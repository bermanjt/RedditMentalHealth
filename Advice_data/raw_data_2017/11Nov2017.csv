2,"I know a girl that is collecting child support, not working, and lending the money out to her lovers. I have physical proof she is not working and only collecting child support, and a written receipt for housing, light, clothing, and phone bill she used online to embarrass her lover stating he owes her money. Can she get in trouble for this or any legal action that can be done? The child is not receiving the money intended for them but rather used for her personal gains.

4,"I’ll try to keep it as short as possible: When I was 15 years old I was physically and mentally abused at school and at home. I escaped reality through gaming, where I’d met this really awesome guy and he became my ingame-boyfriend. I could talk to him about anything. Eventually it was all too much for me and I totally lost myself, I couldn’t think clearly anymore. So I ran away from home and school to my in-game boyfriend. He and his family were so sweet to me. After a couple of days the police found me and the last time I saw him was at the police station where he gave me a kiss..
I just felt so guilty that i put him and his family in so much trouble and i was so ashamed of my behavior (meanwhile he didn’t have a easy life either) that i would rather not talk to him anymore. So we lost contact.. I let him down. Now I’m 22 years old, a totally different person and my life is a lot better now. Sometimes he came back into my mind but I never had the courage to contact him.. 

But almost a month ago, after I dreamed about him, I found him on Twitch. The moment I saw his streamer-name (that is also his old ingame-name) and heard his voice I was so happy! I really like to talk to him again but I’m afraid that he wants nothing to do with me. Maybe he even hates me.. He has no idea that I’m watching his streams (anonymous, just to hear his voice). He doesn’t sound very happy. The last couple of weeks I think about him alot, I sleep and eat badly and the whole time it feels like I have a stone in my stomache..
I changed my mobile number and I don’t have social media, he also doesn’t know my address or last name. So there is no way possible he can contact me.

What should i do? Leave him alone or contact him? --&gt; Should i contact him in-game, through the stream? Or just go to his house because I still have his adress… (Edit: Jk)
I just don't want to get hurt.. All advice is welcome. :) I never post personal things on the internet but I don’t want tell anyone about this in real life.

Update: I want to thank you all for the advice! I feel a lot less nervous now and I can think more clearly. After this weekend I'm going to send him a personal message through Twitch and ofcourse I will let you guys know how it went!

5,"It has been a whirlwind of a month. Long story short my father who has had a high paying career all his life (causing my mother to not have to work) went off the deep end (assuming drugs after his knee surgery) and will now be in prison for a long time for armed robbery as well as my younger brother. This caught all of us by surprise as we have no clue what made him do this. My younger brother, i could see this happening to, but not my father. My mother has been left with no car, savings, and currently lives in a rental home wayyyy out of her price range. What my father and brother did is insane but no way reflects on my mother, sister, or I. My girlfriend and I both have good paying careers but have 2 kids to support so I am not able to help out as much financially as I would like. I have gotten her a car, as well as a part time job (20 hours a week at 10 dollars per hr.) Obviously this is not enough to support a household and I am trying to help her find a second job. Tomorrow I will be moving her out of her house and will be letting them stay in my house for the time being until she has the means to afford a small house/apartment. Any advise would be greatly appreciated as I am not one to get overwhelmed but this is truly testing. ",11Nov2017,4
10,"So I think I take most things with a grain of salt. Im not pessimistic about everything but there's always a bit of doubt in the back of my mind that I can't help but notice. Like I'm ""talking, talking""to this girl that I met a couple weeks ago, so I don't really know her very well. But we've talked everyday since meeting and she seems interested. But a couple times we've been texting and all of a sudden it takes hours for her to text back, she says sorry I was at the dentist or whatever, for some reason there's always a bit of doubt with me about her excuse. Or a potential job calls back and says the position has been filled, I kind of think that it might have to do with me instead. Or when someone goes out of their way to do something for me, depending on what it is I feel more pitied than looked out for in their eyes. Idk, I might be buggin, or I might be completely normal and haven't spoken to anyone about it. Any advice?",11Nov2017,3
12,"Hey guys, I had been looking for internships for next year and I am lucky enough to have 2 offers on the table.

One of the internship has minimum wage pay but the work seems interesting and their is a good social aspect to it (i.e weekly football, social outings, poker etc...). I have asked people who did the internship here before and they all enjoyed it and recommended it. 

The other offer is another place with interesting work. However the pay here is noticeably a lot more than the other internship. It is however further away, I have to get 2 buses to get to, so add another 20-30 mins to my trip as opposed to the first one. Not sure about the social aspect of it and havent found anybody who has done an internship here for a review.

So my question is what internship should I choose? I'm kind of torn between the two. Many thanks in advance",11Nov2017,1
13,"I'm thinking about becoming a fashion designer. I have liked 
drawing my whole life but always thought being a designer is out of my reach because of the competitiveness of the field. I'm studying to become a physical therapist but I don't see myself doing it my whole life! I know PT is a stable and lucrative job, but I am just not excited about it. I know I can do a fine job at it, but I would feel really bored. When I do creative things and look at fashion I could do it for hours without getting bored. I love modern art museums and just weird art stuff in general.  I feel like social media has made it easier to be seen now as a designer. Maybe I could start learning to sew on my own and become a designer. Is this a hard process? What should I do to get started? Should I just give up my PT study? ",11Nov2017,1

15,"I've been dating this guy for about two years now. We met my junior year (while he was a senior) and had a blissful first year, he's been pretty much my first for everything.  Then he went away to college and we did LD which was not fun, and now I'm at college with him (not because I followed him it's always where I've wanted to go) and now we're at 2 years and I'm getting worried. 

Now it could be that I've been watching and reading too many romantic books and movies, but I can't tell if this is how things should be. It feels like we're just best friends, which is how it should be but shouldn't there still be that romance. I know after the honey moon phase thins die down but are they supposed to this bunch. I can't remember the last time he did some romantic gesture (not even a gift but just like offering a back rub or surprising me with dinner after class) or even called me pretty or anything without me asking if I looked okay. 

Basically I'm just wondering is this normal. Do things die down this much? I Love him but I also miss the spice and the fun. I feel like we're just close friends who have sex sometimes. Is it unrealistic of me to be expecting spontaneity at this point of the relationship? ",11Nov2017,1

I got so close today but I chickened out at the last moment because I felt myself choking up and knew I'd make a fool out of myself. I haven't initiated anything with a girl since the beginning of my last relationship (which just ended around 4 or 5 months ago) and talking to her for the first time was the most painful and nerve-wracking thing I've ever done (and don't take that to mean I've lived a sheltered life up to tjis point, girls just do that to me).

18,"Tonight is one of the many instances that me and my girlfriend have had disagreements with my parents. My parents are very different from my girlfriends in that they are very tradition and don’t want me to be able to sleep in the same room as my girlfriend at her house. I’m 18 and I’ve grown up pretty fast in all honesty. I got my license, graduated and started dating all within 2017. I should also mention that my girlfriend is one year younger than me and this is the reason for my parents not letting me sleep over. We’ve spent the night together for a whole week this past summer at my family lake house and they didn’t say anything of it. It’s like they’re afraid that I could be charged with rape or something due to the fact that she’s still a minor. I’ve already struggled a lot with getting more freedom from my parents this year. I already pay my health insurance, car insurance (even though my car isn’t in my name) and pay rent just so I can finally stay out at night. I feel like I should just grow some balls and just spend the night since I’m 18. I’m a very cautious person and pretty mature from my standpoint, but I feel like I’m letting my parents walk all over me at times. Before someone suggests that I talk to them..

27,"Quick backstory: Met her at a club while I was travelling recently (Let's call her F), decided to talk to her and we ended up hitting it off, became super attached after only a couple days, even lots of flirting and stuff between us. She's had some bad relationships in the past (or from what I can tell, she doesn't talk much about her past) and I think that may be a factor. I asked her if we were just friends and if it was something more cause a girl at my school had asked me out (Let's call her T) and I didn't wanna go with this new girl if my friend wanted to take it further, but I was also missing the physical attraction since she wasn't in the same town as me. F said that she'd rather I went with T cause she lived a lot closer to me and she wants me to be happy. I agreed and well T ended up ghosting me, but it hasn't changed anything. It's been a week now and we hardly talk, definitely not like before, she hasn't flirted once back with me, she leaves me on read a lot more often, and she doesn't sound interested in me anymore.

28,"Hello... so. You are probably wondering, ""Huh, I wonder what this kid wants?"" Eh, I've been asking myself the same thing recently. Essentially, I am alone. I have no one who I trust on this planet. I have attempted suicide before, at a real low point for me (around 2 years ago), but obviously didn't pull through. Before that point I had also been cutting. After that point I did the ol' proverbial, ""Fuck it"" and since then I have been abusing marijuana to its extent, especially recently. This has brought me new friends, and a distraction/escape from my reality, but I still feel like a piece of shit when I'm not high. At this point, you ponder, ""What has caused this in his life?"" Well, I honestly don't have a good explanation. My parents have never been extremely loving or caring, but they care about my future and I believe they love me (though not shown to obviously). They press and stress me out a lot about my grades, as they see college as an important next step into any career, and want me to get into a good one. I don't see the importance in school, my future, or anything else. I feel like a floating orb in space, not touching or impacting anything, just floating. The monotomy of my life currently drives me insane, and the lack of interest that I show in anything (basically besides playing games, and smoking) astounds me. Was a born with the ""lazy"" gene? But on a grander scale, what is my purpose? How can I make a happy life for myself (and what makes me happy)? I'm a lone right now /r/depression, and I'm wondering: Is this normal?

29,"Setting: College dorm.

I was watching Netflix quietly in my room when someone started playing obnoxiously loud music across from my room.  I was (obviously) annoyed, but I just kind of snapped on my headphones and turned the volume up so I couldn't hear it.  I finish my movie, and about 15 minutes later, a campus police officer came up to the room and asked them to turn down their music.  They said that it was before quiet hours (which start at 1 AM), but they were still asked to turn it down because someone complained.  They repeatedly asked the officer to tell them who reported it, but the officer said it was anonymous.  They were also being loud and very rude towards the officer at this point.  They weren't in trouble for any reason, and this is the second time they've had a noise complaint (the first was for slamming their doors - a  which they still do).

After this, the entire group went on a witch hunt down the hall to see who it was, starting on my side.  They knocked on every door and assumed most of the people in the hall were out.  However, they had noticed me walk into and out of my room earlier and they knew I was there.  They loudly knocked on my door and yelled that ""they knew I was there"".  Now, I obviously wasn't going to answer the door, because they sounded angry and I don't like confrontation.  They walked away from the door calling me variations of a ""b***h"" and a ""f-ing narc"".  They went around to the rest of the doors, and when nobody answered, they assumed it was me because I was there and didn't answer.

One of them knocked one last time and I saw that it was the only one who looked relatively non-threatening.  He started walking away, and I opened the door to see what he had to say.  He called me a narc and told me that I was a b***h, which I expected.  I told him I didn't file the complaint, but he said ""I'm friends with everyone else on this floor, so I know you did.""  I told him that I seriously didn't, and he walked away and said (in a very sarcastic tone), ""Sorry for the false accusations.""

Now, a week later, they've knocked on my door repeatedly calling me a narc and threatening me.  They constantly make sarcastic comments saying things like, ""Oh, (insert name here), am I playing my music too loud?"" or ""Hey, (insert name here), is my door closing quietly enough?"" when they see me.  They've called me a slurs about my sexuality (I'm a openly out lesbian) in the hallways, and sh*t talk me to their friends all the time.  I have depression and anxiety and hearing this just ramps this up to 1000.  I've contacted my RA, but she can't do anything without proof that this is happening.  I've asked to move, but the housing department at my uni says that I have to wait until next semester to get on a waitlist.

TL;DR: Group of college students in my dorm assumed I called a noise complaint on them, now they won't stop harassing me, insulting me, and calling me slurs relating to my sexuality.  RA can't do anything, Housing won't even try to move me for another month, and, even then, it's not guaranteed, and I don't know what to do.

Two the university that I am transferring to is an hour and a half away from my home and I don't have the time to run the business and commute every day. There's a lot of social pressure on me, because my parents would think I'm a failure if I didn't get that degree. I'm young and need some advice ",11Nov2017,2
36,"I never, ever thought I would go to college. I went to beauty school while in high school and graduated with both my high school diploma and my cosmetology license in 2015. However, I absolutely hated doing hair. I suck at it. My parents forced me to enroll in community college after a few failed hairstyling gigs. I've tried a few different subjects of study there. They were okay, but nothing I felt passionate about. Then I had a seizure out of nowhere. My community college fucked me over because they apparently don't have any resources or plans for students who have serious medical problems arise and I ended up withdrawing. Hell, they wouldn't even let me petition to remove the withdrawals from my transcript.  
There was no medical reason for the seizure, so, for my own sanity, I've been calling it divine intervention. I never felt passionate about the topics I pursued in community college, so I thought long and hard about what I really love- music. (I have a fall back plan, obviously.) I do have prior experience in music, though it is very limited. I found an affordable college that won't require me to audition to enroll in their music program. I probably will not be admitted to colleges that require an audition because I spent only 3 yrs doing choral singing in high school and that's it. This college is also across the country from where I currently live, in an affordable area of an affordable state, so I'm pleased about that.  
However, there's a catch: This college recently changed its housing policy. All undergrad students *must* live on campus **for all four years**, unless they meet one or more of a few specific qualifications (which I meet none of). I have anxiety with depressive episodes and a very short temper. One of the few things I value is privacy. If I could get into an apartment style dorm with several bedrooms and a common area the roomies share, that would be okay (these are only for upperclassmen and have a waiting list, however), but four fucking years of sleeping in a bunk bed with some random chick? Please, no.  
I worry that I'll have another seizure and she'll shove a credit card in my mouth and injure me, or put me seizing on her Snapchat for all her friends to laugh at. I don't want to get mad at her because she won't stop Facetiming someone until 4 in the morning and I want to sleep. I am easily distracted and if she wants to watch TV while I do homework, well, I'm screwed. I don't want to worry about her """"""borrowing"""""" my makeup and clothes or getting mad at the decorations I put up (It's a private college, and while religious studies aren't required, it is a Methodist college. I'm not Christian and would like to be able to express that, but I don't want to offend anyone!). I would be a terrible roommate in such close quarters, and whoever got stuck with me would probably post nonstop on Reddit about how weird and nitpicky her college roommate is. I can't stand the idea of four years of having no place of solace where I can drool in my sleep, fart, and uhhh- you know, do all the gross shit humans do. I don't want to share a toilet and shower with an entire floor of women.  
Part of why I want to live so far from my family is because I want to be an independent adult. I want to work a part time job while I study music and pay for my own studio or one bedroom apartment. I am already twenty, and by the time I started at this college, I'd be turning 21. The first year dorms are, from what the college website says, all fresh out of high school kids. I would not fit in. I know that dorms are part of the """"""integral college experience,"""""" but I personally hate traditional education. I know it is something I have to participate in to succeed in life, but it's frustrating that I don't have the choice to be independent and have an escape from the school environment. This college is such a good fit for me in every other way.  
The college website says you can petition to live off campus even if you don't meet the specific requirements they state, but you have to write an essay about why you should be allowed to. Should I apply, and, upon acceptance, write that essay? Would I still be able to attend a different college if I get so far along that I write the essay and it's denied? Should I just keep looking for a different college? I honestly feel like I will excel more living alone. It puts pressure on me to be good with my time and money, and that is a great motivator. Also, forced social interaction makes me come off anywhere from extremely mean to extremely mentally ill. I'm only slightly mean and slightly mentally ill. :] When I can choose to interact with people, I can make friends easily. However, I am heavily reliant on knowing I have a space that I know is safe, quiet, and all mine to retreat to after a long day of people-ing.  
I think I could make a convincing essay if I tone down the, ""I'm mentally ill"" angle and play up the, ""I'm an adult and I want to be responsible for all my stuffs"" angle, but that's not a guarantee I'll have my coveted solitude. Should I bother applying, or continue to look for a school with a solid music program that doesn't require auditions or on campus housing?  
Also, I know someone probably wants to say by this point, ""Just live with strangers and stop having anxiety!"" I understand where you're coming from, and trust me, I feel like the stereotypical special snowflake for writing this post, but that's not the advice I'm looking for. I've tried for years to improve my mental health, and I'm currently in therapy, but I can't see myself ever being comfortable with an arrangement where I'd have to share my bedroom with a random stranger or even a close friend. I can only picture sharing a space I view as so intimate with a significant other. I am a perfectly well adjusted human in all other ways, and I can socialize like a normal person, as long as I have a place all to myself at the end of my day to recharge.

**TL;DR** I want to study music and I found a great four year university that fits all my needs, but one- I must live on campus all four years. I have epilepsy, anger issues, ADD, depression, and anxiety, and the main reason I want to go to college out of state is so I can have my own place and finally experience adulthood. I can write an essay so they consider letting me live off campus, but it may not be accepted.

40,"(I'm kind of whining in this post. I'm sorry.)

I have various hobbies. Inline skating, crochet, piano, sewing, etc, to name a few.

When I was younger, I had the idea that a person who plays the piano is graceful, that they're super relaxed and enter a trancelike mode where nothing can touch them. That they come out refreshed and just completely at peace. And everywhere I look it seems to reinforce this idea - for every hobby I have. That it's such a joy to practice, or to complete a new crochet project, or to learn new skating techniques, or to sew something new (sewing and skating are new, so as of now, it's still pretty fun). 

But no. It's not joyful. Sometimes, it is, especially when I see progress! But most of the time? It's the most frustrating thing I've experienced. It's so stressful. Especially for piano, where I'm spending more time playing awful, boring songs - 10000 times - in order to get ""better"", but I still feel so awful. 

Although I love these hobbies so much, I feel like I'm instead in love with the idea of the hobby. The idea of learning all of these songs, and of mastering things, and of knowing so much, is so great - but actually doing it? It's so tiring. And it doesn't feel worth it.

""I didn't pick up these hobbies to have an extra job,"" is something that I say when I'm feeling the worst. Right now I'm not feeling the worst. I'm just kind of realizing that I was wrong about my perspective. That I should know that skills require work. I guess I feel like I've been deluding myself. Like I'm the only person in the world who thought that hobbies could, I don't know, be fun all the time. I guess not fun, but… relaxing.

I know that they can't be fun all the time... But no matter what I do, the fact that it takes so much energy just makes me want to give up.

I know now that they take work. I understand that I have to find ways to like the grind. How do I do this? Can someone please tell me I'm not crazy for feeling like things are just so hard? I know that I'm complaining about something that's so obvious to so many other people, and it makes me sad. Like I can't seriously put in some more work for something that I love? Did I seriously expect it to be handed to me on a silver platter? 

Thanks for reading. I'm not giving up on my hobbies, just… trying to make them stay fun before I DO give up.

45,"But I literally burst into tears today about it.

I was a social worker in foster care for 2.5 years. I loved a lot of the work, my coworkers, and doing my best to improve kiddos' lives and give them some stability. BUT - the job was very draining. I worked very late very often and had almost no social life. It strained my relationships. And I was on-call 24/5 for over two years. Sometimes I dealt with crises and traumatic situations and would be up working all night in between full work days. And the amount of things we were responsible for was surreal.

It got to be too much, so I took a (significantly) lower paying but stress-free job to cope.

My former boss has offered me a position again but with a pretty great pay raise. Supposedly the on-call system has changed and it would be less often. But my hunch is still that we would need to have our phones on and be available, because crises are unpredictable and chaotic by nature. 

I was about to call him to give my final ""yes"" today when I became overwhelmed by anxiety and just burst into tears. What is wrong with me?? This seems like the better option, but I cannot rest easy thinking about going back and working as much as I used to. 

TL;DR: Worked my tail off at my former job. Left it for lower paying but stress free job. Offered old job back with raise but having significant anxiety about it.",11Nov2017,2

53,"Disclaimer/warning: I'm heated right now, but our conversations are usually very calm.  

Pretense: We're a single-income family right now.  My wife is a full time homemaker right now.  She was told by her mom long ago that she should re-enter the work force after the kids are old enough, because if she stays a homemaker she will regret it when the kids are full grown.  My wife completely agrees that it's solid advice.  I agree.  Everyone agrees.  

After our youngest starts preschool, my wife plans to start working.  But she doesn't know what she wants to do.  She has a college degree form a foreign language university.  She speaks English, Japanese and Korean.

My wife and I agree that we want to move to some place more sunny, as well.  We don't like the town we live in because it rains too much and it makes her depressed.

We've been going back and forth for a couple years, but it's driving me crazy.  She comes up with an excuse/fear at every suggestion.  She finds a reason to question everything.  She admits she's horrible at making decisions, because she always has a ""What if"" ""What if"" ""What if""

I say, ""Well you could become a teacher.""  Her response, ""But I have to get the certificates!""  I say, ""So lets get started!""  She says, ""But what if I fail, then it will be a waste of money?""  And it goes on and on.  

I reassure her that it's ok if she doesn't know what she wants to do, it's all about starting *something*.  I remind her that we're already a healthy little family.  I have a very stable income, we have great insurance, we eat healthy.  Worse case scenario if we do nothing is that we stay healthy.

She wants to work, but she comes up with an excuse for why something won't work at anything I suggest.  She won't research on her own because she's too tired at night.  I get that.  I'm tired too.  I'm studying on my own right now at night to advance my career.  I'm confident that we'll be very well off if I keep my nose to the grind stone and keep moving forward.  We'll be fine no matter what she decides.

She gets so stressed out every time we talk about it.  I've tried every approach.  Anything that involves moving (and she definitely wants to move), and it's all crazy.

Even location.  I say, ""Well how about this place?""  She says, ""But they'll have an earthquake some day!""  I say, ""Well how about this other place?""  She says, ""It's too expensive to live there!""  I say, ""Ok, well what about this place?""  

It goes on.  I've asked her if she has any ideas and she says, ""I don't know where is good!""

Arg.  How the hell do I do this?  If we stay, she's unhappy.  If I talk about moving, she gets stressed out because of the amount of work it will take and she doesn't like thinking about it.  

Should I just drive the relationship and carry the load?  I'm totally fine with it.  I just want to include her.  I want her opinion to count.

54,Alright well so there is this girl I've liked since the end of 7th grade and I still do. Just a little story about the things I've done. Our school had a bowling day at the end of school and she was in my group. I never saw her at all during the year and I already knew I wanted to get to know her better. I spent the last month trying to find her during school but never talked to her. I went through that summer okay and then here came 8th grade. I knew that there was going to be an 8th-grade dance and I already knew I wanted to ask her but I was worried I wouldn't see her. But turns out I had her in one of my classes. I went that year talking to her but I stutter so I didn't really talk much and I didn't sit next to her so that also made it hard for me. We talked every now and then but it wasn't for long. It wasn't until we came back after winter break that I started to become friends with her a little more. The week of the 8th grade came and I was too scared to ask her and I knew she didn't have a date. I remember going there and seeing her alone with her friends but I was scared to say anything so after the dance was over I regretted it. The year ended and I saw her on the last day of school and said goodbye and such. This summer was worst because I actually got to know her a little more. She didn't have a good phone so I didn't get her number. Once 9th grade started I didn't see her until like a month after school. My friends knew her but I was scared to talk about her a lot to them. I only talked to her once during the whole year when she stopped in the hall out of my class before it started. I tried once again to find a way to see her but once I found a way I could see her it took me going up the stairs fast from lunch. I also saw her talking to a dude. I made another friend and I just forgot about her during the year but once my friend got a boyfriend I saw this girl again. I couldn't stop thinking about her and why I didn't try and talk to her during the year. I saw her on the last day again at the after school got out. I thought I would see her again this year but I was wrong. I saw her when I went for registration when I turned a corner. I didn't really want to stare at her but I knew it was her. I went to school and I heard just went through the day hoping I would see her. I went to my theatre class and when my teacher was calling role I heard her name but she wasn't there. I thought okay maybe she was just absent and then she wasn't there for the whole week. After that week we had hurricane Harvey and she wasn't there when we came back. It's now November and I know she had to move schools but I want to talk to her again. I know some friends that might know what happened to her but it would be weird for me to bring up her to them and ask them what happened to her.

58,"Hello. This is my first post, AND it's 4:30 AM so i apologize for any mishaps.

I'm 18 years old, and ever since i can remember, i've been an avid gamer, preferring the computer over hanging out with real life friends when i was in elementary school. However, as i progressed through high school, i've come to the realisation that i no longer really enjoy spending most of my day behind a computer, and the fact that i've been living like this has come to bite me in the ass quite a few times now and i've had just about enough.

I've never been a straight up introvert and even have been very extroverted and popular in elementary, but ever since i started attending high school, i've been suffering from bad anxiety and such, which is reaching its peak right about now - it has gotten worse and is screwing my life worse than ever before, and i often find myself ""switching personalities"" between fun and outgoing and timid and boring.

I could write much more on this topic, but the point here is, i've concluded that most of my mindset problems in life (mostly that i don't really enjoy it altogether anymore) stem from my fucked up way of living - spending most of the day... you guessed it. Behind this goddamn soul-sucking black box that won't let me go. Now it's not that i am not able to stop using the PC. It's just that over the years, i've stayed so far behind on the real world, that i genuinely don't know what to do to better myself.

I've tried reading motivational books, meditating, affirmations, doing stuff i fear doing, and so on, for about a year, maybe longer. Nothing has helped and it's back to square one. I know in my heart and from past experiences, that i am very capable of living life the way i want to, which is the extroverted, helpful, funny, happy, enthusiastic way, but at the same time i feel like i'm all alone to take the world on, with no one around me really understanding how it feels like to be me. To be switching between two personas all the time, with the bad one slowly starting to take over everything. With my self-esteem and confidence dropping slowly but surely.

It's like i don't even know who i really am, and which part of me is real. I know that what i'm doing is wrong and i am wasting my life, but i simply can't help it, because i can't conjure up a straight image in my head of something else that i could be doing and that would make me happy and fulfilled, or what i should do to get to that point. Videogames fill in the gap and provide me with false temporary satisfaction, but at the end of the day, i'm miserable. And i can honestly say, if i didn't have my parents, or my computer, i'd be as good as fucked, because all i could do is just sit there and think ""Well, what do i do now?""

So my question to you, redditors, is, what do you think i should do to be happy with myself like most of the other people? What should i start doing to heal my mind and start making progress? If you want to add something more or discuss, i'll only be glad. Thank you.",11Nov2017,3

I'm 16, my mother and I have an iffy relationship; I just recently moved to another state to live with friends(going to school here) due to financial issues-- and my mother is devastated. She won't admit anything is her fault and blames everything on everyone else.

During the summer I picked up a job, I should have approximately $1200 in my account; however, my mother has taken all but $90 from my account and has my card because something about her account having ""issues"" blah blah, she's going to put her money in my account. 

I've grown to resent her over the past couple months, call me an evil person; who could hate their mom? Well, I hate to say it, but I can't stand her anymore. This is my tipping point; I've worked my ass off, take AP classes have no time for anything due to my job. But for what? $90? Certainly not worth it!

What do I do? I've told her several times I don't want her to use my money. But of course, she doesn't listen.

I still don't have my card and I now have no money.

Currently I have been going to my current counselor for a few weeks but my last meeting is coming up. My reasons for going to counseling were because of my very bad relationships that I had over the years. I have reached the point where I am trying to accept that relationships, dating, all of that are not meant for me and never will be. Although, my anxiety, confidence, etc relate to my overall life and I want to fix all of those things so I can at least live my life better than I had growing up and not mess up my career before I go since that is all I will ever have.

One of the things I havent tried but my current counselor suggested is that I should get anti-anxiety medication to help me get this process started. The problem is I have some friends who are against it and others who are for me doing that. I still have to go through a Psychiatrist and all of that so I could get a no in the end despite the recommendation. My friends who are against it think I might get dependent, might get other issues from it, or use it as a crutch. I dont want any of that, I want to be on it for a few years max and then not need it ever again if  everything goes well but Im not sure how that all works. They also think I could avoid using it all together by just living life, getting a hobby, going out, etc.

I would like to live life a little better more quickly though and I think the medication could hep with that. Can anyone give me some insight of what I should think about before making a decision?",11Nov2017,2

73,"So I'll try to make this brief but i may start rambling I apologize.

So I've been married to my wife for almost 4 years. We have been happy. We were best friends before our relationship. Within the last few months I had brought up opening our relationship and she was open to it and I never really pursued it further than that. So this semester in school I had someone in class who I found very physically attractive but the more I talked to that person the more I realized that I actually really liked alot of things about their personality. We ended up sleeping together and having a long discussion about person's divorce. Since her story was very similar, best friends got married young then she wanted to grow as a person other person didn't. After which I was left feeling like I perhaps settled for my wife and never really took time to figure out who I was or had time to get comfortable being by myself enough to be in a relationship. What I mean by that is I feel like I might have  been very reliant on my wife to deal with emotional issues if they arose. Having said that I talked with my wife and have moved out to see if it helped. I'm happier on a day to day basis but I have periods where I feel like I've made a horrible mistake and that if I leave my wife I might not ever find someone who I have that same level of connection with. Rationally I know this isn't true which makes me think it's my emotions making me think that. At the same time I am aware that I may have become emotionally attached to this other person and I know that I want a relationship with that person but I don't think it would be in my best interest. But the things that I valued so highly in the other person stimulating conversations, having similar goals to grow towards were issues in my marriage but I had accepted them as differences in personality.

I'm really just trying to make the best decision here. Which is obviously personal and I have to make, not looking for people to say pick x person.
But I honestly feel like I betrayed alevel of trust with my wife, and that wanting this other relationship and having let things get to this point are signs that perhaps I wasn't as committed to it as I thought. Or perhaps I need to grow up and if things could ever go back to the way they were. While at the same time I know I wanted to work on myself and grow to be the best I can be but I also wonder if my feelings for the other person factored in to highly with my decision to pursue all this. Because I do think of the two people I might be happier with the person I met at school just on interests and personality alone.

I'm pretty sure I've messed things up royally, and I feel as though I don't need to be in a relationship right now and that due to wanting to work on myself and having such strong feelings for the other person that I am more right in leaving my wife than in staying and trying to figure all of this out while not being able to give her the things she needs in a relationship.

75,"Background: My older brother (21) has always been an asshole to me (19 M). Not even kidding, since I started to develop memories, my brother has always been a dick to me. I never hated him or anything because 80% of the time, he’s pretty cool and we get along great. 

Well recently, we moved in together while we attend college. He’s in college, and I haven’t started yet, but he’s a senior and I work instead.

Down to what grinds my gears: When we get in any sort of argument where he’s CLEARLY at fault, I’m talking 100% without a doubt that he’s at fault (I don’t argue if I think I might be wrong) he just finds a way to flip it around on me. 

Example being:
*us arguing about cleaning the house, which I do all the time and he rarely does*

Me: I’ve cleaned it the last 4 times, can you do it once please?

Him: what days did you clean?

Me: Some time on my days off I don’t remember the exact day??

Him: Well then how do you know I didn’t clean??



I don’t even have a retort for that because it’s the dumbest fucking shit I’ve ever heard. This is a pretty shitty example, but basically if I can’t think of any exact examples of anything he’s done to me, then it didn’t happen and my argument is moot. It’s annoying. Basically he thinks that if he gets the last word, then he’s right.

What’s mostly irritating, is when we’ll both know he’s wrong, but he’ll come up with a slap-dick argument that you can’t really think of a response to. 

We’ve even talked about it when we’re both joking around. He’s even admitted to continuing to argue when he knows he’s in the wrong.

So I found out today from a cousin who is determined to stop the cycle of cutting ties in our family, that she was notified of my aunts death.
She told me because she wanted it to be my decision  wether to tell my dad or not. 
So my question is, should I tell BOTH my dad and my uncle and approach the situation with the facts that they don’t have to go through life holding a grudge? 
I don’t want to end up doing more damage than good. But I feel it needs to be done.",11Nov2017,2
81,"So my friend had a boyfriend who threatened breaking up with her if she didn't stop talking to me (a guy friend who just sees her as a sister) and a bunch of her other guy friends, tried to control what she wore, forced her to block me off social media, and was an emotionally abusive asshole in every sense. Thankfully he broke up with her out of nowhere, and starting flirting with other girls. A year later, and the dickhead comes begging for her to take him back after talking so much about how she hated him, she almost instantly forgives him. Before that she also almost dated this guy who didn't like me because ""I was in too much of her snapchat stories"". Quiet clearly, she doesn't care about our friendship if she keeps going after controlling assholes like that, so I'm done with her. I refuse to put up with that shit again. The problem, however, is that she happens to be my sister's best friend, and when summer rolls around she's going to be over every day and will probably even sleep over some times. We are also in like 4 or 5 different group chats together, and I can't just leave the group with my sister in it. What should I do? Am I stuck with her? I don't really want to cut her off because she's like a sister to me but at this point with her getting back together with that prick, I don't want to waste my time.",11Nov2017,2
83,"My long term boyfriend and I have grown up in the DFW Texas area our whole lives. We happen to both be born in Canada so we have different values than most Texans. We are in our early 20s and are wanting a new atmosphere with good hiking and better weather. We are also wanting a little adventure. We want to move to Colorado Springs this summer. We are realistically looking at getting rid of pretty much all of our stuff and just buying new things there (which is already hard in its own right), and leaving our family and friends behind. We know no one in Colorado

I think we are finally getting close to settling down in the next handful of years and are wondering that if we do, will we regret not trying to live somewhere else? 

We had told each other that we would decide by Thanksgiving so we could tell our family and friends, but I'm having doubts and I worry a lot. I was hoping I could fish for a few nuggets of wisdom and see what others have to say.

86,"So I'm 18, working as a cashier, and lately a younger coworker has started to get on my nerves. I'm really awkward and quiet in general (I have Aspergers, it's pretty obvious too) and so far a couple times when she was in the conversation/in ear shot she'd jump in and 'clarify' what the other coworker said when I simply take a moment to think about it or seem a bit confused (I'm not though). It's really bothering me, the first time I told her I understood, just thought what they were talking about (gossip) was just strange (what they were saying happened was pretty weird). 
Happened again tonight, I was about to leave when I was offered the chance to leave early or stay longer and have another guy get off early as I work extra. I simply took a moment to consider if I was tired or wanted to work the extra time (I like to take all the hours I can get sometimes). Then she jumps in and basically repeats what the other employee said as if I'm stupid. What's funny is that I've heard that she is from my sister who goes to her school.
I don't know if I should tell her I'm fine (AGAIN), or what, but it's really embarrassing and I can't have it happen again. She seemed like an OK person at first, but I'm growing to hate her.",11Nov2017,2
87,"So, I recently had to move cities due to work. My wife's parents live where I am working and I am staying with them until my wife can work remotely. My in-laws have 6 dogs. They volunteer with a dog rescue and have a big backyard, so it's manageable. The house is super fun, it's like the island of misfit toys. All of the dogs have their own issues and most of them probably won't be able to be adopted and will stay with them. Some are fosters and will eventually move out, but the number usually stays between 6 and 7.

Now for the cricket problem. They've had a cricket problem for a number of years now. It used to just be a few in the house from time to time. The dogs do nothing about them. I was raised with cats, so bringing one into the house was my first instinct. This is obviously a no-go because of the foster dog situation. 

 I was doing laundry the other day, and their water heater is located in the same room. I heard a significant amount of cricket chirps while I was in there, and I am convinced they are entering their home from behind the water heater or somewhere around the water heater. I've done a little bit of investigating and I think I can caulk it up pretty well, but there aren't any obvious openings to the out doors.

Does anyone know of a way that I could get rid of the crickets while using something that won't harm the dogs? Or maybe something they don't like the smell of that would repulse them? The main problem is the oldest dog (15 and still very healthy) will eat anything! He had surgery a number of years ago from eating a small stuffed animal almost whole. This is the sort of problem I'm dealing with. He is very sweet,  and rescued from Tijuana. He was living on the streets for a while, so I understand that he must have had to really scavenge. It is because of this that I ideally need something that will repel the crickets or kill them, but not harm him if he goes for it. They have avoided pest control and pesticides for this reason. 

My in-laws have been so wonderful, I want to surprise them by solving this problem that's been bugging them (pun intended) for a while. 

If it helps, most of the dogs at the moment are terrier and chihuahua mixes of one kind or another.

They're a little old-fashioned so I made this burner account especially for this purpose to protect their privacy. 

I'd also add that I will gift gold to whoever gives me the solution that ultimately works. Thanks community!",11Nov2017,2

90,"Hello,

Thank you for reading my post. This has been causing me deep concern over the past couple of weeks and has been an issue that has troubled me in the past before. 
To begin, I have been working on a small team of less than 9 in Human Resources for a huge staffing company since June. Everything had been going fine until September after some of the team (including myself) evacuated to another state to avoid a hurricane. It was there that my boss was first extremely critical of me for no reason (she was mad I had gotten up three times in one day in the new office bc she had brought lunch for us, pulled me aside on a Sunday morning to ask if something was wrong bc of this action) and started developing negative energy towards me because I guess she saw me for who I am outside of work. (I don't smoke or drink but I am a recluse and stayed in my room a lot)
When we returned home she still continued to act coy with me when I needed to ask questions or required assistance. Eventually throughout the month this eventually died off, and October has rolled in.
In the month of October I got terribly sick due to both kidney stones and a double kidney infection. I was in and out of the ER. I was excused from work and needed time to recover. Boss was extremely upset for missing over 5 days of work in two weeks and demanded documentation as soon as I'd text her to tell her I was at the Dr or ER.
I am currently also in my first semester of grad school, and somehow at the end of October I convinced her to allow me to move up to my school and work remote and test run it for the semester and see how things go. ""How can you manage school and work at the same time?"" Im currently in classes now and have As.

As we pull up to speed now, this past week she has been on me for absolutely no reason -- both aggressively and passive aggressively. :-/ It was extremely slow this week and she gives privileges to the other women on our team (they watch TV on their phones but I had mine in my hand and got in trouble.) as well as being passive aggressive in emails with the whole team CC'd even though my other coworker and I had just so obviously gotten back from lunch. My coworker and I took a 30 minute break at 4 and the other women were at lunch for over an hour and did not get back until almost 3. the email consisted of how we weren't allowed to have lunch past 3 ever. I've always taken my lunch past 3 and this is the first time I've heard of this lunch rule. 

Tldr: Boss picks on me and I'm leaving to work at school in a month. I hate the fact she has been acting so negative towards me and has been singling me out and getting on me for silly reasons. I'm afraid she's trying to make me leave before I have the opportunity to work remote. Talking to her about why she has an issue with me is not a good way to resolve this conflict in my opinion. Please help. ",11Nov2017,2
91,"I just want to start off by saying that i'm 16 years old and that this more serious than a normal teenage girl's ""i hate my family,"" phase. This is starting to get serious, I honestly have no idea what to do about it. It's now gotten to the point where I have to fake my way through family dinners/family outings. I can't even sit through a car ride with my dad without wanting nothing more but to get home already. I avoid my dad and stepmom at all costs by sitting in my room with the door shut until i have to come down for dinner. My dad does a lot for me too. He really does want the best for me and I can recognize that, but to some extent I don't want his affection. Maybe my severe depression has something to do with it? Another important thing to know: my family has been through a lot - parents got divorced in 2011 and still have been in litigation with each other for five years now. I live mainly with my dad due to my moms incompetency/inability to act like a mature adult. I've sort of become numb to the situation regarding my mom and dad. As bad as it sounds, I frankly don't care about my mom and don't mind living without her. What's really strange about all of this is my fondness for my oldest brother whose currently in his first year of college. I have this really bizarre soft spot for him which can lead me to literal tears if someone were to bring him up in certain situations. He seems to think that all of this is repression and that I undermine all of my issues but i genuinely don't know. I can't really identify what it is that brings me towards wanting to see him/spend time with him. Additionally, I have two other siblings, both brothers, one older and one younger than I am. I again feel no affection towards them and have no desire to spend time with them. Anyways, I know this is a lot to digest but would really appreciate it if someone could possibly help me handle this mess...

I worked with this dude at a short lived job I had and he exuded this very positive energy that made me take a liking to him, and the few times we worked together I felt like he was someone I had a cool rapport with and I’d like to get to know better. 

The last time I saw him was about a month ago, probably a week or two after I’d quit. I ran into him at a concert and we chatted for a bit but before we parted ways he urged me to swing by work again some time, but here’s the catch: I’ve since left the job and I don’t have any preexisting contact information to go off of. Do I let the potential for that friendship fly into the wind or try to make something out of it, and if so: how? I’m hesitant to write down my number and hand it off to him for fear of looking like I’m *Interested* in him, but I’d prefer not to let this thing fizzle; by virtue of circumstance and divine intervention I haven’t got a lot of friends left to my name, but even if I did have a metric fuck ton of pals n comrades he’s an individual I’d still be interested in befriending anyways.

99,"**TL;DR** at bottom. 

My professor has been ignoring all of my attempts to participate in class. I will put my hand up and see him glance at me, but he will then look around the rest of the class and find someone else to answer the question. 

What is confusing to me is I’m not the type of student who would typically be considered as one who might easily irritate or get on a person’s bad side. 

For instance: 

- I’m not, and have never been, a “teacher’s pet.” I don’t shoot my hand up immediately at every single question, I don’t suck up to him, I don’t stay after class to chat him up - nor do I bother him in his office hours. 

- (As far as I know) I don’t give stupid or unhelpful answers in class, either. The one or two times he *had* let me answer a question, my answers were to-the-point (I didn’t hog class time), and seemingly “correct” (he responded positively and seemed to be pleased).

- I’ve been a quiet and attentive student. I never use a cellphone, computer, or other electronics in the class, and always give my full attention throughout the entire lecture. 

- I’ve gotten nothing but ‘A’ grades on all of his assignments and tests so far. 

So I don’t understand why he would actively be ignoring my attempts to participate. It has become glaringly obvious, as I try to respond to one question each class but have not gotten a chance for more than a month. (Though I’ve recently been holding back on even putting my hand up once.)

There are other students in the class that actively monopolize the class discussions, yet he doesn’t seem to mind calling on *those* students frequently, which just seems unfair. 

Participation is a class requirement and makes up a fairly weighty part of our grade, to the extent that it could mean the difference between getting an ‘A’ or dropping to a ‘B’ in the class.

What can I do about his not letting me participate? 

I’m afraid if I ask him about it, he will think it is weird (what if he doesn’t even know he’s doing it [though I highly doubt that]) and will think I’m seeking attention from him. 

And if anyone is wondering why this seems to be bothering me so much (more than just because of a grade), it’s because I just have a lot of social anxiety and the idea of somebody not liking me *without a rational reason* really bothers me. 

**TL;DR:** My professor is blatantly rejecting my attempts to participate in class, despite the fact that I am a well-behaved, non-offensive, and high performing student. Participation is a class requirement and makes up a significant chunk of our grade. What can I do about the fact that he won’t let me participate?

104,"I've never had a friend, or have been close to someone who identified as gender fluid. 

But my best guy friend recently started dating a biological-female, that identifies as a male. He prefers to be called a ""he"". But he dresses and looks and is biologically a female. So it gets a little confusing.. He wears makeup, feminine clothing, long hair. So when I look at him, I can't help but think ""she"". 

I don't think there's anything wrong with what he wants. If he wants to be called a boy, sure. I'll call him a boy. But I find that I'm messing up, literally every other time I call his name. And I feel so bad, and awful, and awkward about it. I feel embarrassed that I somehow just can't get into my head that he wants to be referred to as a male. I feel really stupid.

Where the real problem starts is outside of work, everybody my age is still in school or working retail jobs, so I have no real way of connecting with young people because I exist outside of that area. I've tried going to public events, online meetups, parties and social gatherings, but am always the youngest person there. Combined with a lack of wealth amongst my age group it means that people my age don't really get out much.

Any advice you have on this would be greatly appreciated, nothing I've tried has worked very well. ",11Nov2017,3
125,"I currently work full time on the weekends. I come in at 10pm Friday night and get off Saturday at 2pm. I go back in at 10pm Saturday night then I am off Sunday at 2pm. Sunday evenings I am able to catch up on sleep. Unfortunately, I only make $10.50 an hour. At 64 hours per pay period I am able to pay my bills but living paycheck to paycheck is very frustrating. 

I have a 1.5 year old at home and my fiance also works a full time job. He works the same job at the same company making the same pay but gets about 20 hours more than I do. 

My conflict on working an additional job through the week is this: I would lose Medicaid and have to pay around $300 plus in insurance for my son and myself. I would lose a lot of time with my son and I would not be able to go back to school for nursing like I'd like to. However, I've been contemplating a second job for the extra money. I would really like to be able to get in a position that would allow us to put back $100-$200 a month for savings/emergency funds. 

What should I do?",11Nov2017,3

127,"I feel that I need a girlfriend  to keep me happy because I am a very physical person. My problem is not shyness or something typical. No, mine is the fact that I hate public things like restaurants and I also can't drive.

So the driving is fairly easy to explain. I feel that I shouldn't ask them to meet, I feel I need to be chivalrous or something like that and go get them. So one of my parents has to give me a ride which makes it awkward especially because my parents are a little weird with me and girls.

The other is a bit stranger. I don't quite know why but I hate doing things like going to restaurants and movies for the reason I think being I feel like I'm doing things wrong with the way I pay or whatever. I don't really know about that but.

128,"I'm 26 and I work for a call centre as a run of the mill insurance claims handler. I came into this job when I was 23 and I had no qualifations, I made supervisor which was fine because I'm good at dealing with customers on the phone but I thought that's as high as I would go

So when a job for a section called business standards came up I applied but honestly never thought I'd get it, business standards was the job all the middle aged proper suit wearing adults did, I go to work in jeans and some kind of wrestling t-shirt. 

You would imagine my surprise when I got offered the job along with a very hefty pay bump, I didn't climb the ladder here, I was stuffed into a cannon and fired into the sky

But I'm nervous, my job now will be review insurance policies and claims, make sure all the customers were handled fairly and write detailed reports for the CEO's. Why they thought an unqualified dyslexic was the perfect candidate I don't know. The other big issue is in my old position we were protected a lot, if we did something wrong it very rarely came back on us, if I do something wrong now my ass is very much on the line 

I get 2 weeks training starting Monday and that's it, I have very basic knowledge of excel which will be my main tool and I'm terrible at writing reports. I do have some nice presentable clothes so I least there's that.

129,"When I was in high school, my mom had a mental breakdown and I wasn't there to be the friend she needed.  A few weeks after it, she started acting strange and what came after are years of schizophrenic hardship on her, my brothers, and me. 

(NOTE: She's never been diagnosed by a doctor and this is what I've concluded in the years I've witness her illness)

Before her illness, she was the most kind, honest, and loving mother I could ask for.  Now, I have to find the strength to hold in my anger and frustration when I'm around her.  I've pleaded with my mom to get help, talk to a doctor, anything, but she refuses.  At one point, I had to involuntary commit her to a mental institution when she stopped eating because the voices told her not to.  Unfortunately, my decision didn't make things better.  Apparently, she can appear ""normal"" enough to convince others that she's not sick so after two weeks, the institution released her -- that was the day she stopped trusting me and made it VERY hard for me to help her.

My mom unintentionally finds ways to screw up my plans to care for her, like find her an apartment to live in.  Things have to be a certain way and meet her demands or else she won't accept the help.  She's crippling my finances, my work, my personal life, as well as my brothers'.  I know it's not her fault -- she's sick, she doesn't know better.

Out of nowhere one day, she started telling me about everything that she sees, hears, and is happening around her (this NEVER happens as she never confides in me).  She says there are these people that make her do and say things.  They cover her face and I guess, ""possess"" her.  She tells me they abuse her.  They slap her, trip her when she's walking, grabs her hair.  They also prevent her from eating at times because they're starving so she's not allowed to eat.  She says when she's sleeping at night, they take her away to rape and mutilate her body.  They've also told her that in 2018, they're going to take one of her legs so that she can't go to work anymore (her job at the convenience store is the one thing that brings her joy and self-worth).  How do I live knowing she's going through this in her mind?

We've been able to keep her off the streets and she's been living with my brother for several years, but I fear she's going to cause him to spiral into depression.  We are caught in an endless cycle of anger, sadness, embarrassment, and GUILT...guilt has been the hardest for us.  I'm in a constant state of it -- guilt that my brother has to care for her, guilt that she's going through all the torment, guilt for not being there for her.

Right now, we're trying to move her into a 2 bedroom apartment so my brother can have some privacy, but she's refusing to move in and she won't move out of the old one.  I can't continue to abide by her demands nor can my wallet.  I fear she'll be homeless, but I'm so tired and de-attached that I may just give up on her.  Her physical health is also deteriorating and I know there's something wrong with her kidney. What should I do?

136,"Today I am going to bed defeated yet again.

Lately I've been working on a comic with my cousin, who's been a great help so far in assisting me with storyboarding and the like, and I owe him a lot. But lately he's been pressing me to show him the character models I said I've created but have barely even started. Drawing was just a hobby in the past; only recently have I started taking it seriously, deciding I want to find a career in it. And I think this comic I'm working with my cousin is a fantastic and super fun project to be working on. Now we've taken aim and all I need to do is pull the trigger, yet I find myself unable to. I am instantly deterred when I set myself up in front of a blank piece of paper. Even more so when I struggle to draw an image the way I have it in my mind. Time and time again I think, ""Maybe I should take a break from this and draw something else."" And time and time again I feel terrible about what I've put on paper. Then I decide, ""Maybe I just need to relax in order to get in the mood."" And I indulge in video games or some other form of instant gratification and the day is gone. Sometimes I think, ""Why even draw and put myself through hell when I can do tons of other things."" But at the same time I realize that in order to live the life I want to live I need to get good at it. I've asked other friends and all they say is to practice, but how can I practice when noticing every single mistake I make is the most discouraging sensation? It's like my heart breaks itself over how bad I am every time. I've drawn in tons of pages in my sketchbook, but none of them are finished. I am exhausted of feeling this way every day, but nevertheless I will not give up so easily.

143,"Alright the situation is this. I have low self-esteem right now, for various reasons. In our country we have mandatory military service, which I dropped out of because I thought I wouldn't make it. I also had very childish beliefs, I dropped out do I could play video games while doing civilian service (basically work at school or hospital). I support my country's system, so I realized that I acted very hypocritical and that I have a problem with my anxiety and self esteem. But right after I left the military service I didn't want to appear weak, I wanted it to look like I planned everything and was confident in my decision. So I enrolled in this Uni program that I had applied to (I wasn't going to accept this uni program if I had stayed in the military, because I realized I really don't have any interest in it). It was to make it seem like I had everything planned and everything was okay to my friends, parents, relatives. I didn't want to show them that I actually made a childish decision because I have low-self esteem. So now I have pretty much fallen into a pit, I have zero interest in studying this program. I have failed every damn test. It feels like it's draining me and in my past time I just sit in front of my computer. I used to do sports before more active but now that feels pointless because I'm constantly stressing and anxious about uni, which feels absolutely pointless to me.

   I came forward with this to my parents, but they are understanding what I was going through. Then I decided to apply for a warehouse job because I realized studying was pointless since I'm not making an career out of this. I basically want a fresh start to grow myself as a person and try to get rid of my low self-esteem. I told my mom about this, and it got into this confrontation that my mom said that I shouldn't accept this job, she told me that since I've enrolled there I should stay there even if I'm not going to get a profession of this current program. Uni here is free. She said that I would break my back at the warehouse work, that it isn't going to solve my problems, that the people there are uncivilized and that studying on the other hand is a better option. She also said that I should put my mental health issues first and study at the same time, that I should go to a psychotherapy to get my head straight. I sort of agree with the fact that psychotherapy might be  useful.

  So I cancelled the job interview, and am wondering am I doing the right thing. I feel like she tries to manipulate me in some weird ways, even though she is rational often. When I started going to the gym at a younger (I was 17?) she said that people sell steroids there and she almost came to pick me up from the gym because she was ""so worried"". Then when I applied for a summer job she said that I shouldn't take it because it's going to exhaust me and there's too much sun because it's an outdoor job (lol?). Now she's also saying that if I choose to work that I wouldn't be able to apply to another uni because it would be too tough for me to study and work at the same time. It feels like she puts me down every time. She also tried to persuade me not to go to the military because I would hurt myself and that I'm not the type of person that's capable of doing it (I have mild scoliosis that has never caused any problems). I myself believe that I know how to fix my issues, that's why I want a fresh start. I just want an outsiders opinion on this whole thing..",11Nov2017,3

So here's the thing: my country sucks. Our politicians do not care about us, nor do they try to improve our country in any way. 
This neglect is made obvious in how easily our roads tend to be congested. 

Our government has given all of our public transportation into private hands. Our busses cause traffic because they camp at bus stations waiting for passengers to fill every bus before leaving. This would be okay if it showed any sign of being controlled or organized, but it is not. In our country we have people called 'bus conductors' and they collect payment for bus drivers and beckon passengers to enter busses with vacancies. They do this to make each trip worth the bus company's money. We also have a railway system that is dated, and it's not even a unified system that spans throughout the metro. We are a small country, so shouldn't that be possible? Shouldn't a public transport system be there to alleviate a commuter's problems instead of worsening them?

Oh did I mention that we also have a drug war, and people going rampant on the streets killing other people that are accused of using drugs (and our president says it's okay to); we also buried our former dictator in the cemetery for our heroes; have a mindless 'entertainer' (sex icon) running the presidential communications operations office that regularly spreading fake news; a president that admitted to lying about another politician's bank details so that he could accuse the said politician of corruption... YES I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PHILIPPINES

With the current system like this, I am certain this chaos will not end during the current president's term.

148,"I just got a new place and it's not the best apartment in the world, but it's OK as far as I can tell. The landlord assured me he would clean the place before I moved in, and I left it at that. I didn't take a good look around before I moved in because the previous tenant had not vacated yet.

When I moved in, the place wasn't filthy. There were random stains on the carpet but they were not big and didn't smell or anything. Everything else was passable, except for the oven.

The oven is f*cking filthy. It's not too dirty to function, but underneath the burners there is caked and burnt out crust or food. The shelf under the oven is filled with ash and random burnt chunks of debris as well. 

When I told my landlord about it he didn't do anything about it. 

Should I let this slide or antagonize my landlord? I don't want to start off on the wrong foot, and I am not sure what is acceptable and what is not in these situations because I haven't had a lot of places, especially not from non company type landlords.

He only had a few hours to clean the place when the previous tenant moved out on the first of the month before he turned the place over to me, so I don't know if this is laziness or just all he could do. 

I also don't know how hard it would be to clean an oven, but I keep hearing it's a pain in the ass and takes several hours. 

What should I do in this situation? Clean it up and move on? Or get a professional cleaner to clean it and then go to the board to get my money back?

Also keep in mind while the apartment isn't falling apart, there seem to be a few other issues so I don't want to make a big deal out of this and piss him off and have him delay dealing with a more serious issue. 

For example, I have a suspended ceiling throughout the place and it seems like there are squirrels living up there, so i'm wondering how i'm going to deal with that as well.

153,"Warning, luxury problems and whining ahead.

Hello /r/advice! I am 24 years old and currently finishing my Master's degree in a very sought-after and high-paying field with almost perfect grades. I have more great and caring friends than I ever thought possible and I am basically invited to come over somewhere every day. I am healthy and about average in the looks department I guess, but I like my looks &amp; style. Years ago I have made tons of money that I have told nobody in my private circle except my parents about.

Sorry for the bragging, but listing those things was essential to my problem: I guess I should be happy with all those privileges, but I am not. I feel worthless. I have almost no drive &amp; ambition left. I feel lonely. And I feel guilty because of that, beause it feels like you don't deserve to whine while basically ""having it all"".

What's bugging me right now:

1. I always had some problems with my feelings of self-worth. I always kinda felt like I don't have anything to offer to other people and should thus not be liked or loved. I understand that's toxic bullshit rationally, but I just can't manage to internalize it. Because of that I'm also failing in the dating department. I'm great at befriending people, but I can never make something more out of it because I'm always too afraid to make the first step towards something more. ""She could never see more than a friend in me. How could anyone?""

2. My studies. I always wanted to finish my studies and work, because I want to live a normal life and be a good example for my future kids. And now I'm almost done, I only need my Master's thesis. But it feels so pointless, because I will never really ""have"" to work, I already earned enough. That has never been a problem before, but at the moment I have literally zero motivation to do anything for university. Been trying for months, but I'm failing over and over again. I go to the university every day to work in the group work rooms, but I didn't do shit except browsing reddit and doing stupid shit with my classmates for the past few months. Great fun though.

3. Loneliness. I usually like best being around people (strangely enough, because I was a total introvert just a few years ago). And I have lots of great and caring friends who have helped me through a lot and who I can really talk to. But not about everything, because I keep this huge part of my life secret from everyone: the money. It's a hella interesting ride. I'm currently setting up a charity, I bought literally kilos of gold at a time, I'm attending exclusive investor conferences, my parents just asked me for $2m to buy a city house for their retirement, etc. I would love to talk to someone about all those things because I love sharing, but I can't. It would just create this huge wedge between us because of the different living situations. So I feel lonely and isolated despite always having friends around me. I feel the urgent need to just talk to somebody about those things and sorrows but I have no idea who.

4. Alcohol &amp; drugs: Currently I only feel moderately happy and at ease when high or drinking, which already sounds like a red flag to me. But I've always said to myself to never try any synthetic drugs. But so many of my friends are into that shit now that it's sometimes hard to resist. And I just know that I would enjoy it. I'm basically afraid that I would enjoy it too much.

159,"4 years ago when I (f) was 16, me and my step brother (was 22 at the time) messed around. Making out, touching, blow job. Pretty much everything, but actual intercourse. Anyway, this happened twice. Right after the second time I started dating my husband. Me and my step brother just naturally didn't do it anymore and we never really ever talked about it. Easily because he lives 5 hours away from me, I don't see him much. Anyway, like I said, I'm married now. All these years for some reason it's bothered me that we just never talked about it. I guess I wanted closure. He recently came home for his birthday, he's engaged now. He seems very happy. After he went home we started Snapchatting. It was all innocent until I brought up our past. I just wanted closure and it seemed like he did too. But it ended up being a huge mistake. One thing led to another and I ended up sending him pictures of my tits. I felt like I was 16 again. Dumb and naive. But I'm not. I'm 20 years old and married. A couple days after it happened I felt incredibly guilty. I told my husband everything. Obviously he was mad (we're going to be okay). My husband is threatening to tell my step Brothers fiance. 
There's 2 problems, my step brother seems furious with me, but it was a mistake! I had to tell my husband. 
The other problem is that I'm scared his fiance is going to call off the wedding if this goes badly. If this goes the worst possible way, my whole family will find out. Including my dad, and I think this would hurt him so much. 
I'm just not sure what to do. Any advice would be appreciated. 

I want to add that he's done things like this 2 times, to my knowledge, with other girls while being with his fiance. I think he has a problem. He's happily with this girl, but continues to cheat on her.  ",11Nov2017,7
160,"Bare with me this is a long story so here it goes: I live in the western bay area, my parents used to live in the eastern bay area and recently moved to Reno, before they moved to Reno they placed most of their extra stuff in a rented storage unit in the eastern bay area, my parents also have a PO box in the eastern bay area that is still active that i check for them on a 2 week basis. Up until now I haven’t gone to their storage unit because there had been no reason to do so, this time is different due to the fact that the storage facility cut the old lock and replaced it with a new lock recently due to a late payment. I saw this as an opportunity to gather some of their important stuff from storage and bring it with me (since i will be visiting my parents soon for Thanksgiving) so I headed to the storage facility (the whole time i continuously tried calling my father and mother to ask for the storage unit number but they did not answer after multiple calls) I decided that since the new keys must only work that i will go to the general area where I remember the unit being (based on memory) and try the key on doors until one opened meaning that it would obviously be my parents unit. I finally opened a lock (with the key provided in the mail from the storage facility) and i assumed it would be my parents storage unit. I went inside and after a few minutes of expecting the items inside, I could tell that it was not my parents belonging. I then closed the door and locked it with the lock that i had somehow opened with my key and went to the office to ask for assistance from a worker who can tell me which storage unit number my fathers was (i know i should have done this first) and the man told me that he can’t disclose the info to me because my dad didn’t put my name on the list of people who can access the storage unit. I tried calling my dad again and he still would not answer, the worker then asked me if i went into a unit that wasn’t mine which i told him that i had but i realized it was the wrong unit and thats why i came to him for assistance and then he continued to ask me if i took anything which i told him no i had not (there are cameras that can clarify that) he then told me to return when my father can call and add me on the list (which he did way after the fact). Now i just feel nervous because I don’t want them to review the recording of me going into the wrong storage unit and accusing me of trying to do something stupid when in reality I was just trying to find my parents storage unit.

172,"hello, fellow redditors. First, I'd like to apologize for the usage of a throwaway account. Rest assured in the knowledge that I do so only out of strict necessity.  

I've come looking for your guidance, due to the fact that I have no one else to whom I may speak of this. So if possible, please lend me your help for I am in deep trouble. I'll explain and try to keep it short:  

I Have to make a choice soon, between either going to Seminary or University. Under normal circumstances I'm very aware that this would not be a problem at all and the choice would be obvious to any sensible person. But that is not the case, I'm an anomaly and so is my situation. It is not an overestimation to state that this choice will decide my whole future.  

First, the things you need to know about me, are as follows:  

I'm 25 year old atheist, Live in the middle of nowhere, I finished my high-school from a trashy professional school, couldn't go to university due to lack of funds and ended up spending the last 7 or 8 years locked up inside my house. Went out to dispose of the trash once in a while, at night.  

As such, 8 years isolated from everything caused me to develop severe mental problems and exacerbated the ones I already had. I had no jobs and no interaction with almost anyone. Like a hermit, with the internet as my only company.  I understood that such a life could not be sustained forever. From there, I started to have panic attacks with more regularity and eventually broke down and asked for help.  

I have recently gone to psychologists and psychiatrists and it's fair to say it didn't go very well.  

My family ended up asking the Local Priest for help, and he gladly agreed to meet me and give me options.  

I spoke to the priest reluctantly, but all he said was: no one should ever be deprived of an education, I heard you'd like to go to university but can't because of financial problems, is that right? From now on, do not worry about any costs at all, tuition, room, transportation... whatever is needed will be covered. So just think about and choose what you want to major in and when you have decided, just let me know.  

I was flabbergasted with what I had just heard, this was amazing, it's a full ride to university, I've always wanted this! but, then, curiosity got the best of me and I asked about seminary to the priest... He just said, that if it's something that I decide on and want, that could also be an option. He advised me not to be too rash about this, because it's a vocation and there are some sacrifices that come with it.  

That's the gist of it... I need to make the best possible decision for me at this moment in time, taking everything into consideration. This is not just a choice, I spent many years locked up in my room, I have nothing but a damaged mental health. If my family died or stopped supporting me, that would be it. I would be on the streets and probably dead after a while. I would like to get educated and get better if at all possible, but I also need to consider survival.

Seminary:  
Pros:  

* I am mentally fucked up, the less things I have to deal with, the better... It's like the army, they give you a routine, a bed where to sleep and food to eat. They also provide a more reflective and calm environment. Life would be easier, therefore less of a chance of going crazy, I think.  

* All of this for the duration of 8 years, pretty good, not having to worry about work and paying rent for so long... room and board provided, sounds like security.

cons:  

* It's bad, because you have to pretend to believe in God and follow the catholic faith, which as an atheist I obviously don't. Also, all you are ever going to study is irrelevant dogmatic theology. it's a huge waste of time... and although I can't be corrupted as an atheist, I assume it would be hard to pretend and keep the charade up for years. I would also become a huge hypocrite, but I can think of it as being an actor I suppose.  

* I also don't want to be a priest and thinking about living this lie my whole life is depressing... though, I wouldn't have to worry about homelessness.... and I could quit too... what I would do in such a situation I have no Idea.


University:  
Pros: 

* I would love to go to university, I seriously would. I remember when I was little I wanted to be a palaeontologist, I was pretty adamant about it too... but that, is long gone...  
I would also now have a degree, which means more possibilities.

* I thirst for knowledge, and I could choose a major inline with my preferences, such as music, theatre, philosophy, art, languages, psychology... I know they are useless, but we are all going to die, so why not have some fun. knowledge for the sake of knowledge! This would be the first exciting thing I did in a very long time...  

Cons:

* I had terrible education, The only school I had available for my High-school was a shit stained professional school, the curriculum is completely different from normal High-School, which means, I am not prepared for most university entrance exams. I have a huge hole of knowledge that those exams are based on. That's why I can only try to go into arts and humanities. that's what I studied by myself when I was Isolated... 
Engineering, Medicine, nursing, CS, Physics, Chemistry... forget it, there is no way I can get into those majors. I have neither access to teachers and tutors to help me get back on my feet, nor the time to study for it, and to be truthful, not the motivation, dedication, or work ethic necessary to survive those rigorous fields. As I am now, I am a shell, a nut-case, a mal-adapted anomaly.  

* Would I be able to deal with all the confusion surrounding university and it's challenges? how do you even rent a room? how do you pay for it? how do you pay for transportation? and food? are there any more papers or administrative fees I have to keep track of? that won't go well, I don't know how to do any of that stuff, I don't know How any of it works, I don't know How to deal with that. Normal life is foreign to me... and it's much too complicated for my head right now... maybe if we went about it slowly, one little thing at a time... I don't know. 

So Please... Consider my situation, I would like to get an education and learn about interests of mine off course, but, I need to survive too... I have no Idea what to do. If I fuck this choice up, I won't have any more opportunities like this... so please any advice is welcome. I really can't decide... I don't have the necessary data to make an informed decision about this, so I'm hoping you guys can shed some light on this dilemma. I'm pretty desperate...

I'm sorry for the essay, and thank you very much for your time.

179,"Hey all,
I've been physically recovered from my eating disorder for around 3 years . I used to be 80 pounds at 5'4 and doctors told me if I continued I could die any day. 

Well long story short, during the time I was sick, I lost passion for everything . I used to draw for hours, write poems and mini novels, read into the late hours , play video games , play piano for hours on end, sing and make videos of me playing piano and singing. I also used to dance. Sometimes I want to die thinking of how I lost everything of myself as a human being. I feel like I'm an empty shell of myself before I got sick. I used to be so outgoing and love making friends and socializing any chance I got. My parents have been alcoholics since I was little (they finally have seeked recovery now that I've moved out) and it was very traumatic. A lot of abuse, physical and emotional to each other, as well as my mom had BPD. This, and my boyfriend (ex) of 2 years cheating on me caused me to fall into obsessing over calories and working out, causing me to fall into my anorexia, as well as me never really dealing emotionally with my best friend dying years ago in a car accident.

I'm now living on my own with my boyfriend for almost two years. (I met him after I was weight  restored after treatment) Hes pretty supportive , but it can be frustrating for him at times. He has helped me get over counting calories and weighing myself obsessively by setting little goals : One month, you get a romantic date, two months, get to go on a road trip to see family etc. I love this fool so much for multiple reasons, after our first date he researched anorexia and found out ways he could help . Knew he was the one .

The one thing I haven't been able to fix is my motivation and passions . I MISS so much being passionate about things, I've tried to dive myself into these hobbies again, but they don't feel the same any more. I feel so empty inside, I honestly don't know if I could get through this without my boyfriend and brother. I also hate talking to people now, unless I'm actually in the situation (so basically, hate making plans or texting people besides my S/O and my brother) I feel overwhelmed when I try talking to people on texting or on the phone, but I desperately want to have female friends. I'm so lonely sometimes, I've cried many times about the lack of passion and friends in my life.

My boyfriend and I do play video games together, Yugioh and airsoft. All those are fun, but I miss having a creative talent such as my writing, drawing, piano, singing and dancing. I dance a little still (helps that my boyfriend wants to become a professional dancer). He has been very supportive in trying to motivate me, but obviously I don't want to put this all on him. I sleep a lot. Even after I've had 10 hours of sleep. But when I try to fall asleep on purpose, I can't sleep . I think I am depressed. Please help. I feel so empty inside.

185,"First of all, apologies if this is the wrong subreddit. If there is another one that is more suited to this problem, I will be happily guided there for reposting. Also apologies again because this may be long.

I have been with my partner for three years. My relationship with his parents is OK in as much as they seem to like me, but we haven't spent lots of time together and we're not really close or 'pally' in any huge way. I generally like them too, however I have been told many stories about my partner and his brother's childhood that makes me question their ability to be open minded parents (they did the whole 'boys don't cry' shit which I hugely disapprove of and has quite obviously made my boyfriend and his brother insecure about expressing their feelings, and there are many stories of their hobbies being criticised for being nerdy etc, just general mean spirited stuff that has formed into insecurity). They are also quite stubborn people with set opinions and who don't like to be criticised. Both bf and his brother are now young adults in their twenties so it's easier to be a bit more independent of their parents, but they're quite tight knit as a family. I say this to get some background on family dynamics and the type of people his parents are.

Now to the issue. A couple of months ago, they got a dog. This is the first dog they've had so they were inexperienced owners. The dog is some kind of crossbreed mix and is huge, like German Shepherd huge. They got him from a shelter and the shelter were great about offering behavioural support etc, and they do behavioural lessons as well for dogs that pass through there that new owners can take advantage of, completely free. This would be especially useful for their dog because he was neglected by previous owners and has little training and trust despite being about 5 years old. Like them I'm not experienced with dogs either, but even I can tell that the dog needs some intensive training to learn suitable behaviours. He jumps up and barks when people he knows arrive at the door, growls when strangers arrive, and lately has been aggressive towards other dogs on walks (luckily they keep on the lead so he hasn't actually mauled a dog yet, but still). This is all made more intimidating because of his size. Despite all of this, his parents refuse to book training because 'he's a good boy!' and his mum rewards literally every behaviour with cuddles and treats because she loves the idea of doting on the dog now that she can't do the same with her kids. Bf and brother try their best to actually discipline the dog and he behaves better around them, but as bf lives away for university and brother works during the week, the effect is minimal really. Mostly his mum is the main carer as she doesn't work and is home all day.

Recently the dog pulled on the lead when his dad was walking him, causing him to fall over and break his arm badly enough to have a steel rod put in and a lot of nasty scarring (although the doctors said this was a very unlucky outcome - another angle would have led to a sprain or fracture at worst). This, plus the dog's general bad behaviour due to a bad puppyhood and what I think is appalling reinforcement at home, has led to his parents now saying that they're thinking of returning the dog to the shelter, because 'they can't cope with him anymore'. I see this as abhorrent, because they are one of the main causes of the dog's behaviour in the first place, and the dog could really flourish given the right training - he's a smart boy, and affectionate at heart. Bf and brother are appalled at the idea and have said so, but their parents aren't listening to them because as I said before, stubborn and set in their ways. They are frustrated that the dog isn't literally perfect from the offset and think they can just return him like a defective toy.

So I need advice on this: given how they are and my relationship with them, and with the dog's welfare in mind, how do I convince them to actually take advantage of the training the shelter offers and persevere with the pet they chose to get, and show them how destructive their reinforcement is generally to the dog? It's getting to the point where I fear the dog will hurt another dog or something due to the total lack of discipline he receives, but I also don't want to go in like a bitchy bull in a china shop when I'm not really the one who holds the most sway in this situation.",11Nov2017,2

I draw (infrequently, lately just for commissions), I like to read (also infrequently since I'm usually too tired to concentrate). I like hiking and being outside but to go somewhere good I have to drive ~2 hours, which means I don't go every weekend. I'm a casual gamer but I typically play individual games (Zelda, etc.). I practice my second language. Obviously I see my friends but I don't go out-out a ton. ...There's really not a whole lot else that I do that I would consider a hobby.

On the other hand, he's a friend, and friends help each other out in times of crisis. Also, with the harsh New England winter coming, living in one's car is not a good thing. I'm worried about what he'll have to deal with. My fiancee thinks that we should absolutely talk to him about it, but I wanted to get some advice before I did. He does have a job, which is a good thing. The other thing that potentially complicates the situation is that he has two young kids by two different women. I have to figure that the kids are with their respective mothers/family, but I'm not entirely sure.

194,"Prom is about six months from now, however, people are starting to discuss about their promposals and what they're going to wear. Thing is, I'm not planning on going to prom since I don't really want to go and waste my time and money, when I could be doing something else I enjoy either by myself or with other friends who aren't going to prom. Yes, I acknowledge that I will regret this ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity, how I'm antisocial, but honestly, I have made up my mind since my second year of high school, and will enjoy doing something that is comfortable for me.

I still have a long time to decide, since the thing is six months away. That is, when my friends asked if I was going to prom and I said no, they started freaking out. I tried to tell them that I won't feel comfortable going, but they're extremely relentless and want to drag me there. It got to the point where one of my female classmates said that she would drag me to prom and be my prom date, even though I know she is joking. The thing I am worried about is that some girl I barely know will try to do a promposal just for jokes and try to embarrass me by asking me out. I don't want to be the only kid that is known for rejecting a girl to prom and be immortalized as such.

I know that I am worrying about these minuscule problems, but this has been affecting me greatly, and it will only get worse when prom rolls around. How do I try convincing my friends and classmates to respect my decision that I am not going to prom?

195,"So I’ve been friends with this one kid in my grade (Both are males 16; senior year hs) since freshman year. He was always sorta douchbaggish to everyone but still fun to be around and we had a lot of common interest. We would always hang out with a group of friends and every new group of friends he got in he invited me into. Now, in a group chat we were in with a bunch of friends, he called me a “public punching bag”. 

(Context: we have the same birthday and I was going to throw a house party for our birthdays with all of our friends. I wrote a huge paragraph outlining everything and some pretty basic rules and he started calling me out on it for no reason. This got more intense which ended up him calling me a “public punching bag” because when people shit on me I don’t really care about it.)

So, needless to say I was super pissed off at him and told him to apologize. Not only did I tell him to apologize but so did our other friend. About 2 days ago I told him that I’m still waiting for an apology and he had the nerve to call me “retarded for wanting an apology” and asked when I became such a pussy. After he said that everyone hanged up on him and he left the group chat. All I want to do right now is fight him and make him pay because he won’t learn any other way. Please give me advice on what I should do. Should I confront him about it in person? Should I just ingnore him?

196,"I (32/F) have a 42 year old male coworker who became a good friend, we talk a lot at work and text each other to just talk about stuff. 
He has become really down lately because he feels lonely. He lives alone and doesn't really have many friends. I talk to him a lot about that because he trusts me and I really want him to feel happy, but I understand that he's lonely and sad. But I feel I have come to a limit where I can't say so much more to make him feel good. He appreciates that I try I guess, but I can't help him out of this and that makes me sad. 

He's mainly depressed because he lives alone and has No girlfriend, but when I recommend online dating he doesn't want to do that. I don't have any friends that could be interesting for him to date, so I am lost. Sometimes I am scared he would hurt himself and I could have helped him or done something differently. He means a lot to me so it breaks my heart. 

I try to cheer him up but right now I feel that I can't help him anymore. But maybe anyone here knows how I can help him?

208,"Hey there, 

I'm a single guy with friends whom Ive known since college. I recently bought a new house and called over my friends to check the place out. Their child ( age 4 ) started to jump over my sofas with their shoes on, walking over window sills and proceeded to run in to my room and start jumping on the bed. All this and not a word from the parents. The highlight was when the child went in to my backyard to play and all of a sudden pulled down his pants and started to pee. Reaction from parents :- wow such instinctive behavior, he had a problem and he solved it without asking us. 

As one can imagine, being a neat freak and having a low tolerance for this their visits were cut down after a few more incidents like this. Them knowing my nature and how particular about things also could get a sense of why things have been distant.

So cut to a few months later, we all meet up where the couple start telling me that they'd love to visit my house more often but I have to be ok with their kids tearing my house apart and them finding all the hazardous locations in my house. I replied back saying that some level of discipline would be needed and laughed it off. The mother was not impressed

They seem to get the impression that I hate kids and not having any kids of my own dont understand this normal behavior, which is not the case. I do expect some sense of discipline though.

How do I go about interacting with my friends ? I value the friendship and would love to have them over more often. How do I deal with the children ? Am I being too much asking for some level of discipline.",11Nov2017,2

She is an excellent teacher and most of the kids (me included) absolutely love her.  However, around thirty minutes ago (we have Saturday rehearsals for the musical) as everyone was leaving the room to rehearse in the main studio, I saw her looking kind of down. At this point everyone had left and it was just me hovering in the door frame.

224,"This one is really hard for me, as I don’t talk about this often. My mother was a drug addict (heroin and opioids) and has been sober for 8 years. She has been working really hard to get on her feet ever since she was arrested and spent a year in jail for stealing from my grandparents’ house (as well as possession of drugs when she was caught). We have a really good relationship now that has taken years to build up. But I can’t help but assume the worst in this case.

I broke some ribs earlier this year and was prescribed a lot of painkillers, but I only took a few of them because I don’t like the way they make me feel. So I’ve had ~140 pills sitting in my medicine cabinet since June. Well my wife was in pain last night and asked me to grab her one, which is a reason we kept these around was for her occasional severe stomach pain. So I go downstairs to the cabinet, look through all the bottles, take literally everything down from that cabinet, and couldn’t find them. Everything else is still there, because I had just recently gone through it around a month ago and remember what I left there. 

My mother comes over to watch our cats whenever we go out of town, and has a key to our house for this reason. She also knows about those pills. But I just don’t think she would do this after all the progress she’s made. But at the same time, these are the same pills she would abuse, so it kind of makes sense if she wanted to relapse.

TL;DR: I’m missing some strong painkillers and my ex-drug addict mother is the only person I can think of who would want these. Also, she comes to our house when we aren’t there to take care of our cats. Am I in the wrong for feeling like she took them? How can I talk to her about it?",11Nov2017,1

226,"I (F31) have been married to my husband (M41) for 5 years, together for 10. Best friends, great lovers and have always trusted him. If there has ever been jealousy issues, it has always come from his end... jealous of friends who are male, aquatinces  and even his own son (my stepson).  My sister-in-law's (my husband's sister who is a lesbian) wife's 19 year old niece is the subject of this photo. 
Some context. This young girl is attractive. Nice body, pretty smile, but she is a tomboy. 9/10 she is wearing camo/mossy oak hoodie or jacket, jeans, boots, with no makeup and hair in a messy bun. Last year, my husband, who rarely ever gets on FB, logged on one day and liked several of her posts and pics. I thought it was strange since we aren't close with her, and the fact that he never gets on FB, let alone ""like"" anything. He shrugged it off and boiled it down to ""she's family"". I never mentioned it or thought about it again because, you know, TRUST. 
My husband's phone has been running slow for weeks. I suggested that he delete some things to clear space:old text conversations, Tumblr pics/gifs, etc. When I got  home from work later that night, he told me that deleting stuff had worked and that his phone was running faster/better. Although, as he said, it was ""difficult"" and he was sad to delete some of our vacation pictures and other ""special pictures of us"". I told  him he could sent them  to his email or saved them on the cloud. He is not good with that kind of stuff.  Computer type stuff. I explained that I meant he should delete replaceable things...porn, screenshots, etc. 
Last night he asked me to screenshot a funny headline on his phone so he could send it to his sister. Before I go any further, please know that I am not the type to snoop. When I went into his gallery to attach the screenshot to a text message, I saw an album titled Facebook. It only had one picture in it and from the thumbnail it looked like a sexy woman in a very short blue lacey dress. I didn't think anything of it and continued sending the text as he had asked me to do, he was laying down right next to me.
Once the message was sent, it dawned on me that that photo was in it's own album, created my downloading pics from FB; it wasn't a porn pic/gif in Downloads album. My curiosity lured me in. I clicked on the photo and discovered it was a picture of my sister-in-law's niece, dressed in a very revealing, tight, lacey and sexy blue dress...not her typical camo shirt and jeans.
I asked him about it immediately. He was slightly defensive from the start. 
1.) The picture itself. The sexy dress and pose
2.) He had to of download it himself
3.) He spent a full day deleting stuff from his phone, including our vacation pics, but he kept this one. Why?
4.) His slightly defensive behavior quickly turned into anger. 
When he started to raise his voice, I ended the conversation and slept on the couch to avoid fighting. I wanted to have time to think about and choose my words carefully. I don't want to overreact, but I can't deny that this was very unsettling to me. My gut instinct was to be weirded out, sad, angry, fucking confused...
Reddit, please give me your honest opinion about the situation. Keep in mind that my husband is a very nice and attractive guy. He is a flirt. All women...old ladies, middle-aged, attractive, ugly...all women. I have never, in our whole relationship, taken it seriously. I have never felt jealous. that's why I am so confused. I have never felt this way towards him. Why is my gut telling me that there is more to this than he is revealing?

Weve taken him to school dances and met the parents of his previous dates and girlfriends. For my boyfriends mother she prides herself on being morally correct and her idea of “pure” we’ve always had an honest relationship and we’ve never argued until this point. I’m not a person who yells or lies or anything like that. But when his little brother started this new relationship four months ago I’d had a bad gut feeling.

Ii was conflicted and only told my boyfriend. We tried to talk to his brother about it and he would only ignore us. His mom wanted to know what the problem was so we told her honestly. She has clearly made it that her younger son is her favorite so we expected her to care that her son was dating a not so good girl. He has had other girlfriends with no problems but this one holds his attention for all the wrong reasons. Since the very first time they met. If you catch my drift.

Never had anyone else while being a full blown adult,(car, house, bills, jobs etc.) 
We live together, have a couple pets, and I'm really not sure about this anymore. 
I'm not sure if this is just me being overly sexual and thinking I should go elsewhere for it, our sex life is a joke, we fight all the time, i feel like i'm on such leash, I didn't hang out with my friends for a very long time, she has a say in everything I do and everyone I communicate with, for good reason, we've had some troubles in our past with my trustworthiness, but we worked through them, i just feel like we would both be happier with other people but what if I'm wrong. 
I'm not sure I can give her everything that She wants and I'm afraid that if I break it off i'll regret it, I really do love her, but I want to be free. I want a life. I want happiness and I feel like that's just not how I am right now, I'm much happier when I'm alone and she's at work or while i'm with friends. which is another problem because without me she'll have to move back in with her parents and she'll have alot more difficulty with life and Idk what to do. 
I don't want to regret leaving. 
I don't want to kill her chances at a life. 
I don't know what to do.
I don't have any idea where we would live, her parents would take her in but moving back would be such a hard time for her by herself.

240,I work nights 4am to 10am. While I am at work my son stays home. Right after work I go straight to the gym to picking him up from school or his dad's. Recently I had a roommate move out suddenly and I had to pay some extra cash to cover the rent and I have money management problems and I'm very disorganized I have recently found that I have adult ADHD. I started going to the gym and I have been much more organized because of the dopamine. Anyways because I had to cover that extra for the rent I couldn't buy groceries and I was already pretty tight with money. But last night my check came though so right after the gym I bought some meat to cook. I already had rice as I always have rice. Pork chops with rice. I realized that I didn't have or buy any veggies. There's a store a few blocks away but the outside temperature is like 44 degrees. He is a little sick with a cough but superhyper. Should I just cook without veggies? Or should I take him out in the cold and get him veggies?,11Nov2017,1
241,"Trying to condense everything so it's not to drawn out, so please bare with me.  I've been with my fiancé now for almost 10 years all together. She's an only child and works for a family run business. Her parents have owned it for almost 20 years. My spouse has been by there side the whole time working with them. I gave up a decent paying job last year that I worked at for almost 8 years to come work for my to be in laws. My (we'll call them ""in laws""cause they practically are) asked me at the last minute to come to work for them spring 2016. I couldn't leave my old boss hanging(cause of the short notice)so I finished out the year part time at my old job that I loved while working for my fiancées parents. 

I always got along great with my in laws, always. Until I went to work for them this spring in 2017 full time. Without to many details I work at a seasonal campground. This is the set up. I work out of home. Our home has 1 room where it's the front office. People check in and people check out, like hotels. Most of our clients live hear for the season. We have cabins and tent sites as well. Needless to say people always coming and going. We're open 7 days a week for five and a half months, not one day off. I knew what I was getting into. I like to think I'm a hard working, motivated individual. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I'm dedicated and I'll give it my all. Being surrounded by your in laws and my fiancée whom I love with all my heart... for over 5 months seven days a week is hard. Me and my fiancée still see eye to eye with just about everything, but it has it days where work gets between us.  Backing up a little this last spring my in laws left her daughter and I the house with the office so they can semi retire and we step in and pretty much run the show. They moved into there new house... which literally is right next to the campground. WERE NEIGHBORS! We're closed for the season and I still feel trapped by them. They're always micromanaging every little detail. It's so painful. Most of the regulars knew a changing of power is going to happen. So I felt like I had to step up my game even more. People knew it's not the owner taking care of the little things it's her daughter and bf now. So where ever I went, I left my best work behind me. I look at it this ways..."" people know she's not doing it ,it's a reflection of me now"". My day started at5:30 am and ended around 9 pm when we closed the office. 

I really don't want much in life... just to be happy and not ruin the relationship between me and my fiancée,but my mother in law to be is so far really fucking everything up. 

Spring they tell me to take of the house like it's my own... well no shit. It's there name on the house. I've never been one to be destructive. You treat people like the way you want to be treated... and their personal belongings. If something breaks I fix it... my mother is Italian so I'm also a neat freak... I take care of my stuff long story short. Last week mother in law gives a work list to me. Little things that i already had every intention on doing. She forgets I have a list as well. I've helped you guys the last couple seasons do this. I know the routine by now I would think. Not rocket science. 

Today ,6 days after her giving me this list she's in a full panic that these little things aren't done. Well she didn't know everyday this week after coming from my other job( campground is closed and winterized so I went back to my old job to make an extra check) that I've been chipping away at the work list. I told her those exact words the other day. "" I'll chip away at these things all week"" . 

Long story short I hate working for my in laws. I feel under appreciated and almost used. I helped them move into there house and gave them 7 days a week since April until October. I took care of there yard work on top of the 11 acre campground. It's ruining my relationship ship with them. It's also not helping me and my fiancée either. She at least knows her parents are... odd to say the least. It's now November and I feel like I'm just an errand boy. There claim was Nov first we're all done for the season completely and I can get hours at my other job... well it's now Nov 11. I understand in the off season there's always still something to do, but if you give me a list , have faith I'll do it,cause I always have. If you say take of the house. Let me do it!!! Just cause you take the awning down last week of October means I have to do it last week?Maybe I want it on for another week. You don't live hear anymore. Let me fucking do it on my time. This is going to turn into a rant. 

 I'm so done working for her family.  The nit picking and micromanaging is killing me. I'm not a total fucking idiot. I'm 30 for Christ sakes and I get treated like a 18 year old who can't wipe there own ass... no offense to anyone. I'm not perfect, far from it. For the sake of everyone's relationship I think things should go back to the way they were. I can't work for her family. I tried so hard. Being surrounded in this ""bubble"" as she calls it with them and my fiancée is so hard. Nothing seems good enough in her eyes... ever. 

 Advice from anyone would be great. Oh we also didn't get one complaint this year.... For the most part. So that tells me I was doing something right. Ps also my father in law will drive by me in the campground and not even look at me sometimes... like 75% . An that's no joke.

Am I being a bitch? Then on one half I feel guilty if I quit... but should I? I've tried my hardest and made sacrifices... and I'm not happy... first time I can really say that. I want to give and do everything for my fiancée. She's my number one. I just can't go along on this dog and pony show. I tried.... I've never been so lost or confused in life. So yea, if anyone out that has had a similar experience or just some good advice would be great. Thanks Reddit

246,"I am so frustrated.

My boyfriend and I live in my house in one state and his family lives in a nearby state. His father died a few days ago and he has been here in the nearby state with his family for a week. I flew here to support him. Just to caveat this post, I’m stressed out—work is really crazy right now—there’s a software project that depends on me and our schedule is tight, but I still came here because it is important to support him.

I just learned that he has asked his mother to come live with us. Despite the fact that I like his mother and we get along, I am not comfortable with this life change. Also, he didn’t even ask me or talk to me about it. Also, there is a dog involved, and while I am nice to all animals, I don’t actually want a dog. Extra detail—I have two small rabbits at home. The dog is small, but gets into everything and is not trained and is larger than my rabbits.

His mom seems to be okay, but is very much considering moving in with us. She has several other places she could go: 1. Stay in her house here 2. Live with her daughter and husband whom she babysits for several days a week 3. Move out of country with her other son and his family 4. My boyfriend could wait a few months until he likely has a job and get her another place in this state. He doesn’t want her to go to any of those places or stay put. Honestly he seems to be thinking of her welfare, but ......he didn’t even ask me.... presumably, she wouldn’t have to work living with us because I would be paying for food and housing. I already pay for those things for the two of us. We will not have much of a relationship if things become the scenario of me coming home to him and his mother. I’m thinking I have no way out, which sounds crazy because it is my house! 

As his dad just died and I don’t see a way to tell him how upset and uncomfortable this makes me. I also see it making him very angry if I say anything about it. 

I’m not trying to come off as a jerk. It’s not that I don’t have empathy. I just want my own space. I didn’t even plan for he and I to be living together, but it’s what had to happen for his financial situation. He’s going to school and currently does not have a job / doesn’t think he can get one until he is done after the spring.",11Nov2017,1
247,"Hello!

I'm undergoing the process of leaving my current career and I want to work on starting a new one. I plan on working in the meantime of course, because I support myself, but I'd like to either get a degree or teach myself something that can help me to begin a new path and make some decent money. I already have a year worth of general college credits.


I've been working as a costume maker, and while the work can be rewarding at times, we often work very long stretches of time without days off on very small un-changing stipend pay. It's what i signed up for, but I do not want to continue.


I really love drawing, video games, sewing, and making music, but it's tricky to make money with those things. I have a lot of experience with selling and customer service which is genuinely something I don't mind. It would be nice to choose a path that can utilize some of my creativity, but I'm open to a lot of things! I have a really great memory and I learn things quickly. I am not afraid of hard work. The only thing I can't do is anything involving the medical field.


I've been toying with the idea of teaching myself some coding languages and trying to get an entry-level tech job, but i'm not sure if things would pan out as well as I hope. What would you recommend? 
I hope I didn't give *too* many unnecessary details, just trying to be thorough:) 


TLDR- I'd like advice on which skills I should teach myself/which degree i should pursue! I don't have to love it, I just need to make enough to support myself and be able to save. What do you think?


Thank you so much to anyone who's read all of this, it means a lot to me that you took the time to do so.

248,"So I've been feeling awful for the past year, I've always been a loner never really had any friends. My father would shame me and yell at me for that,I always felt like shit. Now fast forward a couple of years he has became the person I hate the most.

He beat my mother nearly to the point of death with my sister watching that screaming while I was laying in fear, he kept telling at me,forbidding things and always saying how he cares about me and my mom,and how he loves us all very much

I find it disgusting how we all fear him yet he ''loves us'' and yells at us for not loving you back,I'm sorry for not fucking returning your love but you lowering my self esteem to an absolute zero through constant harassment just takes a toll on me

Now I feel like absolute shit laying in bed and I feel unsafe doing anything knowing he can just come in my room randomly,and after I finally get outside I'm so fucking sad and miserable I can't speak to people,I may also have undiagnosed anxiety because I'm a fucking Trainwreck when talking to people in person

For a year now I've had no motivation or drive, I've felt constantly restless and sad,and at times suicidal,particularly now.

I have no fucking idea what to do now before I one day just kill myself,advice appreciated

Edit: also gonna add that I don't think moving away from him in the next 4 years is a possibility,first I just started highschool and I'll need another 4 years,and my mother and sister don't agree with me for some god forsaken bullshit reason that ''couples should stay together'' and that he's ''changed'' If I did tell the authorities i would probably get my mother and sister to hate me and they are the only people I have left to talk to",11Nov2017,1

I was recently rejected by the girl I loved. That's how it began. Work sucks these days because the project doesn't run well due to bad management, mainly.  Winter is coming, it is cold and rainy outside. That's not going to get better for a while.

I don't feel like doing anything. I feel just bland and bored all day. Everything seems just boring. I would like to go away, traveling has always helped my mood, but I can't because I have to work now.

I feel like going to the airport and just go somewhere far away, and never turn back again. Actually I'm saving up so I can do that some day, just leave this place behind and find new meaning, but that will take more time. Until then I'm stuck here.

I've had some bad mood in the past, but I never felt low like this. It feels like I'm on Valium all day. I feel disconnected, I don't care about anything, the only feeling I sometimes have is anger.
 
I don't know how I can get out of this. Usually when I have bad mood, I just wait it out. I know that it is just a chemical imbalance in my brain, of sorts.

256,"So I have this customer who's a regular at my Chinese buffet restaurant and there's not a single person on my staff that actually likes him. He's incredibly rude and occasionally says inappropriate things. 

Here are some of the instances where's he's been rude.

* He let my server know there was a small puddle of water. My server acknowledged and didn't do anything about it. At the end of his meal, he came up demanding she be fired. (The reason she didn't do anything was because the last time he mentioned something on the floor, the server went to sweep it up and he got on her case about sweeping next to him while he was eating.)

* My servers' English is limited, he asked for Sriracha. She pointed to the hot sauce. He immediately came to me and said my server wasn't understanding and he was looking for the hot sauce. He wasn't rude at this point, but I pointed him to the Sriracha and he seemed happy enough. He went to my server's station, slammed the hot sauce in front of her, gave her a glare, before going back to his table. 

* If my servers try to clear his empty plate before he has enough empty plates on the table, he pitches a fit. Once he stacks his plates, if you don't clear it immediately, he pitches a fit. 

* One time, he saw the manager drop the silverwear (it's wrapped) on the ground. Because she was in the middle of seating someone, she put the silverware on the counter. When she came back, she forgot to discard it and after he finished eating, said he wasn't paying because she did that. She immediately put the silverware in the bin, but he kept freaking out and demanding he wouldn't pay. He said he would call me when I was in. So the manager ran out after him telling him not to come back. When he did call me, I put my foot down and told him that he couldn't not just pay, especially for something that didn't affect him. He came in to pay afterwards. 

* His favorite server had left for China, he started talking to me about some ""snakehead"" or something. About how all these servers had someone they had to answer to and pay off when in exchange for coming to the States. 
* He occasionally makes remarks about my body. ""How do your pants stay up? You don't have any ass!"" ""You should wear less next time"" (I happened to wear a shirt that was slightly shorter since it shrank in the dryer, wasn't crop, you could see a little skin if I reached out to grab something). ""Sexy."" ""Man, I love Asian women."" 

* I found out he reached out and had stroked one of my server's chin. This apparently only happened once but made her uncomfortable. Since then, he has requested her as his server. 

* Yelled at my bartender for not coming out with food often enough. We have over 200 items on the buffet and 2-3 cooks. Each dish takes about 5 minutes so not everything on the buffet will be full and it's certainly not her fault. 


Like, the guy is rude and incredibly entitled and kinda racist. Here's the thing though. I don't think he realizes that at all. And it's not like he's trying to get a free meal. He's just a creep. Not a bad customer, just an incredibly difficult one. 

I want to tell him to stop coming but in this day and age of Yelp and online reviews, I have to watch pretty much everything I do and say. My staff says they are ok with putting up with him. 

But every time he comes in, it stresses everyone out. 


EDIT: Thank you everyone for commenting and offering your advice. I really appreciate it! I'll definitely be putting my foot down and telling him he's no longer welcome, regardless of what he does online. If I catch it, I'll refute it.

263,"About 5 weeks ago I was dumped and was feeling pretty down about myself.  A few days later, I realized that the super cute girl in 3 of my classes was now open to be talked to, since I was now single.  I had never been introduced to her, but I've been in some classes with her in the past 2 years because we have the same major.  So, I told myself I would summon the courage to ask her out one day.

One morning I was feeling pretty good, and decided to go up to her and start a conversation.  We talked about school, and then I asked her if she would ever want to go out and grab some coffee or something.  She accepted, (more like said 'Yeah sure'), I got her number, and felt on top of the world for the rest of the day.  

Later that night, I sent her a text, as I didn't think to give her my number in exchange.  I just said ""Hey it's ______ from this morning.""  No response.  A day, two days, and so forth goes on without so much as a hello in return.

That really bummed me out, but I accepted it and moved on.  That weekend, her Facebook profile popped up, and so I looked at it to see what she posts about.  And, there it was.  Relationship status: In a Relationship.  I was pretty upset, seeing as I really liked this girl and we have a lot in common from the little bits of interests I could gather from her in class

Fast forward to the next time I see her, and it's understandably awkward.  Since then, we haven't spoken, but we exchange glances and stares whenever we see one another.  It's not rude or anything, just kinda awkwardness. 

Fast forward further to the present.  I kind of want to apologize to her for coming off so strong, and I would really like to just get to know her,as she's always sitting along before class while the rest of us hang out.  But I don't know how to do so seeing the awkward introduction we had.

So how can i choose a profession, when all i see in whatever i will choose, the amount of papers i will have to study, and that it will be too hard and boring?
I know some people that know what they want to do(like medecin) and i tell them; ,,Do you know how hard it'll be?"" And they just say they know, but they want to do it anyways cuz they know it'll be worth it, at the end,they will do what they like. They have passion about the dream they know.

I don’t get to spend a lot of time with them due to our weird hours, but when I do I ask the kids how they are doing.  

Now, my brother is a recovering poly substance addict and Iraq war veteran with PTSD.  He is honestly doing the best he has ever done for himself but it was rough on the kids, especially with their parents’ divorce and two new sisters from a new father.  So their performance has been dropping, and here is why.

My brother is bonding with his kids and finally reconnecting in a major way.  The problem is that he doesn’t discipline the kids, he spoils them, and neglects their homework.  Seriously, my 7 year old nephew was up all night last night playing Minecraft, and was up at midnight when I was heading for bed.  My niece was up with dad until 1AM watching a scary inappropriate for eleven year olds movie.  

I’m all for being a liberal parent, but he is neglecting their schooling and it is party time every time the kids are over.  He wants to be their party animal friend, not their father.  

My niece is getting D’s and F’s.  My nephew is literally on his second round of kindergarten and still cannot read.  Granted they figured out he has horrible vision only last year, so this is his first year in kindergarten with vision.  

Also, there is no talking to my brother’s ex wife.  There is too much bad blood from the divorce.  My brother banned her from the property bad.  

I have limited time, and my own mental health issues to deal with. But I fell behind in school for a lot of the same reasons.  I’m seeing the cycle going over again.  Where can I find these kids some help?  ",11Nov2017,4
269,"I'm 24 and finished uni this summer. I took graphic arts and all I want is to be able to actually work something at least remotely related... I've had a few jobs and have a part time job right now, but never anything I actually wanted to do. I hate that I still have to live at home and can't afford many things, but I just want to actually get some experience in what I went to school for.

I had an argument with my boyfriend on this, which started from the fact that I wish we could move in together in the near future(meaning 1-2 years), him saying that he doesn't see us being able to afford that. To this I said that I don't plan to be living with my parents at 26, and he started going on about how spoiled and lazy of me it is that I complain about living with my parents but don't get a random job to be able to afford to move out. Random job meaning working in a call center or some shit. I felt really hurt by his reaction because I never pestered him to do something he doesn't want to do and tried to support him towards doing what he actually likes.

I don't want more pointless jobs. I will never be able to work my field if I've worked only useless jobs...    He doesn't understand this, because he's never worked a day in his life and he literally just bumped into a graphic design job through a friend of his. He didn't even have to try. I don't have any connections or friends who could get me a job, I've been actively applying and trying and nothing is happening.

Is it so wrong or stupid of me to wanna do things this way? I know I don't really get to complain about money if I'm not working harder for it... But I don't know, am I in the wrong here? I feel really weird about that conversation, it made me sad and mad that he thinks that way but part of me thinks he's right...

TL;DR   boyfriend thinks I'm spoiled and lazy for choosing not to work call center jobs because I want to try and work in my field. ",11Nov2017,1
271,"Hi! So we’re both teachers. I started liking this guy at work. In the beginning he was super nice, always coming to my classroom and reaching out. He changes my flat tire, we go out for drinks. Things are really good. Then we go out on a date. Things are still good but I feel him get a little distant. He stops coming to my class as much, less communication. Then two weeks later we go on another date. It went well. After I just gave him a hug and left. He texted me after asking if I’m interested bc he wasn’t sure and wanted to make sure we were on the same page. So I said yes and then he remained distant for another two weeks. So during those two weeks I barely heard from him so I’m like whatever I’m moving on. Then he came into my room last Friday and asked if I wanted to go hiking with him on Saturday. So we went and then we kissed and he stayed distant af for the next few days. So yesterday he asked me if he did something wrong bc he felt like my vibe was weird. And I told him I just felt like he’s distant. Am I crazy or is he an asshole?",11Nov2017,1

274,"Hey all,

I've worn many hats already in my time and a new one has come on the horizon. I'm eyeing working as a ranch hand on a farm outside of the Bay Area in CA. It's about 60 miles one way for me, which in Silicon Valley equates to about 1-1 1/2 hours (ideally) one way for a commute.

It pays about $17/hr. Not much, not for this area anyway but I am looking to just break into a new industry at this point. I'm beyond burnt out working in an office and farm/ranch options are VERY slim picking in this area. I am lucky to be able to even entertain the idea of making so little. The Bay is not my forever home. It's just a place as I'm passing through for a while.

So, how far is too far?

275,"So a couple days ago a friend threw a get together. I asked him if I could go and he said yeah. I found out good amount of people I knew would be there so I got really excited. Someone I considered a good friend was going, so I thought I’d be going with her.

So before the get together I go to dinner, I run into this person I considered a good friend on the way there and we talked, this friend said she was gunna go and she was getting ready, so I said I’m gunna go to dinner and come back.

I ended up not wanting to eat the place and got food to go and was on my way back when I ran into her again, she seemed surprised, she told me she was going to go to Taco Bell and then come back.

I felt like she was trying to dodge me (leave as I was out) at this moment. But I just said “okay” and went away. An hour goes by and I’m contacting the guy throwing the get together and he mentions “were at the commissary”, I immediately knew my friend lied to me and that she was already with the group.

I message her a few times and she ignored me, so about another thirty minutes later I decide to walk to the store and back. On my way to the store she messaged me asking if I wanted to go still, I said “yeah” she mentions she is debating not going, I asked why and she just ignored me from then on. I didn’t spam message her but I did message her a few times asking what she had decided on.

The next day I message her about ignoring me like, “hey you is everything okay?” She said yeah, then I said why did she ignore me yesterday.

After both of us argued we decided it was both of our faults because I could messaged another person I knew there to take me or give me the address so I could get there on my own, but also hers for not following up with me.

But something she said caught me by surprise and left me upset, the reason she didn’t take me herself was this: “I just said I didn’t wanna be the one responsible for bringing you if people are uncomfortable if you’re here you’re here all bets are off I just didn’t wanna be the one if people get pissed”

I asked who were the ones uncomfortable with me and she wouldn’t tell me.

I went off last night on her about that statement and she can’t see any reason why I’m mad about it or how it makes me question her as a friend. I told her she either has shitty friends or her and I aren’t as close friends as I thought we were. She just shrugged it off and now she won’t talk to me/acknowledge me.

I have been feeling real down all day because she was the last person I considered a best friend in the area, my other good friends left for school. 

I feel lost so I turned to you guys. How do I handle this situation?",11Nov2017,1
276,"I lay in bed next to my dad when suddenly he receives a lot of messages. He seems to think that I’m asleep so he picks up his phone and answers to those messages sent by a female coworker. I read the texts he gets and read the texts he sends to this woman and I begin to understand that my father cheats on my stepmother. Those texts were really obviously in one direction like: „I like to touch you“. The woman knows about my fathers wife as came clear in those texts. However it seems to be at the beginning of the affair and they seem to haven‘t had sex yet. They talked about how they are attracted to each other on a purely physical level. This woman said she likes him and he said that he wants more than „touching her“.
I can‘t believe what I just witnessed! 
Since my father has already cheated on my mom (with my stepmom) I always had the fear that he would cheat again. But now that I actually know, I don‘t know what to do.

279,"Well , I'm sorry if it's too long but I'll appreciate if you read it:

I am almost 35 years old , Working as a Sysadmin for a big company.
In was in the army for 10 years and it's where I got my professional education, In the last 6+ years I work in the civilian market.
My life until not so long ago we're very complicated, having to deal with Mom who had cancer since I was 7 and for 20 years and an alcoholic father for the last 15 years , the years with my father we're very hard on me, having to take care of him when he ruins the family and make us hate him, the things I've went thru with him we're awful , dragging him drunk from night clubs and always be on alert to go and search him if he wasn't at home on time , I even got arrested once when someone thought I hit him, which was not true at all, sometime after his first alcohol stop (yeah he did it for like 3 months without alcohol) I got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that kills my kidneys , I was hospitalized for 2 months 7 years ago and had multiple types of treatment including dialysis , a few months after, my kidneys started to work a bit, my father kept drinking , after 2 years the kidneys failed again but gradually, and 3 years ago I started peritoneal dialysis, ofcourse my father kept drinking all the time , until 2 months ago, when he couldn't even get out of home alone because he hurt himself with alcohol abuse all this time.

Back to me, 
No I don't feel good, my doctors say that I am on a balanced treatment, but my body is getting weaker and weaker , I think it's mostly mentally because I work for a full day and when I'm with people around me at work , I shine,
When I get back home I'm so tired, I also drive alot from and to work, all my friends kinda disconnected from my one by one since I got sick so I find myself laying in bed , preparing for my dialysis which I do at home, I wish I could make music but I don't have room for equipment and If not music I wish I could draw, I have an intense desire to draw my life , draw my thoughts but I'm not talented at drawing at all, 
The situation with girls is also not good, I had a girlfriend when I just got sick and I loved her so much so that I forgot about my health and felt on the top of the world ,but she broke up with me after 6 months , I guess she didn't want to be with a sick guy , that's why till today I can't make a connection with a girl even if I want to, she will leave me when she will hear about my kidneys.

280,"A few weeks ago at a family dinner at my MILs house, my brother-in-law walked up behind me as I was standing in the kitchen and he smacked my ass. I should have kicked him, but I hesitated, because assaulting people is not my normal mode of operation. I’m not a touchy-feely person at all, and there is no reason for him to have thought I would find such a thing amusing. I wouldn’t really say I’m angry, I just don’t like him AT ALL and basically would prefer never to see or speak to him again. Unfortunately, this is not practical since he lives nearby and the family hangs out a lot. I feel like I should say something to him, but I’m not sure what it would accomplish. Other than making it clear that he should never do that again, I guess. Husband said he would talk to his brother, but I’m an adult... I feel like I should be able to handle this myself.

283,"I'll preface this by saying that I am 27/F and my boyfriend is 30/M. We live in a small town in PA, very close to the Delaware border.  I had a great childhood-- only child, close with my parents, etc. I am also close with my extended family as well.

My family is from New York and I was born there. Moved to my current town very young, but I spent a lot of time in NY growing up (probably every other weekend). I have always adored NY, it just always felt like home to me. I applied to colleges there, but stayed local because of a toxic relationship I was committed to.

After college I started dating my current boyfriend. I love him dearly and he has always expressed a desire to move out of our town (he left for college and a while after, then moved back). Both him and I adore NY-- we go there every few months for clubs, shows, etc. It makes me feel alive there and we have always talked about moving there. It is basically a guarantee that we will move there, it is just a question of *when*.

On the flip side, here in my current state, I have a job teaching at a high school I absolutely adore. I am teaching a subject that is VERY hard to land a position in (psychology) and I adore the particular kids I am teaching, who will graduate after next year. I know that in NY it's highly unlikely that I will be teaching psychology at a school as awesome as this one. Part of me wants to stay one more year to enjoy the position and see this particular class graduate (I started their freshman year and have really grown close to many of them).

Also I will miss my family dearly. As I said, I am very close with my parents. It will be very hard not to see them any time I want. 

A few months back, my little cousin (who lives in the same state as me and is about to graduate college) told me she got a job offer in NY. She took the job and is planning on moving. For some reason, I got such a surge of urgency (maybe even envy) that I HAD to move. I felt like I would be wasting my life here and, I'll be honest, I feel envious that she will be moving there with a great job lined up. We have both talked about moving there and she has expressed that she would love for us to move at the same time and it would make her feel much less lonely. In all honesty, I feel like it would eat me up if she were living there and I were stuck here, although I know that is dumb.

This is scattered, but I just want to get my thoughts out. I feel very torn. I lose sleep over this. I dream about it. I know I want to move there eventually, but I kind of feel like I want to wait another year. At the same time, I don't think there is ever going to be a ""perfect"" time to move and I am not getting any younger. I want to enjoy NYC while I'm still young.

I'm looking for any and all advice-- anyone ever made a huge leap like this? Is it going to be hard to find work as a teacher in NY? Will I regret it if I move? Will I regret it if I don't move? I feel so torn right now.  

TLDR: I'm torn between moving to NYC and staying where I am one more yea. I have a job I love and an amazing family here, but I am also bored here and feel like my life is passing before my eyes. ",11Nov2017,0
285,"Ok so basically, I've really been in the interest for pursuing an acting career. To be real, this though just came in my mind a few weeks ago, and it's literally all I've been wondering about. I literally have no acting experience, but I KNOW that if I actually take it seriously I might be GOOD at it. And I also have NO IDEA how to get to the acting position.

My mom always sides with me if I'm right. And I don't see what kind of wrong  I'm doing here. So, how do I convince my dad into actually letting me do this? Is there a chance?

286,"My relationship with my stepdad has always been strained due to the fact that he has shown the absolute least affection for me as long as I have known him. It usually came in the form of money or presents, both few and far between.

He put far more effort into punishing me for virtually anything that he felt required discipline. My mother had been infatuated with him and therefore left him as the main authority figure while she worked 12 hour shifts as a dispatcher. 

I got away from the madness by studying hard in school, I kept excellent grades up but before I could apply to universities or scholarships, we lost the house because my stepdad was sued by his ex wife.

I had no choice but to move back with them when they moved into my stepdads parents second home. I skipped college so I could work fast food and move out on my own. I did this for a couple years, and my mother offered me to come live rent free and focus on my schooling. 

My mom at this point is now extremely resentful of my stepfather, and is clinically depressed to include diabetes still working 12 hour shifts as a dispatcher at 48 years old. He doesn't clean, take care of himself or the cars, house etc. 

I said yes, and took care of my mom and the responsibilities but our strong relationship coupled with the fact that my mom now sees through my stepfather has put even more strain on their marriage. 

He 'invited' me to Taco Bell today to tell me that he is ready to divorce my mom (which, financially would kill her because we have no other family to fall back on to) unless she's ready to cook, and clean, and sleep with him again and fix their marriage. He wants me to start working full time so that I may pay him rent while I go to school but he prefers me to leave by January (when my classes start). 

Where should I start? Should I drop out of school and get a job immediately and restart all over again and live on my own?

Should I stay and risk him eventually kicking me and my mother out?

Is there any way I can help my mom out in this situation?

291,"Title says it best, I dont feel comfortable imposing myself on others but I can't take the crushing loneliness. I really want a girlfriend or a normal friend circle but those seem far out of reach.

I can safely say though that in my entire teenage life from middle school up to college where I'm stuck now ive never recieved a single ioi from any girl. I personally think I look fine (a little scrawny but not unhealthy) but my opinion of myself doesnt really mean much when I'm invisible to half the population.

I've never been in the appropriate situation to ask a girl out before. All my female friends are in ltrs or have multiple other fwbs and like I said no girl ever flirts with me in day to day life (especially if I'm at a party or club and there are other hotter guys there). I have no problem conversing with people, being sociable or making jokes but there must be something wrong or inadequate about me since no guys respect me or want to be friends, and girls just act polite or ignore me.

I guess I probably qualify as a nice guy although I don't think I'm entitled to anything from women. I would ask out girl if I thought she wouldnt be receptive because i can imagine how much it must suck to be hit on by a loser guy you have no interest in and I dont want to make anyone's life any worse than it has to be. Maybe I'm too sensitive but it seems like most women get so much attention from people who are much more physically and socially attractive than me that I wouls just be a nuisance and they would be irritated if not offended if I dared to make any kind of move.

This has turned into kind of a rant and I'm sorry, I just hate that my life is 1/4 or more over and I haven't experienced any happiness, satisfaction or accomplishment , with women or in general.

I'm stuck in school studying a subject I hate because I'm not good enough at music to make a career out of it. I've grown to hate most of my hobbies but I still do them because theyre the only things I'm competent at. Every time I try to play sports or go to the gym I make a fool out of myself and feel like I want to die. I hate exercise and athletics so much but I still try because I know ill never be accepted by men or women otherwise, no girl wants someone who cant fight or play sports.

I spend all weekend alone in bed (since none of my friends invite me anywhere and I dont want to have to be that wierd guy that goes and does things alonr or joins new groups without bringing someone along) Maybe ill go to a coffee shop and play on my phone if I'm feeling bold.

I've missed so many developmental milestones my confidence is at an all time low. I hate being such a weak virgin loser but I can't seem to put myself through the pain needed to change. I hate my brain and body for not giving me the willpower to stand up for myself, or go to the gym and NGAF. I hate it that I freeze up in fear whenever someone I know is stronger than me walks by me, I hate that I feel like crying every time I talk to a pretty girl or guy who I know has lived a way more fulfilling life than me and has access to so many social opportunities that I would be thrown out or attacked if I tried to join. I hate being timid and inferior and hopeless.

I want to make a girl happy and I hate that because of how unnatractive my life is I can't do that. I suck value from any social situation I'm in because I'm inexperienced and desperate so I never want to be around people and bring down their good time. I wish I could just check out of society and just go live on an island for while. I want to be someone else but my brain wants me to stay as no-one. Does anyone have any advice or encouraging words. I feel like such a failure of a man for not being able to just force myself to exercise or ask out girls.

People have told me that since I'm 20 I have a lot of time left to change, but its taken a lot of dedication just to reach the mediocre place I am now, I dont know if I possess what I takes to change myself out of being such a loser no matter how much time I have.

298,"TL;DR: Work is moving me to 12-hour shifts in December. In a year's time, I want to go to school full-time but still be working. Should I keep with the job or start looking for a new one?

**Background:** I'm working at a hotel as a front desk agent and I've worked here for less than a year. I just found out today that as of December, management is going to be moving us from 8-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts. Since I've been working here the least amount of time, I get the short end of the stick. I predict I'll only be getting 24-36 hours a week, since I'll be working 8am-8pm, and the general manager and front desk manager will also be working these morning shifts to save money.

They said if I wanted to, I could always work housekeeping on the days that I'm not working to cover the missing hours. Issue is that I have no experience in housekeeping and don't know what the wage is going to look like in that regard, as housekeeping will not be on payroll but instead move to independent contractor status.

**Pros:** In the immediate, all this is not a problem. In terms of housekeeping, I can always earn that experience now, and the management trusts me enough that they'll go easy on me as I start learning the ropes. In general, it means I'll be able to get back onto a healthy sleep schedule, and I'll see my family more often than I do right now. There's also the fact that the GM plans on giving everyone raises, so if I'm included in those raises, I'll probably be making the same as, if not more than I do now.

**Cons:** The issue is in the future. I want to go back to school, actually finish my bachelors and get started on the path to law school. I plan on going to school full time and moving my work to part time to accommodate that. Since I don't know how my school schedule is going to look when I start again, I definitely don't know how my work schedule will look.

**Question:** I know that I'll keep with the job for now, but when time comes for me to go back to school, should I still keep it? Or should I start looking for a new job about a month or two before I start? Should I even stick with the job now if I know that things are going to change that drastically for me in about eight months?",11Nov2017,3
300,"I've been trying to help my girlfriend for almost a year and a half with her parents because they're very abusive towards my girlfriend. Granted, they were this way to all of her siblings and they all turned out messed up. Anyways, my girlfriend's parents always call her a slew of hurtful names including but not limited to: Dumbass, dumb girl, bitch, stupid girl, disgrace, useless, failure, disappointment, lazy, ugly, ridiculous. They consistently tell her to move out and that they hate her yet they won't let her move out which is the confusing part. She would try to move out but she's still underage and has no source of income so this is her only option unfortunately. Not only that but her siblings are just as bad. They believe that because they've been through it, she should ""man up"" and to ""just deal with it."" I've asked them for help but they told me that it's just how they are and that every family is different. I don't know how else to help her. Please help.",11Nov2017,1
301,"I'm not sure how to even begin when it comes to something like this. 

I have a friend that I have been seeing for the last 4-5 months. We had grown really close, and had fooled around and slept in the same bed before, but never had sex. She wanted to take things slow, which I totally understood. Last Wednesday, I decided to take her somewhere romantic, because she is going overseas soon, and the time we had together was limited. 

We had a great day, walking around some mountain trails and just generally wandering around and talking like we always do. One of the things we talked about was some of the sexual hangups she had, the anxiety associated with it, and that she was feeling ready to talk to someone professional about it. It's the most she's opened up about sex to me ever. 

The night was soured a little, because we hit a native bird on the way to dinner, but we wrapped it up in my shirt and took it to a rescue centre. I've never met anyone who loves animals more than her, and it's one of the things I love about her most. Hurting that animal really affected her, so we went to sleep pretty early.

Before we fell asleep, one of the things I remember her saying was how much she appreciated that she didn't feel pressured to move things any more quickly than they were going.

I woke up later that night and she was on her phone looking very angry. We must have only been asleep a couple of hours. I reached out to touch her and she backed away. I asked her if she was okay, and she said she didn't know yet. Obviously I asked her what was wrong. She told me that she woke up to me touching her and that I was jerking off. At first, my initial reaction was disbelief, but I immediately realised she would have no reason to lie about it. I honestly don't remember much of the conversation that happened afterwards. 

I know I tried to apologise and tried to communicate that I wasn't conscious, but I have no idea how that sounded. By the end of it, I told her that I could leave if she wanted me to. She decided to leave herself, and asked me if I was okay to find my own way home (the place was rather remote and she was driving this time). I told her not to worry about me. She said 'thank you' and dashed out. It's the last thing she's said to me since.

I sent about 2 or 3 messages apologising that night and the next morning and tried to call her once. I let her know that I would leave her alone if she didn't want to speak to me. She deleted me off social media the next day, understandably. 

I probably can't begin to comprehend how hurt and betrayed she must feel, but I swear I wasn't conscious. I've been told by girlfriends in the past that I've initiated sexual contact in my sleep before and even had entire conversations I don't remember at all. In retrospect, knowing that we had an unclearly defined sexual relationship, I should have known better. I should have done better. 

I have pretty clear reasons to believe she has told at least one mutual friend, but to be quite honest it doesn't really matter to me who she tells. What makes me feel helpless in this situation, is that while I understand and respect her narrative in the situation, telling other people feels like she will be forever committed to it. 

In other words, how can I ever change the opinion she has of me now? I want to tell her that I love her deeply as a friend. That hurting her is literally the worst thing I think I've ever done. But now she is going to forever believe that I am a creep, which is so antithetical to everything I stand for. Even so, I'm starting to think that there's something wrong with me, because that doesn't change the actual actions that happened.

I've lost someone very important to me, and I don't know how to handle it. I know any idea of romance after something like this happens is destroyed. I just need her to know that I would never do something like that to her consciously, but I don't feel like there is ever going to be a right way or right time to do it without her approaching me first. Should I just let her go? Would she ever even believe me? I don't want to be a source of pain for her forever.

I would really appreciate some advice, especially any female perspective on the situation.",11Nov2017,16
302,"So I am a freshman computer engineering student and I came to the conlcusion that I hate mechanical physics (which I have to take, and am taking) and working with others (why is my grade going down when my teammates mess up, still annoyed) and I have recently realised that I wake up every day and say, oh boy I have calculus today! Yes, you read that right, I enjoy calculus 1 lectures and recitations a lot. I feel happy doing the homeworks (the written ones, not pearson's MML even though I think it's OK) and I find myself wanting to learn even more. I would switch majors but my professors and everyone around me tells me that I should stay on my engineering path due to my coding and logical thinking skills. I know it is possible to graduate as an engineer and become a math professor with the proper graduate school training but honestly I'm concerned about the job market and pay. Every math graduate I have ever met has mediocre pay and is unhappy due to some form of financial struggle. Some are unemployed. So, what should I do? Graduate as an engineer then work my way to become a math professor? Switch majors? Forget about math since it goes downhill and has no job market?  Wait to finish calculus to see if I like it?

Note: I won't switch this year since I want to test out math tutoring and see if I'm cut out to teach.",11Nov2017,3
