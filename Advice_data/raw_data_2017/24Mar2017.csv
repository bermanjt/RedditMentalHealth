0,"Ok here is the story, Basically we were given an exam last week and it was extremely hard, apparently the expected number of students able to get a full score was 2-5, however because the exam was leaked prior to  us taking it ( apparently a student who took it early was ambushed and they took pictures of her exam and passed it around, somehow the VERY same exam was given to us 2 days later)   21 students got full marks - and the teacher knows about this as the school is currently investigating this whole issue.

He is not giving us a retake, i probably performed bellow average and now I can kiss goodbye any ""curve"" that could have redeemed my grade a little bit
I don't know what to do... I feel that it is very VERY unfair, and i'm extremely pissed  but i can't drop the class ...any advice ?
 
EDIT:  low key thinking in the comments there might be some of these 21 scholars, What are the chances ?

Im trying to get my ducks in a row, so when they specifically ask ""Tell us about yourself"" how do I bring up what im currently doing without bring up that i just up and resigned?

3,"Me and my girlfriend are both 16 years old, and she has been talking about driving down to visit this summer (not for the whole summer). Her parents already know about me and are completely okay with her coming down to visit, but I am not really sure how to bring it up to my parents. My parents have really been closed off about a lot of relationship stuff for awhile, and I am sure they won't like the fact that the relationship currently is completely online. I can understand them being concerned about the safeness of this situation and them not accepting the idea of LDRs, but being able to talk about it openly and convince them that it is safe and that we both are serious and mean to make this work would really help both of us out.
Furthermore, it would help out a lot if I could convince them to specifically let her stay here (we would handle food and the other finances of having an extra body in the house), but I feel like that might be stretching it too much, at least for awhile.

However, today something kinda rubbed me the wrong way for some reason, they want me to use my own sewing machine. I guess I kinda expected them to provide me with one, and seeing as how I use my sewing machine to make my own products at home, at $10 an hour idk if I want to wear my machine down for such a low wage.

He often blames it on his undiagnosed (he claims he went to the doctor but with no proof) depression. I am also not comfortable with a lot of sexual activities for personal reasons such as oral and handjobs but I am okay with recieving ""rubbing"" as it was something I was acquainted with before the relationship. I like to take my time easing into things but he always pushes for it. Even when I'm in pain he pushes for it: I have horrible back pain and the days I can't move my SO talks about how horny he is and tries to intitate stuff even when I say no. When we argue he'll go into his nice person mode and say ""I know we both make mistakes, but you're the only woman for me and we can fix things"" which sounds like bs because he never changes only I do (he claims I don't). Thats only a summary of his bs he also yells, swears and belittles me then plays it off like I do it to him only.

I wanted to ask because I'm in the early stages of a relationship and learned that I will be moving a long distance away for a minimum of 4 years (professional school). Asking my new SO to relocate for me feels incredibly unfair, but staying in the same area as my SO would limit my career significantly (though not insurmountably). The relationship is pretty serious, but my thought is: I would know that I was prepared to either stay or to ask my SO to relocate if it didn't feel (to me) like such a huge question to ask -- that is, if I were already certain of my/my SO's answer.

23,"So I lent my boyfriend my debit card because he wanted to buy a 6 pack of beer. I said no at first because I'm trying to save money for a car, but he practically said that he's gonna take my card and get the beer anyways. So I give in and give it to him. He asked for my pin number, so I gave it to him without thinking (I didn't really need to give him my pin number since you don't need to put in the pin number when you use credit) He comes back with beer, gives me my card back. 

Out of habit, I check my bank account. I look at my transactions and I see that it says there has been a withdrawal of money from the ATM today. Ummm... What? I didn't go to an ATM today. Then I realize... My boyfriend had my card.. And said he was just buying beer.. But actually went to the ATM as well to withdrawal money out of my account WITHOUT TELLING ME. He took $100 out.

Now, $100 doesn't seem like a lot. But I am a 19 year old girl with a newborn baby and I have been trying to save money for a used car since my other one broke down. The fact that he took money out of my account without saying a damn thing infuriates me. What infuriates me even more is that he's trying to justify what he did. 

So he works (I'm currently not working, but going back to work soon). He has his own money he can spend. As for me, I have no income coming in and I can't spend much of my money because I'm saving up for a car. He just got his paycheck a week ago (he gets paid every 2 weeks, so he won't get paid for another week). He spent much more than half his paycheck, mostly on shit he didn't need. Including $300 worth of fishing shit. He put $300 in his savings account. 

So anyways, I confronted him and bitched him out. I told him that it is so disrespectful to take my money out of my account without telling me, especially because I'm saving up for a car.

His justification is.... That I'm the one in the wrong. He needs the money for food at work for next week. He says that I'm the asshole because he works and I don't (just had a baby, going back to work soon). He says that he could just pay me back next week when he gets paid. He also said that if he would have asked me for the money, that I would have freaked out and said no. So he just took it without saying anything. WTF? What if I find a car within the next week and need that extra $100? Maybe if he didn't spend his money on stupid shit, he would have his own money to spend. Not to mention, instead of paying to eat out for lunch, he could just pack a lunch. What the fuck man.

 He blames it on me and makes it seem like I'm the one in the wrong. He does this about EVERYTHING. I could tell you a thousand stories where he's done shit like this to me. 

So.. My question is... What should I do? Am I really in the wrong here? He's such a good talker that sometimes he makes me question if I AM wrong. He makes me question my fucking sanity. Help. ",24Mar2017,3

Yes, this is for the bad activity of recreational drugs,b ut I am responsible and he doesn't do it without me (He's only been chillin for like a few months compared to a few years for me) So I had told him Wednesday, and he tells me this week he can't cause of an essay (He could've done the day earlier mind you).

Today (Thursday) I was planning on just staying home, but after class I was hella starving so I went to a quick place to grab some food and ran into a friend and they invited me out for a joint real quick. So I was like sure, there's a car, and plus I had skated to the eatery and was tried af.

The problem with my other friend is he's super clingy and doesn't even want to buy his own shit, so he always just relies on me for weed so that's why I say No to him a lot, cause I got better shit to do.

So long story... still long... he got pissed at me. Obviously I didn't give a fuck cause he was just being an idiot and I just kept telling to stop being a bitch.

41,"I'm a 20 year old college student whose hearing started to taper off around the age of 15. I hear fine when it's a quiet room or one person talking to me, but I have difficulty with sound discrimination (meaning that when there's a lot of background noise I can't hear what another person is saying). Imagine someone mouthing something to you but you just can't make it out except for a few consonants and vowels. 

I believe my hearing has affected me in settings like parties, bars, etc and I constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. I believe this gives off the wrong impression and other people tend to think I'm a bad listener. I mean, I get it, repeating yourself is annoying. If my hearing was better then I genuinely believe I would make a better first impression!

I've developed some techniques to help myself like trying to lip read (very hard) and giving ambiguous answers to someone's questions (also hard and I look like a doofus when I say ""yes"" to a question like ""so do you want pancakes or waffles?""). I then try to piece together what someone has said to me based on context clues, but I still feel like I'm missing something! And asking someone to move somewhere quieter is either not possible or kills the vibe. 

My ear doctor has said that a hearing aid is out of the question because I have excellent hearing outside of these large/ noisy social settings and these aids just amplify everything (no bueño). She suggested I just learn to deal with it and noisy bars will be noisy bars, but I'm hoping Reddit has some answers. I'm not adverse to technology if there's something out there that I or my ear doctor hasn't heard of.

I graduated in 2015 and have been doing part time at a community college, part time work and I just don't understand what I'm doing. College is probably the least interesting thing I can think of doing but in that case what else would I do? I've been struggling to find interests ever since I graduated high school. Then there's work, which is fine. I still do my high school job, working at an ice cream store, but lately I just want to quit. I'm dreading working worse and worse and feel like crying before work. The work is fine and all, I just feel like crap every time I walk in. Most of the freetime I have is spent listening to chill music on my computer, waiting for one of my internet friends to get online so we can talk or play games. I've gone days just waiting for someone to get on but never have the balls to ask them to play anything. I have no friends in real life, I didn't have any in high school. I'm also pretty sure I had at least a minor case of anorexia in high school; it got to the point where I dropped to 90 lbs as a 5 ft 8 in male and desperately wanted to go lower. Nowadays it's the opposite where I feel like I'm overeating constantly. 

If I could do one thing and be guaranteed to be okay, I'd just run away. All I want to do is curl up and listen to music. It lets me escape for a bit and makes me feel alive again.

48,"Hi Reddit.

I'll cut to the chase.

My brother is the first to get married from my siblings and is now in his 2nd year of marriage. Him and his wife live in a separate apartment than our family home and come to visit every weekend.

I love my brother. I care for him and his future and his feelings. I want his marriage to be as successful and prosperous as can be...which is why it frustrates me greatly to notice that his wife may be attracted to me.

I tend to be a very jokey person with my brother and I've always been the funnier one in the family. At the same time I'm shy of women, even in my adult years. His wife tends to notice this. Perhaps that's a turn on for her, as she looks at me often and laughs out loud at my jokes more than anyone in the family.

I can tell my brother acts a little differently towards me when he's with his wife...he most likely realises this and is jealous as he sometimes visually looks irritated. This puts me between a rock and a hard place!

I'm more socially outgoing than he is, so I tend to look more confident and perhaps flirty, but it is in NO WAY my intention to get her attention.

Additionally, my body physique is genuinely more defined as I used to work out in my youth and I'm almost two inches taller than my brother.

These are all factors that seem to get her attention.

How do I turn her off, guys? Should I show my face less? I will do anything to keep my brother and his wife together. I know they love each other, but I don't want to get in the way of that.

For example, yesterday during her lunch break, she was finishing and cleaning up her lunch, when I entered the break room, and we briefly spoke to each other, before she walked out of the room. However, a couple of mins later, she came back saying that her car was too far in the end, and decided that she would bug me instead. When asking her how far her car was, she ended up saying that it wasn't too far, and with her having at least 20 mins left in her lunch break. 

Another example noted, was today when I wore a fanny pack to work, and when she saw it, she started laughing and saying that she wanted to take a picture of me with it. Although I took it as a joke at first, towards the end of the day, she again mentioned that she still wanted to take a picture of me and the fanny pack.

A little about my friend, she's a little high maintenance relationship wise. She's very extroverted and requires constant attention, almost like a puppy haha. My boyfriend and I are very introverted, and we need some time alone after spending a day with her, let alone two weeks! She's also very sensitive, so if I say that I just want to go on this trip with me and my boyfriend, she'll be the type to say okay, and then just mope. 


I don't mind if she comes, but it irks me that she hasn't contributed to any of the planning we're doing. We also want to go to some national parks and do some backpacking, but she's not into that type of thing. And I don't want to be on the trip and hear her complaining. I'm not even sure if she cares that she'll be the third wheel. She has a boyfriend too, but I don't know if he's planning on coming or not. 


I don't know how to bring it up with her. Right now, she's just expecting that I'm going to tell her where to buy her plane ticket. I feel that I will literally break her heart, especially since side note: we're both pharmacy students applying for residency programs and if you're familiar with the match process, she didn't match to a program and has been super depressed about it, you'd think someone died...

Anyway, just venting a little. Any advice is welcome. Thanks!",24Mar2017,17
57,"Okay so I'll try to keep this as short as possible..

I moved out of my parents house as soon as I turned 16 and I have been gone since. For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to leave this state. I have been in the same stupid tiny town since birth and I'm now 20. I want out.

February 2016, my now-fiance and I started dating. I was 4 months pregnant at the time. I told him from the very beginning that I was not staying in this state, I was not raising my child here, I wanted out. 

Fast forward to a few months ago.. We found out how much we would be getting back in taxes. Great, perfect, we can leave! We agreed what state and what area we would go to and I started planning. Job applications, apartment complexes, the whole 9 yards. 

Come to find out, he was lying the whole time. I don't know what he was planning on doing when our money came through, but he said he isn't going anywhere, he wants to stay close to his family.

Now I don't know what to do. Now I'm the bad guy for wanting to go. This is nothing new. I told him this over a year ago, before he ever made the commitment to be with me. Why date a pregnant girl who says she's leaving the state if you don't want to go?

I want to leave. I don't want to be here anymore. He said we will move in a few years, but I feel like it will be the same shit then. I love him, he has been a great father figure to my daughter... But I am so depressed here I can't stand it. If I leave, he's not coming with me. So then I will be a single mom in a strange new place and I will be made out to be a terrible person for ""leaving him"" when he's the one refusing to go, after lying to me for months...

What the hell do I do?",24Mar2017,1

67,"I work for a business unit of a national company.  Corporate sets our budget goals, and we make it happen.

They released some software 1-2 years ago to help business units achieve their budget goals - but it's buggy, and slow.  They've had constant turnover in staff on the corporate team.  I developed a custom SQL solution for our business unit - and we met our goals last fiscal year.  The corporate team was aware of our setup since I started developing it, and took a ""as long as you meet your goals"" stance. Other business units didn't do so good, so they're now reaching out to me for assistance in mirroring our setup.

I reached out to the manager of the corporate team, reminding him of our setup, and the fact that others have asked me for help in setting up something similar for them.  I offered to help fix the software they rolled out (which is SQL based).  He turned down my offer to help, saying they don't have ""capacity for me"", and told me I should be directing others to the software they rolled out - that fixing it is on the horizon for projects this year - and that they'd make sure they have the right people involved in the fixes.

A few days later, another person from the corporate team announced their resignation - probably the 3rd team member to resign in 12 months - out of a team of 6 or 7.

The corporate manager emailed me shortly after the announcement, saying we should revisit our conversation.  And he'd be in contact once the dust settled.

My manager is open to me helping them - but doesn't want to get in the middle.

I now feel bitter because I was initially turned down, and either don't want to help them anymore - or want a raise/bonus if I do help them.  My significant other has advised me that I shouldn't help them unless I have an incentive to.

I need advice on what my options are, and which is the best.  Should I talk to the corporate manager, or turn down his request to talk more?  If I do talk to him, should I try to negotiate a pay raise (I'm already at the high-end of the pay scale for my title)?  Should I be seeking other employment opportunities (such as those that would recognize and want my talent)?  What would you do if you were me?

Just feels boring, I haven't had a break from school in like a year due to summer classes and HW over breaks. Any advice on how to clear my head? ",24Mar2017,2
70,"I met my best friend (let’s call him Nick) around 9 years ago . So we've basically been friends as long as we can both remember. I can't really remember much of our early friendship but I do remember that we hit it off quite well. A year after we became friends I moved into his neighborhood and we started hanging out very often. We became best friends and went to each others's houses pretty much every day. We told each other fucking EVERYTHING and we had clothes and tooth brushes at each other's places too. We were really close. By year two I already knew most of his really big family and he knew most of mine.

It was very nice until he moved, around four years into being best friends. His new house was pretty far, around 20-30 minute car ride. After he moved we kind of lost touch. It didn't help that we were put in separate classes in school that year. I knew we wouldn't completely lose touch because we had built a strong friendship over the past four years. We were still best friends but it was way harder to hang out so we just didn't do it as much.

The years passed and around two years ago, we were put in the same class at school and started being as close as we were before. I had missed him and was really glad because I didn't really have other close friends. 

It all went swiftly until Nick started dating this girl (let’s call her Mary). It was his first girlfriend and he even said he was in love with her. I had nothing against her, but I think she the reason Nick behaves like a dick around me. The thing is that because of the girl, me and Nick were included into this group of around seven people from school. 

All of them very nice and fun people, except for this one guy (let's call him Tony Green). Tony Green was the most obnoxious piece of shit I had ever met. I had known him for a long time (Me and Tony's dads were good friends) and I had always hated him. Like a LOT. 

So, every time I wanted to hang out with Nick I had to hang out with his girlfriend, three other people and Tony fucking Green. It was fucking hell. Every time I saw that asshole I became very fucking annoyed. He was really racist and homophobic, he made fun of my weight (which I've since lost thanks for noticing), and once used Nick’s phone to send pictures of Nick and Mary to the girl's dad. It was even more frustrating that no one but me and Nick noticed how annoying he was.

The group eventually got separated because Tony Green didn't feel like inviting me to his place every week, even though I had been very tolerant of his shit. Then I became kind of depressed because I thought I would never see Nick again. But the next day, Nick came to me with Mary and told me that they hated Tony Green because he excluded me and were no longer part of Tony's group. I immediately started trusting Mary.

Then, the three of us started hanging out. Me, Nick and Mary. I thought it would be fun, but they would constantly make out and do couples stuff in front of me. I felt like a complete third wheel and alone, became depressed and lost around 20 pounds, which made me not fat anymore. Even that was better than Tony Green. Fuck that guy.

After that, three months ago, after two months of dating, Mary broke up with Nick  on their two month anniversary. Me and Nick started drifting apart because he wanted to be all alone. It did not help the Mary the big fat whore started dating an older guy like the next fucking day. Since then he’s been cancelling most of our plans, even though he says he’s completely over Mary. I really missed him and wished that we could hang out more than just twice a month.

Then summer came around and I saw Nick hanging out with Tony Green (fuck that guy) at the beach where we knew I was near by. It didn’t really bother me that he was hanging out with Tony Green, but I didn’t like that I hadn’t seen him in a month. Eventually they stopped hanging out because Tony’s an asshole and Nick knows that.

Because it was so hard to make plans with him without cancelling, I was very excited when he actually came to my house today and told me that he wanted to stay the night. Even though I was kind of pissed at him, we had a pretty fun time. Well that was, until, out of fucking nowhere, he just turned off the movie we were watching, stood up and said, “I’m leaving”. I was very confused. I asked him why, he said that he didn’t want to get home too late. “I thought you were staying the night”, I said. “I guess I’m not any more”.  He then called a taxi and left. He didn’t even say goodbye, just “I’m leaving”. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME IF HE HATES ME? PLS HELP",24Mar2017,1

75,"I had been seeing this guy and it wasn't very many dates, but it all dragged out over 3 months, so it made it feel like more than what it was. He ended up being an ass that only wanted to sleep with me, and one day after ghosting me, I found out he was suddenly dating some girl I already has suspicions he was seeing. I never brought her up to him, because we were in the early stages of going on dates, so...casually dating other people is a thing. Anyway, I thought it was weird how sudden they were official (4 days after our last date). He was narcissistic, manipulative and lied about a lot, so even though it took me a while to get over it, I'm not wishing he was my bf or anything. 

I recently found out she was actually his girlfriend 3 months before we even went on our first date. Gross. I guess my question is for anyone who has been through this...why does it bother me so much that she has NO CLUE her boyfriend was trying (very hard) to sleep with another girl and going on dates?

79,"Ok so I live in a college dorm, with like 50 people per floor. I was taking a shower (an extra long one, like 30 minutes), and as I get out to get my towel, I see someone shakily holding a phone with the camera on it looking through the stall cracks. At me. I am completely naked at this point. I'm a guy. I was too shocked at first to really say anything, I was thinking maybe I was looking at it wrong, but now that I remember it again, it was definitely a camera looking at me.

But, as a junior at a four-year university I find myself going back to my old ways or avoiding some people because either I don't really want to talk to them or I lack financial funds to really meet them, if you understand where I am getting at. To me personally a majority of the people I have met I could say I faked an outgoing personality and I think of these people as mere acquaintances. 

Is it wrong of me to avoid these people like keeping conversations short and somewhat cold. How do I maintain a healthy friendly appearance with a majority of people without going overboard with the friendliness because ultimately I find these relationships pointless that will never be successful in the future.

The problem is, I am stuck in a ""contract"" with someone and I have to stay in CA for another 1.5 years before I can move. I can save up and I estimate a savings of 6-8K from my part-time job and another 20K from my contract. So total is about 28K max.
What steps should I prepare? Which country should I consider? Basically, I'm starting from scratch but with 28K and a car.

98,"Fairly new to this. I've never written about my personal life on the internet before so this is kinda weird, but nevertheless, I'm here for advice. 

Basically, I live at home, and I'm a freelance film editor who's been jumping from project to project for a few years now since graduating high school. So at times work can be somewhat consistent and other times I'm barely scraping to get by. Living at home allows me to not pay so many bills, which then allows me to help build up my portfolio of work little by little in hopes of landing a decent position or creating a business sustainable enough for myself in the near future. One problem: parents are financial train wrecks. Both of my parents own the same business and have no idea how to run it, even though they've been running their own businesses since the 80's but every time they open a new one it ends up closing within just a few years due to not having enough money to pay rent on the business. So 8 businesses later, it's now happening again, this time they're both almost 60 so it looks like this may be the last time. My family and I all live with my grandmother who owns the house I'm currently living in, unfortunately, to help the construction costs on building the business, several loans have been taken out on the house in order to pay the bills. 

So basically, all the money that's been poured into the business has gone to waste, and we're thousands in debt on the house, and folks won't ever stop complaining, blaming, and pointing fingers at each other (and at me) for their financial woes (which has been going on before I was even conceived). I've also helped their business a ton, I've done videos, promoted via Facebook, designed their website, etc.. I'm just unsure if I should continue to help or not. If I don't, my mother will forever shun me and blame me til her end days that I never helped her. If I do help, I feel like it's just beating a dead horse at this point, I just don't see this going anywhere. Considering the place where I live is now being threatened, I'm unsure of what to do.

I know this may seem like a very trivial thing (everyone has financial trouble) but I'm hoping someone can offer some sound advice. Thanks",24Mar2017,2

He was still pretty nice to me considering it all until the very end. But I was a bitch. I have borderline personality disorder probably. I became extremely mad at him by the end and I wrote him a longggggg text. In it, in my rage, I told him that he was ugly, and I was just using him/playing around with him to see how far it would go.

I told him that I lied to him the whole time about being attracted to him and I was just messing with his head for fun. I said I didn't wanna go out in public with him or talk with him (true). I said I was sad he was ending the game now but it was fun while it lasted. I also told him I wouldn't have ever had sex with him if he was the last man on earth. I told him the little we fooled around was awful and he is horrible clumsy and he has no clue how to give oral in bed and I feel sorry for the next girl. I said I needed to do something to keep him on the hook to keep playing him is the only reason I did that. I also said that I was sending my friends live updates on everything I was doing and his responses and we were laughing about how dumb and easy he was. I said that I was seeing other guys the whole time (we were supposedly only seeing each other ) last year. I said ✌️bye, bitch

He just said 
What 
The 
Fuck
✌️
He blocked me pretty much every where even unnecessary places after that. 

Now to be clear, I didn't mean most of it. He probably knows that. He probably knows I was just hurt idk....


I feel so guilty still. This was days ago and I still feel guilt for my words. Just in case he might believe them, I'm thinking writing him a short letter will maybe get him to understand none of it was true. I hate we ended on a bad note. He's not a bad guy overall. He just wasn't for me. Now he thinks I'm evil...I just want to write a letter so he knows I didn't mean it and I'm sorry for all the drama I caused since the beginning.

Tldr;
Guy didn't wanna see me again 
I got angry 
I said horrible things 
Should I write a letter to absolve myself and feel less guilty?

104,"Hi y'all. I'm a (nearly) 17 year old from Mumbai, India. Growing up an introvert, I've never been one to party or engage in much socialising. I've been fortunate to have a closely knit group of friends, paid off by the fact that I'm a funny guy once you get to know me.

Lately, however, I've been questioning the friendships of a few people that once I considered close to me.

One of them is a family friend who we'll call X. Now X was my crush back in grade 6, but I grew out of that phase in grade 7. While we've been friends throughout our years, I've had feelings for her on and off. Here's the thing though: she's a popular girl and I've never been that. Over the years I've invested a lot of time and effort to try to catch up with her, check up on her and the other niceties, because I genuinely care for her. However, she never makes the effort to reciprocate it. In front of our parents she'll always say 'you're my best friend', and the likes. I can't remember one time though that she's called me to hang out or chat. 

I'd always expected that she was different than all the others, but she's proven to me that she's pretty much the same. She's told me her chronicles of being drunk, smoking weed and just doing all the things that I had never expected out of her. It kills me inside to know that but I want to help her change, but everyday that goes by it seems that our friendships dwindles. It always seems that when she's around her bunch of friends (who are mostly two faced users who laugh in their sleeves about almost everyone, including her) she never acknowledges me at all. 

Should I make the sacrifice and cut this friendship  off?

I'm getting at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep at night and there have been no recent changes in my medications mind you I have been on some tylenol 4 this past week from a dental procedure but it has never made me tired so I don't believe that's the cause of this also because this crashing fatigue just started a few days ago out of the blue. I have been having stomach issues and am currently undergoing tests to find why I'm not able to keep solid foods down so I do know part of my weakness is lack of proper nutrients and protein but I am able to eat some and drink some protein drinks for now..I did see the doctor last week and blood work showed signs of anemia and naturally my body is bit low on a some other things such as potassium and vitamins but nothing drastic and I had no fatigue at that time either..I've even had 3 cups of coffee this evening to try snd stay awake and have nodded off twice just typing this out just because it is a key factor I must mention again this has just come on within the past 3 days....just wanted to see if anybody had any experience or input on what may be going on with me...thanks in advance!

112,"Hi guys and gals,
I have constant general anxiety after a health scare a year ago. This has given me some really low days with severe depression.
I'm currently on Mirtazapine to help me sleep (7.5mg).

Thing is I think I have finally figured out why I'm in this state of anxiety. Googling.
I google and research every little piece of detail.
First when this started I convinced myself that I had lung cancer (I'm a smoker) after constantly reading about it and checking symptoms. This was ruled out after a few weeks of worry after an x-ray etc. I have no thoughts about that right now, since the pain in my chest is gone.

However this incident, as I said, left me in a anxiety state. Right now, I research and google how to get rid of anxiety and depression at least a couple of hours a day. 
I read something and sometimes feel better for 5 minutes and then it starts again. However, most of the time I read posts from people that have had anxiety for life and depression forever and that makes me feel incredibly bad. Rinse and repeat.

How do I get myself out of this? I think I REALLY need to stop googling and was wondering if anyone have any experience quitting a ingrained habit? What can I expect? Raised anxiety levels for some time when breaking this vicious cycle?

EDIT: Yes, I've been to the doctors, who as I said, prescribed Mirtazapine to help me sleep. I was also given some benzo for anxiety/panic attacks but haven't touched that yet because I'm scared to death of becoming addicted to them. Also visited a therapist for a few times but that didn't click.",24Mar2017,1
116,"Hi all,

So let me give you the quick basics. I have a best friend of 4 years now who lives in American whilst I'm in Europe. We speak to each other for hours on PS4 while we play games and have gotten so close that we miss each other all the time. The problem is time zones. I'm GMT and she is PST so we can only play in the morning (8-12 for me) to avoid her work clashes and mine. 

So I have been put into a full time job from my part time and I have no choice to do it now thanks to some people who chose it on my behalf so I was left with no choice but to take it. Now as I will be 9-5 and it's 2 hours away to go to work, I have to leave at 7am. Now, that means we can't play/chat in the mornings now. It's growing on me these last few days as I miss her terribly and I don't want to be distant with her as she is my everything to me. Can someone shed some light on ways so we can stay in contact as much as possible or just anything that will keep us close as I feel like I'm losing my best friend and it's putting in a depressive state. Being best friends for years and now all the sudden it's changing is just heartbreaking to me and not one person in my family understands. If you have long distance friendships and can give me advice. Please anything will do.

Thank you guys. ",24Mar2017,2

After the dinner I sent a follow up email expressing my gratitude for their time and consideration. The vice president replied and at the end of the email asked for my current salary.

I don't want to be around them any more at all or be their friend.

I have a friend who never really listens to what I say the first time and I always have to repeat myself.

134,"Background: 

I live in Toronto, Canada. I have a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. I have two options for higher studies: 

1. Graduate Certificate in Communications and Professional Writing at Centennial College in Toronto

2. Master's in Management Sciences at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo.

Now, the MMSc program would seriously boost my engineering degree. It is filled with job prospects. My girlfriend of 2 years also happens to go to the same university so I'd be with her. I've already been accepted here. 

The Graduate Certificate is in Toronto. It lasts a year, and it provides technical writing skills etc which is also great for any undergraduate degree. 

My resume currently has 2+ years of full-time and part time writing experience on it. the Graduate Certificate would seriously complement my work experience. 

I also love writing. Passionate, and furiously so. I don't love engineering nearly as much. 

What I want advice on is this: 

Which do you guys think is a better option for me? They both have their perks. I know I'd love writing more, but I also need to think about career prospects, earning potential, and my relationship, which is quite serious. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated, people &lt;3

Choice between masters in management sciences at a great university and a grad certificate in professional writing at a college near me.

 I am a somewhat popular person (I know most of the ""popular"" kids, and most of the people in my grade level) and im pretty involved in my school. I do cross country, weightlifting and am on the Junior Advisory Board (we do things like set up prom).

146,"So, this is a throwaway account. I've created a major issue. This is real. I desperately need help, because I am so filled with anxiety that I cannot even think anymore. I'm going to need a mature adult who's willing to actually talk this through with me, I have no idea what else to do. This is long, please bear with me. 


All of this started last year, which was my final year of high school. First semester went by fine, my grades were a little lower than normal but nothing to phone home about. Second semester was another story. We can take online classes and I decided to take online English, which is an essential class for graduation. I've always had anxiety and depression, so the final semester of high school and the pressure of university acceptance took a huge toll on me. I slipped up and crashed badly. I did alright in all my classes except English; I almost failed. I hid how badly I was doing from my parents again and again, they had to end up calling my teacher multiple times and it was just a disaster. They've always put great trust in me, because I was an intelligent, independent student who never needed them. My mental health changed everything and I can tell it really rocked their world. I never wanted to disappoint them. Luckily, I managed to pull through the class and graduate. I got accepted to two of my three top schools, by some miracle. I made the choice to attend my local university because I knew my parents wanted me to go there, and I was unsure that I could handle living on my own due to my health. 

Though I've talked to them about it, I do not believe that my parents know how serious my condition is, because they seem to believe that I was just being lazy. And although everything turned out okay last year, I urge you to understand that my final year of high school was a tumultuous time that changed a lot of things. 

Now, for the real problem. That story was primarily background information and insight for what I'm about to tell you. I have not told anyone about this, I've lied to everyone that could possibly come in contact with the truth. I want to keep the truth a secret, because it's best for everyone involved. All I want is what's best for everyone involved. Here we go.

I'm currently enrolled in a science program at my current university. As a science student, I have longer classes and longer weeks than any other major. I also have multiple labs to attend, which are three hours each. It's difficult, but I applied when I was just starting my senior year of high school. It's something that I thought I would excel in and enjoy. For the first few months, I was keeping up but then I started falling, just like last year. When it hit me this time around, it was unimaginably worse than last year. Some days I could barely make it out of bed. Some days I would just sit in the parking lot of the campus for hours, wishing I could make myself go in. 

I'm going to fast forward through some of the ugly parts, because it's a lot of the same story. I was failing all of my classes so I made the tough decision to drop all of them except for one. That way I wasn't a drop out, but then I wouldn't see zero after zero on my transcript. I made this decision out of fear, and it felt like ripping my heart out. The exact same scenario happened again this semester. I fought so hard to prevent it, but it was the best solution  I had, in order to pick up the pieces of myself. 

I've told my parents virtually nothing, I still pretend to go to classes and exams, though not as frequently as an actual student would. First semester, I tried to talk to them about dropping a class early on before I started having any real trouble. They fought against it so adamantly, I cannot tell you some of the things that they said to me. So now, they think that I dropped just one class last semester but nothing else and for the most part, they believed me. 

Education-wise, I planned to sort myself out during the rest of this year, take a few summer school classes and then slowly reintegrate myself at school as a part-time student. Although, I'm not looking for any advice regarding school, I can figure that much out on my own. My problem is my parents. 

My newest, biggest problem occurred when my mom handed me a form last month and asked me to get it signed by the university. She wanted proof of my full-time enrollment. She's not suspicious of me though, she receives benefits and wants the proof for a tax credit. I've been brushing her off since then, telling her I'll get it signed, and so far that's worked for about a month. Today, she asked for a tax slip from the school regarding tuition. Now, she needs something to show to the bank so I can keep receiving a service charge discount. Today, my anxiety is at an all-time high.

So, I'll try to break this down, because you're probably tired of reading this by now. I have no plans to give any of these forms to my mother. I am adamant that my parents remain in the dark, so I can get my life together. I don't even have an idea of how I can continue at this point. I welcome any suggestions. I appreciate all help. 

Please ask questions if you're confused, I will answer all of them. I will also address concerns. For example, the tuition that my parents paid is safe, I received a full refund and it's in my account, which I will only use for school, whether in the summer or next year. I have two jobs right now and I also give them the majority of my pay cheque to pay for my car insurance and other things. 

I love my parents and I've hurt them before, but I don't want that to happen again. I cannot believe what I have allowed to happen, and I am horrified. No one in my life knows anything about this, so I can't turn to them. I just want to know what I can do now. I need a plan. Thank you. ",24Mar2017,2
153,"Context: I currently live in Canada, have dual citizenship, and am planning to move to the States. I have around 20k in student loans here in Canada, and have been on repayment assistance for the last 3 years (haven't been working, been living with a generous friend). I am about to start working full time and hope to be moving within the next 6 months before my next repayment assistance period ends and I have to report my new income.  

Now let me clarify, *no* I do not want to skip out on this debt for the rest of my life. At least not illegally lol. I do however need a short period to get my shit together so I can start making payments. (Or my other option, see further below.)  
My question is, if I move to the US, does the Canadian government have any way of knowing what I am making there? I am hoping to stay on repayment assistance a)while I'm here saving everything I earn for the move and b)at least the first couple months of living in the States while I get my new job, life, and finances set up.  
Now I know here, they can obviously see my income and once the repayment assistance period ends, I won't be eligible to apply again. BUT, if I move withing that time, and once again have technically no Canadian income, am I able to keep applying and receiving RA?  

I have also considered filing for bankruptcy in Canada, once 5 years have passed since my last date of school. Erasing all Canadian debt in one go, while I'll have been able to start over in the US and have a decent credit rating.  
In that case, would I be able to stay on RA for the next 2 years until I can file bankruptcy in Canada?  


All of this confuses me so much and I don't know how to go about any of it! Any advice at all would be helpful.  
Also, I realize that my short explanation of my circumstances does paint me as a scumbag. The last few years of my life have not been pretty and I have done a royally crap job of adulting in any shape or form. *FINALLY* giving myself a hard kick in the ass and changing everything.

It was alright at first, but it's just been getting worse and worse, to the point where I've cut too tight several important work deadlines and my production (im an artist) is right down. 

The only answer I can see is to move out - either on my own, or with another friend, to a different city. But I'm not sure I can afford. Unfortunately I don't think anything like counselling or strict time tabling will help (I've tried the latter and the former has never really helped me). 

Advice?

tldr; I moved back into a house I associate with horrible events and it's affecting my mental health and my business which I rely on to survive. What should I do?",24Mar2017,2
164,"First off, I'm aware how much of a loser I am and am responsible for most of these problems. That being said, any advice is very much appreciated. Here goes my shitty problems. I got a DUI 8 or 9 years ago and was 21 at the time. I was paying off a car loan of 2 and 1/2 years and was a year and half into it. I was still living at home and my dad co-signed on the car loan. He decided to take the car over against my will and then took about 3 years to pay off the final year which ruined my credit. I lost my social life and started drinking and got depressed. I worked steadily and paid rent to my parents and got into a routine of taking public transportation to work and walking to get groceries. Fast forward to today (8years later) Im still at home have little money saved up ($1300) and my company I've been with just sold to some new investors looking to upgrade which is nice but they bought a building about an hour away with no bus routes available and taxi's costing way too much. I need to pay $500 to install a breathalyzer and then $100 every month for 6 months. I need full coverage insurance which is about $400 and I need last and first month upfront. So, just to start getting a car is $1300 before I get a car. I tried applying for a car loan with lending tree and was denied by half a dozen places because I have bad credit. I'm looking at getting a $2.50 raise at my 'new' job with the new investors and I really need this job because I've worked there for 8 years and this is a great opportunity except I don't have a plan to get a car. I can carpool with a friend for the first month but after that it's going to get dicey. Also, my parents are kicking me out and I have no rent history since I've have just paid them directly and there is no record of it. So, Im worried about being homeless and completely lost but still have a chance at a great opportunity with this 'new company'. Any advice on how I can get a place or a car is much needed. I have no one to help me with these things and Im an adult that fucked up his life but still have a slight chance to turn it around before it all goes to hell. Also, Im in Florida and I currently make $16.25 and should be making $18.50 at the end of next month. I have to start at the new building on Monday. Again, any advice is much appreciated.

Since the day i started working this far from my parents, they have been trying to make me come back near  my hometown. Now i have a job offer with a raise (around 60% increment on my current salary). But instead of congratulating me or being happy for me, they are still saying that i should come back near my hometown on the same salary (without any raise) and try to search opportunities there. (There​ are not as many opportunities near my hometown as there are at my current location )

I think I will regret if i don't take this opportunity as it my turn my career around​. But if i don't take my parents advice, i feel I am hurting them and not doing a good job of being their son.

I am in very confused state and not able to sleep due to this. Just want to know from you guys/girls if you ever faced this situation. What did you choose? And how did it turn out?

171,"I'll try explain this as best I can. I bumped into an old friend (A) from school and it came up in conversation that I am saving for a house, she asked how much I had saved and I just said I'm not sure I keep it in separate accounts so I don't count it much.

Here's the kicker, A was taking drugs regularly and was homeless for a while, they're getting back on track now and got a job, so I want to believe she's not like she used to be.

Now another friend (B) who I know is friends with A has messaged me saying you fancy grabbing drinks with me and A.

I was friends with B at school but I've not spoken to them since, they had a very strange personality. They would seem to bully everyone, including myself, but othertimes would be your best friend. Literally in the space of a minute they can go from hitting you to being your friend.

I was scared of them but also liked to hang with them because when they weren't a bully they were a great person.

Now it's been about 4 years since I spoke to B, and out of the blue, B has messaged me saying do you want to grab drinks. We're not in school anymore so any assault I would call the police. But I know both B and A were not exactly well off, and both were involved with drugs. 

I'm really not sure how to handle this, I only have one friend and girlfriend (from school) because of the amount of bullying and shaming I got at school, it's made me very self conscious and scared of human interaction on personal levels (outside of work) so I am very lonely, and constantly depressed. 

I want to have more friends and I feel like this might be a good thing, but after A asking about money then literally 2 days later I get a message about meeting up, I just think they're either going to mug me or try and get money off me.

173,"At the beginning of this year, my boyfriend and I recently moved and started renting out his mother's house with my 5-year-old daughter and my 6-year-old rescue dog, Pixel.  Along with the house came his mother's two 1-year-old Poohuahua dogs, Mia and Mocha.  The first day there one of them peed on my daughter's bed and almost immediately all of her Christmas toys and basically, all of my good Victoria Secret underwear and one bra was destroyed.  I've grown up around dogs so I know puppies can get into everything so I started puppy proofing the house, blocking off access to my daughter's room, making sure my bedroom door stayed closed since my clothes were on the floor and whatnot.  But they will chew anything.  Empty medicine bottles, pens, pencils, my daughters headbands, their plastic water bowl.  They even dragged my dog's bed that she has had for many years out the doggie door into the backyard and just destroyed it.  Everything gets dragged out the doggie door.

Mia also has a tendency to eat and drink until she pukes and always on a spot on the hardwood floor where you will step on it.    They are completely codependent, they both sisters from the same litter.  They are both constantly licking each other in the mouth and Mia picks on Mocha and sometimes hurts her to the point that it makes her yelp.  They both bark all the time and are super skiddish and Mocha yelps before you even touch her.

But I then started to notice that they kept going to the bathroom in their cages.  They can't even hold it overnight, even if they go out right before they are caged for the night.   As I mentioned there is a doggie door but it stays closed as they have chewed the flap completely off so bugs can get into the house when it is not closed, this was done prior to our arrival.  It seemed no matter how much we let them out into the backyard we would still find piles of poo around the house.

I was willing to make it work, to try and train them and do what was needed to fix whatever issues they have until this past week.  I was cleaning our house and had picked up our bedroom so nothing was on the floor so the bedroom door was open.  Boyfriend gets home and finds me in the kitchen cleaning to tell me to clean the shit up off the rug in the hallway and off our king size bed, that I had just stripped the sheets off to wash.  Like what?  Go into our bedroom and sure enough, Mia had jumped up onto the chair to jump up onto our bed to take a spite shit and piss.  

Out of the two, she is the only one that can do this.  I'm done.  Up until now, these dogs have had no training, they have had no time put into them and I'm not sure I have the time or the patience to do it.  My boyfriend wants to keep them but as the days go on I find myself not liking them more and more.  Their cages are in the kitchen, the only place in the house for them so my kitchen smells like dog piss, they do not like my dog and I am not sure how to help them at this point.  I've never dealt with dogs that have had so many issues.  Can anyone give me some sort of direction on how to try and help them?  I don't really want to give them away but then again I can't go on letting them ruin everything I have just to replace it for it to be ruined again.",24Mar2017,2

I own a pet shop. Some days ago, we got robbed and they took all our puppies, among other things. Today, a friend in the local PD, confirmed that they are being sold in a street market across the city. 

He's willing to come with me and ID the dogs, so we can collect them and get them here again. But here's the thing; I don't know what the consequences will be, and I'm sincerely puzzled as to what to do.

Because if I retrieve them and the police catch the people selling them, they are going to, at some point, tell the robbers that we got them back, and they will be looking for retribution. They got my wallet when they robbed us, and even tho it doesn't have my current address, it has my name, obviously. I fear for my life.

I don't know what to do. Please help me out with suggestions.

EDIT: I forgot to say that it was a very violent robbery. Four pieces of shit came in with guns and tied me down a desk while they collected them. So, even if I get a gun or a security guard, I fear that if they come back, it won't be to steal them again, but to kill me, so they very well just follow me in the street and hire someone to make the hit.

184,"So back then in elementary school (fifth grade), i was at home playing with my toy plane and i stopped for a minute and looked at the toy plane. I was thinking.... this is who i want to be, this is what i want to do. Be a pilot.

Fast forward to middle school, i planned to become an Air Force fighter pilot, because of increasingly playing video games of fighter jets and how badass the US Air force is and how cool to be shooting down enemy planes. I dreamed of being a pilot so bad.

Another fast forward to freshman in high school, i joined JROTC (i think there's different branches of JROTC, this is the Army one). I loved it there, learning a lot about the military and words like Alpha, Foxtrot, etc. I had a lot of fun.

At the end of freshman year, i suddenly lost interest of joining the Air Force, i have no idea why, i forgot. In the summer time after freshman year is over, i was down in Destin, Florida. Im in the era of trying to find myself and what is truly my passion and i sort of observed people in Destin (not in a creepy way) and seeing how people are enjoying their life and going to clubs and parties at the beach.

""Man...i would love to have that life"" i was thinking to myself. I wanna be a DJ. 

Back at home, everyday i would go on my parents computer and use a free online ""music-maker"" website. I post songs online and no or little feedback were given. I was not getting a lot of plays on any of my songs (highest was like 120 plays, i used to think that was lot lol). Lost interest in that later on.

Sophomore year, the year that i just dont know lol. My family and i moved to another location in the same state at the end of my sophomore year. I found a job in the summer and started saving up.

Beginning of Junior year, i discovered that i would love to travel and visit all countries in the world and decided i wanted to be either a commercial or airline pilot. I did some research and realized that i need to have some degree (i forgot) to become an airline pilot, and only needed a high school diploma for commercial pilot (i think?). So at the end of Junior year, i saved up to buy an used GTi VW and suddenly i became interested in cars and lost a little interest in becoming a pilot. ALSO at the same time, i went skydiving because i always wanted to do it and the skydivers there offered me a job there (because of how they were impressed of me following proper procedures during skydiving) but i couldn't for many reasons. I loved it and started some research for skydiving careers. 

Beginning of Senior year, my interests went back to traveling and i did some research for ""getting paid while traveling"" and there were not a lot of good opportunities i could pursue. 

And currently, getting at the end of my senior year, i just have no idea anymore. I keep losing and gaining interest because i always get that ""temporary confidence"" when i think i could do something, but i cant. Theres so much i want to do, but im not too sure. College is not for me, i hate to learn and always loses my motivation and courage whenever im in school. I need somebody's serious advice or recommendations. ",24Mar2017,1
186,"So this morning I went for my first dental cleaning of the year, they did the annual x rays  and the dentist said they found a small, very early cavity in tooth #14. It was surprising, because I have had very good teeth all my life, I've only ever had one other cavity and that was in a baby tooth that fell out about a year later.

I haven't had any pain or signs of a cavity, except for some mild sensitivity to cold drinks but that's not unique to that particular tooth. So the scheduled me for a resin  filling in about two weeks. ( with my insurance the co pay will be about $20).

Now, I didn't ask to see it on the x ray (dumb of me maybe) and I didn't really question things until I got home. I read that early cavities might not need fillings, that fluoride treatments and other steps can be taken first. 

What should I do? Get a second opinion? Call the dentist back and ask for alternatives? Or just go through with it?

Like I said, I haven't had many dental issues in my life (aside from the cavity as a kid and having my wisdom teeth removed in my late 20's) so I'm not sure how to address things like these.",24Mar2017,1

189,"When I was younger, I was a bit of an early bloomer. I was as talented as a typical high school freshman when I was only in late elementary, so my parents and teachers and friends told me I was smarter and more creative and talented than other people. This came up with things like poetry, general education stuff, math, science, art. Now, at 19, I'm still about as talented as a high school freshman at all these things. I know this is somewhat common, but it's making me very unmotivated and depressed.

My significant other is a musician, but not super good at writing songs. I USED to be exceptionally good at poetry, so I decided to try writing a song. I tried about 20 different times, but I never got further than 8 lines, usually less, and every time I showed my SO any of them they were changed or rejected. I chalk it up to not knowing enough about music to make things work, but it still doesn't make me want to try writing more songs. This most recent time, I spent 45 minutes or so writing a chorus, and I thought I did a really great job, but I ended up crying when my SO expressed that it wouldn't really work as it was. One line would have to be changed and some others entirely removed.

Let me be clear, of those 20 attempts, some of them went through changes and fixes of my own. I'm not opposed to changing the first draft, but when my SO does it, the songs end up getting changed from what I had originally intended thematically. I try to write about personal feelings and experiences while still being almost universally relatable, but apparently that's not good enough.

I've slowly given up things I used to be passionate about, like drawing and painting, and poetry and story writing, because I wasn't getting any better at them. Don't get me wrong, I've practiced. I was an artist for 10 years of my life if not more, and I got plenty of encouragement and positive reinforcement along the way. I just gave it up one day because I obviously hadn't been improving for a couple years.

As much as I want to keep practicing and get better, everything I try fails to work. I try things over and over again and they never show promise. The only thing I'm actually good at is being a waiter, but that's obviously not something that makes me happy. I don't even have any people skills outside of work. As soon as I clock out I just become a zombie.

I have no reason to be proud of myself, except for the sheer force of will that brought me this far into adulthood and dragged me through depression and suicide attempts. Even then, there have been times I wanted to kill myself but just didn't because I was too lazy to get up and do anything. I don't think this kind of lack of skill is normal, and I don't know what to do to fix it. I've tried exploring different hobbies and fostering different skills and talents, but it's always either too expensive, too time consuming, or just proves to be something I'll never be good at.

I don't really have high standards either, at this point. I would only be happy with mastery 5 or 6 years ago, but now I just want to be even slightly good at something.

We're both super mellow but continued to text. Recently he would say things like, ""wish I was watching the moon with you"", send me hearts etc etc. 

Recently I've noticed I'm always the one to initaite the conversation. We've also never hung out since the first initial hour when we met. 

I really like him but am scared of coming on too strong. What do I do?!? ",24Mar2017,1
199,"Hi Reddit Users,

I am a Hispanic 21 year old. I'm the textbook definition of a ""good girl"". However, my parents still find the need to track me via GPS when I'm not home along with making me message them my every move throughout the day. My mom in particular accuses me of things I haven't done like drugs and having sex. What is the purpose of this? Is there a hidden angle to this I just don't see because in my eyes they're just driving me away. I have had to resort to planning the day I move out along with buying myself a side phone to be able to sleeps knowing that they don't check through my phone that night.

What would you do in my shoes?",24Mar2017,1

Hello!

Heres the story: I'm approaching a corner with a stop sign. I notice a car on the left side of this corner, on the block left of me, parked with its lights on. As soon as I make my right turn, this car starts to pursue me pretty close. As soon I make my turn and im on my block, i turn my right turning signal on again. I was about 3 houses away from mine. I start to break on the 2nd house, I was initially doing 20mph at first anyways. As I make my turn, the other car tried to pass me through right side of me, ignoring parked cars and everything.

My lights were on. I gave ample time to signal a turn. We were both, at one point, doing 15-20mph. But when I made my turn, He sped up at the shoulder of mine and booom. Thing is, I had no insurance. Has anyone else dealt with something like this before? On the police report, the driver listed was an elderly female, but the driver at the time of the incident had to be a 20-30year old black male. He mentioned the car was his friends. Something fishy is going on here.

We started out as really good friends, and we work together often enough but not too much, but lately her problems have been draining on our friendship

she has some severe bipolar issues, and frequently has completely debilitating panic attacks, which I have calmed her down from numerous times

the other night, she had a really bad episode, and started an argument with me after waking me up at around 4:30am when I had work at 6:00am

I realized much too late that she was also pretty cross faded, and she came at me with blazing fists. I'm a shit ton bigger in size though, so I easily grabbed her arms and kind of grappled them behind her back so she couldn't punch me

also much too late I realized the had teeth and was ready to use them, and she did. bent right down and bit the fuck out of my forearm.

she gave me a general half-assed apology, but then told me that she ""didn't remember it happening"" because she was having an episode

in the moment, I wanted to just call the police, but I waited to sleep on it and go to work before I decided what to do.

that was on tuesday. I still don't know what to do. I want to file a report of some kind, and not necessarily pursue any legal shit, I just want it to be known this happened in case she fucks someone else up and they want prior history.

207,"So for a while now I've been wanting to try and learn a creative hobby but I cant find inspiration to make anything.

Ive wanted to learn 3d modelling, Photoshop, Video editing, Drawing, how to code, and even some robotics.

The issue is I never have ideas on what to make so I dont really have a way to learn. 

I have the means to do these things and learn them, i just dont have the Ideas. So what do I do to get ideas or get inspired?

Also other people who have tried these things, what would you suggest I try most? I really liked video editing, what little I did. But idk what to make that isnt just simple cuts and has an actual good end result instead of just trying something just to try it. I want to put it into a project I suppose.

Idk, I feel like im rambling now so I'll stop now before this gets super long.

208,"I work at a small pizza shop that has only been open for just over a year. I started about 9 months ago and they payed me every week, I got a raise after a couple months, and I fell into a pretty good grove. But I guess the money started running out because I statted getting checks that were $100 short here and there with an apology ""Hey man, had to pay the cable"" and they rest of the money later that week or so. Things were fine until a couple of the front oh house people got fired and the manager quit.

I started getting more hours, but the checks kept being hit and miss, and now has basically gotten to $20-$50 every other day or so. This drove me to start having friction with my girlfriend any time I talked about work, but I felt like I was a part of the family there and that I was helping out by being flexable. So I insisted that my better half be more supportive of me working and not getting paid in full.

211,"Hi r/advice!
Im a nineteen year old dude going to high school. I'm currently at a point in my life were I don't have a lot of close friends. I think this is due to a mix of not having the best social skills and not finding too much in common with the people at my school. 

But there are these guys who I used to know back when I was around fifteen. I just found out that they all still meet regularly, and I was told one of them even asked one of my peers what I was doing lately. I go to a school with almost only girls, and I really think having a group of guys to hang out with would make me so much happier than I am now.

So I would love some advice on how to approach them without making it feel all too sudden or forced. I haven't met any of them in years now, so I don't want to come off as too awkward. How does one reconnect with old friends?

Thanks for reading through what I had to say, and any advice would make my day.

212,"Hey everyone! This is my first post here. 

First, let me say, I love animals. I grew up on a farm with lots of animal responsibilities. I know adopting an animal is a forever choice and I treat it as such. 

My husband and I have three animals, 2 cats and a dog. One cat we got as a kitten from my parents' farm, the other cat and dog we adopted as adults. We were not planning on adopting another animal for a number of reasons (financial, upkeep, training, etc). About 6-8 months ago a stray cat showed up outside our house. It was very thin and looked like it had been in a fight or accident. I began to feed it, gave it water, and built it an outside shelter. A few weeks later I realized he didn't have front claws, so we brought him into the garage. It was at that point I took him to the vet to get checked out. We found out he's about 10-12 years old, has a digestive disorder, and has a variety of other health/physical problems. 

He wouldn't use a litter box in the garage, instead he would pee and poop everywhere. Because it got colder we brought him inside and put him in a dog crate with a litter box and food/water while we were gone (8 hours) and overnight (8 hours). We would let him out when we were home and supervise him. He was using the box consistently so we let him roam the house. Well, since then he has begun peeing and pooping in the house. This has been going on for at least 2 months. I put in extra litter boxes, changed litter, cleaned up the messes I found. But, I can't keep up with all the messes. I'm still finding things soaked in pee throughout the house. His care is becoming overwhelming for me. I'm starting to reach my limit because:

-we weren't looking to adopt another animal anyway, but we did because he seemed like he needed help. 
-he doesn't use a litter box unless I follow him around the house and stop him from going on the floor
-he has to take medicine everyday that costs a lot
-he has severe skin allergies, will scratch himself raw, even with the cone of shame on, and then they get infected (then I have to pay for vet trips/antibiotics)
-he's supposed to eat special food which again costs a lot
-our other animals and him don't get along
-I would have to buy diapers, shave him, and change him daily to stop him from going in the house (which I would have to do, because my husband didn't want to keep him in the first place)
-I work full time, go to school part time and I don't have the time to devote to his care

Lately, we've been looking at our options, re-homing (I don't think anyone would take him), shelter, or euthanasia. I've been sick thinking about it. Even now, I'm tearing up because I don't really like any of these options, but I don't know what else to do. He's just too high maintenance. I feel like a failure. 

Are there any other options? I feel like an absolute horrible person for wanting to give him up, but we can't give him what he needs. Am I terrible? Am I a hypocrite? I feel like it. ",24Mar2017,2

216,"So I'm feeling stuck in my life. I'm not even sure advice will help. I'm trying to be as true and honest as I can be with what I feel and what I am... and that has led me to just be at home all day... eating meals and being on my computer. I used to be very outgoing... A lot of the conflict is coming from me not being able to connect with what I love. I don't know what I want, what I love. I keep praying for a vision, for guidance on what to do. I used to have a lot of inspiration. I used to have all these ideas and I want to be in those ideas, following them, but I also realize that it means I have to open myself up to people. 

It means I have to be open to love, and to be vulnerable, and authentic about what I feel and who I am. 

The block for me comes in that I really don't want to do it alone. I want people who have true empathy and true understanding to be with me along the way... feeling what I'm feeling. - and I did to a certain extent - but the problem came that those people were not true in themselves. They were not capable of giving advice. They were not open and allowing the most intimate thoughts and feelings to come to the surface. So, I had guides, but it wasn't the right guides because they weren't there with me 100%. In the moments that mattered, they were gone. 

I live in a very rural area... I've been thinking of moving to a city where I might have more opportunity to meet the right people. 

I also am learning a lot about love... and I feel that the people who could be truly close to me also have to be intimate with me... like sexually... and so I feel very uncomfortable being too close to my parents... and I feel very uncomfortable being too close to people who are not my age. The only people, however, who seem to feel me, and connect with me, are not my age or are my parents.

I have isolated myself from my parents and people who are not my age... but have not come across anyone my age who seems like they could really accompany me, yet. 

I need a good partner, who I can trust, who will really talk and listen. ",24Mar2017,2

221,"Hi, I'm struggling right now. More than I ever have been. Referring to the title it's not me who's got the problem with alcohol, it's my father. Not just alcohol but cocaine. 

Years ago him and my step mother (I don't know my real mother), separated and he moved a few towns over to Hoboken in an apartment. They separated because he'd drink a lot. I stayed with my step mother with my younger brothers. 

I was closer to my dad, I saw him a lot. The drinking didn't stop though. Wasn't every day he got really drunk, some days he'll just have a few and that's it. But at times he'd get really drunk and get nasty. We'd argue and I'd drive back home early. We'd not speak for a few days, he'd apologise and we'd go back to normal until it happened again. 

He's single and got laid off work and hasn't been able to find something new. So he feels worthless. I love him but it's so difficult to deal with. 

We argued last night. Bad. He revealed it's not just alcohol but cocaine. He was shouting at me and even said he's having withdrawals from the coke and he's had alcohol which is why he's being that way but still turning this on me, stating he's not drunk I'm just the bad guy.  I left and he doesn't want to see me again. I can't just cut him out, I love him so very dearly. 

I'm a 24 year old guy but I can't mentally deal with this. I think about suicide. My brain is telling me right now I could do it. Just swallow some pills, lie down and let darkness take me. That's it then. The pain is gone but I am too scared to do it. I don't know why. I've not really got much to live for. My job is shit awful and my step mum doesn't really care much for me. I have my amazing girlfriend who I love with all my heart but she'll get fed up with me eventually having me cry on her over this. She's never shown any signs of this but I feel she will. Everyone does eventually.
