3,"I'm in my final semester of university and will be graduating in a few months. The graduation ceremony is long and will be held quite far from where I live. Most of my friends have parents who are eager to go but I feel like my parents, even if they go will probably just complain about it afterwards. They didn't even come to my high-school graduation. I go to UofT and will be graduating with distinction, and I would think my parents would be proud of me for achieving it all in 4 years too but idk... it really doesn't seem like they care all that much ",23Jan2017,1
4,"Ok so I'm a university student, currently studying finance and business law. I'm posting this because I need to find somewhere to move to that isn't Australia, where I've lived my whole life. 

Don't get me wrong there is a lot to love about this country but at the same time I feel like the country just hates itself. It feels like slowly, in front of me, any form of national pride is just slipping away and is being replaced by this desire for people to self-loathe and argue in circles with others. 

My point is, is there anywhere in the world I could go, that would have job opportunities in the field I've studied and also has a sense of national pride and being united as people rather than nearly everyone having a constant desire to seek reasons for hating your fellow citizens. 

I'll probably get criticism here too but screw it, it's worth a shot. ",23Jan2017,1
5,"It's a long story so I'll try to keep it short.

I approached the health department about some concerns of how they were treating mental health patients, as I worked with supper group and kept hearing troubling stories. A month later I was 'arrested' at my house by 4 police officers who said the hospital said I was a danger to myself. I was roughed up a bit and locked in a van and taken to the psych ward.

They would not listen when I, my GF and friends all told them I was fine and was not crazy or suicidal. They wanted to lock me up for 'at least 2weeks'. Luckily my parents both have psychology degrees and new the right phrasing to challenge their reasons as to why I was there.

I got out, but ended up getting majorly depressed and having some PTSD symptoms.

A formal complaint was made and the health department investigated itself, and cleared itself if any wrong doing. When we reviewed the reports we found that they had made up that I was suicidal and that the complaint I made was a sign of paranoia. Of course we disputed this with all my friends coming forward and me even getting several letters from independent private psychologist saying I was fine, but they ignored this. 

Meanwhile the resulting stress and depression from the situation and all the aftermath really took a toll on me. I had to go part time at work then quit altogether. I got incredibly down and got about a year couldn't really function enough to hold a proper job. The irony is not lost on me! All the time too we were fighting the system, getting mental health review boards and ombudsmand to look into it, but it all came back to this one thing: ""the hospital has records and you don't"". Of course the records aren't true, but that just plays into their accusations of me being paranoid. I can't challenge that without it actually strengthening what they're accusing me of.

Lawyers won't touch the case - simply, I've got no proof of my mental state that day I made the complaint, but the hospital does. 

Now I'm out of options. It's been 2 years of fighting and I'm hugely depressed and exhausted and broke. They've won.

How can I put this in my past and move on knowing that someone did something horrible to me and I couldn't stop them and that they might do it again to me or someone else? How can I forget it when I still have to deal with the lasting illnesses from it?",23Jan2017,1
7,"I feel like I've lost control of my life, and I'm wasting a great deal of my time.  This past month, I had winter break, meaning that I had the greater part of a month off, every day, all winter.  While I did travel and spend time with family, I spent most of my time doing nothing.  Playing video games, a little programming and writing and art, but mainly nothing.

I understand a month in time is huge.  I could do anything, hell, I could have travelled halfway across the world.  I mean I don't have money, but I could have made an opportunity or something.  I'm going back to school now, but just honestly I need to know:

How do I make my time count?  I feel like my interests spread me so thin that I'm good at everything, great at nothing, and as a result do nothing.  What should I be doing with my life, to give it purpose, to make sure the days don't go by with me doing nothing?

How do I actually do something with my life?",23Jan2017,1
10,"My brother's ex girlfriend (who still keeps in contact with me for various reasons, I'm 22) has just told me that he has been drinking, heavily, recently. she said he had drank almost an entire handle of 70 proof whiskey in the span of about 24 hours.

He has a job that involves moving, and thus driving a moving van, and he lives a few states away (About 4 hours) from our parents. 

I'm not sure if we should contact police (as this may result in consequences for him) or my parents (they will be worried sick and I'm not sure what they can even really do since he is hours away and my mother works full time, and my father is about 14 hours away). My step father is about 4 hours away himself and is retired, I was thinking maybe having him go up there to see what's going on is the right choice?

15,"This past Monday I got a boil cut out of me, the wound is deep. They put gauze in it then and removed it Thursday. 

I'm taking anti-biotics and everything. But do I change the dressing and bandage every day, every other day? When do I need to stop? The wound is very very deep, getting the boil out was really painful.

As I was leaving the hospital they gave me some bandages end peroxide, so I've been cleaning the wound with that, putting neosporin on the wound and bandaging it up.

So.. how long do I need to do all that?",23Jan2017,1
16,"Conversing with others never came easily to me, and it still doesn't. I recently returned from holiday and while I was there I met a lot of likeable people, one of whom I have developed an attraction for, of sorts. We have many things in common and regularly text each other, but as of late I've noticed that our conversations are seemingly becoming shorter and shorter as we run out of things to say. This alone is a worrying thought, and the next possible time i'll be able to see her will be in a whole years time, this is even more concerning. In a years time will i have accidentally scared her away or not? I hope not. How do I keep her interested and keep the conversation flowing? Another thing i've noticed is, the majority of the time when a conversation starts, it has been because I started it; and to be quite honest with you, i'm tired of always being the instigator of the conversation. Should I listen to these tell-tale signs? I want to keep some sort of connection with her even if it leads no were and we just stay friends, I enjoy talking to her and from what I could tell from when I was with her, she enjoyed spending time with me as well. So in conclusion, tell me how to keep a connection. Thank you for reading and your help.",23Jan2017,1

19,"Good day! I was assigned to do a project to conduct an interview with someone from outside the United States. The purpose of the project is to get to understand someone else's culture better while teaching and sharing with them something about your culture. I am expected to ask a minimum of 15 to 20 questions to someone from Turkey and the thing is, I am just so incredibly socially awkward that I don't know what to do.

20,"I have a friend (19 years old) that I am trying to assist with getting their paperwork. They were able to get their social security card, but it's almost impossible to get any other form of ID with just that.

If I try to help them get a state ID, they need a birth certificate and proof of residency (utility bill, paycheck stub, etc). 

If I try to help them get their birth certificate, they require other forms of identity such as a deposit check slip, utility bill, automobile registration, etc - none of which they have. 

Is there anyway to go about this in a better way? I am really not sure what to do. I feel bad, but I had the privilege of having a parent who was really hands on and did everything for me. 

If we work with the vital records of the state they were born in, their turnaround time is 2 months (making things more difficult is that they were born in a different state)... Really not sure what to do. 

I appreciate your input and any advice. Thanks. Sorry for the throwaway account.


Sob story:  Their dad is basically holding on to all their information and will not give up anything. He is threatening to kick them out of the house. The other day, he came drunk and physically kicked them, cops came but nothing happened - I only have one side of the story, unfortunately. My friend wants to leave, but has no paperwork which is making everything difficult. They have a friend whose parents have let them stay at their house before and would welcome them again. Edit: Also the issue is if they leave now, the birth certificate would only go to current address it seems.

22,"Usually some time Sunday night I realize tomorrow's Monday and think ""Ugh, gotta wake up early for work and leave my dog and drive there and then try to fit everything I want to do in the evening.""

I don't dislike my job, but I'm the type that loves my personal life and doing my hobbies.  Of course on weekends, I get to do them uninterrupted for the most part.

I think part of what I could do is think about things I look forward to each week.  For example, on Wednesdays, there are new episodes of Vikings that my girlfriend and I always watch.  But of course, those will run out at some point.  But it's a start.

23,"My parents always wanted me to go to law school.  I go to a top ten American law school, and then pay for all of it.  They are relatively well off.

I have come to learn that I do not really like law.  A significant majority of people in the profession seem to be stressed.  A lot of people are sleazy.  A lot of people are obsessed with alcohol.  A lot of people are egotistical.  And on top of all that, I really don't like the idea of reading and writing all day for a living.

I am going to get the degree with zero debt, and I might as well finish it because I only have about a year left.  But I don't know if I really want to work at a law firm, especially one with 14 hour days.  Everyone around me is telling me I should go into the profession, but I am just not sure.

I really would like advice from people who are not in my field and are on the outside.  What other careers are open to me at this point?  When I graduate I will be 26 years old and have zero debt.  My parents likely wouldn't pay for any further education, but there is a possibility they would pay for an MBA.

I also know there is a large public perception against attorneys, and I really am staring to understand why during law school.  My personality really doesn't fit this profession, and I would rather have a career where I can make a real difference or do something very interesting.

24,"I wrote a long post and lost it but the gist is that a teenaged boy climbed a tree in the courtyard behind our condo and was looking at me in the bathroom.  It was daytime at least.  He had his phone out pointed at the bathroom but I'm not sure if he was filming. 

The bathroom has a small window with no curtains but is blocked by a 6 to 7 foot fence so there is no way to see in at ground level.  I did buy window film a few weeks ago just the same but just haven't put it up yet.  I will do it ASAP.

When I saw this kid I screamed at my boyfriend who was upstairs and the guy left.  My boyfriend went out to supposedly check the mail but I know he was looking for the guy.  He saw what direction he walked off toward.

We rent so I don't think we can put up cameras or motion detectors or anything.  

I'm used to my BF being home with me most of the time but that's about to change. I work from home also.  

I didn't call the police because I felt foolish not having put up the window film yet.

Any advice on being and feeling safe?  We do not want a gun in the house but are open to almost anything else.

So his plan is to get a fake diagnosis for anxiety &amp; depression to be eligible to have a dog (which irritates me as someone with social anxiety). The issue arises from him not being in the room most of the time, so I will have to take care of the dog the most which is not something I want to deal with especially the dog having to use the restroom when we are all in class or something and the dog shits on the floor.

31,"So, let me start off by saying my husband is a completely giving and wonderful person.

My main issue: he's just not a sexually active as me. My secondary issue: he BLOWS OFF my advances.

We do it, on average, 2 times a week, with me starting it 75% of the time. I understand our activity is above average.

However, sometimes he can play video games for hours on end. (cough, Overwatch.) Though I am a gamer as well, normally playing RPGs, I want some sort of attention at times after working a long shift and commuting a long commute.

I'll sometimes PM him a sexy message like, ""Baby if I ride you tonight will you get all hot and heavy and tell me you love me?"" ... this often goes ignored, or gets a response like ""Sure babe"" (...not quite something you can continue the dirty talk with.)

Even at work if I message him something sexy I'm often ignored though if I asked if he wants pizza for dinner I get a response quite quickly.

I understand if he's stressed at work and cannot ""get in the mood"", but when he's gaming I have no idea why he's so freaking moot. I've already given up with the idea of kinky sex and we do it vanilla af every time for his well being, I'm wondering if I'm being selfish or if he's unnaturally bland?

Note: I just stopped taking Zoloft and my drive, which was suppressed while on it, is coming back. I have a fear being more sexual will just continue to cause issues. What should I do, other than try and cater to his lower sex drive?",23Jan2017,1

I would as questions about the persons life, aspirations, health issues, background and the like in order to get an insight on the very real struggles they face. I would possibly like to start a non-profit humanitarian blog and charity to make similar trips and hopefully grow to make a difference. What I am asking is do you guys think this is exploitation?

33,"23F I was in and out of abusive relationships for years during college. I have a lot of trauma behind me. I've been seeing multiple doctors about my mental health since 2011. I was in outpatient in October 2016  for a few weeks. I had gotten to a point where I was so angry with myself for seeking love to the point where I allowed myself to get abused over and over again. And I realized I had been thinking purely emotionally. After outpatient, I decided I wasn't going to have sex/be in another relationship for an indeterminate amount of time. At least until I was able to get another degree, move out of my folks' place, etc. Yesterday I ""relapsed"" and had sex with a girl I've been completely platonic with since November. Today I feel so guilty and stupid for allowing myself to do that to myself. And I guess I realized that I've been almost strictly acting on logical reasoning since outpatient. Like there's no intermediate for me. It's either stay safe and don't be emotional or be emotional and feel anxious/depressed/suicidal. It just feels so unfair to me that I can't balance these things. I'm so impatient for me to be the person I want to be. And I see other people managing their relationships/sex lives with their own lives. And I don't know why I can't have that. I love with my folks right now. And my mother is very emotionally abusive. And I don't have the means to leave or be on my own. I just feel so fucked up right now. And trapped. If I don't perform well in classes and if I can't be functional I will not be able to get my second degree to move out. And if I can't move out, I don't feel like I can heal properly.

I go about my life doing the best I can and going places (I save up to do what I can to experience new things, it's not much but I give up buying new things or the latest styles). But it gets lonely, and I want friends to come with me. But either, they can't afford it (it could be a cheap dinner downtown or just one drink at a bar and they seem to be bad with money) or I ask THEM what they want to do but they just want to stay home and mope about nothing having money and being bored.

My female pastor and I have been pretty close since we met, and I got to know her family very well too. Over time, I eventually became a bit too obsessed with her, and I developed a crush on her. This is a problem within itself--it has brought so many problems into my life. Anyways, long story short, during a mission trip, I walked in on her using the bathroom almost a year into having a crush on her, and I freaked out. She apparently had figured out that I had had a crush on her, and so rushed to comfort me following the situation. That moment of comfort wasn't really enough to fix what felt like hell on earth to me. Later that night, when I had momentarily left the room to grab something with a friend, she messaged me ""I hope you know that there's nothing you can do to make me not like you :)"" This got me very emotional, as I assumed that she somehow had figured out about the crush. (I did not know that she had actually figured out at that point until about six months later.) I went over to her, hugged her, and started crying. During this hug, she kissed me on the cheek. Now, I know that she meant nothing sexual by this. But I have established with a few other people at my church that she can be incredibly manipulative at times. Was she wrong to kiss me on the cheek if she knew the way that I felt about her? Especially considering that she was a pastor, and she had full knowledge of the fact that I was in too deep?

I've lived in terrible living conditions for all my life and I have not developed any health issues because of it. They do smoke and I do feel the secondhand smoke has had an impact on my lungs. 

They take care of me and love me but I feel neglected in some way, emotionally, maybe mentally. They don't seem open minded, a couple months ago I was going through some tough personal things and I told my mom that I was pretty depressed. She said ""You're so young, nothing in your life is bad enough to be depressed over, it's all in your head."" Yeah, that's the problem. It is my head.

I'd like for things to get better but I have no ideas on how to do it myself other than contact the police, but I don't want to do that. They'll come and arrest my parents. Then they'll get child services involved and I'll have to get taken away, I'll probably lose my possessions, and my entire family will hate me for getting them arrested. They'll disown me.

I love my parents and they love me but I know that this isn't right. I don't know what to do, I want things to get better but I don't want to lose my family and possessions in the process. What do I do?",23Jan2017,47
52,"I'm putting this post up because I have such a passion for the west and actually visited for the first time back in march. I'm a 22 yr old male that has a bachelors degree in marketing and business administration. I read a couple other places that the hardest part is actually committing to the move and  ""just do it"". I however am worried about financial implications. I don't have any money saved up, I'm currently starting a new job, I have loan payments which have just started and maybe $1,000 in credit card debt. I want to save up money and pay my credit cards off and even have money before I move. I was thinking about having $5,000 before I committed to the move. Another thing that scares me is that I've read things that have said ""oh I just need to save up the money"" and then the move never happens. I just don't want to be out there broke essentially and living on the streets. 

This is something I'm really serious about and am aware of the challenges that I will face. I don't know anyone out in California. I just want to know if any of you guys have advice as to how I can achieve this.",23Jan2017,2
53,"My issue is I'm caught in a weird cycle. I've recently put on enough excess weight to be technically overweight (long story but I let it happen) and since I've never had this problem before - always been fairly petite &amp; healthy weight - I didn't know how it would affect me. I'm on the autism spectrum and have had sensory problems with clothing my whole life; since I was a kid. I've learned to manage any issues which usually means choosing clothes that don't bother me sensation-wise. 

Now, however, I've put on excess fat in mostly my midsection area and the feeling of clothing touching it at all drives me up a wall. I feel like I'm being slowly driven insane no matter how I try to ignore it. I've determined the best &amp; healthiest thing to do (mentally and physically) would be to lose the weight/tone my abdominal area/whatever. I've never needed to lose weight before and I feel so clueless. I fear eating and being hungry. (Eating disorder has been brought up but my therapist is aware - I see one for depression already &amp; keep her updated) 

On the bright side, I start a new job on Tuesday and the only way I've gotten myself to exercise regularly is through a routine based on my work schedule. Sadly I don't know how my commute will be yet, but once I do I can get a regular workout routine going. 

In the meantime, since this is such a constant problem I want to learn how to eat better so I can lose this even faster. However, the ASD affects that as well - it's really hard for me to find food textures I can tolerate eating and therefore I eat very little variety. Flavor is my enemy - most flavors are too extreme to me and I'd much prefer what most people consider ""bland"" food. If I could eat the same tolerable bland food every day forever that would be great, but nutrition is about variety. 

I have Hashimoto's disease and recently got in to a new endocrinologist since my move, and he referred me to a dietitian (waiting on them for that appointment). Maybe the dietitian's help + regular exercise will be the most effective solution to my problem; I hope so! 

But in the meantime; what do I do to fight the horrible sensation of fat spilling all over my clothes 24/7? My usual solution is to smash it in, which never works. 

TL;DR: My abdominal fat is driving my autism spectrum brain into insanity. How to ignore it while I work on (healthily) losing the fat? ",23Jan2017,1

56,"Not really paranoid or whatever, but need advice on:

1. how to kinda calm down?

2. how to live my days like normal days?

3. how to avoid infection?

4. if detected (dormant) how to avoid disease?

The facts are below:


&amp;nbsp;

Not from USA here. So, I found myself in odd urgent briefing where my boss told me and few others, that there's a **person in our office identified with TB case roughly 2 weeks ago.** Boss wont tell us who.


&amp;nbsp;

So, I'm on mandatory TB screening now, but it could take weeks for my employer to organize. So I think I'd just go ahead to the clinic and pay with my money since I have a quite a story about my lung.


&amp;nbsp;

I have a history of **long childhood asthma**. Like I had it almost every year for several months until I was 23 yo. After that it occurred only if I'm exposed to massive allergen (dust, stupid funny smells &amp; humid air).


&amp;nbsp;

And I was also a **heavy smoker** from 12 yo. Ended when Im 22 yo, but became a social smoker. Once to thrice a year, but like 1-2 pack a time. I smoke less than 3 times past 6 years, none in past 2 years.


&amp;nbsp;


Also when I was 22 yo, I had this **very ugly picture of my lung X-Ray, probably something like bronchitis**. But, that 22 yo me is more than 10 years ago. Plus, I had TB check several times in past 6 years. So safe to say I've been quite healthy these recent years.

59,"I moved to New York in August because it was my dream. I was going to college but after a pretty terrible first semester, I didn't go back because I'd like to explore my passions a bit more before settling into a program. 

I thought that all would be well and, at the behest of my parents I left for three weeks. I came back two weeks ago and applied to at least a hundred different jobs. I got three interviews the first week, one last week. I'm still waiting to hear back from one company but all of the others have told me that I have no retail experience (both of the jobs that I'd previously held were in assistant or secretarial-type positions) and that I need some. However, if no one will hire me without experience, how can I get experience?

Anyway, I can pay my rent through February. I'd have to give up my apartment because I'd have to use the deposit for the month of March and leave. I'm terrified of what might happen. 

The stress of the situation is compounded further because I have never been happier. In my teenage years especially, I struggled with anxiety and depression, often considering suicide and self-mutilation. I generally didn't have a life and stayed in all the time despite having otherwise healthy social relationships. I was a recluse. I don't want to return to that life but New York is the only place that it can work for me at this point in my life. 

I am unsure of what to do. Should I start looking towards giving up on my dream and my life as it is and move back home to be miserable with my parents? Is it too much of a risk to stay? ",23Jan2017,1
60,"A bit of backstory: my dad has been employed in the shipping industry in some form since he was 18 so this is coming as a bit of a shock to him when his last fixed contract expired. His last few jobs have been projects based in Australia in the oil and gas industry.

We're based in NZ but he's looking globally as he'll take almost any job at this stage. He was a captain of cargo ships when we lived in Ukraine (19 years ago) and has renewed his certs, though now he's told he can only start at a lower rank and he's too old for it.

62,"Hello to anyone who is willing to read my extremely long and drawn-out post.  I must apologize for the length in advance as I have never been very succinct when it comes to putting my thoughts to words.  It has always been a skill that I have found myself lacking, but at this point I am so hopeless and lost in my day-to-day existence that I have to at least try before all the will to live is completely lost.

I go by Barty online and I am 27 years old.  I suffer daily from bi-polar related depression and crippling anxiety to even the smallest daily tasks.  Things like checking out at a grocery store by myself is such a terrifying experience that I often hesitate for long periods of time before I can even approach the check-out lines.  I constantly have to check the amount of money in my pocket to spare myself the embarrassment of holding up a line and annoying all of the people behind me.  My short term memory is pretty much zero and I regularly forget what I am doing while I am still in the middle of doing it.  My long term memory however is very strong.

I have also suffered from persistent headaches for all of my life.  I can usually expect to spend at least a few days a week in bed all day with a pounding in one eye that reminds me of the way Rambi the Rhino would slam enemies back in the original Donkey Kong Country game.  Imagine a drum beat that is pretty much synced with your heartbeat behind one of your eyes.  The pain can range from a dull annoyance all the way to what I would describe as suicidal pain.  Pain so extreme that death seems more like a pleasant release than something to be feared.

My upbringing and life from childhood was as perfect as one could expect.  I grew up a very happy and healthy child although I began to suffer from depression and mood swings from about Jr. High school and onwards.  I gained a lot of weight, weighing in at 250 pounds by the 8th grade and was well over 300 pounds by the time I graduated high school.  The depression often caused me to not be able to get out of bed and into school on many occasions.  This caused a lot of fighting with my mother who couldn't understand why it was always such a struggle to get me to go to school.  The constant headaches didn't help either.  Regardless of my awful attendance records, I still graduated with high honors and moved directly into an associates degree program within weeks of my high school graduation.

While I was in my last year of high school, my mother moved out of state and I moved in with my grandmother to continue my education.  Things changed quickly however because my mother was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer while I was in the last few months of college.  She moved back in with me and my grandmother and began the painful and sickening experience that is chemotherapy.  She became far too sick to work and eventually was accepted for disability which allowed us to survive, albeit barely.  We eventually all left the state to bring my family together with my sister who is ten years older than me and lived in another state.  My mother wanted to be as close to her children as possible while she went through the experience that is cancer treatment.

I graduated with my associates degree in an IT related program two years after my high school graduation.  I graduated with the highest possible honors with an A grade in every single class from the beginning to the end.  I set records on all of my tests and because I had such an easy time with the material, spent most of my in-class time helping my peers succeed with me.  I began an unpaid internship with a PC repair company around six months before I graduated hoping to add some work experience to my portfolio.  This is where my story begins the slow decline to where I am today.

My experience with the internship was not good to say the least.  I was beginning to feel the effects of anxiety on me as I attempted to become the kind of hard worker that my mother always was.  My ""mentor"" in this internship spent the majority of our time together making fun of me, regularly exclaiming that he was surprised ""how little college teaches people nowadays.""  My mentor was extremely knowledgeable about everything to do with computers and had an extensive history working with them.  I truly desired to obtain all of the knowledge I possibly could from him but was constantly put to work doing the most elementary of jobs and then being mocked at how poorly I could do it.  It was a heartbreaking experience and I lasted six months with it until I finally got too fed up to continue.  At the end of it all, I felt I had learned absolutely nothing and simply kept it on my resume for a couple of years.  Six months of life completely wasted and with no reward to show for it.  This job caused me to completely reconsider my IT background and after a few years of failing to obtain an IT related career, I completely gave up on everything related to IT.

I put in applications to hundreds of different places after leaving my internship.  My state was one of the worst in the United States for unemployment so unsurprisingly, with little to no work experience, I was unable to land a job.  Attempting to break into IT without at least some experience under your belt leads to nothing but frustration.  Any company that called me back after my application interviewed me at least twice, with some of them giving me third or fourth interviews but I always ended up rejected in the end.  Unable to find work, I sank further into depression as I began to feel like even more of a failure to my sick mother than I had already felt in the years prior.  No matter what I achieved or how I excelled, I always felt like a failure.  Being over 350 pounds at this point didn't help either.

My anxiety started spreading further into the recesses of my brain, stopping me from even doing simple tasks.  I didn't get my driver's license until I was 22 years old and I have not driven a vehicle a single time since I received it.  Driving to me feels like I am constantly overloaded with too much to pay attention to and everything around me just blurs.  I can't pay attention to my mirrors, I constantly find myself glued to my speedometer, and every time I have to change lanes or make a turn I find myself hesitating to the point of it being dangerous for me to even be on the road.  Being unable to drive keeps me home all of the time and trapped inside of my own head which is its own special kind of torture.

I eventually found seasonal work at a local retailer but was laid-off as soon as that seasonal period ended.  I have not worked in any capacity since then which would make me currently unemployed for a period of 5 years.  I didn't spend all this time on nothing however.

I eventually had a breakup with the girl I had been in a relationship with for over 5 years.  I looked in the mirror shortly after and decided that I was tired of being fat.  I don't know what got into me but I began a calorie restricted diet and stuck to it without fail or exception for an entire year.  I quickly dropped from 350+ pounds to the 200s.  Three years later, I weighed 160 pounds and was the healthiest I had ever been.  I finally could go out in public and feel normal instead of like I was my own planet.  For a time I found some temporary happiness.  Like everything else though, it didn't last.  While I have kept most of the weight off to this present day, the happiness faded and loneliness took its place.

My mother's condition has become much worse in the last year.  While the cancer is seemingly under control, she injured her back doing a job where she would clean apartments in order for us to have enough money to get by on.  She currently has two disks out of alignment in her back along with a pinched nerve.  This means she spends her days in bed in agonizing pain.  Seeing her suffer from this on top of the poison she has to take to battle the cancer is affecting me in a huge way.  I worry about her every second of every day since she is the most important person in my life.  I still live with my mother and grandmother and without their support for my life I would have committed suicide long ago from my despair.  But with my mother suffering the way she is and my grandmother getting close to her 80's now, I know they won't be around for much longer and I am completely incapable of even taking care of myself adequately.

I know that once they die, my life is going to be in jeopardy.  With no income, I can't afford basics such as food, clothing, and shelter.  I constantly worry about what my life is going to become once they are gone.  I feel hopeless and scared and regularly think that the only thing that can happen to me once they are gone is eventual starvation and death.  I have no family left that I am close to and I would never want to burden anyone else the way I have burdened my family.  I spend several nights a week crying for hours until I eventually cry myself to sleep.  Other nights are simply spent inside of my head thinking of different ways I may be able to extend my life beyond the life of my family.  I am never able to sleep when I want to as I have struggled with sleeping my entire life as well.  That means hours spent in bed being tortured inside of my own head.

From my admittedly biased perspective, it seems like my life is nearing an end.  I have lost 10 pounds in just the last two weeks because I can't motivate myself to bother eating since it seems like nourishing myself is only spreading my pain over a longer period of time.  I find myself wanting to reach out to friends that I feel are tired of trying to help me through my mental struggles.

I deleted my social media accounts and cut off contact with anyone besides my closest friends in 2015.  I've spent years with nobody except my close family and now with my mother being in such terrible shape, I feel more alone than ever.  I have no friends where I live and no longer feel close to any of my friends from back home, even my buddy who has been my best friend since we were both in the 4th grade.  Not to mention, even the thought of interacting with new people gives me a panic attack even though my personality has always been extroverted and I always was surrounded by a huge network of friends in my school days.

Any hope that was once inside of me has died and now I just go through the basic motions for survival during the days of the week I manage to get out of bed.  Where can I possibly go from here?  I desire nothing more than to help my mother get the care she needs but we're so poor we just can't afford to do anything thanks in no small part to the amount of resources that get wasted on me being completely useless.

I know this post doesn't have a great flow and I jump around quite a bit.  I'm writing this tonight because I was feeling so angry and upset inside that I was writhing in agony in my bed unable to cope with how I was feeling.  I figure that maybe someone out there might have some advice that has been through the same kind of things I am fighting now.

Even thinking about submitting this post is causing me to shake.  It hurts terribly to have people judge you and it is so scary putting your story out there for other people to see.  It took several months for me to work up the courage to post this but I am fed up to the point where the fear can no longer stop me from doing it.

TLDR: I am a 27 year old with bi-polar who struggles to even function on a basic level due to bi-polar depression and crippling anxiety.  My mother is suffering daily from cancer and back problems that leave her bedridden but she is also the one who supports me.  How will I survive when she dies if I can't work to support myself due my mental struggles?

65,"This whole situation is a bit odd, but I'll do my best to explain. I apologize that this turned into such a long post. 

I had recently met someone on a dating app. We hit it off instantly and talked/texted all day for the past two weeks. We got along great and formed a connection very quickly. I'm a 25yo single mother and only started dipping my toes in the dating pool a couple months ago, so I held off on making plans for us to meet (he was completely understanding and a total gentleman about it, which was very refreshing and made me like him even more). 

Last Wednesday, we made plans for today (Sunday) for us to go to dinner together. The last time we spoke was Friday evening. We were texting all day and he stopped replying around 8 in the evening. I assumed he fell asleep and thought nothing of it. I didn't hear from him yesterday (Saturday), which was abnormal so I sent him a text around 9:30pm saying ""Hey sweetie. Just wanted to make sure everything's okay."" I never got a response, and I found out this evening that he passed away yesterday afternoon after losing control of his motorcycle at a high speed. 

I have been very conflicted in my emotions since finding out about his passing. Of course I'm sad, as he seemed to be a wonderful person and any loss of life is devastating. And I'm absolutely heartbroken for his family. But I'm also angry that he would be so reckless. And I'm (admittedly selfishly) angry that I had found someone I ""clicked with"" so effortlessly and now they're gone. And a part of me feels almost indifferent because I hadn't actually met him and fully formed that connection. 

I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to grieve for someone you've never met and barely knew? If there even is any advice for such a peculiar situation. We don't have any mutual friends, so I don't have anyone to talk to that knew him. ",23Jan2017,3

69,"(I apologize for the long text)

You might find this very immature and childish of me, but here's what happened; I'm currently on my internship, together with several classmates in the same company. At the start, i was placed beside one of them, i shall call ""jeremy"", which I got really annoyed of, because he was so quiet, and despite me trying to talk to him, he doesn't talk back much, and i did the immature thing; that is to ignore him. It took me weeks to realize this mistake, and i tried to talk things out, and even apologized. Apparently, he does not find my apology sincere, and despite me trying to talk to him again, he does not even look at me to talk, and replies were extremely cold. That i don't blame him, since i ignored him first.

In the mean time, as my seat has changed, i started hanging out with this classmate/colleague who i was never close to for the past three years. I shall call him Henry. After some talking and hanging out, I learnt that Henry's quite an amazing dude, the things we talk about, his character, etc. He's just unique compared to most people i know. I mean.. I could talk to him about anything. We hung out, we shared our problems with each other, and I've grown to trust this friend, and I would not want to lose this friend as this phase of life comes to a close. 

So, without my knowledge, Jeremy, Ive no idea why, whether out of jealously or just pure hatred towards me, Jeremy started going around, individually and in groups, and started talking about me. (idk if this are his exact words - but somewhere along this line), going around telling everyone in the how ""fake"" of a person i was, how big of a jerk i am, etc,  and exaggerating the matter to everyone. It weren't even that serious for goodness sake. It's almost as though he wants to spread this hatred, and wanting everyone to hate me. I said this because over the past 3 years in school, i saw how he exaggerated things about people, and saw how he made big groups of people dislike a few separate individuals. He even went to the extent of hoping for one to ""suicide"", and even labeling people as ""sins"" - like the legit 7 deadly sins mentioned in the bible, and many people even laughed and joke about it. Whattttttt even...

It could be seen clearly that some people in the company started looking at me differently, like, its so obvious, how they look at you when they talk, the way they talk and some even treated me as transparent! I mean... how could you even just listen to one side of the story and deemed it to be fully true? Truth to be told, It does not really concern me much whether or not I'm 'hated' by this group of colleagues/course mates, because they ain't really my friends to begin with. We're just classmates, internship colleagues, and i honestly do not see myself keeping in contact with them after graduation. 

But what's bothering most right now is whether or not Henry would be influenced by what's going around. As far as i can see, jeremy has been going to people individually, telling them about me, and I wont be surprised if jeremy actually told him. I'm just afraid of losing Henry, or that he might be affected by peer pressure, or influenced. It's not that im close to him now because I've been ""outcasted"", ""ignored"". Nope, thats not the case. I genuinely wanna continue this friendship with him. Its like, my conversations with him really helped me grew, and saw things from a different perspective, and understood alot better towards certain expects in life. I have my own groups of friends outside, a few close buds, outside, but i wanna this friend to be there too. He once said to me how I have been there for him, and asked if this friendship would continue even after graduation. It really made me feel happy, and reassured at that time. But right now, i'm just afraid that he'd be influenced - like how people would go with the flow so they wouldn't be outcasted? I dont know man, how im really feeling right now, but what i feel bugging me most right now is that I'd lose this friend of mine. I dont know man. I dont even know how Im feeling now.",23Jan2017,1
71,"So, I have an acquaintance (let's call her ""Abby"") who I'm feeling guilty about ignoring, but I don't know how to interact with someone who makes me feel so uncomfortable.

Some background: I met Abby in high school, though we were never actual friends. We merely knew of and were friendly to each other. I strive to always be friendly to everyone, especially those who seem to be socially awkward, which Abby definitely is. Well, years later, we met again at college, and I have to admit to only barely remembering her while she remembered every detail of our minimal interaction years prior. Again, I was polite and friendly, but that was the extent of it. I could tell at the time that there was some interest on her part in us hanging out, but I'm not super social outside of my sphere of close friends. I'm also super anti-confrontational, so I didn't/couldn't just say, ""No, I'm not really interested in hanging out with you."" That led to me just dropping off her radar, which I did rather successfully for a while.

Well, we ran into each other yet again through our local community theater, where I am a regular performer and she's a regular patron/volunteer. It's been over a year now that I've been getting (dodging) Facebook messages from her suggesting hang outs with no real context and commenting about our common interests based on what is obviously some pretty heavy-duty Facebook stalking. Example: I have a few posts featuring my dog, and then I get a message from her out of the blue saying how much our dogs would love to hang out, and then commentary on our similar tastes in movies/music based on my Facebook likes. I know that doesn't sound so bad, but again, we've never really been friends, just acquaintances who happen to appear in similar circles.

Now, I like to think I'm pretty good at reading people and seeing what's going on. As awkward as she is and as uncomfortable as her messages make me, I can't stop the little voice in my head from looking at her and her messages and thinking, ""She's probably lonely."" It's made worse that I have been ignoring her messages for so long, but she keeps sending them. I would like to think that she picked up on the hint of, ""I'd rather be left alone,"" but my brain can't help asking, ""Why does she keep reaching out to me?""

This escalated recently as I'm in another show at our community theater, and she messaged me during the show to tell me she was there. After the show, she stuck around for the meet and greet; I was friendly and thanked her for coming and proceeded to greet other people. She stuck around and waited for everyone to leave, so I stayed for a moment to ask how she'd been because I don't want to be overtly rude to her (yes, I see the irony of being more discreetly rude by ignoring her messages, I know, I know). We bantered awkwardly, she passive-aggressively mentioned under her breath the message she sent me during the show and then pretended she hadn't said anything, and I quickly noped out to get out of costume and out of the awkward. Well, after all that, I was heading out of the theater with some friends/castmates to go to a restaurant together, and there was Abby camped out in the parking lot waiting for me. She was standing next to her car, just waiting. I honestly had no clue what to do. I get that I shouldn't be a jerk to her, but don't I also have the right not to feel so smothered and uncomfortable? I smiled, waved to her, and thanked her for coming to the show, and then (mercifully) walked next door to the restaurant with my posse.

She left (with disappointment on her face), and I didn't hear anything from her. Then during our matinee performance this afternoon, I was looking across the audience and saw her and had to stop myself from going out of character. After the show, she came through the line and hugged me and left pretty quickly, so I thought, ""Cool, that wasn't so bad, maybe the parking lot thing was enough to finally end this awkwardness."" Cue the newest Facebook message that reads almost exactly the same as most of the others: 

""Would you like to hang out one day this week or any other day will be fine with me it is up to you?""

TL;DR - high school acquaintance has been trying to hang out with me like we're buds, but I'm anti-social and non-confrontational so I've just been dodging her messages. I feel bad because I'm scared she's lonely and needs someone to talk to, but I also REALLY value my privacy and seclusion. I don't feel comfortable just hanging out with people I haven't become friends with through work/theatre/church, and she makes me feel so awkward.

I feel like the grown-up thing to do is to be honest and just tell her that I don't really want to hang out, but I also don't want to be a jerk to her. Again, I know that ignoring her messages is being a jerk, too, but anyone in this position knows that it doesn't feel like it's the same. Any advice?",23Jan2017,1
72,"**BACKGROUND:**            
I had a toxic friend/sex-partner for a while, I thought things would calm down once I moved to a new city (about 3,000 miles away)... but they didn't. I'll spare you a lot of the details, but he was essentially a NiceGuy^TM that truly guilted me into 'friendship'. After politely telling him to stop contacting me several times over the past 8 months, he tried to guilt me into talking to him again (with a **VERY** low blow). That was the last straw, so I sent him a long, assertive text explaining how I am not falling for his shit anymore, and then blocked his phone #, email, and every social media profile I can think of. I even blocked some of our mutual friends and told some of my close friends to block him as well.        
&amp;nbsp;          
**WHERE I NEED SOME HELP**    
1. I am a little worried that I will regret cutting him out so harshly/abruptly. I feel 0 regrets right now, and I don't *think* any will form. Has anyone cut out a person and later regretted it?              
2. He is the kind of person that always needs to have the last word, and he has shown up to my house uninvited when we lived in the same city. I know it is *unlikely* that he would fly/drive 3000 miles to try to talk to me, but honestly that sounds like something he *would* do. And I am not certain whether he has my address or not. He asked me for it recently, and I declined.          
I feel like there is a ~2% chance he will just show up at my doorstep and I kind of want to have a game plan if that happens. Would I be allowed to call the police? Pepper Spray him? Or should I just lock all the doors block out the windows and pretend I am not home?        
3. Is there anything else I can do to make it even more impossible for him to contact me?

73,"Hey Redditors. I'm pretty stressed out at work with no one to talk to. Not even my own family. What happened at work was that my former supervisor quit from our workplace due to poor judgement from senior management. Now that he left, I'm the next victim under senior management. Currently, my temporary supervisors are the COO and CEO.


Both the CEO and COO aren't exactly the best people to deal with at work. First, it's lack of communication. No matter how many times I call or email them, they don't respond. Even if they did respond, they get back to me a week later. When a week passes by, our deadline for projects or invoices that needs to be paid for has past. Because of that, they would yell at me for sending an email or calling them late and I can't say anything back because I'm a junior level employee.


This kind of routine continues on for a long time. Projects aren't done yet and overdue payments are piling up, and I am very stressed out. I tried to talk this out with my parents and my best friends, but they didn't say anything. It is almost like I am talking to a brick wall. Sometimes, they think I am complaining too much about work. But, I was asking them on what I should do. Instead, they ignore me and continue to talk about other things.


Since I don't know who else to talk to on what I should do, I'm feeling very depressed. I was diagnosed with depression since college. I got depression mainly from stress. I overcome it when I was seeing a therapist on college campus. But, now it is creeping back because of stress from work.


I tried to find other jobs, but due to lack of experience, I got rejected left and right. I've been working at this employer for over 2 years so I thought it should be enough to leave this place. Because of this, I feel even more depressed.


I'm asking you all, what should I do? I can't find another job and my own family and best friends aren't helping me. Thank you.",23Jan2017,1
74,"Hey, I know this is gonna sound like some bitch fit of a post, but it's something I need to express. I'm 17, about to turn 18, and graduation is maybe 4 months away, and I'm scared. It seems as though life has just sucker punched me, and I fear I won't regain my breath fast enough to handle life. Pretty soon, I'll be going off to basic training, and go to school for cyber security. The only job experience I've had is at books-a-million. I know seemingly NOTHING about the requirements of being an adult, and I lack the social skills to go out and learn. What I've done for the past seven years is play video games with the same people, and hang out with all the trumpets I perform with in marching band. I'm afraid to leave them, you know? They all look up to me as the senior, and we've had some times I wouldn't change for the world. But now, all these fun times are going to disappear. All of high school will. The only thing that seems to want to stick are the bad memories, like a gigantic rumor that I was 'gay', which people still believe today, despite me having my lovely girlfriend for almost a year now. Sophomore year, a dear friend of mine (who was also in the trumpet section with me) felt life was too much, and took his own life via self inflicted bullet wound to the head. I played at his funeral. It's all this sad shit that keeps coming up with me, and I'm trying so hard to be positive, to be excited about finally living life my way, but I'm not. I'm gonna miss being a kid. Memories of baseball, coming home from middle school to play Halo 3, and performing in marching band after long days of practice, some leading up to 13 hours a day, will all be gone. So distant. Is life actually just a boring day job earning money just to survive? Is it all dependent on how I look at it? I'll be experiencing it first hand, but I'd like some advice from anyone that's an adult and has felt like this before. Sorry for sounding edgy, but it's bottled up feelings from the past seven years of my life. ",23Jan2017,3

She would always laugh and then talk for a few min/secs or just walk away. There's also this one time that we had to dress nicely (like in a suit, vest, etc) and she complimented me. I don't really know if theses are signs that she likes me? Or she's just doing it to be nice because we've been friends for so long ever since kindergarten.

I wasn't breastfed nor was my sister and we're just fine, where as my fiancés side of the family are all 100% breast. Like I don't have anything against breastfeeding or anyone who does it, I think it's an amazing thing to do and I support women who feel they can do it in public but I really don't think it's for me. I know it's early and my opinion may change the further I get in my pregnancy but I've seen so much hate towards people who do bottle feed lately, and alot of mothers I have on Facebook all BF etc. 

I know that there are benefits to breast milk and it's a good bonding experience etc but I don't want to be seen as selfish for not doing so when it's my body and my child, as long as they are fed, warm and loved that's all that matters surely?

Even then there are rules you have to jump through. And if you are dating someone it is important that they are also a JW and that's where my problem starts.

93,"Hello. I have worked with computer users for some time now, performing tasks of guiding, teaching, resolving, and recommending, in a broad technological sense.

Earlier I gained an interest in forming a small computer user group based loosely around the requests of /r/howtohack.

There are a few of us now, and though I'm not really sweating it (this is all volunteer/trade etc), I'm wondering how I could best utilize my students time, become more aware of their learning styles and requirements, and overall keep the group together and moving in a productive direction.

I have come up with a few lists of suggested plans, I can paste below. Just curious if anyone has ever done something like this (lead a small workgroup) and has any recommendations?

We are mostly going to be meeting online. And I clarified for them, my definition of hacking is being a tweaker and tinkerer of technology, not a Mr Robot badass whose in your emails.

In fact, what I hope to teach this group is how to stop, or at least, notice, a Mr Robot entering your system.

96,"Hey there! Thanks for reading. 

To preface this I'm a 22 year old woman who has been working as a pharmacy technician for 2 years and I'm highly qualified. Well, I moved from Indiana to California and my license isn't valid here.  I was with the big 3 letter pharmacy for a year and a half, and when i left they said they'd love to rehire me (as a company). 

So I got kind of a temporary job while I work on getting my license. I'm working at a very small business, minimum wage (11.50), 30 minute commute. It's totally different from what I've ever done. And I don't really like it the way I do pharmacy. 

The problem is: I was hired strictly so the owner could be at home with her young children (1 and 3) and I could run the store. She's brought her whole family in before and her daughters are super young. She's  been very patient and helpful with training me. I just started a week ago and the other only employee there is about so go back to school so she'll have reduced hours. 

I wasn't particularly happy at the 3 letters but it'll be much closer, pay at least $3/hr more but I'll be extremely busy and exhausted by the end of the day, but feel more fulfilled. I can get my license through them too, easily.

102,"Hey Reddit, 

I'm normally not the ""talk about your feelings"" kinda guy but I feel like I'm at the end of my wits here. 
Firstly, I was in a relationship that lasted three years (22/m, 21/f) and where we've lived together for 2 and a half years. Two weeks ago she broke up with me because she slowly lost the feeling without ever showing it. 

What you need to understand here is that this girl was my everything. She was the girl I was going to marry and grow old with in my head. When that plan blew up I broke. I'm not particularly good at anything except using my head, logical thinking and mathematics etc. Ever since it happened I can't seem to get coherent thoughts together and everything I do seems so damn empty. This is really messing me up bigtime because it lost me my parttime job. 

Since it was her apartment, I am now back to living with my parents which isn't that bad but not my favorite thing. Especially since they were always steady as a rock untill lately when both my grandmothers died within a very short timespan. Add some unexpected financial issues and now an extra mouth to feed and you've got one fucked up situation. I can't help but feel a little guilty about it because I really have no where else to go. 

I think the thing that's killing me the most is the way we broke up. There was no argument, no yelling, no anger, just tears. We still talk a lot because she gets lonely really fast and I still help her with her science homework because I still want her to get a college degree and she needs help. So basically we still hang out a lot and we act pretty normal to each other but you can really feel the underlying tension. Still, when I sit there staring at her and getting to smell her smell again, it makes the darkness a little brighter. I know it's not healthy but I can't help it. 

Lastly I have a very strict standing on suicide and self harm, it's never on the list of options to me. My now ex-gf however has had a bad youth and is covered in scars. This is probably the reason I can't let her go. I'm too scared it will become one of her options again and that would absolutely kill me. 

So reddit, since my brain has blue screened and is now boot-looping, I hope some of you have some some decent advice as to what I am supposed to do here. I really want her back even if it's the last thing I do. 

Oh and excuse the formatting, posting on mobile is a bitch.

Basically, we got pissed at our teacher. So we started making jokes about him. Then my friend (lets call him A) made a meme about him. Yeah, we are immature. Then I sent a pic of my teacher that I found on Google. Then A, started making more (nonthreatening) memes of him. All of this happened for twenty minutes, with around five or six pictures on the group.

A couple of days after, one of the teachers found the picture. Technically, I am guilty too for sending the pic. They were trying to find the guys which were responsible for this, so me and A. I wasn't there on that day, so I found out later that day.

Fast forward a couple of days, my friend and I decide to own up to our teacher. We got sent to the principal's office, then I told her the whole story honestly, without A. She walked with me back to class, and basically said that the whole class is fucked.

110,"I'm 18 years old and I want to be a wrestler. I understand that it hurts and that there are risks involved, but I still want to be a wrestler. I found a wrestling training school nearby and I contacted them, learning how much it costs, what dates, and getting offered a free try-out. However, I have had to consistently blow them off because any mention of it and my dad goes on a tirade about how I'll break my back and wind up a paraplegic, and that it's not the right age to do it, and that I have other pressing obligations to attend to first. First it was to get the year out of the way, then get my enrolment out of the way, then to get my bank account details out of the way, and he continuously brings up a different reason to delay. This makes me feel like garbage, and I wind up blowing them off because I don't want to go only to be scolded again.

I can see that the wrestling school are getting really frustrated with my inconsistent attitude, and to them it just seems like I'm being uncertain. I'm willing to go by myself, pay by myself and I'm obviously not going to try and kill myself doing it, but I always find myself at a loss for words whenever he starts yelling at me.

I get that I'm 18 and that it should be my choice, but every tirade launched against me is a massive blow to my confidence. I always find myself thinking ""Chair shots to the head are generally banned, piledrivers are generally banned, exercising caution is important"" before I mention wrestling, but every time I just struggle to say anything.

I would go in secret, but my brother always insists that I tell dad, but every single time I get yelled at and feel like crap for the next few days. I know it doesn't seem like a huge deal since most people would just say ""do it yourself, you're 18, it's your decision"" but I lack that confidence at present.

111,"Hi guys,

First of all English is not my first language so please bear with me. It is about the relationship with my brother. I’m currently 19 years old and my brother is 26. We still live in the same house with our parents. The problem I have is that in every situation he tries to teach me about life. If I have a conversation with him, 95% of the time it is him talking and trying to teach me about everything, that it gets really annoying sometimes. But what bugs me the most is that he doesn’t do the things he preaches. I know it may sound a little bit pathetic but last time I wanted to take a walk outside and right when I wanted to leave, he yells at me that every time I go out, I should tell him where I go. The problem is there were countless times where he just did the same thing, leaving without telling anybody. In that moment I suddenly was filled with anger because he always tells others what to do but there is no problem when he doesn’t do it. He tells me to go to a club to make new friends, but most of the time he is in front of his computer at home.  This is one reason why I started to avoid him more and more the last few years. I just feel happier when he is not around to be honest. My parents always tell me to respect him and that he just wants the best for me but he does not stay true to his words. My parents also know that he is lazy since he is not doing well in university. A few months ago I have become an uncle and since I have only one brother I also feel like I’m in a competition with him. I can only rarely play with my nephew because most of the time he takes him away from me to play with him like he is the only one who matters and fuck the others. It really just makes me angry, not only towards him but myself as well, because very often I just feel like I can’t stand up for myself. It is not that I only feel hatred for him, there were times in the past where I also was happy to have a older brother but today I realized that most of the times I just want to avoid him as much as possible.
I appreciate any serious advice for my situation

Its a pretty long and hard situation that im in, so i will try to keep it short while covering all of the main points!

I am 28 years old.  I live in the UK, but have an amazing fiance from the states.  When i was 20 i was fortunate enough to start up a successful online business which enabled me to travel freely and work from anywhere.  I was able to travel to and from the states to be with my fiance while making roughly $10,000 per month from my online business.  life was great! 

My fiance moved to the UK to live with me.  However around one year ago she lost a family member who was very close to her and had to move back to the States permanently.  

I am currently in the states with her now.  My business has taken a turn for the worst and i have basically lost all of my savings and it is draining all of my money.  

I have not had to consider money since i was 20 years old as i have always done well financially.  I am almost broke and in 2 days time i will be returning to the UK.  I will have to close my business as it has drained me and i will have no source of income.  

I dont know what to do? I cant get a job as that means that i cant be with my fiance.  I also havent had a job since i was 19 years old and would be so depressed and miserable going from being my own boss and having freedom to travel and make money from anywhere (i know it sounds very arrogant but it is the case) 

What do i do? My fiance cant move to the UK.  I only have around $10,000 left.  Im miserable, scared and depressed and have no more ideas.  I have no education as iv always owned my own business and now have a HUGE gap (8 years) in my CV. 

Any advice on what i should do would be amazing.

I have huge problems commiting to things, be it career, relationships or things... as I am always changing my mind. This has caused a lot of stressful situations to both me, my family and my girlfriend who has been with me for 3 years.

Anyway here is my main concern: I earn a lot not doing much and feel like I've stagnated. I don't know if I should move/pursue a different career or stay and ""pretend"" I'm working hard for a couple of more months or years.

Some facts:

- I'm 29, going to be 30 this year

- I work as a Telecom Engineer, have around 6 year experience, now I'm in a technical leadership position with 15-20 people working in projects that I supervise.

- My client's feedback is excelent, especially because I meet all the goals and objectives with distinction so far

- My company's feedback is non-existant, they have no career progression plans, the management is shit and only cares bout the profit and I see a lot of talent ""escaping"" the company every day. Employees are very discontent with the working conditions (salary) and lack of support from HR, especially when decisions have to pass by the HQ..

- I work in Spain and earn about 80.000 euros per year (NET). This is way above the average in my field, especially in Spain. I managed to save around 50% of this.

- Some days of the week I work from home, or should I say I play video games, watch tv shows while connected in Skype meetings and answer some emails... not learning much.

- I have decided that I want to pursue a career related to Business Development, Solutions Architecture, Pre-sales...

- I have received job offers to go to Portugal (where I have my family) earning about 20.000 euros (NET) or Germany, earning about 40.000 euros (NET). 

In conclusion: Changing now looks like a very bad decision because I'm effectively cutting down my earnings in half or a fourth... I'll have to relocate (which is expensive, to say the least), work a lot more hours (effectively to prove my worth) and also have to disrupt my current life with my girlfriend who is currently OK with living in Spain, although she doesn't like it very much...

Should I stay where I am or should I start actively looking for new oportunities, even if that means cutting into half my earnings??",23Jan2017,3

I could see the symbols perfectly well, I just couldn't figure out what they were or what keys I had to press on the keyboard to reproduce them. I often get symbols confused, and couldn't tell the difference between the letter x and the symbol for pi in an exam once. I have not read a book in over a year because of this. My typing has become a mess as well, and when I go to re-read anything I have typed I find that it's all jumbled. I know what I was trying to type, I just end up typing all of the wrong words, and in an odd order. Interestingly, my writing is perfectly fine and still very neat, and I have no trouble reading it, however I cannot read anyone else's handwriting. 

I have already been to a neurologist and psychiatrist in the past for similar issues, but all brain scans came back normal and EEG was only slightly abnormal. I have never had any issues before a couple of years ago. All blood work is normal, I don't have dyslexia, and my eyesight is okay. I'm worried that this is all just in my head and that I'm going crazy, because the doctors just can't find a physical cause and they don't seem to have any idea what could be causing the issues. It costs money which I don't really have to go to doctor's appointments, and I don't want to take up resources if someone else needs them more.

Essentials: needs to be relatively fast setup, preferably import function for IMDB watchlists. Fast to update, either manually or auto. Search function is also needed. 

I would prefer something that is not client based when it comes to auto-updating your watched movies/tv-series episodes, etc I watch movies on PLEX/Netflix both on my computer and on my TV, so I dont' want browser based apps etc, that can't keep track outside your browser activity.

I have been searching around for a bit, most fall short simply because they need to be manually updated or that they are client based, which means no update if I decided to watch from my TV + most have problems syncing with netflix if they are not installed on your browser, which means no update if I watch through my TV.

147,"So my classes just got dropped due to the fact that the military (who pays for my school pretty much whenever they feel like sending the money for tuition) hasn't payed for my tuition like they usually do. I emailed the only individual that is permitted to make any changes to the system such as eliminate holds, sign advising sheets, and provide forms when needed. This is what she said to me:

You'll have to go get your bills paid and add back. Get with your semester faculty to ensure that you sign up for EXACTLY the crn's you were supposed to be in, not the ones you want. You also need to reach out to the faculty. (My Name), this is semester 3, You know how the system works by this point. Asking me what to do is not the first step. Follow the chain of command and in case you haven't noticed, I'm at the top...not the bottom. Do not contact me until you have first spoken with YOUR clinical faculty and can prove that you haven't received an appropriate answer. I'm not playing this game this semester. 

This individual is the assistant director of the nursing school and is responsible for signing my advising sheet so that my tuition fees that are payed by the military can be approved. Money didn't come. So I go to her because she's the only one that can override the classes that were dropped so that they can be re-added.

I honestly don't understand what the last part is about. The only reason I've ever had to email her concerning troubles with classes. I think maybe because she was my teacher for one of my other classes I used to contact her about the class and she didn't like that so much.

This is the same individual that will ask a student to write their signature 50 times ""legibly"" because she can't read it in cursive when the signature itself sits right next to a printed name. I feel like she treats us like children and it's not very professional at all. I'm 27 years old and no one has spoken to me like this before. It's somewhat irritating.

Here are my reasons why I haven't done so yet.

I feel like he wouldn't like me because of my beliefs. Honesty, I'm not sure if he is religious or not, but it's such a touchy subject to bring up so I don't mention it. I'm Pansexual, and for those who don't know what that means, I find personality more appealing than gender or their sexuality. 

I also don't care if people call me a boy or girl, so my appearance is different from girls he's dated in the past. I guess I could say that I am self conscious, thinking that he won't like me because of my appearance. Don't get me wrong, I love how I dress, I love how I have short hair instead of long hair...I just don't know if he would be used to that, I guess. I know it sounds stupid, but that's how I could describe that.

153,"I am a 25 year old graphic designer with a four year Bachelor's Degree and have been working full time at the same job (first one out of college) for three years now. I have become dissatisfied with my job for the following reasons:

1. I have a *very* unorganized and ""scatterbrained"" boss, which drives me crazy. I am the opposite----very organized and on top of what I'm doing. I made it work for a while, but it has worn me down over time. When your boss isn't organized and gives you inaccurate or incomplete info, it can ruin a project really fast. 

2. I have moved up as far as I can possibly go at this small company. There's nothing more for me here other than a small annual raise. I don't have healthcare benefits either, so that's something I have to deal with.

3. I have grown tired of shoveling out ""okay"" work for mostly low brow customers. People ask for the worst things and aren't satisfied unless they get exactly what they want. I'm talking crappy design work for rednecks, small churches, NASCAR fans, and the like. I know I can do better things than what I am doing here. I have friends who graduated and went to work for awesome design firms producing great things and that's where I want to be.

I have a decent portfolio, but have ideas for things I would like to add. My thought was that I could respectfully resign and focus on (1) building a kickass portfolio with the time I would be spending doing throwaway work at my current job, (2) searching for a new job (3) working out, getting into a better mental state in general.

I have 6 months of living expenses saved, or 7-8 if I really live frugally and cancel some unnecessary subscriptions. I own a car (EDIT: and it's paid off), but I live in the downtown area of my city which is pretty walkable/bikeable, so I could get by without using my car for a while.

So, I wasn't really sure who to ask about this, my family isn't very helpful and my peers all come to me for advice, so asking them wasn't an option. I used to work for Starbucks, I worked there for a year and a half and I worked fucking hard. I always opened at 5am, pulled 6 day work weeks, and always worked overtime when someone called in sick (which is constantly) - which I think is part of the reason I am so hurt and confused by this.

I left for an office job after a customer of starbucks noticed how hard I worked and offered me a position in the coming months when her main receptionist went back to school. I love my new job, and it's been a great experience so far.

My new job and the starbucks are in the same community, literally around the corner from each other. I go in and get stuff and am still friends with all my old coworkers. Except it has come to my attention that there is one girl who had started with small false statements such as, ""she never came in to work"", ""she constantly called in sick"", etc. I brushed that stuff off because, whatever... I'm sure she was probably a little upset she didn't get the offer.

Until this weekend, she was training some new barista, the entire cafe was full and she says ""make sure all the food gets thrown out. We had an employee who would steal the 'expired' food and take it home to eat. They had to be let go, and now they work at (my place of employment)."" WHAT. THE. FUCK.

Patients that come in to the clinic can hear you, some of them are friends with my boss! People who respect me in the community can hear her slandering me and I truly think it's starting to affect my reputation. I'm now wondering what other stuff she may have said because I've definitely been starting to get ostracized - people who would normally love to chat with me are more cold and uninterested.

Now on to the bad parts, the owners are very forgetful and prone to not caring about my teaching schedule. It's been two weeks in a row now where they've basically double booked me.

I've been friends with Martin (18) for nearly a year now, towards the end of September we started seeing each other more, at least 3 times a week. Sometimes we would smoke marijuana together and drink with his/my friends. We were close and I guess I started gaining feelings for him the more we spent time together, it's been like that ever since I met him though. 

In October I started dating another guy (Luke, 14). He cared a lot about me and we were close, we had been friends for 7 years so we knew a lot about each other... but few relationship wasn't perfect. We would have arguments a lot of the time, I didn't treat him as well as I should've. (Luke didn't know anything about Martin, I kept him a secret from most of my friends and family).

End of December, me and Luke decided to go on a ""break""  but we both knew that was the end of the relationship.

One night during December me and Martin had sex, we had both been drinking and smoking so maybe it wasn't the best decision for the both of us. But I didn't think anything of it, we both had feelings for each other and It was consensual (by law no, but I knew what I was doing).

Anyway, yesterday my ex (Luke) basically pushed me into telling him the truth about everything, now he's calling Martin a pedophile and a rapist. I do not see him that way at all, he would never do anything to hurt me... He's 18 and in college, he's smart and intelligent and has the future to look forward too, not prison. Luke is threatening to tell somebody about what happened between us, which by law could result in that. 

I told Luke because I thought I could trust him, he's unsure on whether to tell someone or not. I told him I would never forgive him if he did.

Problem is, I am extremely obvious when I like someone. My face turns red, and I can't stop smiling when they're close by, making it hard to talk to them. 

My friend thinks that he may like me back because he started sitting closer to me during physics, but I can't really tell. (He hasn't sat close to me in any other class we're in.) I tend to tell myself that guys won't like me because it makes me feel like it would be easier to accept rejection. 

I don't really have much experience in the dating department. The only guy I've dated in high school lived in a different country, and it ended within a few months (he wasn't really good at long distance communication). I don't know if it's my shyness, or the fact that I look younger than my age, but I don't usually tend to attract the opposite sex. This kind of makes me doubt if he likes me or not.

And yes, I know, it's high school, I don't need a boyfriend in high school, and I'm a strong independent woman who doesn't need a man to make her happy, but I don't want a relationship with him just to say I have a relationship with someone, I want to because I genuinely might have feelings for him. Enough feelings that if I find out that he does like me, I would want to ask HIM out (Do guys like it if girls ask them out?). 

So, what do I do? I'm so nervous that I'm going to screw everything up, and just plan embarrass myself. Any fellow awkward people out there that can help me out? ",23Jan2017,1
173,"For safety reasons I cannot give the real names or location and every single detail.  I will call this person I know Sarah.

Sarah's ex-husband gives her money every month and at this point she owes so much to dangerous people she is owned by them.  Every payment goes directly to them.  Next month she will no longer receive any payments from her husband.  She is also currently being hunted for who knows how much moneys worth of drugs.  These people know where her family lives and know she has children.  

The police have assured this family that these people tend to stay out of the spotlight and that things should be fine but I seriously doubt that.  The city everyone lives in has a very high crime rate and rising gang activity and I personally believe they don't have the resources to help considering there are thousands of active warrants.

She asked me the other day why my friend never want to play truth or dare and I told her because he doesn't want to hear other peoples secrets or tell his own. She thought it was really stupid and said she likes playing because it makes her feel closer to people. I think that is totally bs but maybe I'm wrong. She also doesn't get why people don't want to talk about their sexual life. I told her because some people value their sexual life and treat their secrets as sacred moments between them and that other person. She thought that was dumb because he and my friends brother are really open about their sexual life. My personal believe is that they don't share what a lot of other people feel. They aren't very loving and their sex life seems to be strictly sexual, not containing any sort of intimacy or love. So I guess my question is, is it weird that some people don't want to tell their secrets and it could be bringing you closer to someone? Or is it super weird to be hungry for peoples secrets and play truth or dare with a bunch of family? I just want to know the psychology for both sides.

196,"Long story as short as I can possibly make it, I was fired from my previous job. I had been working there for nearly five years and had outlasted several managers, working at several locations. I had worked my way up from crew member to Assistant Manager. The company was constantly shuffling managers, unable to keep most and overworking many. My newest GM and I lasted four months together before I was let go. 

While the termination was legal, I would say it was quite a bit underhanded.  My GM maintained he had no idea what the reasons could be, it must have been some issue I had with his boss. So I had to call some big boss I'd only met a few times and they pretty much told me what other people had told them, completely unaware of the situation. They were able to come up with a few examples of times I'd been a few minutes late, and that was the official reason I was given. The unofficial and real reason I was let go is a delicious story, I'll have to tell to some subreddit someday. Give me the BOTD here and let's all agree I did my job, and mistakes I made were never addressed as being a big enough issue to even give me a warning over.  

My issue is that I've been filing applications for a while. I have a resume too. Most applications ask for the store location, the supervisors name, the location's phone number. I'm sure if they call him he will say some nasty things. He was a pretty strange and rude person. 

People keep telling me to fudge dates and names so if they call they'll get someone I did work for but not technically my previous supervisor. 

Should I put the store's number and his name?
Should I put the store's number and the name of a past GM who I did work for but no longer works there?
Should I put the phone number and the name of the past GM who would say good things... even though it isn't the store number?

And what should I put in reasons for leaving?
And if I lie am I going to regret it in the interview?

Good evening ladies and gentlemen!

So I thought perhaps I may try my hand in the hospitality industry and perhaps one day become a hotel manager. It should (I think) be a much more upbeat society to work in! 

Given that I have no qualifications beyond my high school diploma, how viable is this? Is it a realistic to get an entry level job at a hotel and then work my way up the ranks? My fear is that I'll be stuck in a receptionist position for decades to come haha.

The only thing is that, I'm finishing up my final year of university and if I get hired, I need to be in the country the last two weeks of August. It's my parent's 25th anniversary three days after her wedding and they want to go on a trip as a family. Also, if I do get a job, I will most likely have to move/buy a car because I cannot commute 4 hours every day to get to work. I've been doing it while I was in school, but it's not practical as the field that I am going into requires that you start work early.

We've had a difficult friendship to say the least. She's very selfish and cannot understand things from other people's point of view. Nevertheless, we've had some good memories together. However, I was done with her friendship after last year.

I was going through a depressive phase and I was trying to tell her about how I wasn't feeling good physically or mentally which was why I felt like incorporating meat back in my diet (I'm vegetarian and she's vegan). Please don't give me a lecture on how I was doing a plant-based diet wrong. I was going through a suicidal phase at that time and her answer was, ""it's because you're under-carbed"". I wrote her a letter explaining my feelings and we stopped talking for a few months. We started talking again when she was about to move and I hoped that our friendship would die naturally because of the 15 hour time difference.

She got engaged in November and asked me to be her maid of honour. I'm her oldest and closest friend because she pushes people away from the way that she behaves. No one else from my country (aside from her family) is going over for the wedding. It's really too expensive to pay for the flight, accommodations, food, travel expenses, gifts, dresses, etc. Honestly, if she were a good friend who had truly been there for me, I would have made an effort to go, but everything is always about her. I don't think she understands how much her words hurt me and why I don't want to be her friend anymore. 

I've told her the other reasons as to why I don't want to go, but she thinks I should prioritize her wedding over my family and getting a car, which I will need to start my life.

229,"Hi everyone,

I am new at this, but I'm in desperate need of good advice on what to do. 

I met this coworker, maybe a year ago when I started working at the company I'm working for now. We were in the same department before he transferred to a different department shortly after I started there. It's not like we're close friends or anything, but I'll say ""hi"" or ""how are you"" if I see him. 

However, he starts messaging me at work more frequently through our work message system. I don't wanna come off as rude so I'll chat him back, but we never get into any deep level of conversation (it's normally very short or he talks about himself/ his life). I'm totally uninterested in our conversation, but I usually do my best to keep up the small talk. At this point, he has my number and added me on Facebook, but to me it's just whatever we're like work acquaintances.

Things get weirder, though, when he starts asking me if I have a boyfriend (which I do) and then every so often he'll ask ""Oh how are things with your boyfriend?"" OR ""What are you up to?"" ""Not doing anything with your boyfriend this week??"" OR ""Your boyfriend is so lucky to have you."" Then he'll randomly bring up something like ""Oh this girl just tried to hook up with me, but I refused bla bla bla."" And I honestly don't know WHY he's telling me this stuff and I don't care either.  (I also want to note that everything is done through online messaging- he's very awkward in person and we rarely conversate in person either.) 

At this point, I feel frustrated and annoyed that he keeps messaging me (first through text which I kind of ignored and now on Facebook). I try not to respond hoping that he'd get the hint that I don't really want to talk, but he'll continue to message every week or so to the point where the conversation looks like he's talking to himself! I also feel extremely terrible as well... I really hate ignoring people like that, but I don't want to be like ""HEY STOP BOTHERING ME"" since we work at the same company. 

Also, he isn't really a bad guy or anything and I don't want to cause any trouble. I feel like he's very oblivious to social cues so I'm hoping you guys have a good suggestion for me?!

In the meantime, I haven't clicked on his messages (I really really hate that it shows if someone read your message or not). My excuse for if he ever asks me why I don't respond is, ""Ohhh I just stopped using Facebook..."" (I know. So lame, but it's the best I got so far)...  ",23Jan2017,1

234,"I don't know of this post fits here, or if there's a more appropriate subreddit. If there is let me know.. 

So, I guess here goes, this may be lengthy. 

I need help with.. my life. I'm an 18 y/o female, currently attending college. I just started my fourth semester. 

My parents are decent. They're hypocrites and narcissists sometimes but they care and do a lot for me and my siblings and I appreciate all they do. 

Unfortunately they're definitely part of the problem, as is one of my siblings. 

A bit more background: I was raised in a small town, I was the black sheep throughout all of elementary and high school, I never had friends, and anyone that got close abandoned me without reason. I've had three long distance boyfriends, but two were emotionally abusive, and all three left without saying a word to me. I guess I'm emotionally damaged now, I have trouble trusting people.

My parents are also over protective. I'm their only daughter, and they still have trouble leaving when they visit. I can't tell them anything without them overreacting, so I don't tell them anything. I was never independent of them when I was younger either, I'm terrified of doing anything alone now. 

And then we get to the present. I'm currently being forced to live with my brother. Due to the small town I was born in being primarily my second language, in order to go to college, I had to move to a big city. My brother previously attended but dropped out, now he decided to go back. To minimize cost my parents put us together.

Don't get me wrong, I understand completely. I just wish I had a choice. I was never asked, I was just told. 

Each semester gets worse. Every class is boring. I have high hopes of being a psychologist but I can't even bring myself to go anymore. I need to, I don't want to disappoint my parents like my brother did, but I can't take living with him.

He's the opposite of me and he's gross, and living with him is hell. I had my own problems before and now I've got to deal with him as well. And I can't do anything about it. Half the time I want to kill him. The other half I want to kill my self. 
I don't have a purpose. My classes aren't reason enough for me to want to get out of bed. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I don't have any friends, I don't have a boyfriend, I can't have any pets. 
I'm smart but unmotivated. I hate myself and my life, and I can't even change what's making me miserable. I don't know what to do. 
I'm open to any suggestions, honestly, I just need help... ",23Jan2017,1
235,"My (now ex)girlfriend broke up with me on Friday. We had only been together two (or three depending on when you're counting from) months but nonetheless it really hurts. We were sort of friends for about four years prior and realising how much I like her as a person I still really want to be friends with her (which she is fine with). The issue is, I'm still very much in love with her. I get that it will fade over time, but right now I love her so much that it hurts. We go to college together, so it isn't like I could take a little time away from her before we went back to being friends and even if I could take some time away I'm not sure I'd be able to handle cutting her out of my life (even temporarily).

239,"Hey everyone. To start off, I am an 18 year old girl who believes in equality for everyone, and does not hate or dislike men in any way (I assumed some might interpret this text that way). 
This is about my “story” with porn. I am writing this because I hope to get some answers and maybe some advice: 
I never thought much about porn, or its significance in my life, at least never consciously. I have a boyfriend; we have been together for almost two years. I have always known that he watches porn now and then, known but not thought of. I had never watched porn, and decided to try it out for fun with a friend of mine accompanied by alcohol. We went through a lot, many different genres. The more I watched the more disgusted I was by it (personal opinion, emotional, not rational, don’t consider it the right opinion). That’s when I started thinking about it more, I would get sad by the thought of my boyfriend being turned on by other women. However, I was always mostly frustrated and angry with myself for having a problem with porn since I seemed to be the only one. I would think about it more frequently, it really got to me, and it was starting to affect my relationship. (We have talked about it, but not enough I feel.) It really bothered me often. I realised that I had to do something about it. In my head, there were two solutions: 1. I could change the world’s view on porn or 2. I could change my own view on it. I favoured the latter. I started doing some research as to why it really got to me, and I found some sort of explanation: 
When your brain reacts to viewing porn as opposed to masturbating while using your imagination, it reacts extremely differently, in that it engages what are known as mirror neurons. These don't mean you imitate what you see, this means your brain cannot differentiate between what it's seeing and what's happening. So while you masturbate, even if you are consciously able to differentiate, the arousal part of your brain and other parts of your brain just can't. Your brain thinks it's in on the action. That's why people like porn. That's why people say, ""I'm not looking at her, I'm looking at the action."" Because their brain actually thinks it's in on the action.
This is just a small part of the “answers”. The rest focuses on numbers, facts, about violence in porn degrading women and so on. Though that might be true and I dislike that aspect of it, I am not trying to fool myself. What gets to me is the images that keep appearing in my head of my boyfriend and other women, it is the feeling of not being enough for him since he is enough for me. Many readers of this might think I am overreacting, and honestly, I fully agree with that statement. I am assuming that my point of view is quite wrong, not rational. That’s why I am writing for advice on what to do in order to change this perspective, this feeling that now occurs too often.

240,"Hello Reddit Family,

My 73 year old aunt has been diagnosed with Colon Cancer and she needs to undergo two rounds of chemo therapy. 

My aunt is the reason my dad and my other aunt are here in the USA, but she doesn't have the documents necessary for Medical insurance, etc to undergo chemo therapy so we have been scrambling do get the funds together. 

My aunt never married, and never had kids. She always lived with my dad or my aunt. Never alone. She always dedicated her life to helping others and being there for me and my other cousins since we all grew up together. 

Since she is old and has cancer, my cousin recently told me that my aunt is really not my aunt but in fact she's my grandma. When she was around the age of 18 she had my dad with my grandpa and she was brought in as a sister and part of the family. 

My parents, and my newly found ""grandma"" do not know I know. And my sister does not know about my grandma either.  

I came here to Reddit because I am upset, shocked and have a lot of emotions running through my head. I don't know if I should let my sister know, or just keep my mouth shut. 

Has anyone been through this before? If so, what did you do?

242,"My Dad and I have never had the best relationship, he got hooked on alcohol and hurt me and at one point beat my mum up. He really took a toll on my life and my confidence was knocked so bad because of him, I was loud and literally thought of myself as a diva and I thought I could take on anything until that happened. 

Im not saying this because I want sympathy. What he did is inexcusable but at the same time... he's my dad. And I still want a relationship. 

Me and him rarely talk, and when we do its usually him messaging me saying that we need a ""catch up""... I think of catch up more as a friendship thing so it generally annoys me that he says this because he's my dad and he should make more of an effort. He told me that he suffers from depression and anxiety and thats why he never gets in contact with me... because he's afraid i'll reject him after everything he's done, this is why he rarely messages me but i still think thats no excuse... is it? 

After everything that happened I got into so many arguments with him over the phone, all he does is talk about himself and its never a ""Hi maxine, how are YOU doing?""..... Its more of a ""Hey Maxine, so I lost another job again."".... I know he's my dad and I may sound selfish saying this but he unloads all of his problems on me... maybe too much. Its always about him and he never asks me what Im doing, how my dentist appointments went, am i doing well in college...ect. I just feel like he talks about his problems and I never get to talk about me. 

I want him to be a dad to me, step up and play the role he never has because I've never felt love from him, I cant even say I love you to my mum because the minimum love he's shown to me has rubbed off and I don't even know how to express it anymore.

244,"Over the past several months my roommate seems to have a new issue every week with me. He never comes to me directly if he's had a real problem he will just slam doors extremely loud and smash stuff in his room and when I confront him about it he tells me to fuck off in a sense.

He thinks I have been throwing garbage in his room, eating his food from the fridge, using his toiletries and most recently accused me of cutting his shoes.

I keep to myself 100% and have been doing my best to stay out of his way but my efforts seem to be in vain. He has been habitually dirty since we moved in together and I have since stopped telling him to clean up and cleaning up after him because it does not seem to get through to him.

He has been saying he wants to move out for a while because of this problem and at this point I don't care anymore. I know he has some anger issues but i also suspect he has some underlying mental health issues as well.

We were good friends and I would like to salvage the friendship but now it seems his problems with me are getting out of control so should I even bother trying to work it out with him or should I just let him do his own thing? We used to hang out and talk before he started getting paranoid, now he just keeps to himself as well for the most part except when he has his outbursts against me.

250,"So lsat year I failed two modules (one for philosophy and one for psychology) because of reasons I'm not entirely sure about but it probably has something to do with me having to fly very far twice during my exams for my brothers wedding (bachelors party and the wedding itself). 

I had to reregister for university the other day like I do every year and I thought I had to redo the modules I failed to continue with my course and get my degree. I've failed a stupid subject before (basically just a compulsory course on basic computer skills and referencing where they give out immediate fails for certain things) and I remember having to tick this big red box for the subject I failed before I could complete my registration.

I didn't have to do that this time and it seemed fishy to me so I checked what the course requirements were for philosophy and psychology and both said to continue with the course I only need to pass any combination of three of the four modules to continue. 

So basically I don't have to redo them. If it were any other subjects I'd be over the moon and this wouldn't be a problem, but I want to major in psych and philosophy and maybe even get my honours in one of them. 

So do I go to the office at te start of the semester and ask to retake them, or just leave it and be glad I don't have to do it again since I didn't particularly care for them?

First of all, let me know if this is in the wrong sub. 

I have to give a speech to my high school, as a graduation requirement for senior year. It needs to be 7-10 minutes long, and it's considered the ""big thing"" you do as a senior. I thought I kind of had it all figured out and just needed to write it down, but now that I'm hitting the ""write it down"" phase, I'm panicking a bit. Most people just do the speech on something they like (yoga, books, etc), but I've kinda wanted to go deeper/more interesting and talk about something that is either offbeat, deep, or at the very least unique. 

Here are the topics I've come up with so far:

Failure: Talk about how it's okay to fail and why it can be a good thing. I feel like this one wouldn't have much substance to it, though, and it's a bit generic. 


Bullshit: Talk about how we're all ""faking it till we make it"", in a sense. I feel like this one would lack a ""so what""/moral, and that might make it feel like it lacks direction. 

Be weird/stop being so goddamn self-conscious: It's hard to come up with substance for this one, because it really does boil down to that one sentence. The moral, at least, is pretty clear here: do you and fuck the haters. 

Intellectual discussion: Talk about the importance of challenging our own ideas and maybe go into polarization/the danger of safe spaces. 

Scientists being round up and executed: So this one's pretty weird, but I feel like it'd be interesting to talk about how different scientists have had their views shut down over time. The issue with this is that it might just turn into ""the Catholic Church sucks"", and I don't really want that. 

Moral dilemmas: Walk people through different moral dilemmas and whatnot, and hopefully round it out into an interesting piece about human psychology. Not sure how i'd manage that, though. 


So that's all I really have. I've found that I'm really struggling to make anything creative/substantive here, and I'd love it if you guys had any ideas, or could help me iron out the ones I have. Thanks :D

261,"Hi,

I'm 20 years old and I developed a real passion for soccer when I was 18. Before that age, I've never played soccer (not even with friends just for fun). Now two years later, my passion for soccer is only getting stronger and last year, I signed up for goalkeeper lessons. I consider myself quite talented in goalkeeping (since I've only just started), but I am currently only getting about 3 trainings a month and I am not playing in a team. 

I'm really dreaming to play at a high level one day and I'm willing to work extremely hard to still develop a succesful soccer carreer. Due to my age, this might seem ""impossible"", but I've always believed that everything is possible - especially in soccer - and I really believe it now too. So my idea was to start a crowdfunding project for a documentary web series where I train to become a professional goalkeeper. With the money from the crowdfunding, I could assemble a dreamteam to guide me to the top and reserve some money for a living (since I won't be able to work full-time due to my trainings). 

So my question is, does this sound like something you would back on Kickstarter? And does this seem like a documentary that you would watch (let's assume it is a high quality professional documentary). 

Thanks a lot for your honest opinions!

269,"This is gonna be very long but if only a few people have the patience to read this I would be very happy about advice.
I don't know which subreddit this fits into so I am probably just gonna end up posting it into a few that I know where people like to listen and give advice.

I am male and now 21 years of age.

I have been becoming increasingly emotional when I was almost numb not too long back. The difference is like black and white and I am very curious as to what the root of my former numb and my new overly emotional state might be.

Up until recently I didn't cry in around 7 years and even back then it was not because i was particularly sad about something but more like a way to manipulate my mom into giving me my internet cable back.

To explain this I might have to go back in time a bit. I realized around 2 years back that I have been living my life in a very one sided way emotionally. I could actually not get sad to save my life, I wasn't really able to develop strong feelings for another person either, not to mention my severe lack of empathy for everyone and everything. 
I had a good share of relationships with beautiful, smart and caring girls that all ended because I was not able to develop any feelings for them. 
Obviously I liked them around me because they were nice and funny and I certainly was physically attracted to them but it was unbelievably far from love even in the slightest sense.

That is not all though, a number of actually pretty tragic events took place around that time from which I detached myself completely emotionally. To name some examples:

My grandpa died of cancer, we were pretty close but had a fight or two about completely irrelevant stuff ( at least I absolutely can't remember specifics ) which lead to me not visiting for a few weeks before he got sick. And in the year he struggled for his life, despite everyone telling me countless times that he was asking for me and that he wished to see me badly at least once before it's too late. 
I could not bring up the effort to walk 200 meters to his home or later to the hospital simply because I did not give a shit, because I thought it would be kinda weird suddenly showing up after not having any contact for so long. I guess I could not comprehend that it actually hurt him that I wasn't showing up, that he actually cared about seeing me again before he goes, because I was so emotionally detached from everything and lacking empathy on a very large scale. 
I actually feel like crying just typing this. I regret nothing more than not visiting my dying grandpa that was a proud and extraordinarily smart man, that only ever did me good and shared all my beliefs and interests, alltough he was asking for me and waiting for me to say goodbye, simply because I did not care.

Needless to say I didn't have any emotional epiphanies or even changes in mood upon attending his funeral, I remember me being more concerned about how my new black scarf looks than even listening to his last praises.

My dog Josephine of 16 years also died shortly after. She was pretty much the only link to my childhood and alot of my happiest memories are connected to her. I remember the day she got euthanized as if it was yesterday, I woke up and my mom told me under tears that there was no hope in bringing Josy back from the Vent and that it was better to relief her from the pain and put her to rest. Instead of getting even slightly sad I thought it was funny to make jokes about how my griefing mother killed my dog and that we had to kill my brothers dog too just to be fair and so on, you get the idea. I investigated my feelings alot that day though, I remember sitting quietly in my room actively trying to get sad to no success.

I could go on about this but I think from what I told it should be pretty clear that the way I was back then was neither normal nor healthy.

As Karma might have it I got very sick after that. I was extremely nauseous everyday for several months and alltough I had a lot of tests done and visited various doctors it never really got diagnosed. I got pretty depressed for the time I felt sick, not sad or emotional at all, I just wasn't sure if I wanted to put effort into being alive anymore if it meant feeling like I have stomach flue everyday. I spent almost a year only being in my room, not doing anything. The only social contact I had was my girlfriend which visited me around 4 times a week and my best friend that came by from time to time. Once I felt better I dumped my girlfriend, which stayed with that miserable version of me alltough I was of use for nothing and by no means affectionate towards her, because I couldn't bring up any feelings for her and the whole arrangement annoyed me, because that's just the kind of person I was.

Despite that I think feeling like shit for so long softened me up a little because shortly after that I met a girl (ONLINE!) and she hit me like a truck. I got almost addicted to her and we spent excessive amounts of time together – skyping and such. Suddenly I was able to feel like I never thought was possible for me. I felt things I could not bring up for people close to me, for my former girlfriends, for my family and that all despite not being able to see her for a long time. With all that new love I felt in me I started developing very negative traits too, like being jealous for the first time.. overly jealous, like extreme and irrational jealousy considering she wasn't even my girlfriend at that time. I was very overwhelmed with everything and I couldn't really make out that it was actually jealousy that I was feeling the first time it occured. I just felt sad and anxious suddenly and it took me a while to figure out how it is called.
Me being jealous, clingy and moody drove her to look for distance and ultimately take a break from me.

During that time I experienced sadness in the purest form for the first time I could remember.
And after being only sad for a day or too and having the pressure of it build up I was finally able to let lose and ended up crying for the first time in almost a decade. Let me tell you it was a very weird experience, I was almost happy about it, I felt like the biggest weight had been releaved and much better after I did. I started crying more often and more easily, for the next weeks pretty much daily. I developed the habbit of letting all the dissappointment and sadness stack up for a while and relieving everything by literally taking time to cry. That went on for a while since I felt like I didn't only lose my first love but also the person that opened me up to emotions in the first place.
But I ended up feeling even happier than when I still spent time with her.
We had a bit of contact then and there and ended up meeting when she was visiting my country for a schooltrip. It took about 20 minutes to convince her to come with me to my hotel room and make her fall for me and ultimately end up in a long distance relationship with me - obviously my feelings for her hadn't disappeared.

That was around 5 months ago and we are still together, we met 3 times since and I am overall pretty happy I would say, alltough the whole long distance thing is taking it's toll on me.
I also still get very jealous and overly emotional about her.

Apart from that I get overly emotional (mostly sad) about pretty much everything. Like I legit catch myself tearing up watching a movie or listening to a sad song ( because of a song, like wtf?). I cried like a baby looking at an imgur picture dump the other night – it wasn't even completely sad I really don't know what's wrong with me. I scrolled trough some asian comic about a guy and his demential wife he lost in a fire and cried for a solid 20 minutes. This is not a joke and I seriously feel like it can't be normal either. I don't know what could be causing this, maybe I am actually sick and forced to live at the extremes. Could be hormones aswell, maybe my emotionally numb phase was just my way of going trough puberty – either way I am at a loss. And I seriously feel like the way I am right now can't be normal either. And especially the transition from being emotionally numb to crying looking at picture dumps has me worried.

Maybe someone has some Ideas and even if I get no constructive responses I am still glad about the people reading until here. It definetly felt very releaving to get this all out and maybe some people are patient enough to read this. Thank you very much.
Oh yea, I am not a native english speaker so this might be a bit messed up but I gave my best.
