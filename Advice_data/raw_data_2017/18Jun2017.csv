6,"Just need some advice. I have an opportunity for a good job, about 25% pay raise, by moving to Seattle.

However, I've been given a chance to buy a house where I currently live for about 50% of its market value.

It needs serious repair, which I can afford, and I will still clear almost $100k, after which I can still move to Seattle and get a comparable job after it sells.

I would lose about a year in the process.

Am I stupid for wanting to walk away from this deal for $30k a year now?",18Jun2017,2

9,"So I haven't had sex in a year and haven't really had a normal session in more like 2 years. I devoloped a series of masturbatory fetishes and now I can only get off with my hand and I haven't had a single relationship since. I feel completely asexual when I'm not touching myself like my thing is shriveled and small feels really numb and dead and nothing turns me on but as soon as I touch it I literally go into 120% sex mode and want to fuck everything in sight but I just masturbate because I was the one that got myself hard. 

I still have violent urges to fornicate but I know I can't and I'm asexual anyway aside from fetishes or if I'm really turned on by something I can use regular porn but I feel like I'm just meant to crank it until I die. Is it normal to just jerk off and never be in a relationship? I don't think I have a choice. My parents keep pressuring me to date again but I haven't talked to a girl in years and I don't think I can perform sexually I feel like I'll have my asexual moment when I try to get with a girl and she'll laugh at me. 

The last time I tried having sex I kept getting distracted because my house is filled with noisy inconsiderate ass holes and I lost my boner and the girl literally just sat on her phone texting about it to all her friends and she said fuck you and stormed off and left without saying a word. 

I'm so scarred from that I can't possibly try to have sex again. It was hard enough to put myself out there and try and that was literally the worst result. I had sex one other time after that but I had to try as hard as I could to get like half way hard and by some miracle slipped it in and could barely stay hard and after 15 mins I lost it and she said she gave up and I didn't even get to finish. 

I used to have sex with my girlfriends every single day now I go years without having sex and can only get off when I'm alone with my fetishes. Am I just meant to be alone? I've tried like fucking crazy to give up these urges and they just won't go it's who I am now. 

I've tried online dating and relationships but my fetish somehow even messes that up and I usually end up saying some weird shit and they just vanish without a trace.",18Jun2017,2
11,"First I just want to thank you for reading my post.  I'm having the worst time of my life.

tl;dr I live in a tiny redneck town with no jobs.  Can I make a living online?  At this point I will stoop to new lows but I won't do anything illegal or naked, but I will write smut or sell a kidney. Help?

My boyfriend of 9 years doesn't want to be with me anymore.  I need to be able to cover all of my own expenses.

My current employer sucks.  Long story short, they screwed me out of insurance for the next 6 weeks.  They also keep sending us all home due to lack of work and the unemployment office doesn't care. My PTSD is getting so bad.  To keep things concise, this is by far the worst I've ever felt.

So, if I quit my crappy job I can get the help that I desperately need.  But if I quit, I'm stuck in this house with a boyfriend that doesn't want me but I'll have to depend on him.  If I wait 6 weeks I will run out of my refills on my heart and diabetes medication among others.  My conditions make it hard to for to work a traditional job anyhow.  My attendance is great then suddenly I get a bout of illness and I'm out for a week.

I'm looking for a job I can do from home that pays a living wage that doesn't require me to clock in and out everyday, so if I have 3 days straight of osmotic diarrhea and vomiting I won't be fired for not showing up to work.  No FMLA required.

I'm good at writing.  This entry may not be evidence of that, but I'm creative and I can tell a story.  I'm also a very skilled visual artist.  I have a bachelor's of science in psychology plus accolades.  

Can anyone tell me what I could do to make a living online?  I can't really do online surveys, Measurement Inc, or REV since they don't pay any better than China.  It needs to average about $15/hr to make it where I live.  Any ideas?

PS my max internet speed is 6mbps down, .06mbps up.  I live in the middle of nowhere.

12,"Ever since I was young I always compartmentalized my sex life/sexuality becuase of how I grew up, I was always indirectly taught that sex is naughty and shouldn't be talked about.



What I notice now in my mid 20s is that I have difficulty balancing sexuality with other parts of my life, like loved ones and responsibilities.



I've had a very strong fetish that I've had since a was a preteen that just seems to envelop my life if I let it. 



I've honestly gone through so many possibilites in my head. I of course have a career path I'm working towards, family, friends, and dreams I want to accomplish. I don't really see how my fetish fits into it, its difficult to image in my head.



But on the opposite side, I've honestly considered going full throttle finding a partner into the same stuff. Earning money online (by using my fetish through vids, pics, etc.) And just living a life completely encompassed in my sexuality and fetish.



Both options sounds appealing to me in different ways but I feel like if I have one I'll be giving up the other completely.

Its just difficult. I can have and enjoy ""regular"" sex but I enjoy things so much more when my fetish is involved, it just takes it to a whole new level.



Recently, I've noticed its just taking up so much of my time. I've literally spent all day just online looking for pics, vids of my fetish etc. I obviously have other stuff to do so I've started to block sites from my computer and started deleting pictures from my computer because it's gotten so distracting.



I've seen people online who completely deprive themselves of what they want sexually until they are in their late 40s and 50s. 



I don't want to put that part of my sexuality on the back burner for 2 decades. I don't want my life to be about giving up something I really love for the sake of it not being convenient.



This is all over the place, I apologize for that but I would really like some input. Maybe I'm just denying the inevitable.



I feel like there is some sort of balance that lets me have both that I just can't see.



What's your take on this? 
Do I just give in, be ""normal"" until I can afford to incorperate my fetish into my life again? Or should I try to incorperate it more realistically into my life?

I want to go into sonography.

Here are a few of my concerns : Should I postpone paying my loans for a few years while I go back to school? How would I even go about that? Deferment? 

I definitely will be pulling out more loans to go back to school, but I know I will pay it all back quickly once I graduate and get a job (I don't plan on having a family, SO, or other commitments. I'm currently happily married to my gaming PC).

According to my calculations, I roughly have 20k left I can pull from federal student loans to fund my second degree (which will mostly likely be too little). Money has always been a major discouragement for me, but I've realized that doing nothing is helping me right now.

Also how do you go about balancing working (possibly two jobs) and going to school?

22,"Hello everyone

Current job: RN

Seeking full time RN at another place

I applied and interviewed to this particular place. I heard back from the recruiter and she had good news for me. They called me Monday to offer me the job and ask what I was looking to get paid. The recruiter said i was asking higher than what they had in mind  but she would see what she can do and call me end of this week. I didn't hear from her so..

I called the recruiter, and  left a VM just yesterday (Fri) and asked if it was safe to say the job was mine, so that I can put in notice at my job.

She called me later and said an internal candidate  applied and they have to consider and give her a fair chance to inteview, and ""quite honestly it all happened very fast and was very unexpected"".  They will make a final decision next week. She said she wanted  to keep me in the loop to be fair. However, if they were to select the internal they wanted to offer me per diem. What worries me is the recruiter kept apologizing as if she was feeling sorry for me. 

What's your take? Will I get the job. I told my close friend and she says come on now, you know the company has to hire the internal employee, it's less training, less paper work, etc.

I'm kind of bummed out because I wanted the job. Have I lost to my dream job? Advice please.",18Jun2017,2

Uncle(2) and his kid will leave mid July. Grandparents get the guest room, Uncle(1) and aunt get my room, Uncle(2) and his kid get my brother's room. I am supposed to sleep in the living room, while my PC stays in my room. It's not an issue with me, I got a summer job, so I'll be gone 8-5 on the weekdays. It's the night that is the problem. I planned to stay up till 11-12 every night, making YouTube videos, gaming, chilling, etc being left on my own where no one will bother me, especially important for YouTube since I HATE having background noise, or constantly having to pause recordings whenever someone comes in my room. If it's my room, I can just close the door and no one will bother me. However, if it's in the living room, everyone is basically gonna stay on the first floor, chat, watch TV, etc and generate a lot of background noise. Now I wouldn't mind giving up my room and sharing it, like I use it all night, they sleep when I'm done, that's fine with me. But uncle(1) and aunt are the type of people that'll sleep kinda early and I can't move PC downstairs cause there will be a lot of background noise plus I won't have a big enough desk for PC and PS4, only desk big enough is my desk in my room. I can make makeshift desks, but it's gonna be noisy downstairs. Help?

28,"I'm a 17 year old kid (going into my final year in high school), and one of my closest friends is just confusing me with everything she's doing to me. 

She's one of my closest friends, even though we've only known each other just under two years. We got really close around September to December, until all of a sudden she started ignoring me. Not blatant ignoring, but before, she'd be constantly texting me (she's a very bubbly, outgoing person), then out of nowhere we barely texted. I'd text her trying to start a conversation but she would be completely dry, barely responding. 

Cue to a few months later, she starts talking to me again, and we become really close again. I then find out she has a crush on me. She told me she was gonna wait until Summer but she just had to tell me now, even if I didn't like her back. I asked her to be my girlfriend, and we start dating She's pretty excited about this, and tells a bunch of her friends, telling me that she was too excited to keep it quiet. A week later, she breaks up with me, saying she didn't want to lie to her parents about having a boyfriend (She's also pretty religious). I'm fine with this, because she says she's still into me. I figure that I'll wait and then ask her out in the future, maybe to senior prom. Even though we're broken up, we're still texting a lot like before. 

Then one day she goes completely dry on me again, barely responding to my texts. Then she says she's no longer into me, and doesn't want me to wait or whatever. She says she still wants to be friends, and I decide she's too valuable in my life to throw away this friendship. As of now, she's not ignoring me like before, but she's also a lot more distant. 

I don't understand what's going on. If I'm the one getting friend zoned, wouldn't it be me who gets all awkward? I'm trying to talk to her like we would before, just as friends, but now she's being all distant. I'm not sure what to make of this. I know I should confront her about this, but I'd like to know if I'm missing something here. Also, the time span of us dating to her telling me she's not into me anymore is like 2 and a half weeks.

35,"So, bit of a weird post here but I am looking for some advice.  

I am friends with someone on Facebook.  Not really good friends, just someone I met years ago and never talk to.  Anyways, recently they made a Facebook post that has me conflicted.  Basically they posted bragging about shooting someone that was on their property.  The gist of the story is it was night and they saw someone walking with a flashlight on their property and they went out weapons in hand and shot at them.  Even said that the person should have zigzagged instead of running in a straight line which makes me think that they shot at them while they were running away.  

They said that they were happy to live in a ""make my day state.""  They live in Colorado which has a law like that but apparently the law stops at your front door.  Your backyard, porch, etc. doesn't count.  From what they described this person wasn't in their house, just on their property at night with a flashlight.  Now my dilemma is that while that person could have potentially been up to something at the same time there is a chance that it was just someone who needed directions, was lost, or something like that.  I know there are stupid people out there but I don't think you go to rob a house that has its lights on at night while shining a flashlight everywhere.

I am just afraid that this person is just looking for an excuse to shoot someone and one day might actually hurt or kill someone who just happened to be walking near their property.  Should I let the police know about this?

I know gun control is a complicated subject on here but the way they told the story makes me think that they  could potentially hurt or kill someone in the future.  I am not trying to say nobody should be able to have guns but I do believe that there are some trigger happy people out there who probably shouldn't.  Anyone have any advice?

Also thanks for reading all this!

EDIT: First off I wanted to say thanks for all of the advice.  I decided to report them to their state's Crimestoppers.  I sent them screenshots of their posts and their comments and a short message saying why I was concerned.

This person has a history of lying so there is a really good chance this story isn't true.  But even if they're lying what concerned me is that they seem to misunderstand the law there and are just looking for a reason to shoot someone.  I don't want someone walking by their house and getting shot.  But seriously thank you for all the advice!",18Jun2017,19

39,"So I've recently learned that i(once again)have failed my math course for the year. I got out of school for the summer about a month ago and am a rising junior. This past year I was a sophomore in a freshman level class, and as I already mentioned, I failed, meaning I'll have to retake the course again next year. 

To make a long story short: I used to go to a series of very poor schools in the past and ended up being left behind about three years worth of math. I've never been skilled at math, and my current situation isn't helping. Despite managing to catch up in all my other subjects, I couldn't catch up in math and I find it highly unlikely that I'll ever succeed in that area. 

At the end of the day, I'm completely incompetent in math beyond a fifth grade level and I'm wondering if I should drop out because I don't want to waste anyone's time.

There's a person in my life who, putting it bluntly, seems fixated on torture/execution videos. Mostly being animal abuse/terrorist executions. 

Now, we all have a curious side to us that runs a little deeper into the darker parts. This is just human nature. The reason why so many of us find serial killers fascinating. 

But there's just something about actually watching someone die right infront of your eyes, that even for me (horror fan. Not squeamish. Training in psychology so these kind of things crop up sometimes), is stepping over a line. Especially involving babies and children. (This said person was watching a video of kids being set alight in some terror attack in Syria) (believe it was Syria. Not sure)

i have been friends with this girl for around two years now. let's call her ""penny"". penny was a really sweet girl at the beginning of our friendship but as time went on and she got comfortable, she became somewhat of an ass. and i understand, when friends become comfortable, banter happens BUT she was very mean spirited. she would constantly make fun of the way i do my makeup, would make jokes about my aspergers, make fun of my hobbies (i don't drink or smoke or party), etc. just nonstop heckling but more times than not it would go way too far. i confronted her about this, and she stopped (somewhat), still making jokes but not as harsh. 
earlier in the year, she just about dropped me as a friend, didn't reach out to me for about two weeks, found a new crowd and started drinking like crazy. one night, she got extremely wasted and had sex with a guy in front of everyone at a party. after that situation, she came to me and vowed to never drink and be more like me (staying straight edge, finding new things to do). her and i became very close for a short period of time. but that changed when she got wrapped up in this group yet again. 
she has not texted me in 2 weeks, every time i reach out to ask how she's doing or to hang out, she leaves me on read and i later see her on snapchat dancing on tables, drinking like crazy, doing coke, etc. 
tonight i ran into her at a corner store, i waved to her, and she didn't even acknowledge me and her new boyfriend (mind you, we are 16 year olds!!!!!), starting flipping off my dad and screaming fuck you at me. mind you, i have never met this kid. 
obviously, i know i need to drop this girl. i am the type of person who will not beg someone to be in their life and i feel as though i have given her way too many chances.

47,"I am a cook by trade. Right now I ""work"" at two different places, one full time, the other on-call. The on-call one is a golf course that is kind of remote and thus hard to attract people to work there. There's more of a ""family"" attitude in this place; people joke around, help each other but there's also lot of gossips. I am in charge of their banquet department along with a partner, Dee.

The FT one is a casino that has lot of resources at their disposal. I used to work for their banquet department and they really like me because I am a good worker. 

The story goes like this. I used to work at the casino but I left and started working part time at the golf course (let's call it GC) for one and a half year. During the March - May,  business started getting slow and I basically have no hour so I started looking for jobs. One of my really good friends recommended me to go back to my old job (casino). I decided to take her advice. Before I went for the interview, I told a few people and this, to me, is seen as a big mistake since people all gave me good words. Interview is basically just a formality since the person, Jason, who interview me really like me. I told them I can start working at June. Jason asked me if I want to work PT or FT and I made a really huge mistake telling him FT. I don't know why I did that since I can always do PT and see and go FT later.

In May, business started to pick up at the GC place and I am actually earning decently (hours + tips) with a lot of flexibility (day off any day I want). I am so busy I basically have little to no day off. At the same time, our old sous chef quit and we hired a new chef. Needless to say, lot of people quit along with the old sous chef. I stayed to help out the banquet department and realized that I actually like working for the new chef. When I told him I am about to leave (not quit since I am on-call), it was sad to see his expression. Regardless, he gave me a gift for sticking up with him. It may have been a manipulation tactics but I still like working for him since he has a good managing philosophy.

A week ago, I started working at the casino place while the GC place is falling a part. People are walking out or no show. Nobody want to apply for jobs there, etc. On the other hand, the casino has way too much resources. I am basically struggling to find work when at the GC place I am struggling to keep up. I also experienced more authority that I don't experience at the GC place and I need to be more careful all the time. I felt less open to express myself at the Casino compared to GC.

Right now, I am really torn between going back to the GC place to help them out (turning FT and I can guaranteed to ask for higher pay), or stay at a place with less flexibility and a less ""fitting"" environment. If I go back to the old place, I am basically burning my bridge and betraying the trust and good words many people. If I do stay at the Casino, however, I felt like I am betraying myself and my own principle.

49,"My parents decided to end their marriage of 3 decades last week. My mother cheated on my father, but this was the result of a dark family history I've only recently learned about. My older siblings have told me some terrible things about their relationship, mainly that my dad was incredibly emotionally manipulative and threatened suicide and even physical harm to my mother if she left him. Things quieted down when I was born, but my dad started stalking my mom because of the cheating and put tracking devices in her car. My oldest sister basically forced my mother to leave so they could finally divorce. 

Today my little brother and I visited her new place and everything went fine. The trouble came when we came home and my dad started talking to her. Once he came back he sort of told me that he never wants me to stay over there because my mom will let me interact with the ""other man"" and get me to hate him (my dad if that's unclear)

I know he's very dishonest so I know my mom didn't say anything like that, but that's how it is. I'd prefer to stay with my mom because I feel my dad is very mentally unstable. I'm also gay and he's homophobic, and I'd feel my mother would be more accepting of me. 

At the end of it all I just feel very alone. I turn 18 in a few months and am going to college next year, so it's only a year of my life, but it's hard feeling like I have nowhere to go. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. ",18Jun2017,34
51,"Tw self harm/suicide

I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years and have been crying nonstop since. It was a necessary thing to do and I made the right choice, but I'm so overwhelmed. Nothing I do is helping. Listening to music just makes me cry more. I'm not asking how to move on from a break up, I want to know how to stop these breakdowns and cope through them. If this continues, I'll end up begging my boyfriend to take me back, which he will. I can't do that. I need to be strong and get through this. I am for the most part, but, like it is right now, it can be so fucking hard. What do I do? How can I stop crying? I know distractions are a thing, but I don't want to rely on that. I need to know how to think my way out of crying, because at work there is nothing I can distract myself with, so I just cry in front of customers and can't stop. What the fuck do I do.

Tldr how do I stop crying without just distracting myself????",18Jun2017,2
52,"Hi. I'm 17 and I've had my permit for almost 2 years now. About 6 months after I got my permit, I was pulling the car into the garage, not pressing on the gas and just letting it go slowly in. As I was doing this I thought to myself ""it'd be so scary if I hit the gas instead of the break."" I then realized I was getting too close to the back wall of the garage and went to hit the break. Well, I panicked and hit the gas. Went right through the back wall of my garage, totaling a couple thousand for damage to the house and car. 

Ever since my one and only accident, it makes me nervous to drive. I feel like I can't pay attention to everything at every moment like you're supposed to. Sometimes I'll see a stop sign, and that registers in my head, but I'll go right through it mindlessly if there are no cars coming. I know one of these days I'm gonna get in another wreck because my mind wanders so much while driving, whether the radio is on and people are talking or not. I'm not ready to drive on my own, I'm too nervous. I have to get my license soon because I start community college in the fall and I have to drive myself.

54,"I was drinking earlier tonight and we were going through a parking lot to get to a buddy's house. There has been a car parked in that lot for many months now and we always see it. The tires are deflated and its all dusty. There was rumours going around that it belonged to a drug dealer that got killed. Anyways my friend that was driving (was sober) pulled up and said he wanted to break into the car and I was like fuck it lets do it. So he tried breaking the driver window without success and i gave it a try too but it didnt break. He picked up a rod and busted open the rear wind shield and we sat in the car and tried to find anything interesting in this abandoned car (found some drugs and a tazer). Anyways it was fun and all but now the regret is coming in. I'm normally a law abiding citizen, I don't know why I participated in that. Should I be worried?

56,"Okay, here goes. I imagine many of you would scrunch up your nose at this. I'll try to simplify it.

My background:

I dropped out of high school because I was sick and tired of it. Its safe to assume what those issues are, but it was a reactionary choice and left me feeling sorry for myself for an extended period of time lasting for about five years. Being lazy has a lot to do with it. I postponed the English/Language Arts portion of the GED for one year because I was overly fearful of the 45 minute extended response. In total, it took two years for me to finish the GED because I thought I was idiot. Still do. 
Besides languishing in the high school diploma program, I luckily gained some confidence interacting with others on polite grounds at my parent's donut shop within those stagnating years. However it's just day in, day out, going through the motions. 
Most people would say that I'm ungrateful, and I would have no choice but to agree. 

The problem:

A high school friend of mine, though not close, seems to understand how shit went back in the day. I told him maybe a year or so before, that I was sheltered (it's very likely to be true). He told me that I wasn't. (A pick-up artist or con-artist sensed my insecurity and compared his experience on the streets as a homeless, drug addict for 2-3 years. My mom who has been through far worse doesn't brag or barely talks about her life experiences to anyone saw through his BS.) Anyways this friend and I have corresponded today, we exchanged phone numbers but I don't have texting. I didn't call him for a week or so because I didn't know what to talk about. I thought I would bore him or come across as annoying or maybe worse... So I lost his number, but then I tried to see him at his workplace today with some japanese kit-kat. He says we should hang out. We're going to hang out, but I think I'm going to embarrass myself. 
Overall, I feel like I don't have an opinion worth sharing...

The Good:

I do read occasionally. I've been into Natsuo Kirino, lately. 
I do draw occasionally. I receive compliments often, but I don't believe I'm creative. I've recently joined free drawing sessions with live models and attend art classes outside the college for two years.
I listen to podcasts and the radio.
I'm doing my summer semester at the community college. I completed two semesters so far, but I don't know what I want. My HD-101 teacher liked me because I was a people-pleaser, identified with the underdog, and suggested twice I should apply for Honor courses--and I did my best to complete the course-work, but I should have failed the class. 
I have interests but I don't delve into anything too seriously. 
I have gotten into the habit of speed walking about forty-five minutes after work at the park.

58,"Just needed some advice! I am about to start the last season of The Office. I absolutely love the show, and am a huge fan. I also have a tendency to watch a large number of episodes at once haha. I watched the first three seasons in one weekend if that says anything. Should I try to watch this last season in moderation, as it is the last season, or enjoy it like I normally do?

60,"Okay so one day I was at work and my little sisters friend texts me asking if I'm free. I said sure and after work i pick her up and we head back to my hosue and chat. I asked her if my sister knows she is here and her friend says ""no""

My sister hates when I hangout or even talk with her friends so we promised to keep this hangout on the DL

The hangout was amazing and fun. Her friend and I ended up bonding and soon we ended up talking about my sister. Her friend tells me that my sister is acting like a jerk and is being very conceited. I agreed with this because she is mean to me as well, but what her friend was going to tell me next I didn't expect.

She told me my sister drinks and not occasionally, but often. I was shocked and didn't believe her. Her friend brought me upstairs where she took my sisters swell bottle (my Christmas gift to her) she says smell it and I did. It smelled like vodka. Apparently my sister drinks for fun and takes vodka from the downstairs basement. I was horrified and I felt like a failure as the oldest sibling in the household. I am 18 and I've never stolen alcohol from my parents nor drink when I'm bored. 

But that's not it. Her friend continued saying that when my sister gets drunk she becomes mean, touchy, and crazy. She's said mean things to her friends and apparently I've walked in on them when my sister is drunk but I never noticed! Again what is wrong with me!

Okay so a little background information on my sister. She does not show a lot of emotion and when she does it's mostly anger. I've had some problems with body image and my sister would say to me that ""that's a me problem"" and ""get over it"" and sometimes before I would eat something she would tell me ""you shouldn't eat that"" or ""that'll make you fat"" I do a lot for my sister. I drive her places. Ask her how everything is and do the absolute best to be a good role model. But she's a stone cold bitch and we have some good moments but now I'm on a whole different level


So of course I was in denial and I did some snooping. I went through her room and found two mini bottle of vodka that were empty, then I smelled her swell bottle and found that it was used again. I saw her schedule planning thing and I read it and saw some entries that say she ""drank myself to sleep"" and "" threw up everywhere"" 

My attitude has completely changed and I give my sister the cold shoulder. I can't even look at her and I feel so betrayed. She's made fun of me in the past and calls me out for stuff and I'll do the same but to an extent, BUT ever since I've been giving her the cold shoulder and have been making mean comments (which I feel terrible for and sometimes I wanna stop but I can't) she shows concern and lately had asked ""hey are you alright?"" Or ""what's going on?"" As well as ""how was your day!"" , and ""how's life?"" She's been becoming more and more concerned but I don't wanna here it. 

Like tonight she asked ""hey are you okay? Is life treating you okay?"" And I snapped and said ""I don't know you tell me"" she got quiet and began to text on her phone. I was watching some stupid videos on my phones because it calms me down and she never ever takes INTEREST in what I watch and asked ""what are you watching"" I don't know why she is suddenly starting to care! So I have to be a bitch just to get respect? Like cmon!

I don't see my sister as my sister and after all the bad things I've heard I am so shocked. I'm heart broken and her friends were upset when they told me this because they knew it would break my heart. I care about t family deeply but now I don't know what to think. This week has been pretty rough and I don't know what to do. My attitude has changed and I find myself becoming sadder and sadder.


I can't tell my mom because she will lock my sister up and she will feel heart broken 

My dad will be outraged and I don't know why he will do

But I'm leaving for college in two months which means my younger siblings have this jerk of a sister who is starting to drink as a role model? What am I supposed to do?

I am currently a uni student doing Bachelor in IT. I am currently in my second year, although wasted alot of time in uni (about 1.5 years) failing/not knowing what to do etc. I would say my passion for what I am studying is not that high to begin with. I have another 1.5 years to go assuming i dont fail anymore subjects (which is unlikely).

Currently, I am working at a restaurant as a casual for about 6 months. I progressed pretty quickly there and now was given thoughts on being a supervisor. The thing is I am halfway through my application at Apple to be a store assistant. I am confused to whether to leave the restaurant if i were to be successful and start at Apple from the bottom (and somehow related to what i am studying) or just stay and get promoted to a supervisor.

Here is why I am so torn to what to do. Eventhough I am currenly doing a degree in IT, I actually am thinking of opening a small cafe or food business in the future. This made me think that if i were to stay at the restaurant and eventually progress higher up the managment role, I could gain a lot of experience for the future. While on the other hand I believe working at Apple will be a lot better in terms of company culture, working environment etc.

Now I'm at a point in my life where alcohol is having a severely adverse impact on me and the people around me, when I drink I can't just stop at one or even 10, I drink until I pass out or run out of money, I do stupid things that I would never normally do and recently decided to drink drive, I experience blackouts as a rule every time I drink leading to anxiety about what I did the night before. I have come to the conclusion that alcohol is the major contributing factor in my life that is causing me harm both psychically and mentally, however and here is my dilemma without alcohol I would not be able to socialise which means I would be going back to being by myself, trapped in my head with no one to talk to.

I am currently 15 guy, and I live in a small town, with a happy family. I do not have any relationships with abuse, rape, drugs or anything like that, so let's just say I am clean.

Then I was told I had to move out of Holland to Belgium. I wasn't too happy about that, and was really disappointed at my ""international"" school. Teachers were meh, less motivating and most people were assholes.

At that school, my grades went up and down (down currently). I've had bad relationships with many people and started to lose motivation really badly. My grandmother, whom I was really close to, passed away in December. I guess that caused me to have huge mood swings (happy one day, depressed shithead the other day), and more arguments between me and my parents.

The past month, I've had a lot of though of just running away from my house, and going back to Rotterdam. I know it's a VERY stupid move if I do that, but I can't help but think about it.

I'm posting this on many sub-reddits because, frankly, I don't know where to go.

SAAS is saying that they need to pay them about #1,6000 for something that isn't clearly defined. They also say that his accounts will be taken by a debt collector company and he will be taken to court.

Throwaway obviously, (located in Australia).

I work for a big 4 in one of our country's major cities. I am junior in the office having only had the job for 6 months or so. Anyway Friday afternoon I was called into the office and sat down with a partner of the firm and HR, they told that I was being suspended effectively immediately but they couldn't tell me what for, all they said was that the allegations had been made in the last few days. The partner told me that they were in full support should I need anything, and to give them a call. They also said that I would be called in for an interview once they have investigated further. They said I could have someone with me, and that that was recommend. I questions as to who, and if I needed a lawyer but they recommend that it was someone from within the firm but it could not be a partner.

15 minutes later they called me and said that they wanted to let me know what the allegations were about. I sat down with just the HR people this time and they said that it was drug usage, particularly at work events (our company does a lot of work drinks on a Friday. I (like the previous meeting) was in shock and they asked me if I had a reaction. I didn't say anything because I know how things you say can be used against you. They then told me that I was free to go, and that they would be in contact Monday.

After speaking with friends over the weekend they have advised me that I should seek legal advice with an industrial/employment lawyer, and that I should in fact take them with me to the interview. Any of the events they are referring to happened at least two weeks prior. 

I really value this job, It is such a privilege to be working there and I wouldn't want to jeopardise the opportunity in anyway.

But it's hard since I suffer anxiety and constantly imagine the worst. I'm scared I don't really know who he is anymore and this will all happen again and that when he cheated, maybe he knew exactly what he was doing.

113,"Hello, 

Looking for advice on how to approach someone who has become unresponsive during a financial transaction. Here is the history summed up:

I finally am getting a puppy after many years of patiently waiting for my life to be stable enough. After researching breeders, I made a $1,000 deposit with one who seemed excited to work with me, was thoughtful with her responses, and had a responsible/reliable history.

The breeder's website clearly outlines her process and expectations for receiving a puppy. They include a birth announcement, individual pictures from which to select your puppy (this happens prior to 5 weeks of age), an invitation to visit at 5 weeks, and then confirmation of a time to take the puppy home at 7-8 weeks.

Communication started to go downhill once the puppies were born: the breeder quickly updated her website with an announcement of the birth, but failed to alert me individually as her website promised until I emailed her 5 days later to confirm. 

Then, 25 days passed until I heard from her again: I emailed twice within that length of time with some questions and a request for the individual pictures so I could express my choice of puppy. I also wrote her to suggest a different visiting time, as I would not be able to make the preset date. She did not respond until the night before the preset 5 week visit when she apologized for being out of touch and promised to send me pictures the following morning (yesterday), and talk with me more then. 

Needless to say, the breeder did not follow through with her promise to contact me. I left her two voicemails yesterday, reminding her that I was unable to visit on the preset date, but still wanted to choose my puppy before other visitors made their selections (she told me I had 2nd pick). 

To compound all of this, I am leaving the country next Friday for a vacation, and immediately driving to the breeder (2 hours away) to pick up my puppy when I return two weeks from now. I won't have a reliable way to reach her or be reached while I am gone, so am feeling extra pressure to resolve this before I leave. 

In all of my communication with the breeder, I have done my best to remain calm, open, and friendly. Only in one voicemail yesterday did I express my disappointment in her lack of follow through, and my feelings of frustration. Even so, I did not raise my voice, swear, or argue. I have tried to be patient and understanding of her other commitments, and I feel neglected and ignored by her.

Am I overreacting? Any advice on moving forward and/or dealing with someone who has inconsistent communication when I am someone who prioritizes clear, thoughtful responses?

Thank you for any helpful insights.

It seems that my upper canine tooth is taking the most of it-I am having severe sharp surface pains shooting through my tooth every minute or so. It started in my dream. I was having a full on dream and in the dream the pain started. I woke up and it continued. I took advil to see if it will calm it down. I KNOW I do not need a root canal in that area. It is not affected by ice on the tooth either. It feels like air going into an open cavity intensely. Does anyone know what I can do?

120,"Hello,

Im a 26 year old. I have to warn you this is not a troll post. 

Im really ugly; its a fact. I have no friends and my life consists onl of:


1.- Waking up and working out/running (depends of the day)

2.- Clean my parents house (where i live) cook, house chores

3.- Religiously practicing music; guitar / studying music theory and ear training 

4.- Smoking weed at the end of the day as a reward


I have t o add , sometimes I make free lance jobs as a translator for some small money that I use for me and to bring some stuff to the table. 


My parents are worried about me, they think I need to go back to a psychatrist therapy, but I dont want to be prescribed Klonopin and Remeron again; they make me feel like a zombie. 

So , my mom was talking to me last day and told me that they want to pay some Marketing studies for me, to improve my CV and that stuff. I know they do this of good faith and I appreciate it.

But I have talked to them many times before. I wont be able (and I dont want to) have my own family. Im subhuman, no girl likes me and I have 0 social life. Im just a rotten carcass of a person and I dont want to deal with all the stuff that studying on an academy brings; group assignments, the need to communicate with other students, stuff like that.

I know that you go to a place to study not to make social life, however, we cant deny that social life and connections are part of all that life. I dont want it, I dont want to exist because there is no one out there for me. That is one of the reasons I dont have social media. I dont trust anyone but my family, pets or my musical instruments.

123,"Okay, here goes. I imagine many of you would scrunch up your nose at this. I'll try to simplify it.

My background:

I dropped out of high school because I was sick and tired of it. Its safe to assume what those issues are, but it was a reactionary choice and left me feeling sorry for myself for an extended period of time lasting for about five years. Being lazy has a lot to do with it. I postponed the English/Language Arts portion of the GED for one year because I was overly fearful of the 45 minute extended response. In total, it took two years for me to finish the GED because I thought I was idiot. Still do. Besides languishing in the high school diploma program, I luckily gained some confidence interacting with others on polite grounds at my parent's donut shop within those stagnating years. However it's just day in, day out, going through the motions. Most people would say that I'm ungrateful, and I would have no choice but to agree. I've told myself that I was better off not having friends. But admittedly, pretending to be the introvert, is not working. I've wasted so much time, most of the time I don't even want to get up from bed.

The problem:

A high school friend of mine, though not close, seems to understand how shit went back in the day. I told him maybe a year or so before, that I was sheltered (it's very likely to be true). He told me that I wasn't. (A pick-up artist or con-artist sensed my insecurity and compared his experience on the streets as a homeless, drug addict for 2-3 years. My mom who has been through far worse doesn't brag or barely talks about her life experiences to anyone saw through his BS.) Anyways this friend and I have corresponded today, we exchanged phone numbers but I don't have texting. I didn't call him for a week or so because I didn't know what to talk about. I thought I would bore him or come across as annoying or maybe worse... So I lost his number, but then I tried to see him at his workplace today with some japanese kit-kat. He says we should hang out. We're going to hang out, but I think I'm going to embarrass myself. Overall, I feel like I don't have an opinion worth sharing...

The Good:

I do read occasionally. I've been into Natsuo Kirino, lately. I do draw occasionally. I receive compliments often, but I don't believe I'm creative. I've recently joined free drawing sessions with live models and attend art classes outside the college for two years. I listen to podcasts and the radio. I'm doing my summer semester at the community college. I completed two semesters so far, but I don't know what I want. My HD-101 teacher liked me because I was a people-pleaser, identified with the underdog, and suggested twice I should apply for Honor courses--and I did my best to complete the course-work, but I should have failed the class. I have interests but I don't delve into anything too seriously. I have gotten into the habit of speed walking about forty-five minutes after work at the park.",18Jun2017,1

134,"Just to warn you, this is a specific, slightly complex, and certainly very strange problem which may be why I have no idea who to talk to about it. 


For about five years now, I think I have been unknowingly saying my thoughts out loud. As in, I do not have any intention of saying anything, and I don't hear myself speak, but I think it may be happening nonetheless. Sometimes I feel a little warning, like tension is rising before it happens but not always. This came about suddenly but it took me a while to catch on.



Before you back out- obviously, I know that's crazy. I would have to be crazy to be unaware of my own actions, or to think that anything like that could happen at all, so initially I assumed I was dissasociating or delusional, went to a psych and was told that it was all just anxiety. 



Responses that I receive to my thoughts from people that I know well have been chalked up to coincidence, which is fairly believable.  I started to get severely anxious when this began and had a lot of intrusive thoughts, making matters worse. I was constantly mentally banging my head against a wall, if that makes any sense. Okay, it was clear that I had anxiety issues. I almost wished that I was crazy, because it would make things simpler.



Now I am a pretty calm person. I can't bring myself to care very much anymore and anti-depressants seem to have wiped the anxiety away. 



So, now that the anxiety is gone, this is still an ongoing problem. After five years how many coincidences can one person take? It happens too often, people responding to things I never had any intention of saying. Some things that I say are benign, some things are rude, some are embarrassing



For a benign example, leaving a classroom recently a teacher called after me, made eye contact and said, ""Thank you, Inputconfused001."" I turned around confused and wondering if she was talking to someone else before realizing that I had idly thought her dress looked nice. 



This happens far too often. My thoughts spark discussion, prompt answers, etc, and only I would truly know the difference between my thoughts and words. Clearly I'm not psychic(that would be crazy), I guess I'm not insane, people with tourettes are aware of what they say, right? I can't be disassociating, I'm not anxious anymore, I'm too tired to be.



So what is this? Could there be something physically wrong with my brain? If I seek an MD, I will be referred to a psych, and if I seek a psych I will be referred to an MD. Nobody wants to deal with something that they don't understand, it seems. I'm hoping that you think differently. 



One more strange factor to throw into the mix is that at around the same time this began, my vision became covered in static. No, it's not blurry vision, it is static. Believe it or not. I thought wow, I'm insane. My perception of reality is completely screwed. I can't trust anything I see. This further led me to believe that I was delusional or disassociating, which according to psychs I've seen means I am rational and just anxious and probably ought to visit an eye doctor.



 More recently I wonder if the static is a sign that something actually went wrong in my brain and whether or not it is connected to the speaking thoughts aloud thing. 



Any input whatsoever would be very much appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read through this convoluted mess.",18Jun2017,1

142,"Hi all. Just some background on me... I'm 26, got a decent job and am doing okay for myself, slowly paying off student loans living in a 1 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend. I have one sister and she's doing well for herself too but neither of us have any excess cash really. My dad lives 2 hours from me, my sister is currently in another country. 

My dad has had financial issues for as long as I've been alive. My parents declared bankruptcy​ and divorced in the late 90's. He's a smart guy but is often unwilling to work, he was most successful working in finances but his current bad credit means he can't really have those jobs anymore. He worked at Wal Mart for a few years and then a screen printing shop, during this time I was living with him in a small trailer, I eventually moved out while  in college. Since then he has been evicted twice, has burned bridges with about 3 phone companies he now owes money to, and he lives in the back of his screen printing shop of which he's now the owner.

He's the only one working there and he doesn't really get much business. He owes thousands in rent, taxes, and is always on the verge of having internet and electric for the office turned off. He's 60 and has heart disease, a few years back he nearly died, since then he's changed his diet, lost a lot of weight, and he is much more healthy.  He is on a lot of medication now and he still gets exhausted pretty easily.  That said, he doesn't really push to keep his business afloat, things are hard for him but he always has an excuse as to why he's not doing more to help his business. 

Basically at any moment any number of people could shut down the business and start liquidating because of all the debt he is in, and then he'd be completely homeless. His goal is to do non profit Christian events and charity outreach in the Philippines and right now most of his energy goes into finding a way to move to the Philippines . He's also engaged to someone over there he met online. He says it's love but I can't help but doubt her motives.

On top of that he has a tick problem and is often covered with bites, and can't really get rid of them because he doesn't have a good way to stay clean there where he's living. I have tried to help with poison and stuff but they keep coming back.

He thinks someone should buy the business or just fund his charitable mission, but he isn't doing any extra work himself. He is confident God will take care if him and isn't really doing anything extra to make this happen, and he has said that he does t want to ""live just to live"" by which he means he's unwilling to do work just to keep surviving, he wants to do these events and that's pretty much it. 

I know it's a lot but I don't know what to do, it sounds like he'll be homeless or in jail within a few months. Are there any programs out there that might help with something like this? Is there anything I can do? Do you think he could get on disability or something like that?

174,"Hi all,

I guess to answer this, you'll need to some backstory.

I've been with my girlfriend (B) about two years, and my best friend (let's call her P) for the last five years has been a women who I used to work with and now lives about two miles away. We used to hang out a lot, go to festivals, day trips away, etc. etc. She's told me before that she had feelings for me, and that she would try and get rid of them so she could let me be with my girlfriend. In the end she couldn't, and would often poison my thinking towards whoever I was with relationship-wise (she's broken me up with two people) so we went our separate ways. It might sound like something I should have done a lot sooner, but then again, when you're that close to someone and you have so much in common, it can be hard to see clearly.

Anyway, my girlfriend and I were going through a rough time, and went on a break of sorts. I had a family member die on the 5th May (second death in just a few months of close family) and I was feeling pretty low on accounts of the break and the deaths and having some drinks at home. P messaged me, and asked if I wanted someone to talk to and just watch some TV with. Initially I said no, but after a few more drinks, I agreed.

She came around, one thing led to another, and we were having sex. I was pretty drunk, and I realised what was happening, and just before it was too late, I realised how risky it was (P isn't on protection on account of the hormones 'messing her up') so I tried to withdraw. She wouldn't let me, wrapped her legs around me, and held me there until it was done.

I was pretty angry at this, and we went our separate ways again. I was worried, as I had remembered her mentioning the month before how she'd had a weird, 10-day period (don't ask me why she told me). By my calculations, the night we had sex was pretty risky. I mentioned this to her, and she said it was fine, she couldn't even get pregnant because she has polycystic ovaries.

I messaged her two weeks later, to check she wasn't pregnant. She said ""I'm actually not pregnant, by body is doing that thing it does about three days before I get a period"".  Okay, I thought, relax.

Having been broken up with B, and with P broadly out of my life and not poisoning my thoughts anymore, I realised more than ever that all I was ever thinking about was B, how she was, how much I missed her. I realised that I wanted to give it a proper shot, without P in my ear the whole time.

On Monday (22nd May) I messaged P to tell her that this is what I wanted (she was working about 50 miles away at this point for a few weeks) and that that was what I was going to do. All good.

That night, I get a message asking if she could come round. She said she was at her mother's. I knew straight away what it was.

She came over, and said she was pregnant (this was at 8PM, having mentioned nothing at 1PM that day). She produced two positive pregnancy tests (First Response) and said that it was entirely up to me how involved I did, or didn't want to be. She was remarkably collected for someone who had only found out that day. She had already spoken to her mother, and two friends who she got in touch with when she couldn't reach her mother (all people I know). I felt heartbroken, and I spent most of the night throwing up. She said she was keeping it, and that was pretty much that. ""Nothing needs to change for you,"" she said.

The next day she made a doctors appointment, and went at 9.40. At 9.50 I had a message to say the test was confirmed, and that her midwife's appointment would be on 22nd June.

Having spoken with my family and friends, I think it's clear she's used this to trap me. She did not have the reaction of someone who didn't want to get pregnant, or to whom this was a shock. I had become a side detail. I knew that, given that I felt like this had been stolen from me, that I didn't want any involvement or updates from her, and I told her that by message. I was also convinced that if I were involved, the child would be weaponised as every relationship I've had since I've known her has been. (For the record, her and her mother and exceptionally wealthy people, and I know the baby would want for nothing at all with or without my involvement).

It's now almost a month later, and since I sent her that message (23rd May) I've heard nothing. From her, or her friends, or her family. I've also discovered that the GP Surgery where she's having her midwife appointment on 22nd June (a Thursday) only do appointments on Monday afternoons. In fact, when she claims to be having her appointment, the surgery is closed every week (Thursday afternoon).

Her social media is full of posts of her going to the gym and running, with cryptic clues left in about feeling ill, or being extremely tired, or seeing a film sober for the first time.

I would have expected to have had some kind of abuse from her family or friends in this time.

Why would someone who believes they can't get pregnant be testing 17 days after having sex unless they were trying to?

It also seems convenient that all this happened just hours after I'd said I wanted to give it a proper shot with B.

My friends and family all say something feels wrong about it, like it doesn't feel natural or too convenient.

She posts a lot of her run times on Instagram, and by now she'd be 8 weeks pregnant ish. Yet no changes to her pace, even in searing heat today.

In my gut, I know the timing was risky, and I do feel in my gut that P probably is pregnant. But what do you think?

Also - I realise that this whole thing probably makes me seem morally reprehensible to some people. That's fair enough, but I can't change it now. It's the situation I'm in.

P.S. I told B all of this, all of the details, and she's decided to stick by me. I fully intend to marry this woman, and again, without P poisoning my thoughts, we're truly happy.",18Jun2017,1

I'm having an issue that I'd love to get some advice on. If there's a better sub for this, let me know.
I'm expecting to get a job offer in the next week. When I get that, I'll be turning in notice at my job that I've had for 10 years. My issue is that the first week of July I'll be going on vacation, I already have plane tickets. If I get the offer any time other than tomorrow, my 2 weeks notice will overlap with my vacation time. My current employer has a strict policy that you cannot use paid time off once you've turned in notice, and that if you do not give 2 weeks notice, you are not eligible for re-hire. The new company has mentioned July 17 as a potential start date. There's a group training I'll need to participate in to start.
The options that I see: 1. Give a 2 weeks notice that lasts for 3 weeks, offering to work last week of June and 2nd week of July with 1 week of vacation (probably unpaid) in between 2. Pay $200 or more to cancel my trip 3. Ask the new company to postpone my start date

178,"Brief overview of my life: 35. Been in several relationships but none longer than my marriage that lasted 3 years. 

The same pattern is evident, including my marriage: I was a very vulnerable person. The girls I end up with are the ones that are very aggressive, initiating the conversation. What follows is never good. 

Not to say I'm so shy that I can't talk to girls; it's not that simple. I'm shy in initial courtship, not making moves when they're obvious to make. Once I get past that barrier, I'm quite open. 

Lately, it's actually far worse than it ever was. I've literally dodged opportunities to get numbers from girls. 

I know I'm attractive, and know what to say. I just don't do it very well. 

It's a maddening cycle for me, because my dating pool is only getting worse (fact). I have a set of standards, but over analyze conversations and what the purpose is when talking to girls. When the right criteria is met (cute, nice, conversation is rolling), I have a fear of screwing it up overwhelm me, and it shows. 

A classic fear of rejection. But I don't understand why I still have it. I'm not looking for a future wife. 

I'm not asking for the bullet point that will change my life. What I'm looking for is solid references to books/videos etc that can help me with the basics, or maybe identify a personality trait that will get me on the right track.

179,"Hey guys, I need some advice on what to do to help my friend. Please read all of this, so you can understand the situation.
So I have a group of high school friends from the bay area in Cali, we've just completed our first year of college. Most of us go to UC schools, but some go to community colleges. We're all really huge potheads, we like to smoke a lot, and we're all Computer Science oriented (majorwise).
Now my friend, we'll call him Jack, goes to a community college nearby, along with another friend from my group. Jack has been depressed for a while, and has basically lost his direction/purpose. He smokes weed and does other drugs to 'forget', and has admitted to some of us that he is very depressed. He lacks motivation to do anything really, and is not looking to graduate community college or transfer out anytime soon.
Our friend group basically only talks about 'getting lit' and smoking and hanging out, about what concerts we're going to go to, and stuff like that. However, Jack doesn't have the money to do many of these things besides just drugs and hanging out, and he gets to see us talk about all the fun and happy memories we experience at UCs. However, his experience at the community college is the opposite. There's not many ways to meet new people, and he isn't too sociable.
We've tried to get him to find a job, but so far he hasn't really actively pursued one. He doesn't have a girlfriend, and has a gym membership but rarely goes. He's stuck in this loop of going to school, getting high all day, having no energy and no motivation. Recently, he's been doing very reckless things, such as driving fast extremely drunk. I think he's been giving a cry for help, as recently he's talked about ""how have I not died yet"" and notified us of his extremely reckless adventures in our group chats, and I'm worried something will happen to him soon if we don't do anything.
His parents have known that he's depressed, and he's not on antidepressants (I don't think he will willingly take them). We live in a city where not much happens (hence all the smoking of weed), and there's no clubs at this community college. What can my friends and I do to help him? If you guys know anyone who has been in a similar situation as him, what worked?",18Jun2017,1

We are both originally from the same place (I took him to uni with me) but he hasn't come down with me because he has work. I told him I would come back for a month - he was already a bit annoyed with that. But my mum wants me here all summer. If I go back to my university home after a month which is 2 weeks time, my mum will be really unhappy. My dads a dick and I brighten her day. She loves my company. On the other hand my boyfriend will be happy and I can sort our rocky relationship out. If I stay longer he will get annoyed and it may cause more serious problems for our relationship. But on the other hand my mum will be very happy. I don't come home much from uni. 

How do I know what to do? I can't figure it out.

I have a friend who I've known for 8 years. I stopped speaking to her for a year because it causes me and my boyfriend to argue. He believes I can't trust her and so I ended up not speaking to her for a year ...until I came back home for summer and reached out to her. I do love her very much. I told my boyfriend he didn't agree. He said I shouldn't trust her she's not my friend and if I can't trust my own judgment then how can he trust me? If I stay friends with her I will lose him. If I want to keep him I will have to cut her off and lose her.

208,"Sorry for the long post, there are a lot of details.

Edit: Mom and I reached a resolution. Thanks everyone for your input, it was really helpful.

[Background: My mom was estranged from her mother for about 25 years when she moved to the US to marry my dad. Last year their relationship thawed when grandma invited mom and myself to her home. FWIW, my mom's family is extremely eastern European in culture and language.]

My uncle is a bachelor in his late 50s and had never met me [F;27] prior to last September. I had noticed right away that he was quite captivated by me, and at first I chalked it up to the fact that we had many similarities and interests. We had really good conversations at first. Then I started to notice him staring at me, and checking me out when he thought I wasn't looking. I thought maybe I was being too friendly, so I chilled a bit and tried to put some distance between us.

However, it didn't really seem to work. About 3 weeks ago we went to visit grandma and uncle again. On our way to grandma's house, we swung by the family shop to say hello to him. I immediately noticed him openly staring at my chest, and that he barely greeted mom, and was completely disinterested in talking to her. He then told mom to go on to grandma's house but he wanted me to stay there at the shop to catch up. I said no and we went to grandma's.

At this point I hadn't said anything to anyone. The next day we were supposed to go to the lake and mom asked if it I thought her swim suit top was appropriate. I offhandedly said, ""yeah sure, if you want [Uncle] to stare at you too."" Mom agreed that he stared at me a lot, and before we left, asked grandma to say something. Grandma scoffed but turned to me and said, ""you think he flirts with you?"" And I said, ""no, he just stares at my boobs and checks me out at all the time."" Grandma said something to him along the lines of ""don't flirt with them, they don't like it. Now run along to the lake with them, and don't look."" 

Fast forward to about a week ago, it was my birthday and neither grandma nor my uncle called as they usually do. I thought nothing of it until mom asked, and when I said they hadn't, she called them. Grandma went off the deep end. She told mom to never talk to her again, and that she wanted nothing to do with us because we didn't understand their lifestyle and had ""insulted [Uncle's] honor."" When mom tried to talk to her, she proceeded to get angrier and angrier, demanding that we should apologize to my uncle, that I had horrible manners and was possessed by evil spirits (I kid you not) that had caused me to come into her house as a guest and make accusations against my uncle of molesting me. When mom tried to clarify that it was just looking, grandma said that is ""normal male behavior,"" that I was being too sensitive and close-minded. There were other things she accused us of, but they're a bit outside the scope of the issue.

So now my mom wants me to call my uncle and talk to him directly and apologize. We both agree that my grandma's reaction was completely out of line, and I'm not really down to tolerate their attitude about this issue. I don't want a relationship with them after this. However, my mom was estranged from her family for about 25 years, and was extremely happy that she could finally reconnect with her mom. This has completely wrecked her, and she feels very betrayed by my grandma's behavior (the first time we went there, grandma talked a lot about learning to unconditionally love, acceptance and the importance of healthy boundaries). 

Should I simply bite the bullet, condone their behavior and apologize for mom's sake? Should I try to let it blow over and send them birthday and Christmas gifts in a few months like normal? Should I do something else altogether? 

Help, please and thank you. 

**Resolution:** After talking in depth to mom, I told her that I thought it was morally and ethically wrong to apologize to them, and that I thought this dynamic was unhealthy. I asked her why she wanted to even be in a relationship with someone who was willing to use such emotional manipulation, but said that if she did I would be willing to call Uncle and apologize for offending him so that she could have a relationship if she wanted ... but then I wanted nothing to do with Grandma or Uncle moving forward. I told her that I'd talked to a lot of my friends and strangers on the internet, and pointed out that nearly everyone saw through their machinations from one angle or another (many people hit some details on the head I'd left out). She ended up agreeing that it was wrong for me to call and apologize, therefore perpetuating the cycle of abuse. We're writing them a letter instead to explain that their reaction was not okay and that we won't tolerate their disrespect. Thanks everyone who commented, y'all helped me sort this out and reach a course of action I feel good about. ",18Jun2017,21

  My question is: how to survive and start over in your mid 20's when you've hit rock bottom? I want to know if you've been through this, or worse, how did you survive and not get discouraged, especially during lonely times. ",18Jun2017,4
216,"A guy from my grade at school recently started messaging me heaps on snapchat. He always sends hearts and xoxo's. The other day we were talking and then he suddenly said ""what do you want to talk about? You can ask anything and I will answer. Anything"" this made me feel awkward. I just said I don't know. He then asked if I wanted to play would you rather so I said sure. His first question was would you rather a banana or an apple. I said banana he replied with ""nice😉"" his next question was would u rather a steak or sausage. I said sausage and his reaction was similar again. Do you think he means this in a sexual way? Or am I just over thinking it? And do you think he likes me? He is really nice and I think I may like him. Please help thanks! :)
UPDATE: we talked again and we played would you rather for a while he then confessed that he likes me. He asked me to tell him how I would make out with someone. He then asked if I would make out with him. I said don't take it personally but I don't think i would feel comfortable and I don't think I am old enough maybe one day. He then said we could go to a park after school and talk and things and I said maybe I dunno. He told me that he doesn't think he is ready or old enough to date but asked me if I wanted to secretly date and not tell anyone. I said I am not sure I'll think about it. I don't know how to tell him this but I do like him as in have a crush on him but I don't want to go behind my parents back and date without their permission ( I know they would say no) and I jut want to get to know him and be good friends. And wait till we are older I know? Thanks :) xx",18Jun2017,2
218,"I get angry over small things, like for example, comments on twitter. I know it's pathetic. It's just when someone like Lauren Duca says 'straight white men are generally trash', it gets to me. I get angry and annoyed. 

I take a lot personally. 

I spend a lot of time online. I ruminate over things a lot.

I also worry I'm becoming Islamophobic. I started to follow right wingers like PJW and I don't know what to believe. They say things like 'France and Sweden are being overrun by islamic extremists/gangs and there are many no go areas'. 

I don't know what to believe. 

I worry a lot. I worry about terrorism and how much it's happening. I feel guilty because I'm only taking notice now it's happening in the west more, but I still worry a lot.

These types of issues go through my mind a lot. I'm depressed, so this might be my depression feeding off them. I'm always in my head. I get angry over nothing. Obsessive. So I'm a bit worried. Any advice would be appreciated.",18Jun2017,1
219,"I went to a course for two and a half months, but only spoke to this girl for the last month, I believe. But after that me, her and a third girl (they two hanged out before I joined them) sort of hanged out daily until the end of the course.

I can't remember how many months ago that was now, but could be around three months or so. We've been chatting since, but I decided to sort of not talk to her on Facebook too much because I didn't want to orbit her (she has a boyfriend). We've talked about hanging out and grabbing lunch, but that hasn't happened and I don't think I'll try to set one up considering it'll feel weird.

Now, I recently resumed the conversation (we used to talk a bit on and off before I took this break) and we've been exchanging some messages, but now she's not responded for a really long time. It's not like she's read (the message has at least not yet been read) it or anything, but even though it usually takes her a long time to respond, 10 days is a *lot* for her.

I miss hanging out with her and the third girl, but I'm worried about sending her another message. I don't want to lose contact with her though. What do I do?

I'm sure a lot of this info was unnecessary, but I don't know what's important and what isn't. I guess I wanted to add some backstory. We're great friends, or were when we hanged out ",18Jun2017,1
220,"I applied for a position thats basically what I do now but with a few added responsibilities but I can't decide on whether I should take it. Most of my concerns revolve around pay and some perks that are now more apparent that I have an offer from a different company.

About my self
I am a student and trying to make some bucks, usually sleep around 4:AM. 
Last night i was doing same and around 2:AM, i just stood up for toilet and after just closing the door, a strange noice started like ""hoooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOooooooo""
Pitch changed between low and high but it was countinous for 10 or 11 seconds.
It was a sound like a lady crying in pain. 
I was listening that voice after it stepped i tried to inspect, i live on scond floor so i stepped towards bottom floor checked everywhere nothing found.
Asked my dad, he was sleeping, he said they might be dogs go and sleep(he was sleeping he did not listened).


So about my house and neighbours
My house is like I shape and in right side of our house a private kind of road(i dont know exact word for this) which starts with my house and ends when my house ends and after just the end of private road my uncle house starts where my cousin lives.
No one in our house and no one in uncle's house can do this type of strange noice and for this long time without stopping in mid.(no one is mad either)

No dogs can enter in our private road because of doors at the starting of private road.

Strange thing is that private road is long and when i heard that voice i felt like someone is in private road which is side of toilet i thought someone is just below my toilet and making noice and in the morning when i talked to my cousin, he said voice was just outside his room and distance between my toilet and his room is around 1000feet.
And voice was so loud that it was clearly listening even when 3 different coolers in diff rooms were running and they make so much noices. We they can not hear anything easily.
In morning a checked cameras nothing was there in road. 2 other people also listening voice and 1 guy did not slept whole night because of this (our family is big). 
All other peoples were sleeping even my cousin woke up after this voice started. Through his main door whole private road can be seen. He checked through his main door all was clear.
He said he cant even figure out from where was the voice coming it was near him.

1 more thing last year in my uncle's house my aunt and her daughter listened same voice in different rooms but they said voice was like just near their bed  but they both were in different rooms.

Our house is built like no one can esily come and shout like this and can not do shitty pranks.

I myself have never seen ghosts and any stuff. I am also terrified from last night.
Whats your suggestions on this. Do you have ever listened something like this?",18Jun2017,2
222,"I know that the term conflict of interest often applies to workplace situations - things like an employee dating their supervisor or working for a competitor, but are there any conflict of interest situations in life that I can avoid if possible [or try to, at the very least]?

I am not in any situations where there is a conflict of interest - and currently my job role [doing presentations and other related work for an NPO [non-profit organization] ] doesn't really cause this, for now.

What situations would constitute a conflict of interest [and I'm talking about ones outside of work, not just in the workplace].

224,"I am very confused about my own emotions right now. I'll keep this brief.

The girl that I like would not be a good fit for me. We disagree on a lot of things, and I just know it wouldn't make for a good relationship.

Regardless, I still have these feelings for her that are impossible to deny. I want to spend all my time with her, and she makes me feel so good.

The twist: She knows this, and she has pretty much told me that it wouldn't be a good idea.

My problem: She wants to remain close friends and I like her so much, and I can't turn these feelings off no matter how illogical. It's a completely internal problem, as I know on the outside there's nothing I can do about the situation.

Have any of you dealt with something similar? Have any advice? Thanks!",18Jun2017,3
226,I am an Igcse 11 grade student studying for my upcoming final exam in A level math. Which for those of you that dont know A level means that the curriculum gives most advanced shit you'll see in highschool. The thing with igcse schools is that the dont have terms of trimesters to gradually test your skillz no no they shove all of it down your throat at the end of the year like you're on the 18 and abused section on a porn site. You wake up at the end of the year realizing that you actually have to work to do well in life.

229,"I'm a junior I m usually pretty chill, but I take my schooling very seriously but I've never had a freak out like this. I've been working 90 hours a week this summer and I do my homework at my day job as a receptionist. 
I turned in my first paper too early and he gave me a zero... I begged for my grade and he allowed me to turn it in again. The paper (I turned in early) was due on the 14th I turn it in on the 14th but I turn it in an hour late.... i had a major freak out and have a mental breakdown I'm hysterical for 20 minutes and I can't stop crying until the morning but I think it was also do to the fact that I had worked 90 hours that week. I beg for my grade and he allows me to turn it in again because i proved that I turned it in earlier that week.

I'm so stressed about this class that I wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night making sure I've turned everything in on time (literally every weeknight). My body hair is falling out because I'm so afraid I'll make a mistake. I've never had such a unreasonable teacher before and this is for a community college. This rigidity is stressing me out so bad.
Today I turned in my paper but I turned it in as a PDF instead of a docx and in my haste I quickly re uploaded it to the wrong link. I'm trying not to freak out but I don't know how I keep making mistakes like this. I'm so upset but I'm so afraid of my teacher as well. How do I deal with this stress? ",18Jun2017,1

237,"So I work at this store that I've worked at since high school, only now I'm back from college for the summer and getting some hours in.  It's a pretty big grocery store and I've always just cashiered (which is fine), but this summer they have me in the back room in the grocery department stocking shelves and shit like that.  I hate it. 

I came back thinking I would have a straightforward summer job that I could do in my sleep with coworkers that I love and know, but that was completely turned upside down on me.  The guy who usually does grocery is at some internship for the summer, so I'm essentially taking over for him.  Long story short, the job makes me really stressed out, and does a number on my anxiety.  I don't really know anyone I'm working with anymore, and while they're perfectly fine people, I don't really fit in with them.  My hours are good but are really sporadic and unpredictable, changing day by day.  I don't know what I'm doing half the time, because I was never officially trained.  None of this fits well at all with my personality, and it's really taking a toll on me.

I've been exhausted, mentally and physically, I haven't been getting along with my parents, I've been distant from my friends and my girlfriend, and I've felt more and more depressed every time I go in.  The thing is, they do genuinely need my help in the grocery department, and I do genuinely want to help.  This is just too much for me though.  

I mentioned some of this to the manager that I used to work under as a cashier and who is technically the one giving me hours.  I told her that July is going to be crazy for me and that I would like to come back to being a cashier if it's possible.  She said she'd talk to the manager of the store itself, which is great.  I'm still stressed out about it though.

What do I do if things don't work out well?  I really don't want to come off as lazy or weak, but I don't know how much longer I can stand to work in the department I'm working in.  I can't just quit all together because I really need the money, and don't know how else to make money this summer, as another place probably wouldn't hire me for the eight or nine weeks I'll be here.  

Is there a productive way to go about this to ensure that I'm not throwing them under the bus, but am also taking my own mental health into account?  I've never been very assertive, and have trouble sticking up for myself in these situations, so this is way more difficult for me to handle than it should be.",18Jun2017,2
239,"So I'm scared this might sound like some loser talking about how they were meant to be cool but please hear me out.

Its VERY hard to describe what I want so please don't take this paragraph as written in stone:  I've always been a very adventurous, impulsive  open minded person the kind you'd imagine to have friends from all sorts of backgrounds, I see myself in stories of crazy people from parties, I generally relate to the stereotypic ENTP more than anything, I love dancing want to hang out in big festivals and sexually I get turned on by being the more experienced one and generally am into some kinky stuff and want to have a few one night stands.

If I could I would in a heart beat be that person who went to a at 2 am party and came back telling you about some crazy thing I did.


There's just one problem: I'm terrible with people and I have few friends. I'm autistic I'm behind my classmates in terms of partying and socializing and I'm terrified of people as well as being fucking bad at making friends and when I finally find someone ""experienced"" in life they are usually the ones who teach me.


The people who are the type of person I want to be (and keep in mind that is NOT just drinking and partying, far from, I was just talking about socialization) usually reject me understandably as I'm to people I don't know stuck as the ""token loner kid in class"".



Meanwhile, the people who do befriend me are often nerds who are perfectly content being nerds and while we can bond over shared nerdy interests clashes it with my need for a wilder life , they don't want to join my on my adventures or do any of the things of the wild things I want to do, either trough being meek and ""playing it safe"" or just being and introvert who's plain uninterested. and it pains me inside.



at the same time when I find someone who's even more inexperienced than me (wich most of my nerd friends are) who sees me as that adventures person and who I genuinely feel like I can ""show the world"" its one of the only times I feel like myself.



I know its an overused emotiotional methaphor but I really do feel like a bird with broken wings at points. I enjoy some aspects of nerd life and I have my introverted traits but this is not enough, I need more than this-this is not the life I was meant to lead.
