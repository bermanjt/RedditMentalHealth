3,"I'm a physics major (with possibly a double major in mathematics and a minor in chemistry) who is interested in doing biophysics research. I am a freshman. 

I met with my chemistry professor today in order to discuss the possibility of minoring in chemistry. To my surprise, he was extremely confident that I could successfully complete a chemistry minor on top of my courseload (perhaps even a biochemistry double major with physics and a math minor if I take some classes during the summers). I am very interested in doing this, however I go to a smaller university and my physics ""plan"" is already structured for every semester I'm in college. I voiced my concern for taking a course such as Orgo on top of numerous physics/math classes and he was very sure that I could do it. 

However, I am weighing this heavily. Course registration for next semester is in a couple of weeks. This semester, I am in Gen Chem I, Calc I, a physics/astronomy class-thing (don't know how to explain it, it's kind of a colloquium) and Anthropology (needed to fulfill a social science/humanities requirement, and was just placed into it). I have A's in all of them. 

Next semester, in order to follow the Physics plan, I will be in Calc II, Physics I (w/ Lab), and English (more so creative writing). I have space for one elective, and my chem professor suggested that I take Orgo as my ""elective.""  

On top of the courses I'm taking next semester, do you guys think that taking Orgo might be way too much? I'm willing to put in the effort necessary to succeed in Orgo, I'm just not sure if I should do it next semester, or put it off (I'm actually quite good with biochemistry, however I know that Orgo is a different animal). The thing is, my semesters aren't getting any easier down the line (as I'll have quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, astrophysics, etc). On one hand, numerous people are telling me I could definitely do it and succeed, but on the other....I can't help but worry (and my father, who went to medical school and is very successful, is the only person who has strongly advised against it thus far).

I am meeting with my physics and math advisors soon, and will be meeting with the molecular biology professor soon as well (my chem professor also wants to meet with me again before I register for classes). I have a couple of weeks to decide, however I just don't know what I should do. Reddit, help! For any of you who have taken Orgo (or maybe even teach it), do you think this is doable?

Thank you in advance!

4,"My mom is struggling with a meth addiction that has wreaked havoc on her life. It's cost her her home, car, job, friends, and even her close family. She's aware of this, but can't get away from it. She's 50 years old and homeless in Alaska. A ""friend"" of hers has been letting her stay with them for a while, however this friend is a dealer and also keeps them into the shit in the meantime. She can't keep staying with these people but is otherwise homeless with a harsh winter coming. She wants away from and has nowhere to go. She refuses treatment, mostly out of shame and fear of losing her dog. Believe me, I've tried for years to convince her to go. She has quit several times herself, but being in such a small city running into people to get her back into it is inevitable.

She keeps begging me for help since I'm the only person that hasn't given up on her. Meanwhile I am working in a tiny rural resort town 100 miles away. She wants to come here, which actually might be good for her because it would completely cut her off from the shit. It's not possible for her to stay with me though since I quite literally live at work in employee housing. I can't even make it back to the town she lives in. I can't keep hearing her cry for help and not being able to do anything.

5,"After a 12 hour sleep I woke up and looked at the time.  As soon as I did I laid back down and heard my mothers voice call my name (in my head) I didn't reply but I acknowledged what I was hearing. She then said, the devil is here. She said all of this in Spanish but I'm translating it. I was so scared I asked my sister to sleep with me. I've been sleeping 7-8 hours each night but that night I was really tired. 

Should I get holy water or is there any other explanation for this?",12Oct2017,2
6,"My whole life, I told myself and others I was set on becoming a doctor - with hopes in specifically specializing in obstetrics and gynecology as I have a passion for reproductive rights and great interest in pregnancy and the reproductive system. I promptly got a job working in one of the busiest emergency centers in the country to get my foot in the door and am in my second year of college. Since this fall, I have realized this is not the path for me. 
I am aware I would be an excellent doctor, as do others but I know now, I have little interest in this profession. There are a multitude of reasons but to keep it short, we'll just leave it at that - I don't want to be a doctor, let alone a P.A or anything medical for that matter. Now, I am stuck.

The only thing I truly have interest in is history - mainly art history and anthropology. I want to educate people on this and I often find myself fantasizing being in my professor's shoes, leading a university class. People also tell me they see me doing this...however people tell me they can see me doing a lot of things well (lol). Regardless, I worry being in school for so long - even if I enjoy the subject - will suck the passion out of me. I worry not being guaranteed a job that pays well. You can love art, literature, history, anthropology etc.. but that does not mean it is viable. Other than that - I am not interested in anything else. Like most people, I truly value my free time and independence and naturally just want to be my own boss - perhaps own my own business. But what does that even mean? I just don't know what to do.

I know I am extremely young. I am told I have my whole life and there are people ten years older than me who are still figuring it out. I just don't find it acceptable for myself. I live in one of the richest counties in the US and in my community and family, it is simply not heard of or okay to be in this position. To not be in school, not have a job or an acceptance letter into grad school by 22 makes you a loser. I'm not saying it's right - just stating my environment. In two short years, the majority of my friends will be graduating with degrees and will begin their roles as functioning members of society. Yes, some are struggling with what type of business major to pursue or are not completely at ease with their kinesiology major, however they have a plan. I have nothing. I can't imagine being 25, working some clerical or registration job and then finally settling to go back to school for something I won't truly enjoy.

I don't know what's out there. I don't know who to talk to to see what is out there. I don't want to continue wasting my parent's hard earned money and my time going to school for no reason. I feel so utterly hopeless and lost. Not to mention this situation is only worsening my depression. Has anyone else been in this position, especially in an environment where not knowing your life plan isn't acceptable? What are my options here - what is your advice?",12Oct2017,1
8,"Hello, I hope I hit the right sub with that. I need some advice because I haven't been in such a situation before.

From the beginning: I met her about a year ago for the first time in university and we got to be friends. We saw each other pretty much on a more or less weekly basis (because the course we met in was the only one we had together and she was living in another city most of the time) and I didn't really think about 'hitting it off' with her. Up until now.

The problem is that she's now studying in another country for at least 8 months.
Right now we're loosely writing on a daily basis about what went down that day and stuff like this. 
Nothing really deep and not on a ""close"" level, mostly around the later evenings. Mostly some ""things happen - writing - questions - answers - night - repeat"" kind of cycle.

I don't really let on to what I feel, because I don't want to step on her toes too much and I don't see what I can do now without making everything really awkward.
I think it would be the best to leave that topic alone at least until she's back, but here I am, lying in bed at night, regretting I didn't make a move earlier even though I didn't exactly knew what I wanted at that time, because who knows who she'll meet there.

I am not very experienced with these kind of things and I don't really know what to do now. I'm afraid of things backfiring and myself losing something I never had (but really really want).

TL;DR: been friends with woman, now she's far away for a long time and I realized I like her more than I thought. Need help.

Things I'd like to add: 
a.) not a native speaker, please cut me some slack.

b.) the more I write about this the more I realize how far away I am from what I want out of us both. I want to change that, but I don't think I can. I don't see a way how to..

10,"I am a college student working a fast food job. While I was at work, this guy started talking to me after I delivered his food. He mentioned he is working on his own business and is talking with some young millionaires on how to make his business big (he was meeting with a few associates at the restaurant). To be honest, it sounded a bit Tai Lopez-esque. He asked if I was good with numbers and almost seemed to offer me a job of sorts. He asked for my number and now we have plans to meet up this weekend.

I did some research on him using the number he gave me and it seems like he owns a local painting company that has been around for a few years.

Does anybody have experience with people like this? Or does anyone know if this is actually going anywhere worth my time?

I always hear constant screaming going on as well. Not just yelling, like full on scream until their voice is hoarse kind of scream. The screaming is always in anger and seems to be occasionally directed at the boy. They scream like this at each other as well. Its both the MIL and daughter doing it.

The MIL once told me they have no idea who his father is and made a few jokes at the boys expense.

15,"This is an odd question. Bear with me.

I'm 24, working a low-paying job in order to gain more job experience even though I went to graduate school. I'm working to recover from serious depressive episodes I had between 2013-2016 because of the difficulty and culture shock of college and personal things in my life. I battled depression pretty continuously from 2010 to 2016. 

Thanks to those episodes, I gained a bunch of weight. I'm finally in a good headspace again, but I feel like I have to undo what happened to me and eventually become the successful, healthy person I'm supposed to be. The weight is the most obvious physical reminder, but there are plenty of emotional scars, including those caused by a demanding, narcissistic mother. Despite the fact that I feel more stable now than I have in years, I can't deny the fact that I didn't think my life would turn out like this. I thought I would be making more money, living in a better apartment, and feeling more settled than I am now. I'm over 100K in debt for college, and my current job only has me earning 20K a year. I know I can do better, but I'm afraid of putting too much on myself and spiraling into another depression again. I also have at least 80 pounds to lose.

Before the downturn, I was a straight A student in high school. I was shy, but I had a lot of friends. Choir, musicals, and plays added meaning to my life. I weighed a healthy 120-125 pounds (I'm only 5'2,"" so that's a good weight for me).  

Between 2010 and last year, I gradually fell apart and isolated myself from friends and things that I once enjoyed. I hit rock bottom and finally got help in March 2016. I also live far from my hometown and college town friends. 

I have a supportive boyfriend who is undoubtedly my best friend. He went through similar struggles. I am admittedly concerned that he doesn't want to improve himself in the same way that I want to improve myself, but time will tell. 

I'm on a good track. I have lots of regret and pressure to try to subside, though. 

I'm so embarrassed about the weight gain that I don't want anyone from high school or college to see me until it's gone or close to gone. That makes me feel lonely. 

Even more awkward is the fact that I seem to have this nostalgic yearning for the emotional connection I had with my high school crush. We never dated, and I'm of course closer with my current boyfriend than I ever was with him, but I had a musical connection and closer friendship with this person than I have ever had with my boyfriend. My boyfriend isn't a musical person, and it makes me wonder if I need to be with someone who appreciates music like I do. 

I don't have feelings for the high school crush anymore, but I would be interested in being friends if I lived closer to him. Like I said, I'm too embarrassed about the weight to see him now, because he'd have a thinner version of me in his mind to compare current me with (unlike my boyfriend). The high school crush has expressed interest in meeting up with me if I'm ever in his town.

I have no idea why I feel as though this person has the key to me feeling more fulfilled in some way. I don't like it. I'm fine with seeing him eventually just to talk about fun memories and music, but it seems strange and unhealthy of me to feel this way.

Does anyone have tips for knocking him off of his undeserved pedestal?

16,"So since around mid September I've stopped being attracted to her as much as I used to but I still have SOME feelings for her. The best way I can put it is a quasi crush. And I've been beating myself up about it.

Also she isn't talking to me a much as she used to. She's off with her friends when we're at school, her memory is really bad so we can't plan stuff after school unless I text or email her. Even then she hasn't been responding.

I've been thinking of this for a while. I think I'll tell her why I'm CONSIDERING it but I'll have to wait for her response to see if she can:

A) talk to me more
B) make me like her again

19,"I have Borderline Personality disorder, it messes with attachment issues, self harm, impulsive behaviour, difficulty with interpersonal relationships, low self worth, neck breaking speed emotional changes, and a few other horrible symptoms. I had been through load of therapy, literally bags full of medication and nothing seemed to make life worth living
About 2 years ago after several suicide attempts, I found a therapist who was working for me, which isn't easy as Borderline clients are seen as impossible to treat. Things were going well, he really helped me with my mental health. I had a partner I'd been with for 3 years and a baby at home, was trying to work, and with my therapists help, I was managing for the first time in my life . I had to see him 3 times a week to keep bpd under control, he was always there for me if I needed him, morning or night. He made me feel instantly better, knew how to calm me, make me laugh and smile. 
 I was completely sexually dysfunctional, I had a childhood full of sexual abuse, and as a rule doing anything sexual repulsed me, if I did anything I would self harm violently. It caused strain with my partner as he had to be celibate too, but he was very understanding.  Things weren't perfect at home though, my partner worked, disappeared with his friends a lot, and when he was home he didn't really help with our son, or the housework. It was a lot for me while doing a full time job it caused tension, but I still loved him.

About a year into therapy, me and my therapist began to flirt, at first I thought it was just me experiencing transferrence, but I felt strong feelings begin to develop for this man 31 years my senior. I pushed for some form of relationship, with flirting taking up more time than therapy, which apparently  is textbook bpd behaviour, but when it came to anything sexual I would completely melt down. He told me his history,  his childhood not being to far from mine, and how much he could help me sexually, gently guiding me through everything on a therapeutic way. It was a rocky Road,  but we got there. I feel like sexually I have been reborn, what was once terrifying and would make me hysterical, now is normal and loving to me.

 I found myself in a muddle constantly, trying to distinguish if I loved my partner ( who could be so emotionally neglectful at times, he wasn't there, he never remembered birthdays, rarely interacted with our toddler and left me to do everything) or my therapist (who's relationship is completely unethical).  While I had a feeling at this stage my new love was possibly just my therapist taking advantage of a vulnerable client, I found myself in constant denial of this. Soon, my therapist wanted to leave his wife and be with me, some days I would want nothing more than this, others I didn't want this at all. My relationship with my partner was really struggling for obvious reasons and I was crippled by my guilt. I told myself that this affair was just like sexual therapy, me and my therapist had talked about it just being this, and that kept me at bay.I split on my therapist, a bpd trait where you switch from idolisation to complete hatred instantly, however 2 months later I was suicidal again. I felt so helpless, my partner had become disinterested in my mental health, I didn't feel like I could go to a new therapist, I was scared of the same thing happening again, or the therapist not being able to deal the the bpd as many previous therapists had, and I most certainly did not want my old therapists and mines secret getting out, he would loose his job.I missed my therapist.  I went back to him, knowing me going back meant I had to leave my partner. 

I've been back to therapy for 3 month now, a couple days ago I out of the blue ended the 5 year relationship with my partner, I told him things just weren't working out. I am a wreck. I feel I have made the biggest mistake of my life, however, I cannot go back because I have been a royal bitch to cheat on him. My ex partner deserves better.
 I feel that although I do love my therapist much of it is because of the personality disorder. I have been very down the few days, I miss my partner so much, but I have messed up so much. I have no friends to talk to, as my therapist and me worked on me being independent from them because they were bad for my mental health due to having their own issues.  my therapist has obviously seen I was very down I  have literally been questioning my life and how I managed to fuck up this bad. I do regret breaking up with my partner, and I do feel like my therapist really pushed and encouraged me to end the relationship with him, though I am aware it was me who went through with the break up in the end. 

 Tonight my therapist admitted that he wanted to kill himself because he doesn't feel that I want him anymore, he says I am too upset with the breakup from my partner 5 days ago, and I am being cold towards him in my texts and in person. It took me nearly 2 hours to talk him down, I had to confess my undying love for him, even though I am not feeling it, because the man has literally told me without me he will kill himself. He says I am the only thing he has worth living for, and I have no idea what to do. I don't know if the love I have felt for this man is due to my mental health, or I genuinely love him.  I don't know what to do. I now know that if I pull away at all, the therapist is at risk of ending his life, something I feel very responsible for.

20,"Here is the full story. I matched with this woman last week on Tinder. After a couple messages, we were thinking of hooking up. She tells me that she has a boyfriend however, who cheated on her previously and now she wants to cheat on him. Without going into too much detail, she goes to my college and lives with her bf who's a doctor. I didn't want to meet up with her anymore so I told her: ""I can't do this, maybe if/when you break up with him."" I get no response for about 24 hours so I think that's the end of it. The intent of that message was to say that in the future, maybe we can hook up after she breaks up with him. I didn't want her to break up with him for me. I know my message is vague but I genuinely thought she wouldn't break up with him or at least move on and find someone else to cheat with. Besides, who would break up a serious relationship just for a hook up? Earlier today, she texted me a couple hours ago saying that she broke up with him and how I suggested it to her. Honestly, I'm scared because I didn't intend for any of this to happen. She doesn't have any of my social media besides my tinder so I could just unmatch her and forget about this but I feel obligated to talk her back into getting back together with her bf. Also, a small part of me is worried about my safety as well since she's pointing the finger at me. I don't think that any harm will come to me but you know how these things go. Any help/advice would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.

Edit: I should also add that we were never texting back and forth within minutes. Ever since we matched, we've had gaps of at least 30 min to a couple hours. Even now, we're not sending messages back and forth hastily. This probably doesn't mean much but I think it's worth noting.

Edit 2: I can't help but feel as if she wanted to break up with him and is using me as her scape goat. Could all of this be some elaborate lie?

I want to start off by saying I have VERY bad memory like I forget things, sometimes 5 minutes after it happens even though I should be able to remember it.

Like yesterday I was retelling something my manager had told me (which made me uncomfortable; it was about politics) to my co workers and although I was generally telling the truth, I exaggerated one part where I said he said something but it was just because I felt like he said it bc of his tone and how he was already belittling me. Which is not the same and it is lying. That’s just an example. I try hard to be aware of when I am exaggerating and telling white lies but it just seems like whenever I open my mouth I do it unconsciously.

For going on two weeks now no one in my family has heard from my brother. My brother for the past year has had some problems with meth on top of his already bad alcoholism, a lot of this stems from a woman he's insanely in love with. The last we heard from him was the Friday before last when he got paid and cashed out money from a 401k and went to go see the woman and her friends where we knew he'd be around meth. He was living with my aunt and uncle at the time and they haven't seen him or received a call of any kind nor has he been back to work. Previously this year a similar thing happened on a smaller scale where he went missing and we later found out he had attempted suicide by cop.

40,"First of all, I love my s/o.  She has been apart of my life for years, and we have been together for quite some time.  Over the course of the last 2 years she has been having some problems with her weight.  She has been eating out of control, and has not been working out ( or doing anything) to compensate for it.  I love her to death, but she doesn't look like the same person anymore. 

 I didn't attempt to date her because of her body, but she was stunning when we met.  I cannot say it enough; she is my best friend and I adore her.  It just scares me that I am not attracted to her anymore.  She is a smaller lady, so the weight she has gained has really changed her appearance.  I would never end things with her because of something temporary like this, but I feel less and less attracted to her every day.  My sex drive has almost hit the floor, and I feel like she has to know to some extent that I am not as interested in our bedroom life anymore.  I never was the most active person in that sense, but recently I don't want to take part in it at all. 

I feel like a terrible person for having so many negative thoughts about her current weight, but I feel like its important to be physically connected with your partner.  I'm not sure if I am being selfish, or If I'm just plain wrong in this situation, but I almost feel hurt that she has made so many choices that allowed her to completely change herself like this.  

I have brought it up that we should work out together, but nothing seems to stick with her.  I have also been subtly hinting that we should try to go on a diet together, and that maybe our food choices haven't been the greatest.  Again, no change.  I put a decent effort into being relatively fit, I would just love to see some effort from her to change her bad habits.  She is getting to the point where she might be impacting her health with her current bad habits.  

I would love any and all advice on the subject.  I love her to death, but the lack of attraction is starting to hurt my relationship with her.  Thank you for putting up with my wall of text, and thank you ahead of time for your advice.

TLDR: Girlfriend has been gaining a lot of weight due to her bad habits.  I am losing my attraction for her, but i love her more than the world.  I would love any advice that you guys may have on the subject.  I am scared to simply confront her on the subject,  I don't know how she will take it.  I do not want to hurt her.",12Oct2017,1

42,"I really am serious and I know this is a funny topic. I've never had this problem before and it's become an issue for me today.

It first happened earlier today right before I was supposed to meet with a client. I had a good 5-10 minutes before they were supposed to arrive and let out, what I thought, was some innocent gas. To my shock and horror I ended up completely sharting myself. Gross runny diarrhea just exploded out of me and down my pants. I completely panicked, grabbed my paperwork, and noped the fuck out of there. Thankfully, I was alone at the time and my client had not arrived yet. I left a message with them on the longest ride home of my life to cancel our appointment. I had just enough time to go home and shower before I had to meet with another client.

I do have IBS, but never in my life have I had a sharting problem, or even really a problem with diarrhea. I felt completely fine today - no stomach upset or nausea nor did I get the normal painful cramps that usually forewarn you of diarrhea to come. I'm a woman in her mid-thirties, so I feel like this makes this more embarrassing..

I came home from work this evening and after I had finished eating dinner I was sitting on the couch when I had another (seemingly innocent) bout of gas and ended up sharting myself again! Thankfully alone again! Took another shower and scrubbed the shit out of my couch (literally)....

I just don't understand what's going on. I know this subject is hilarious (and a very small part of me is laughing about this myself), but I just don't want this to be a new issue in my life now! 

Any advice? :/

57,"Hello, I have to write a 3 page paper on this prompt:
Discuss the conferences held at Yalta and at Potsdam which took place respectively during the presidencies of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, as well as the Manhattan Project begun during the Roosevelt presidency and concluding in the Truman presidency. Given the criticism from certain fronts with regard to some of the terms agreed upon at Yalta and Potsdam, as well as the outcomes of all three events, select one of these, and briefly conclude whether it should be judged in a positive or negative light in the study of modern American history. 

I was wondering if this prompt means that I should talk about Yalta, Potsdam, and the Manhattan project. More specifically, talk about what happened and what it did, and the criticisms all 3 have received. After this, do I then choose one of those 3 events, and talk about it being judged in a positive / negative light ? 

My other interpretation was that I only talk about one of these 3 subjects, what it was about and what it did, and the criticisms, and then conclude with whether or not this should be judged in a positive / negative light.

62,"Hi - I need some help.

I think I have an anxiety problem.  Sometimes it’s random and the heart rate goes up, bresthing issues; etc. - but sometimes it’s triggered around people and stuff.

Usually I’m pretty good at hiding it.  I have a lot of friends, and I’ve dated a lot of really nice people.  When I really like someone though, the anxiety consumes me.

I feel like it mutes who I am.  I go from interesting and funny to a complete ghost.  It’s hard to explain.

I like this girl in one of my classes (college).  She’s exactly like me in so many ways - we like the same things, and think the same ways - more so than anyone I’ve met so far.  But for some reason, my anxiety hits a new high around her.

I’ve been meaning to see a therapist (my insurance covers it) and additionally, my medical doctor said she doesn’t mind perscribing me medication (she specializes in medication for psychological issues as well, apparently).  Likely will be propanolol or something as needed (as I am wary of becoming too dependant on it.

What should I do in this situation?  I do a lot of public speaking as well - and I feel the medication and/or therapy may help.  I’ve tried every meditation remedy, and herbal thing, and so on that I could find - but it only gets me so much mileage.

TL;DR: I have an anxiety problem, especially bad around people I have a crush on.  I’m usually alrigt but in some places I just turn to mush.  I like this girl currently - but afraid anxiety has made me a mess.",12Oct2017,1
63,"As you read in the tittle, I was a victim an armed robbery in my home and need opinions.


When I was 11, my home was broken into by 3 armed robbers. They 'broke in' through the only window in the house that didn't lock, which was located by a balcony on the second floor (which they had to climb up to through a very specific ladder-like structure used to grow flowers on, that couldn’t be seen from plain view). The way it went down was as follows: they gathered my family of 6 + 1 friend of my little sister + the maid at gunpoint to the living room on the first floor, then separated my father and took him straight to the safe where valuables were kept on the second floor. Once there - apart from gathering valuables - they gathered belts and ties; as if to tie us up and/or muffle us later. While this was happening, my younger sister's friend's dad arrived to pick her up, so they lured him into the house as well and left in his car with the valuables they had taken.

I distinctly remember as if one of the robbers was the more calm and directed the other 2 not to use violence (which wasn’t used). Also, they were wearing boots. All of this took place in a heavily secured gated community (fairly common in my country), and the car was found abandoned about two dozen houses down the street, with the robbers never to be found themselves; even after a heavy search by private security and police, which found nothing on the community's sealed permitter or any workers that hadn't left the community earlier during the day (all of this took place at around dinner time).

These people were about as professional as criminals get; at least I and everyone else involved remember it that way. The whole thing was clean, quick and without trace; even when the issue of the pick-up came up. As much thought as I’ve given to this subject over the years, I have never figured a convincing theory as to who was behind the robbery. What do you think? The private security doing an inside job, because of the boots? Someone who had done some kinda work on the house and knew about the non-locking window, ladder-like structure and somehow about the safe as well? A family friend, who could provide refuge to them after the robbery from the heavy search within the community? Or a combination of the three?.


PS: none of the many security cameras within the community ever caught them; however after the fact it was discovered that many were non-functioning at the time; and they only covered the club’s perimeter and entrances back then. So, they might have known about the camera’s blind spots, about the non-functioning ones, or made them non-functioning themselves (if it was, in fact, the private security who did this) - or they just got lucky, which I doubt given their professionalism and seemingly calculated nature. By the way, this definitely wasn’t any kind of revenge or anything. It was a robbery, with the clear purpose of taking money. By the way, it took place 7 years ago, in 2011.",12Oct2017,1
64,"Yes, I do smoke some marijuanas, but I've been doing it for years and I've always stayed extremely responsible with it. Because personally, I'd feel very uncomfortable if I didn't have control over my urges, so stopping for a couple weeks here and there is a breeze for me.

But yea, I can't do anything. Or I can, but if I did then they'd trip out and probably end up not believing me.

My friends were hella trying to make me come out and chill with them a bit at around 9 pm today, and I know that would be weird to them.

I've never been caught, never even close to be honest, so they almost have like no reason to be suspicious but my mom is a bit crazy. She doesn't really do much other than when she tutors some classes, so I feel like she has a bunch of free time to always be there and asking me stuff.

I love my parents, and my family as a whole. I'm probably the one who's been putting the most effort in nowadays because my middle sister has been getting out of hand, and my oldest is in SD so I don't really have much distractions.

My friend told me to not be such a good kid, but to them I'm not even a good kid, they just always suspect something of me even when I've never even done shit when they were home. I only do stuff when I know it's chill.

I can't even go to the park to hang out because if I told her I was just going to the park she'd be on my ass in a second. ""Why?"" ""With who?"" ""What are you gonna do at the park?"" etc and then usually she just has these half worried, half just staring at me eyes that she always does and I'm about to crack my own skull open if they don't catch on.

70,"Okay, I want to start by saying that this woman/caregiver had a number of little red flags - but my mother was desperate to hire help as she couldn't take care of my dad alone anymore.  

So here we go... Mom hired a woman off craigslist (after interviewing a number of candidates) to come take care of my paraplegic father - she had already exhausted all licensed services in their small town and needed someone who could also do wound care - thus hiring a private caregiver.  Background check run, drug test, etc - all came back fine.  Woman was a little odd, but took care of my Dad for 3 months without major issue.  

My mother finally trusted this woman enough to have her stay in our house to watch my father so that she could attend her son's/my brother's wedding across the country. 4 days later - Mom comes back, all seems fine.  House is in good shape, Dad is taken care of - this woman continues working per usual for the next week or so.  Then one day, out of the blue, she's a no show.  She won't answer her cell, her boyfriend won't answer his and my mom has no address for her because she apparently lives in an RV without a designated ""home"" for it.  Then she started to notice that things were missing - her mink coat, my Dad's nice suits, some jewelry, power tools, alcohol, wine glasses, paperwork with their personal info on it... the list goes on.

Mom has contacted the local police who say that unless she has proof that this woman is responsible for the missing items there is nothing they can do.  My mother is not tech savvy and had no camera installed, and even if she got a neighbor's  outdoor footage - she thinks this woman was using her suitcase to transport stuff and it wouldn't be considered proof.  Other than the fact that there was no sign of breaking and entering and this woman was the only one with a key and has now dropped off the planet... there is nothing the police say they can do.  We've provided the license plate of her car, her contact information, full name, etc.  But unless we find the items for sale somewhere or any images of her with my mom's property - it's a dead end.

My question to you is... is that really all we can do?  Just search the internet for a sign of the missing items?  This caregiver isn't tech savvy either, and I doubt she'd be dumb enough to post them herself online.  How can I help my now terrified mother?  She doesn't have much - and those items were almost all she had left of a life before my Dad got sick.  I'm desperate to do something - I just don't know what.

Any advice?",12Oct2017,3
72,"Hello reddit, I'm in a very difficult place right now in life. I moved out abruptly two and a half years ago and have struggled with my mental health and just becoming an adult in general, I am twenty one now. I have goals, I have things I want to do but I haven't done them over the past 2 1/2 years and I've failed at several things. 

Part of me knows that I have a lot of years ahead of me and that if I change my behaviour now and focus, I can still accomplish what I want to do. However, part of me keeps staring at the wasted opportunity and fearing that it will repeat itself. I worry I'm just going to keep sabotaging myself and that nothing will change, even though I know what I want to do and who I need to be to do it. 

Part of me wants to give up on myself. It's worth noting that I've been on antidepressants for the duration of my moving out and a year prior, only for the past four months have I been completely unmedicated. 

I don't feel like I'm a risk to myself and my emotions are manageable, but I feel like my view of myself and my future might just be the illness talking. 

I've become aware of things I do in the workplace and in my personal relationships that are self-exploitative. I didn't even realize how much I let others take advantage of me until recently. 

I'm also 'calming down' a bit and not putting a bunch of deadlines on myself to do everything, which has actually increased the amount of things I do. I am realizing I'm a bit of a perfectionist and that I keep waiting for the right time or circumstances to do things, and that there will never be a right place or time. I just need to act. 

Basically, I'm aware of mistakes I've made and I have insight into why I haven't been successful in the past. That's a good thing, right? Logically, I know that that naturally translates to better odds for success in the future, providing I follow through on the corrections I need to make to my behaviour. 

**But** . . . I can't shake this fatalistic way of thinking and feeling that no matter what I do, I'm pre-destined for one thing or another and that no matter how hard I try it won't happen. I keep looking for 'signs' to tell me when I'm on the right path or that things will get better. 

I think I do this because I've never had anyone reassure me and I was told a lot of absolutes about myself when I was younger, mainly from my dad. He's actually said to me point blank, ""You're the type of person who makes mistakes."" I was told I was stupid, aloof, self centred and stubborn among other things. 

I've finally started to acknowledge that I was never any of these things, and now I'm overcompensating. I started to believe these lies about myself and now I have no faith in myself, I have no idea who I am as a person because when I look in the mirror I continue to see the person my father told me I was. 

So now, I keep looking around me to the universe to give me signs and searching for meaning and happiness in the wrong places because I don't trust my own self view and I don't believe others when they tell me different, either. 

I guess I just have this hole inside, or like a shadow that follows me that tells me I am destined to fail and amount to nothing, like I'll never redeem myself from mistakes I've made and nothing I do going forward matters. I feel like a shell of a person. 

I'm twenty one, and if I came across this post on reddit I know all the things I would say to that person, but I can't believe it for myself. What the hell is wrong with me? How do I stop thinking like this? I just feel utterly worthless and ashamed of myself as an individual, and it's haunted me my whole life. 

How do I overcome this? Has anyone else felt the way I did and successfully changed? I really need someone to talk to. ",12Oct2017,1
74,"Single male, 27, just bought a new house, wondering how I can minimize burglaries since I will be leaving my house alone when I'm at work.

As soon as I got my motorcycle, I never touched my truck, only like 2-3 times in a year me, (I ride a motorcycle full time, any weather).

Recently, my truck went caput, and the mechanic says it'll be ~$2000 to fix it. Now I'm contemplating to get my car towed to my new house for about $200-300 or get it fixed.

But will this even be worth it? Will a car parked in front give an illusion that someone is home, and deter burglars?",12Oct2017,1

80,"So let me start at the beginning i'm 24 this year and i'm an addict. I'm addicted to sex, masturbation and drugs and its ruining my life both financially and personally. I haven't had a serious relationship since I was 21 and it was the first real relationship I had it was also when I lost my virginity since we broke up I haven't been able to find that same chemistry with another person but I have met a lot of prostitutes. I've spent thousands of dollars on them and if i'm being honest every time I've spent that money I've only felt more miserable after the deed. I can't seem to kick it though if its not the sex with prostitutes its the masturbation or the drugs and its destroying my life. Just today I was scammed out of money trying to get sex from a girl I met online. Honestly this whole thing is incredibly embarrassing and I can't really understand how my life has gone in this direction, less then 3 years ago I was a straight laced kid who had confidence issues. Basically I would like some help kicking the habits I know these things are bad for me but I can't seem to stop myself from doing them and I want to have normal relationships and not the f**ked up mess that i'm currently in...

83,"I'm 22 and I found out I'm pregnant 11 days ago. I've only been with my boyfriend for 5 months and we live together. This is so unexpected. He is supportive, though. He already has a 6 year old son from a previous relationship who lives with us. This is my first pregnancy. 

I'm trying to be excited and happy about having a baby but I just can't. No matter how hard I try, I can't see anything good that can come out of this. We live in, basically, a shed that someone converted into a tiny house. I mean it when I say tiny. This house has two rooms. The bathroom, and the rest of the house. I can't raise a baby here. His son doesn't even have his own room or a bed, he sleeps on the couch and we sleep on the bed right next to the couch. We do not have room for another kid here. My boyfriend thinks we might be able to get a different place by the time the baby would arrive (June) but there's no way we can know for sure. The reason he's been here so long is that this is the cheapest rent in the area, and we struggle financially even with rent being so cheap.

I got fired from my last two jobs in a row for stupid reasons. I've been trying to find a new job but I'm not having any luck. If I have a baby I really, really don't want to get a job and have the poor baby spending its days in daycare at a month old. I imagined once I became a mother it wouldn't be like this. I wanted to be able to stay home with my baby for the first year and exclusively breastfeed. I can't do that if I have to work. I've been trying to find a work from home job but I'm not having much luck with that either, and those don't usually make very good money.

I'm not even sure if I like kids. I like babies, but I don't really like toddlers and kids very much. I believe the whole ""it's different when they're yours"" spiel but that doesn't change the fact that kids normally get on my nerves. My boyfriend's son annoys the shit out of me more than any other kid ever has. We're pretty sure he has severe ADHD and my boyfriend wants to get him evaluated and put on medication but he hasn't taken him to the doctor because for some reason his insurance isn't active anymore. It's more than just ADHD. He has a really low IQ and can't understand anything he should be able to at his age. He's 6 years old but acts like a baby, crying and whining about literally everything. He might be easier to handle if he's on medicine but I can't be sure. All I know is right now he drives me crazy. I'm also worried that my kid would be like his son, and I don't want to have a kid like that.

I've heard so much that babies ruin relationships because of all the stress. I don't want that to happen. I want us to be happy, the way we are now. We've only been together for 5 months and that's not nearly enough time to be just us before bringing a baby into it. I love him. I don't want our love to fade because of the stress of a baby, like so many other relationships.

I've been thinking about abortion since I found out. But today I told him for the first time. He was shocked because I've been acting happy about it trying to convince myself that this is a good thing, but I broke down today. He wants us to keep it. He said he'll take me to get an abortion if that's truly what I want but he won't be supportive of that decision and he will be upset about it. 

I want to want this baby. But I just can't see one good reason to have a baby right now. I feel like we would be ruining our lives. All a baby would do is make our lives ten times harder when it's already so difficult as it is. 

At the same time, I worry that I would regret having an abortion. I'd feel so guilty. I'd probably be thinking ""What if I had the baby?"" for the rest of my life. What if everything did turn out okay? What if I did experience that ""love at first sight"" moment between mother and child and suddenly have the motivation to persevere through the hard times? What if I am able to get a work from home job and we got a new place? What if it doesn't ruin my relationship, but instead makes it stronger? What if it all could work out?

I read about abortion for hours today. I spent over an hour telling my boyfriend what a mistake this is and how our lives will be ruined. But as soon as he said ""Fine, I'll take you to get an abortion"" I was... sad. Abortion could be just as much of a mistake as having a baby. I'm so torn, reddit.

My friend (let's call her Jess) has quite a few health issues that are seemingly getting worse. She's emotionally and physically being destroyed worse and worse on a daily basis. I have a pretty great family life and have always been fortunate enough to have the money to have access to good medical care for any health problems I've encountered.

90,"Hi all.

I am 34. I have worked at a place for three years now and my boss and I have become good friends. However, she has me stand all day long. I get 10-15 minutes to eat my lunch but must get up if customers come into the store so I never get to actually rest. 

I have asked many times for a chair. She finally bought a rubber pad for the cement floors a few months ago after me asking for over a year. 

I will not ask for a chair again as she will refuse. She simply doesn't think that since other employees don't have pain standing that I should and thus ends the conversation every time.

I have developed vericose veins in both legs. Last week hard, painful bumps appeared on my knee. The swelling has gone down but the bumps remain and it is heavily bruised. 

I make ok money at the job but pull in a loot of clients for my secondary job through the business - with permission. If I leave my side business will most likely dry up. The job market where I live (and want to live, I moved here a little over three years ago) is bad. And I've just applied to the first job I've found in my past career and education since arriving. 

I may lose a friend if I leave as well, but I can't come home every day and hobble around in pain for the rest of the night. I literally have to push and pull myself out of my chair after I've sat down for a bit because I seize up.

What would make me happy in life is just having a family. A wife, and loving kids that we can spoil! Nothing crazy, just a life that many people already lead, some of you probably do!

I just don't know what the hell to do! The biggest issue is my job. Without being in upper management, it seems you need a degree to make anything close to decent money, but I would have no idea which type of degree to get! If someone asked me what I wanted to be 3 years ago, I would have excitedly said ""A truck driver."" They make decent money, and I love trucks/cars/bikes/planes ETC. But my Epilepsy (well controlled) rules me out of that. 

Now I am at the biggest state of loss I have been in a VERY long time. I even thought about just becoming a mechanic, but after reading what some others have said negative about that career path, I scrapped that. I am just so lost!

Any advice on what I should look for? Should I try to see if this current job has advancement chances in the future? Should I get a degree of some type? I really have no idea and it is scaring me, at some points even making me suicidal when I start thinking about it too much.

So when people try to use phrases like ""move on"" or ""let go"" it baffles me, because I can't comprehend being able to frame feelings like that. I don't understand why ideas like forgiveness or acceptance exist, because that's not how emotions are for me. When people say therapy is work I don't get that either, because I can't understand being able to work at feelings. Like, when someone says I am ""letting"" myself feel this way it makes as much sense to me as saying someone ""lets"" themselves have cancer.

DAD1 is a mechanic and works regular hours, DAD2 is some kind of desk jockey at a purification plant and works night shifts; if the hours line up he sleeps at DAD1’s apartment during the day so Kid has someone if she freaks out.

Sleeping arrangements came up naturally somehow at work and DAD1 mentioned the co-sleeping offhand and I can’t decide if it’s weird or not. He said when she gets screamy then usually both Dads will lie down with her at once, which would probably seem less odd to me if the Dads were married, but as far as I know DAD2 is more of a casual partner, like a step above an fwb, and Kid doesn’t quite trust him yet. 

I’m almost certain that no abuse is happening (I've heard from the Boss that DAD1's father was abusive, and I can see DAD1 wanting none of that in his life), but I still can’t get over how strange their arrangement seems. Is this weird or am I some kind of prude?",12Oct2017,0

I am slightly of an introverted person, in a sense that I am not very social, and prefer to ""think"" (ponder and then discard it) other than ask. This post took a little more courage than I would like.

Back to the topic: Take Orwell's V for Vendetta - (yes I have read it) when the totalatarian government fell, I was sad, not because ""evil"" was ""destroyed"", but because the government was no longer existent as itself.
Here's another instance; Cameron's Avatar. In that film, simply put, humans are routed and sent off to space after robbing the planet of resources, and generally being the evil of the whole story. And with that ending, I was sad; maybe because of that humans ""lost"" (I find myself often pro-human in stories), but probably due to again; a powerful system being torn down.

TLDR: Please enlighten me. I am a bit lost and worried why I have this ""belief"" (system of thought) that a loss of a power structure, no matter how evil, is a loss for us all.*

117,"I'm bipolar, and very sensitive and emotional. None of that helps my situation. Last week I decided to go get some tattoos on a whim (a whim I have every time I'm manic but I finally followed through  with it). 1/3 I actually really like, but 2 of them i realllllly don't. I mean, I'm grateful I did it for the sake of it showing me this, but fuck.

My main targets are always my exes. For some reason I just can't seem to fully let go. It has been 5 years since my first relationship (I'm 21) and to this day I still let it get to me. I literally don't understand the feeling of fully letting go. And with that comes a fear of new relationships. And each relationship I get into afterwards is just a comparison towards my previous relationships.

The tattoos I mentioned were somewhat of a screw you to my last ex. We broke up in February and since then, a lot of my life has been centred around becoming better than her. (She had a tattoo. I did it cause ""ha ha I can do it too""). Even the silly shit, like hanging with friends and going ""Oh, I bet she isn't do this"". But I know she doesn't even think of me anymore. And I just cant comprehend how to do that. I want to. But I don't know the feeling of fully just letting go. 

It doesn't help that all of this comes from within an identity crisis. I'm having a really hard time figuring out who I am (hence the tattoos), and I've forgotten what it means to just be present.

My SO got asked to work short notice and said yes because we had forgotten we had a handyman coming. This means that we completely forgot about tidying up, and when we got home we were horrified to find his business card that he had left on the kitchen table.

124,"This is a long story but it explains my situation, if you don't feel like reading into it then I'm warning you now.

Anyways
Here's some background info:
About two years ago I met someone and fell in love with them. After about three months of being with them I noticed changes and demands that were never there before. I tried my hardest to give her what she wanted but nothing ever seemed good enough. If I didn't do what she wanted me to do or act the way she wanted me to act then she would withhold any emotions or feelings toward me and would become very distant. On top of that plus all the isolation from friends and family I'm convinced now that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. 

Now I'm a man, and where I grew up/came from men don't really get abused, or at least that's how it was so I was completely oblivious to this because my main focus was making sure I didn't repeat things I saw done to my mother growing up. I never used her weaknesses/emotions against her even though she did it to me, and towards the end she left me while I was in a coma and basically robbed my apartment when I was in the hospital. I've learned to let things go, but ever since I got out of surgery (almost died and lost two organs) I've spent the last three months barely existing on the couch now moved back into my mothers place. The surgery was from a bad wreck now I have no car, no job, i have PTSD from the car wreck and from the surgery itself because I don't like knives and having a 12 inch scar on your stomach doesn't exactly sit well in my stomach...

I've done a lot of thinking and the only way I can come to any conclusion is if I recognize the situation for what it was, but where do I go from here? I've been basically broken down so badly to the point where I'm not confident in anything I do, and All I do is retrace things that have happened in the last two years in my head. How do I make myself stop thinking about what happened, and will I ever get over what happened between me and this person? Note: I really truly loved her nothing she could've ever done would've made me leave because I don't judge people but it seems like once my usefulness was up I was out the window..

Thoughts anyone? I'm losing my mind",12Oct2017,1

129,"I have a friend from a country where they don't consider blackface to be a bad thing. This past summer, she worked in a camp (outside of the US) that had a theme of ""traveling the world"" or something like that. Every day was a different country: Monday was Ireland, Tuesday was China, etc.  
One day they ""traveled"" to Ethiopia. Part of this was doing a cultural dance from the country, learning about the culture, eating food from there, etc.  The only thing was...all of the camp counselors painted themselves black. Their entire bodies. I told her that this was a rather racist thing to do and she couldn't grasp her mind around it, saying they were just acting out their part.  
I know in the US blackface comes from a negative place but here it has never really been a thing. Hell, even in their religious festivals they paint a white guy black to symbolize one of the three kings that visited Jesus.  
My question is, how do I explain to her that this is a rather racist thing to do? I tried giving the example ""would you feel comfortable going to Africa with your body painted black"", but that didn't seem to resonate with her. Any ideas?

It would be for a job I'd be more passionate about and I have always wanted to live on the west coast, especially California. 

My girlfriend has always wanted to move west coast as well but will have to look for a job when we move. We talked about this extensively and I told her I don't want her to move with me just to be with me and uproot herself, but she is adamant that it is what she wants as well. I understand the budget will be tight at first with her looking for work. I personally think this would be a great opportunity, but am worried I might be too young or naive to make the move. 

I am from Pittsburgh, PA originally and my family is supportive of me moving. However, my girlfriends family is very against her going, and want her to stay at all costs. I just don't want to be the person that moves her across the country and has her family miss her so much. 

Should I stay in my native town of Pittsburgh for a few years or potentially find another job, or should I take the chance and move to California with my girlfriend? I know the risks that are at stake, and am confident my girlfriend and I will make it work, we've been together for a few years now. I just don't want her family to resent me for taking her away, or for me to make the wrong decision in moving so far away when I am young. Advice would be very much appreciated, thanks.

141,"So the title pretty much explains it briefly, but my mother is overly protective and controlling. And I can’t stop caring for her. 
A bit of background..
 Ever since I was little she has had an illness that effects her muscles and joints from moving a ton, so she hasn’t been able to live life to the fullest, and I couldn’t experience really having a mother to spend time with (resting lots) or go out with.  She started to use manipulation towards me as I got older. I also had two little brothers that were apart of this too. I used to go to sleepovers with my friends, or go to the mall, or hangout outside everyday (used to live in a big complex with a lot of kids my age). She used to tell me before I went to go do any of those things, “ I’m all alone now.” When my brothers would leave the house as well, “you’re never with me anymore.”, and she would sometimes start crying if I went for sleepovers. 
I grew up thinking that it was wrong to leave my sick mother behind, while I had fun in life. 

Now, I am 18 and tired of this. 
I understand that she is sick, I understand she’s in pain. But I am 18 now and she’s worse with the manipulation. 
Everytime I leave the house she tells me a new thing that’s wrong with her. 
Either she’s found a new disease she has, a bump on her foot, or her hand moves weirdly. I have an overthinking problem that leads me to a lot of depression and anxiety, and her telling me something like that whenever I leave the house, makes me not want to leave her at all. 
But there is more she does with the manipulation. 
1. She doesn’t let me go to my boyfriends house, if I’ve been there 2 days in a row. 
2. She doesn’t let me stay out of the house past midnight. 
3. She doesn’t let me have any company over, because she doesn’t like people in our house. 
4. She screams at me if I say anything that has to do with me being 18. 
5. She doesn’t let me go out anywhere if I don’t go to school.
6. She won’t let me move my room to our basement, so I have more privacy and room. 
7. I’m not allowed to close my bedroom door. EVER. 
8. I’m not allowed to go anywhere at night if I’m not already out of the house already. 
9. I’m not allowed to stay in my room unless I’m sleeping or on the phone. 
10. I’m not allowed to go into my boyfriends car if he picks me up if she says I can’t.
11. She won’t let me go to colleges or universities that aren’t in the same city as us. 
12. And I am not allowed to move out of the country or city or even province. 

She has this thing against my boyfriend that makes me thinks she’s really jealous of him. He has helped me through my depression and really hard times, and whenever I bring him up, or say he’s apart of the family she gets really defensive. He has done nothing to her. 
My grandma loves him to death and when she says it’s fine for him to come to family dinners or get togethers, my mothers cuts in and doesn’t let me have him there. 

She won’t ever get the idea that I have grown up, and 18 now.  When the words “but I’m 18 now” slip out of my mouth, it’s game over. 

Please help me. 

Thank you

143,"Hey Reddit,

This is my first time ever making an account on here... I've tried to find a place to ask this question but haven't had any success.

I've been with my boyfriend now for close to 2 years, and have lived with him for 18 months. He is 25, I am 26. We both possess college degrees and are working professionals.

Before moving in together, I had snooped through his phone (I know, never do this, it was horrible, but I felt I should prepare myself in case of anything as I've had very bad experience with exes lying). In his internet browser (I imagine he didn't know of incognito or browser history) I found multiple google searches for ""scat porn"". I thought to myself, okay, that's weird, but whatever floats your boat right. It's not my place to dictate what someone can be interested in sexually, and I support masturbation in relationships as it alleviates discrepancies between sex drives. 

Flash forward nearly two years later, and his gmail was logged into my phone and computer from when he had to check his email for work. I didn't realize this also included his search history. Turns out he literally watches ""scat porn"" multiple times a day while I'm in a different room from him. I'm now incredibly freaked out because I wake up in the morning and am too scared to leave the bedroom (he wakes up before me) in case I catch him masturbating to this. He is actually legitimately addicted to watching it. Now we are at the point that he doesn't want to ever have sex, but sits there and masturbates before I wake up, before I go to bed, in the shower, after work, all to people smearing poo on each other. He has asked me for anal which I'm not interested in (very bad experience with an ex), and now knowing that he would do it just to experience my feces has me revolted.

There are many other issues with his psychological well-being, and his family has approached me to ask me to be patient with him because they know he has a few problems and needs help with them.

However, main one right now is this. I don't think I can get past it. 

My question, Reddit, is has anyone ever been in a long-term relationship with someone with Paraphilia NOS and how did you deal with it? How do I approach him about this? Does this typically stem from childhood sexual abuse or something? He did lose his virginity when he was 12 and has a very intense sex drive (he has told me he masturbates every day on the way to work as well as back). Should I be concerned that this is an indicator of a more dangerous underlying mental condition? He will not see a psych professional. Is there any way for me to become more open to this?

TLDR; Boyfriend is obsessed with corpophilia, watches it multiple times a day in other rooms while I'm home. Has been going on for our whole relationship, I'm getting extremely repulsed by it and need advice.

144,"Let me just start off by saying I suffer from severe anxiety. I’m medicated for it, but it only helps so much. I know what “triggers” it, and crowds, shouting, and phone calls are some of them. 

I applied and accepted a position for data entry. It’s the perfect job for me. I go to my office, enter data all day, and only have to speak to my coworkers. In the interview they asked if I would be willing to cover the receptionist if needed. I accepted with the knowledge it would only be once in a while. 

The girl in reception is awesome. She can handle the angry clients with ease. It’s a high volume, high stress job. The few times I’ve covered I’ve held my composure on the outside, but am actually freaking out internally. It honestly puts me in a bad place every time I have to cover. 

I’m rambling, to the point. A position opened for half day-care/half reception. The receptionist was hired (she was a volunteer) for that position, which leaves reception open for half the day. My assumption was that they were going to hire another part-time receptionist. My supervisor was on the phone with the door open and it was clear that she was talking about me taking the position. It seems she’s wanting to avoid that, but HR is pushing. Their stance is I agreed to cover in my interview. 

They haven’t spoken to me about it yet, but I know it’s coming. Guys, I can not handle 5 hours of reception. I don’t want to sound like a baby about this, but I genuinely can’t do it solely for my mental health. I applied for a specific job for a reason. 

What are my options here? Can they just force the position on me without my consent? Any and all advice is welcome. Thank you. ",12Oct2017,1

161,"First off, I don't think I'm a serial killer and here's why... I find human death and suffering very disturbing and only look at it when I need a shock.With animals it's very different.

I don't really like to see dogs and cats die (and I should clarify I never watch or condone any kind of animal abuse by human hands, just horrible accidents or natural stuff or sacrifices or rodent killing for pest control). However, for things like squirrel, bunnies, deer, etc. I quite like seeing them die. I know this sounds fucked up, but let me explain. We have a morbid curiosity, but obviously we are disturbed by death as well so we don't seek it out on the internet as much as we would if we weren't disturbed. For some reason, the satisfaction I get from seeing these ""lesser"" creature dies far outweighs any misgivings I have and much of my sympathy. Also, for some reason seeing these kind of ""dumb"" looking animals run around makes me dislike them and makes it easier to stomach their death and such. 

Furthermore, seeing baby animals devoured by a predator is one of my favorite things to see, with the mother helpless to defend her young. Something about the brutality and unfairness of it all just makes it like a morbid delights, like a candy or something, yum, ya know? 

My only concern with this stuff is that sometimes I feel like I'm crossing the line from advanced curiosity to deep satisfaction.

He mentioned (sort of jokingly) pretty early on that it was great we met, just in case he needed someone to dogsit here and there. I said ""sure,"" since I like the dog.

A few weeks ago, he messaged me that he wants to catch up on some work at the office by working late. Would I mind looking after his dog for a few hours? He even offered to throw in food and drinks afterward. He let me know over a week in advance, which was nice, but I'd recently signed on with a new client as a freelancer and was expecting an in-house assignment soon. Letting him know this, I asked if i could get back to him a bit later. He said that was fine with him.

Sure enough, my new client called me in to do a project overlapping with the day he wanted to work late. I let him know four days in advance what had happened. I linked him to a good petsitting/petwalking service my friend uses and l told him how sorry I was.

His responded with, ""don't worry about it. I'm good."" I know it's tough to read voice/tone over text, but something felt off compared to his usual humorous messages, so I asked if he'd still be able to get all his work done. His response was simply ""I'm good.""

He hasn't asked to meet up for an after-work drink since then. He doesn't message me until I do and, even then, his responses are very short and almost curt. So, I've let him alone.

We ran into each other by chance last week at our local watering hole. He joined me like everything was normal until (with a couple drinks to fuel my courage) I asked him, ""were you upset that I couldn't walk the dog that time? Your messages seem different now."" He didn't respond verbally, but his face said that he was well aware of the change to which I was referring. It was sort of abashed. 

Now I'm on the fence, one minute feeling fed up by his immature response (in general) and the other feeling a bit like an unreliable friend/asshole. To be clear, I never reneged on watching his dog. I simply asked if I could get back to him in a couple of days, considering my work situation, of which he was well aware when we first met).

How do I proceed? I liked our after-work drinks. I was also looking forward to finally meeting his wife. Am I the one who has goofed up here? I can't help but wonder if he was just being friendly with me in order to secure a dog babysitter. What do you think?

167,"Sorry for the really long post, I needed a good rant as well as advice. 

I’m a freshman at a state university and decided dorm living was not for me. My mother found me a house to buy on a lot in a subdivision, grandparents loaned me the money, and here I am. I needed help paying rent and the loan back so I offered one of my high school classmates who also attends this university to live here with me (mistake one). Our combined incomes were not enough for the lot rent, loan, internet, electricity, and insurance so we got a third roommate who was older than us but originally from a town not far over and we had mutual friends. 

The problem was roommate one from my high school. She had/has an abusive boyfriend, and at the time of moving in, they were broken up because he hit her. I let her know that I was completely not okay with him being here but I know she’s an adult so I stupidly told her that what I didn’t know wouldn’t hurt me (mistake two).

That was in June and now forward to late September, she has passive aggressively shunned me. She and roommate two will go out to do things together and for the most part won’t invite me or even say bye. One instance was that I was cooking dinner and let them know that I was cooking for everyone and they said thanks and went go do their thing in their rooms while I cooked. No biggy, I really didn’t need help. So about thirty minutes later it’s nearly done and they grab their purses and just leave. I was like “... okay..?” So I figured they were going grab something from the store. I fix my plate, eat, and leave the rest out for them when they get back. A couple hours later they show up with leftover boxes from some restaurant. I’m like physically stunned and don’t know what to say as they smile at me, and walk to roommate one’s room to watch Netflix. I was hurt, but sucked it up and life carried on. 

Forward to early October, I come home in between classes one day and I’m sitting in the living room, doing last minute studying when I hear it. No one is home and I hear a man’s cough coming from Roommate one’s room. I rush to my room, text roommate one and ask if there’s someone here, if not I’m calling the cops. She proceeds to tell me that it’s her “boyfriend.” So I get pissed and tell her that he wasn’t supposed to be here. She tells me she didn’t know I was coming home and that if I didn’t see it I didn’t care. I honestly don’t know who’s right or who’s wrong but regardless, I saw so I think she should own up to it. 

Now, she’s moving out at the end of the month and hasn’t spoken a WORD to me since everything hit the fan. At the end of the month, I’m stuck without a third roommate and honestly, I’m not 100% positive that roommate two might follow her and live with roommate one if she finds a place. That would be ideal because I know this really down to earth couple who has asked to move in with me but I had to turn them down because the subdivision has a 3 roommate rule policy. 

So my question is, what should I do about new roommates? I can’t find anyone I trust to fill the single third spot and I really don’t want to kick roommate two out because she is a sweetheart despite her friendship with roommate one. Different opinions about how I handled the boyfriend situation would be greatly appreciated and I’ll offer clarification when asked. ",12Oct2017,1

169,"I'm 20 now. So all throughout school, I've  kinda always had a little depression, and frustration, and a general dislike of my life. I've kinda been an outcast, never quite mixing well with people, never being invited to fun stuff and all that. I've also never really reached my ""true potential"" and actually succeeded/won at anything since 5th grade.

This anxiety, depression, and low self estimated has made me lose out on ** a lot** of typical teenage experiences, so much so that I'm twenty now and I still haven't experienced much.

A year and a half ago, after multiple failed entrance exam attempts, I joined an engineering college in my city. For a while, things were slow, but it later picked up, and by the second semester, I became fairly acceptable in my class ( this college is basically structured like a school really), and *more importantly*, it made me feel like I was actually accepted somewhere, for the first time in my 20-year-old life. I was actually going out, doing stuff a normal person my age would be doing. I actually **belonged somewhere**, and it seemed like at least this part of my life was improving.

But lately, with the anxiety I've been a weird mess and I confided a few of my gaping insecurities in a friend, I kinda sorta cried(as close to crying as possible) my heart out multiple times.  Apparently, he couldn't really be trusted, and it ended up spreading like wild fire throughout the class. Now,this was a golden opportunity for a very social and popular person in our group. He never really liked me, he has tried to put me down multiple times behind my back while being good to me on face value. I just assumed it to be jealously. This personstarted whispering innocuous things to make me look like a fool to people, then the humiliating memes came about me, then the pathetic lies.

I was stupid enough to think he was actually a friend and words could resolve this. I didn't exactly handle that well and it just made everybody think I'm an anxious mess who depresses people(fitting his narrative perfectly). He ended up turning a lot of people against me, even my friends started to believe I was bad company. Last week, I was officially kicked out of the WhatsApp group we've had for a year (well, they were polite enough to make another one with all the same people bar one). I got stopped getting invited to parties, and just outings in general even though I've asked them to hang. A bunch of them are still pretty friendly to my face.

**But now**, I'm back to square one. With no real friends I could do stuff with. Most of the old ones having just left me (albeit because of the horrible stuff I apparently said about them)And I'm worried the remaining of my college life is just going to end up like my school life, where I was an outcast who wasn't involved in anything. And this messes me up big time. This is the one thing I *absolutely* *hate*. 

I'm sorry if this post seems long or trivial to you. But this messes me up really bad. 

**Why am I not capable of creating basic human connections/friendships? What is it in my that even messes up amazing ones I used to have.** I've been in this city for 15 years, and I only have 2-3 friends I can actually count on.

Where do I even go from here, when my only friends hate me, and I'm forced (minimum attendance criteria) to spend 90% of my weekdays with them?",12Oct2017,5

There's a central committee that runs things -- it's just some friends that keep it in their little circle.  My friend forwards emails they send to their circle and it's super toxic -- like the minister belittling members of the church kind of toxic. 

The ""little circle"" is super-hostile to change. Some of them don't even go to church on Sunday half the time, it's just a power trip.  We haven't added any members for years.  I know they've made mistakes running things, but we can't talk about it and there's no chance for anybody else to get involved.

181,"Maybe it's my age (25) and the fact that my parents had me late and are already in their 60's but no one around me ever seems to be talking about this, when it's on my mind like 24/7.

An extreme amount of my mental energy is taken up by the dread of something happening to my parents. I'm incredibly lucky to have an amazing family that I'm so obsessed with, but how do you balance that with life responsibilities and shit? 

1. It is the ONE thing that makes me hesistate when I think of marrying my boyfriend. I have moved states away from my hometown with him, for his job, to a place he loves. I like it here too, but I just can't be happy thinking ""okay, if I'm lucky I have 10 years left with my parents... and I'm currently wasting them away halfway across the country."" If something were to happen to one of them while I was away I would NEVER forgive myself.

2. It is also the thing that makes me want to QUICKLY jump into marriage with my boyfriend and start having kids. I so badly want for them to experience being grandparents, and my brother isn't making any moves that way, so it's gotta be me, right? This sounds completely crazy, but I would TOTALLY DO THIS. I don't think I could take it if any kids I have never know their amazing grandparents. It fucks me up just typing that. 

3. I am from rural middle of nowheresville in a part of the country my boyfriend doesn't really like... There's no draw to it, certainly not many job opportunities, but because of my family I see myself NEEDING to move back close to home in the next couple or few years. I haven't brought this up to him, because I'm terrified he won't consider it, and then what? 

4. Do normal people prioritize their S.O.s over their parents? If so, how?! I would ultimately break up with my boyfriend, I think, if the only other alternative was living this far away forever. Does this say something bad about my relationship with him, or something good about my relationship with my family?

211,"This might be off topic, but I'll be glad if someone answers my question.

When I was a kid (5-6 years old) there was this boy (let me call him Simba) who lived in our neighboring house, who was at least 10 years my senior. My dad would remain at office the entire day and mom would stay busy with household chores. So Simba would often come to our house to take me with him for playing. He would take me to a nearby building along with one of his friends and we would play hide and seek. Surprisingly, Simba's friend would always do the counting and the two of us would hide all the time.

While hiding, one day he hugged me tightly from behind and I could feel his dick pressing against my ass. It felt awkward but he told me to be quiet and stop moving or else his friend would find us out. I thought this 'hugging' thing was a sort of strategy and was therefore okay with it. This went on for a couple of days, until one day.

This time, Simba told me to lay down on the floor because there was a so called hole in the wall  which would help his friend find us out. Without asking any further questions, I did what he said, and then he laid on top of me. He was rubbing his dick against my dick and this kept going for like a minute. This went on for a couple of days too. One day he came to our house to take me but since I was not home, he took my sister instead (She was a couple of years older than me) and perhaps did the same type of thing with her too. She complained it to my grandmother and then my grandmother told my mom about it. It was then I reazlied what he did with me was wrong and then I told everyting to my mom. My mom called Simba's mom and let her know what her Son has been doing recently. She was ashamed and shifted to another house a couple of months later. That motherfucker was never seen again.

 Both of us were on clothes during 'that time'. So What I want to ask is, does this fall under the category of MOLESTATION? Was I molested? Should I be ashamed?

221,"My husband and I currently live in middle of nowhere Iowa. My family is 9 hours away. His family is 24 hours away. 

We just had a child and are very lonely. There’s nothing special to us out here except a house that we have partially remodeled. We have no friends, because DH is a recovered alcoholic and most people here drink due to boredom. 

It’s been decided that we want to move, but the hard part is deciding between 2 locations. 

Indiana - My grandparents live there, and they were very involved in my raising. My uncle lives there and has two teenage children. It’s familiar, because I used to live there. Lots of manufacturing work available, and that’s what my husband does. Need for teachers in that area, and that’s what I want to finish college for and do when I’m done being a SAHM. Houses that we would be able to get a mortgage for on one income. Some farming availability out there, we want livestock. Somewhat possibility of having a mostly self sufficient home. Good school district that I know about. Good church that we used to be part of. His family is very accepting of distance. 

Not to be morbid, but my grandparents are very old and I don’t know how long they have. That’s a reason to go there, but also a reason not to set up our lives around them. My uncle is not good at being involved with family, because he is too busy. My cousins are looking at going off to colleges away from there. There’s no other family there. Work is very dependent on the economy, because it’s all luxury manufacturing. Less farming area all the time. Subdivisions are forming and driving up prices (pro and con). Crime rate is going up. My siblings who have disowned me for cutting off my mother are there and make family gatherings difficult. (My mother is not located there though.) We would likely only see his family once a year. 

Arizona - DH’s parents both live there. His 2 sisters live there with 2 children each (around middle school age). Should be jobs somewhere considering that his family is spread out enough that we can have our choice of towns. I read that they have a teacher shortage and will fund your college if you teach in a public school. Most of the area is familiar to DH. I’ve been told there’s some livestock out there. We can take our choice of where to live and still have people around. There are churches with our denomination out there. 

Unfortunately my family would likely never see us unless we flew out. They’ve never been on a plane and never intend to, plus there’s some complications with driving. They don’t do long distance well. We don’t know where we would live or how to narrow it down. It’s possible that the houses could cost more than we could manage. Farms and self sufficient living may be less accessible. I don’t know anything about the jobs. Most of the cons are the uncertainty or lack of info. Plus I am afraid of what I heard about crime. 

Our priorities are first things to do with children. That’s school, room and content to explore outside, stability/not moving much, ability to maintain staying at home or being only part time until school age, family, community/church, and safety. After is self sufficiency. So frugal/small footprint living, employment, maybe some farming. 

We just don’t know what to do and my DH is 100% behind me and letting me lead the way. He says he can deal with distance, because his family is used to/good at it. I just don’t think that’s a good enough reason to decide to go to Indiana. I really worry about the grief my family will give me for moving further and also the grief they will have. Sometimes I wish he would decide so I don’t have to. 

I’m not asking for the decision to simply be made for us. Please just point out any flaws, things I missed, things you know about that I don’t and advice on how you would decide. ",12Oct2017,7

227,"Hey guys, first time ever asking the internet for advice,  it here goes.  My wife and I have been married for just one year, together for 6.  She's 27, I'm 34.  We have had some rough patches through our engagement but always worked stuff out.  Sex has become less and less frequent since about 3 years ago.  Now I understand sex isn't gonna always be fireworks like when we first got together, however, we took vows to have and to hold.  To start, my wife was very much a highly sexual being when we first started dating.  Fast forward to present day, she has zero desire for sex.  I had to ask very nicely for sex on our wedding night.  She has gained about 30 lbs since we got engaged and always is very hard on herself for the weight gain.  I have never once said anything to criticize or make her feel self conscious about her weight.  I tell her I love her everyday, buy her flowers, take her out every weekend, hold her hand, and tell her how sexy and special she is.  When I make a sexual advance, she pushes me away and says get off of me.  She blames her lack of desire on her weight gain.  I'm at the point where I'm almost begging which is pathetic, I know.  Here's the kicker, we have several vibrators and dildos, and I can tell by looking in the basket they're located in, they get moved around quite a bit.  Now I'm not one to tell another human not to masturbate, but if you're telling your spouse you're not in the mood, or feel self conscious about your body, why turn to masturbation?  I understand it's less complicated and gets you off easier, but isn't that almost cheating?  She has never initiated sex since we've been married.  We went to counseling and the counseled basically told her, you should try and meet your husbands needs, make an effort at least.  She felt cornered.  I'm in good shape, take care of my body, and honestly don't care if my wife gained 200 lbs, I'd still wanna fuck her brains out.  We have no kids, we own property together however.  I will add as a disclaimer so I get honest advice, I have always had a premature ejaculation issue.  I've tried everything, pills and potions.  I always offer to get her off orally before I penetrate as I can only last about 2 minutes.  I take all the rejection personally and she tells me not to cuz it's her issue, but never offers a solution.  I want to have sex with my wife and I had no idea marriage would present this issue so soon.  Any advice would be helpful",12Oct2017,9
228,"I've been addicted to just using a computer, or video games, since probably the age of 6-7. Back then it was fun, parents moderated my time so it wasn't that bad. As I got older and that stopped happening, it literally consumed my life.

Constantly playing video games, watching shows, just random surfing or, if nothing else available, literally just looking at settings on a computer screen or messing with various default programs just to pass the time.

This hurt me more than I realized it did growing up. Made me pass up on tons of opportunities I never got to see, missed out on friendships I never pursued. 

I'm now 24 and it's at it's worst. I spend all my time on the computer or on a video game. A lifetime of instant results/satisfaction with computers has ruined me as far as patience goes. I have no tangible skills to speak of due to this. I get migraines every day from using the damn things. I shun the people closest in my life, such as my wife and son. Away from these devices, I'm pretty much a nobody. And I hate myself for it because every last bit of it is my fault.

But now it's impossible for me to get rid of it! I use the internet for entertainment, financial obligations, research, etc. Not everything I do on it is useless, but just it's existence is dragging me down an addiction hole that I can never get out of. 

How do I get out of it!?",12Oct2017,1
229,"He and I have been texting for about a year. Conversation  was good at first, got bad in the middle, got good again, and is now back  to being bad. He just keeps talking about things he wants to. Whenever I try to get a word in about my own life or interests, he literally just ignores them. If he likes something, he'd want me to like them, too. That's it. What I ACTUALLY like, or anything to do with my life, doesn't matter. It's a pain, yeah. But I can't get out of it. I feel like he needs me. I'm the one person who has been nice to him (except for this one time I got pissed at him, but it blew over). He's got a LOT of issues. Bad childhood, bad present life, identity crises... he can't really talk to anyone about them, except for me. I try to help and all. I can't just end things, desert him and leave him stranded with nobody else to go to. At the same time, it's a HUGE burden and I honestly can't take it anymore, since there's nothing in it for me.

231,"Hey everyone, I really don't post anywhere but I feel like I need some advice on this. I feel a little lost.

This morning I was waiting for the bank to open in the warm ATM area (it was +5 out), a man came in and asked me for change. There were 4 other people in there with me. I told him I did not have any on me (which was true, I was only there for some documents I'm really strapped for cash right now and have 1 child + another coming in December). So after I told him I couldn't help him he told me fuck you. So I turned away from him, he then got louder and said over and over he would stab me and threatened to send gangs after me. Finally the bank opened and I immediately leaned into a worker and told them to call some security. They told me they already called the police. After that I thought nothing of it, finished my banking and left the building and just wanted to get back to my family waiting in the car. As I was driving home I received a call from the police asking me to press charges so that they may finally get some justice on this person. He explained how this person is a common problem for many people but they never had enough to work with. But now they do with me. So I agreed to give them my statement so that they may prosecute him so he doesn't end up actually stabbing the next person that he talks too. 

Now we all want to do what is right, that's how we are raised. And the right thing to do in this situation is to charge the criminal. So that's exactly what I did. But now.. I just feel scared. If I had just not charged him and moved on than he wouldn't have ever found out my name (which he will once it goes to trial), then I might not feel as scared. Honestly it didn't bother me when he threatened me, It's happened to me a lot before as a very skinny small white kid with a father as a police officer, I've been threatened a lot in my life. But I have a family now, and on the off chance this guy knows someone just dumb enough to actually hurt one of them and I knew it all came back to the fact that he learned my name through the charge, fuck I couldn't live with myself. But I mean I couldn't live with myself if I had not charged him and he ended up hurting the next person in the bank tomorrow or whatever it may be you know? 
So I just need some advice on how the hell to cope with doing what's right? How can I feel like I am more prepared to protect my family? I feel so powerless. I don't even know if this is the right place to ask but, how do you go to sleep knowing there's a very small chance something could go wrong? ",12Oct2017,19
232,"This might be an ADHD-influenced problem. I have seldom completed anything that I have started that would take me longer than a few hours to complete, and often won't even bother starting new projects I *want to do* because the time it would take to complete it doesn't feel worth the effort. I hold myself to higher standards than others, and soon after beginning something new, I will have already raised the bar for myself. 

Example: Creative writing. I love writing, and it's one of the few things in which I am confident of my abilities. But when starting a new project, I will eventually fall into a trap to where I will feel as though I could do better than what I've already written or I have come up with better ideas already and I need to start over. It is a continuous loop.

236,"Hello, r/Advice. I was told by a friend you might be able to help me with a serious problem. So I created a Reddit account to call for your aid.

My son is 14 years old and has been verbally abusive and hateful towards every person he talks to, including myself, he used to be such a sweet boy but sadly my husband was KIA in Afghanistan about 7 months ago.

Since the day we were told the news my son has deteriorated horribly, and his behavior and grades in school have reached an all-time low. We've tried counseling, and we've tried therapy, but nothing seems to be making any impact on his behavior.

Now I'm getting advice from some of my friends to have him sent away to some sort of camp for troubled teens, but I'm just not sure whether or not that's the right thing to do...

238,"I am thirteen years old. I've been singing since I was maybe five of six, around there. But I was okay with singing in front of my family back then... I think... Well I don't remember. My voice has been cracking a little bit every so often because I can only sing/practice at school. I have songs I am performing in December: three songs, possibly four, and I might be playing bass or something at my Halloween dance.

Now I only get to practice two of my songs once or twice a week while one is whenever I have music class which is twice a week because a lot of my class is doing that one with me. Two guitarists, me and another guy, one bass player, two drummers and a whole wack load of singers. That's only from my class, though, we have two 7/8 classes that are doing that song.

But anyways, I cannot sing in front of my family. My parents and sister are disappointed that I don't sing for them and that they can only here me when I perform. I wanna be able to sing around my family but I literally cannot. I tried once last year but my brother (14m) told me to shut up and my confidence dropped. I sing in the shower only sometimes now because once I came out and my older sister (18f)  said she heard me singing and I was completely embarrassed.

The only person in my family I'm comfortable singing with is my younger sister (11f) who sings aswell. She really doesn't like when I sing in my ""bad/silly"" voice when my family is around, in fact, she gets mad at me. It's a habit that I hate, whenever I try, I cannot do my real voice. And I have a niece who is almost seven months who already loves it when I sing to her alone in the car. She cries, but not a sad cry.

I want to be able to sing to my niece but I can't. I have social anxiety and I and too scared to do any singing. And I want to so so bad... Any advice?",12Oct2017,1
239,"Quick note, ""closest to me"" is whoever I feel is basically my #1 in life at the moment (though that sounds like they're easily replaceable).

I've known for a while now that I am a very malleable person. I'm nothing more than a creation of my friends, especially those who I feel are closest to me. Luckily the majority of my life so far (now first year university) I've only been surrounded with nice people; but I've realized after my last closest friend, I can be influenced to do negative things, even if I think I know my morals and values like the back of my hand (even if it might be partially due to depression, don't suggest therapy, I've talked to people about my problems before, it just makes my problems hurt more). Now that my me and my friend have grown apart (slightly), I'm starting to question my actions again. Another example is lets say I am against a minimum wage of $15 (an example don't kill me reddit), and my closest ""person"" is for it, by the end of a conversation I would probably change my views to be in the middle. Anyone have any advice to at least make me less like play-doh?

TLDR; In the face of the people I feel are closest to me, I just can't help but be whatever they want me to do, or whatever they want to do. Advice to stop?",12Oct2017,1
240,"So I'll try and keep this short.
I've been dating this girl and went on my 2nd date with her. She's 19 I'm 22. Yesterday was our 2nd date.

During the date we had some ice cream near a Panera in which she says something along the lines of her ex used to work at Panera and didn't know if it was this one. I didn't mind at all, Everyone has baggage and it's not like ex's aren't brought up eventually.

Later that night when I was driving her home her ex was brought up again and she told me she and him were going to go to a concert in November and hope they could just be friends. She also told me that although it was awkward telling me. If it was her decision she would still be with her ex because she cared for him a bunch. She also has only been single for about 2-3 months from him.


I'm okay with her baggage and I don't care about her being single for a just a little while. However I don't really want to play 2nd best, rebound guy, and I don't really want to just fill her lonely void. Id hate to think I'm only there because she just needs someone. She's really nice and sweet and I'd love to at least try things out if feelings are genuine but if there not and I'm just filling a void fuck that

241,"So when I was 17, my dad left my mom and I here in Canada. He went to Europe, haven't seen him since. My mom is living in poverty and is in no shape to support me, so I got into doing bad things for money for a few years which I luckily got out of, so that isn't an option for me anymore.
Anyways, long story short... I don't have time to go to school because of work, but if I don't go to work I won't have money to pay for my rent while I'm going to school.

I have a job offer for a civilian company in Colorado making close to $30k more a year and they offer a tuition reimbursement.  My GI Bill is running out and the idea of not having student loans to finish would be awesome.

On the other side I have a job offer within the DoD still, but in Italy for up to five years and then I will have priority placement for a position stateside.  The pay is comparable to what I am making now except with the living quarters allowance which will allow me to pocket most of the money instead of paying rent.  Most everything I have been able to read says that I need three years in the system before being able to go for tuition reimbursement from DoD.

I was immediately thrown into a tailspin as I was only 19 years old and in college. Although my boyfriend lives 2 hours away for work, My family was supportive and I thought I could handle this change. Then, my mother had diabetic ketoacidosis and was in the ICU for almost 3 weeks. While she was in the hospital, I picked up the slack and took care of my brothers and father trying to keep everyone together. My mom made it and came home, but she had multiple falls afterwards. Have you ever seen your mother lay on the floor crying because she has fallen for the 8th time? It's completely awful, I was heavily pregnant and I couldn't even help her up.  This lasted for months and nobody had answers. Meanwhile, near the end of my pregnancy I developed preeclampsia and had to be induced, I gave birth on a Monday and on Friday I had to have an emergency appendectomy. It was traumatic and basically gave me ppd. Fast forward to now, 4 months later and we discovered a month ago my mother has a (hopefully) benign brain tumor and has to have brain surgery.

Long story short, my house received threats, because people got our address, and my dad said he was going to the police and never came back(he lied). Lied again when he said he no longer had his laptop when the police asked(he told me he does), but nothing came out of it. No proof apparently.

Now hes pissed at all his family for believing this, but he seems guilty to me, and if it's true i dont know how to feel. Would you still have a relationship with him?
I feel so bad for him, but not for me, if that makes sense. To lose everyone in an instant. ",12Oct2017,3
265,"My therapist is really nice and we get along well enough which makes it not horrible to talk to her. But she sort of just lets me talk and then asks very simple questions that I’ve already asked myself a thousand times. And sometimes she seems to be visibly annoyed or bored by what I’m saying. I can also tell when she suddenly tunes in because I’m saying something that sounds sort of ‘gossipy’ and interesting. I get that listening to other people talk isn’t the most fun thing in the world, but I am paying her to help me pick my brain and she hasn’t really done any of that. 

When I first came to her I was grieving the death of my father and she really helped me then by giving me some tips on how to get myself out of certain emotional reactions. But now I’m at the point where I want someone to just really dig into my brain and help me dissect some stuff and take apart, rebuild, etc. 

I’m very shy, and the thought of quitting therapy with her and finding a new therapist is very intimidating. I’m afraid of hurting her feelings, I know that sounds stupid, but I really am. If I go to a new therapist is she able to know that somehow? Could I just tell her I don’t think I need therapy anymore and then find a better therapist?

266,"This is my second year working as a special education teacher in a public school. I liked being a special education because it focuses on small group instruction. I hate being a teacher and everything that it entails. I hate co teaching with incompetent teachers who are lazy. I'm tired of trying to manage the classroom, I feel like I'm baby sitting more than teaching. My co teacher is so chaotic that it makes the kids unfocused. I barely have time to myself, I'm constantly grading, planning, and creating lessons. I've always wanted to be a teacher because I want to make a difference in people's lives. I know it sounds cliché but I love helping people. The job doesn't feel rewarding anymore, I honestly just feel bitter, angry, and extremely stressed out everyday. I don't know what job to pursue. I have a BA in History and education, and I'm almost done with my masters degree which is for secondary education. I feel like I've dedicated so much time and money into my career that it's stupid to leave. However, is it worth being miserable everyday? I don't want to go back to school for a long period of time either. I need advice, what should I do? I wouldn't know what type of job to pursue in either. I would consider myself as an introvert. I get easily stressed and I feel like I rather stay away from people now then helping them out. I need a good paying job ( more than 50K a year with benefits). Some things thats I am passionate about are nature, traveling, art, and music. Does any anybody know any good jobs that will fit my personality?! Maybe a job that works with the environment (no math and science skills required).",12Oct2017,6

270,"What's up Reddit. I'm an engineer in the energy industry and work a week on - week off schedule with home base in Austin, TX at the moment. When I'm working, I'm in deep South Texas. Single gas station sort of town. My company will be bringing me back to the office this December to work a typical 9/80 schedule again in Houston, TX. While I enjoy Austin very much, I'm looking forward to the work-life balance that a normal job in Houston offers. 

I'm tired of renting an apartment and moving my things every year. I'm ready to purchase my own house. I've got the cash for 20% to avoid PMI.

I'm struggling with where to purchase. With my budget, I've got a couple of options to consider. On one hand, I can purchase a 2007-ish home in what I'm calling the ""happening area"". OR just a few miles down the road, a 7 minute drive, I can purchase a new home where the neighborhood has not been through gentrification, yet.

On paper, financially, it makes sense to go with the new home purchase. The older options I have are going to need new roofs, HVAC repairs, water heaters, and other possible issues the inspector may find. I'm not saying that I'll be forking out that cash soon after the purchase, but I could likely expect to replace some of those big home expenses within 5 years.

The dilemma I'm having is internal. I don't know how important it is for me to live in the ""happening area"" and be around like minded young professionals. I'm worried if I don't live in it, I'll have trouble meeting folks. In particular, a girl to share my life with. Is location, location, location, really that important for a 28 year old single guy? Or if you're within a few miles of it, is that close enough? 

I will say, the fact that all my other friends are getting married and having kids is affecting me. I feel myself having some anxiety that I haven't met the girl yet...

271,"I feel like A complete fuckup and I don't know how to take control of my life.

I am 34, I have one child, a decent job, and a home that I pay a mortgage on. I've filed for bankruptcy,  had my car repossessed, gotten divorced twice,  been a part of a polyamorous triad, been a booty call, dated another couple and had a couple one night stands. My relationships are a crazy mess of emotionally unavailable and abusive people. 1st spouse arrested for masturbating in a public department store, had multiple affairs, broke my nose, ribs, and arm. Second spouse- had a rought time with custody with his ex, completely withdrew and spent the next 6 years playing videos games, spending my money so I would stay poor and isolated, using drugs and then had an affair resulting in a child. He now has five more his with five other women.  I moved on to polyamory because I felt like everyone just cheats, at least that way I could know about itand it wasn't a lie or a betrayal. Instead, I was discussed in absentia, limited on when I was allowed to be a part of their life, rejected in spite of all that I provided to the relationship they used one of my vehicles for 8 months without paying for it etc. Then the last relationship that I was in was more of a situationship- Loved one evening a week, denied in the everyday, included prolific drug use on his part and eventually mine. All drug use has stopped except the Pot. I don't think I know or understand what non-abusive relationship looks like. I've always been too good at doing what I am told. I always try to be helpful and supportive.  Every time I escape something bad, I find my way into something that I later find out is still bad- its just better than what I knew before.  
I work full time, go to school full time(grad school), and try to drive for rideshare companies on the weekends that I do not have my daughter. I also take care of my mentally ill mother- one of my childhood abusers. She went through a total knee replacement and needed a ton of care, now just when I've gotten through that she is beginning to have cancer and kidney issues. I feel like I will never escape. I am the only family member that will have anything to do with her and I am driven by a lifetime of guilt due to her narcissistic bipolar behavior.If I don't care for her at this point she'll be homeless.
 I live in a medium-sized city in the midwest.  I feel completely nuts all the time. My childhood was ridiculously abusive, physically, mentally and sexually(abused by a sibling). So my family support system is non existent. I've tried so hard to overcome my beginnings but I feel like I just keep making terrible mistakes because my life and social skills suck. I have no close personal friends. My Best friend died when we were in our early twenties- unmedicated epilepsy with no insurance, and then when I have made friends, they tend to move on after a couple years and by move on I mean move to other places and send maybe a facebook message once per year.  
 I have become completely overwhelmed. I am not good at confrontations, and one of my mothers mental problems is clothing hoarding and it is beginning to seep into the rest of my home. I've forced several conversations on this issue and after each one I see maybe a 4-12 hour improvement. Then back to business as usual. My home is falling into disrepair, i can neither afford repairs, nor do I have the ability to complete them myself.  I am struggling so much and I have begun to smoke pot in addition to my anti depressants and anti anxiety meds as a way to cope and numb my feelings. I see a therapist- because If I wasn't I am pretty sure that I would not be functional at all.  My financial life is a wreck, my love life is a wreck, my home life is a wreck and I feel out of control and I don't know how to fix any of it. I don't even know how to start.

278,I was headed home and had to stop outside my apartment for a school bus with the lights on. I was stopped for a while because there is a single mom with a disabled boy in my apartment. I saw a group of 4-6 small kids walking with backpacks with a 20something woman but across the street there was a man in all black and a hoodie just looking at them. I made eye contact with him and he turned his head and seemed to scratch it for about 5 second while facing a rock wall. I began to drive off but when i did he glanced over at me and met my eyes with this look like he was worried he got caught doing something. It was really sketchy and just creeped me out a little but Im not sure it wasnt just a homeless guy being strange. Should I do anything?

279,"I just started freshman year. Throughout my past school years I’ve been mainly a B- to A- student. I’ve been trying to bring my worth ethic up and my procrastination down, but every year nothing changes. I’m not the *smartest* kid ever but I’m not ignorant. I even take 3 honors out of my 5 core classes (2 B’s and one low A). I just never seem to exceed in any of my classes. As much as I’m going to try, I don’t see myself changing that much. So my question is, can I get into good colleges with that average of a grade? My dad is an SAT teacher, I’m sure I’ll do fine on huge tests like that, but what I’m worried about is colleges seeing my grades/GPA. I have a lot of time until then, but I just see my future going down this path. Maybe a few tips on how I can work harder would be great too. Thanks everyone!

My boss’ birthday was two weeks ago. I’ve only been with the company for a short time and I’m not yet familiar with everyone’s birthdays or even if they like celebrating them. Anyway, I gauged interest on doing a belated card and a gift or something. No one was interested. So alone, I picked a card and got a $30 gift card for a movie and a dinner. I thought she and her husband could enjoy the  treat on a date night. She returned the gift card but kept the card and said she couldn’t accept the gift card because it could pose a conflict of interest. 

Now, I know, from previous experience, that gifts are typically supposed to flow down from the top of the hierarchy. However, as someone with a birthday just a day before Christmas, I know what’s it’s like to get shafted on gifts and recognition.

281,"I am a 90+ avg student. Im currently in high school and after a test or when we get report cards, i get my best friend or classmate asking me what i got. I dont want to answer this question because it makes them see me as a ""threat"" or competition and I really hate that. 
I have tried saying ""i did well"" or something like that or "" i forgot my grade"" but people sometimes get angry, and my friend just persists or she takes my test to see how i did. 

In class today, my teacher was calling up students and when i got my test back and sat down, my friend asked me what i got and i said i did well and she said what did u get? But this is the one that is persistent and i dont know how to not tell her so i told her i got perfect. The thing with her is that she will take my test to find out what i got and I dont want to make a big deal out of it in front of the people i am sort of friends with and shit so people just ended up knowing i got perfect on my test and i hate it.

For some reason I’ve picked up the habit of looking down when thinking about something, even if it’s in the middle of a conversation. I can’t help it, it just automatically happens. And when I attempt to stop it I just feel awkward staring at someone while trying to pull a memory forward or thinking about an answer.

287,"Confliction:

In the 2 years since graduating high school(I'm now 20) I've hesitated to apply for college. I've often doubted my commitment to school and seen some friends drop out, just to be left in debt(I don't come from a wealthy family either) The fear of debt and commitment to school, and then a profession, has given me a lot of anxiety about the future.

My Dream:

I've always been a pretty artistic and creative person, my favorite passions being producing music, shooting/editing videos and writing. I've often dreamed of turning my passions into a career. How rewarding would it be to be able to provide for your family, doing the things you love? Sadly, most people aren't that fortunate....

However, I believe in my abilities that I could be successful. I want to provide quality content to the people of the world. There's just one problem. How do I get my content to the people of the world? I come from a medium sized town with a much older demographic. How do you reach a wider audience?......

The Plan:

So I know this is bold, and it very well carries a lot of risks, however, I believe the potential reward makes it worth the risk.

My plan is to travel the country in my car. Preforming at open mics, busking in the streets, jumping from city to city, all the while documenting it on social media, as well as on my DSLR.

I have 3 Major Goals:

1. Reach an audience &amp; Create an online community

When it comes to the business, it's a numbers game. That's what it takes to get paid gigs. But at the same time, if I can make sincere relationships, and share intimate moments with people across the world and create an online community of support and love for one another, that would be rewarding in itself.

2. Make the trip sustainable 

Over the past 2 years I've saved roughly $2,000 for the trip. On the road, that money can burn quickly. It's important that I spend wisely. Luckily, I have friends in several states that would give me a place to crash and I'm not opposed to sleeping in my car. I will also likely busk(street preform) for tips, but the biggest goal, that would likely allow me to fully pursue my dream is.....

3. Gig

If I could book consistent gigs, therefore, consistently receive money and exposure, that would give me the greatest chance of achieving my goals. From there it would all rely on me.

I'm aware that this won't happen over night. It's gonna take a lot of time, effort and dedication. Even if I fail, I believe this adventure will be more satisfying than spending the next 4 years of my life in college wondering what could have been. There will always be time for me to take out a loan and go to school. But this opportunity may never present itself again.

At the same time, I feel cowardly, leaving my family behind. My father, who's now 50, still works manual labor. I could very well give up on my dreams and go to school. That would be the safe thing to do........




But what's life without a little risk? What should I do?",12Oct2017,1
