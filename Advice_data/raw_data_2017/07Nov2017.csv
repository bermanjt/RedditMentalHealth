I'm curious to know where the boundaries are between my Professor and I (student)? What is the difference between a Mentor and Friend for professors and does it apply to me? Is there a difference between university student friendship with prof and high school friendship with teacher?

Background:
My professor and I walk to and from class, I am a female student and my professor is in her 30's. I've gotten to know her really well and we even had a random dinner . I go to her office hours everyday and share a coffee. I also go to her for many personal issue. We've discussed confidential information and we've cried in front of each other. She has a partner and I've even met him and she's only here for 6 more months and knows no one else in town.  We email constantly, I consider her a friend or a mentor. I feel as if I'm annoying her sometime with emails or almost infatuated. She bought me a couple books though, which was nice. Just really confused. ",07Nov2017,1
1,"In the evening yesterday I was sitting in a gas station, next to me there was a really expensive black Mercedes jeep filling up gas. When it left I saw a wallet on the ground next to where the jeep was. 

I took it and saw 6000€ inside of it so I quickly left.

Now back at home I feel really bad and want to give it back to the guy but don't really know how.

Texas. Wallet belonged to some russian guy from the ID. Expensive Mercedes jeep, don't know the number plates.",07Nov2017,4

I'm a 35 year old man from the United States. I lost my job a few weeks ago. I was working on an IT service desk taking incoming calls from end users. In a lot of ways, it was a typical call center type of environment. It was going okay until I kinda just (not sure how else to describe it.) broke. I just can't couldn't bring myself to go to work and deal with 8 hours of phone calls from people who are potentially going to be salty as fuck or idiots. It just filled me with lots of anxiety and I just kinda broke. 

I've worked in quite a few call center environments and I'm just beyond burned out on it currently. I think it's safe to say that that kind of work makes me miserable and that I don't ever want to do it ever again. My resume, unfortunately, is full of that type of experience so I feel kinda pigeon-holed into that type of work. 

I was put on some medication by my doctor (Wellbutrin) but it doesn't seem to be doing very much. My ability to get any sort of meaningful treatment is limited due to the fact I recently lost my insurance. 

I had been working on an IT degree in hopes of getting a higher level IT job but I find myself questioning my desire to do that. At this point, I suspect that I really don't want to work in IT. If that's the case, I find myself unemployed and with no career path. 

People ask me what I would do if money was no object and honestly I've never had an answer. 

How do I determine what it is I want to do? ",07Nov2017,2
3,"So I really love watching MMA and I was working out with a personal trainer and I did a lot of like bag work and I loved it. I feel like I’m too fat to do it though. I’m 5’7 and I’m 170.

She’s too out of shape for this.” I lost over 100 pounds and so I also have some extra skin on my arms and around my stomach. It’s not super terrible, but I notice it.

5,"I was sitting behind some unopened stores in my car rehearsing a monologue. Cars were generally driving back and forth but this one drove up pretty quick and slammed the breaks. The tires screeched and it made me jump. 

I looked up and saw a really big guy unbuckling his seat belt and he just began wailing on the person in the passenger seat. I couldn't hear yelling or anything. I immediately pretended like I was listening to a voicemail and looking the other way. Don't know what I really could've done, I'm a scrawny guy.

14,"So.. my ex will call her S she lived with me for a year and half. we broke up. now im with my new girlfriend call her K. they dont have issues with each other but just yesterday i got a text from one of those uncallable text numbers asking me to help them and i assumed it was S cause she said things only me and her knew and she needed me to get her cause she was homeless ect. things didn't add up she said but i was out the door in a second and couldnt leave this person ""freezing and homeless"" as they said. it made sense in that moment and i felt bad. so with my friends we went to do what we wanted and i told this person to meet me n my friends there n they didn't show up.



the next day i ask my ex why she lied and she had no idea what i was talking about which means someone was pretending to be her, or she's a good liar but she never struck me as a liar she was always a very nice person that just was a free spirit.  The problem here is that no one has my number. not even my girlfriend or my ex. And no one knows anything that was said yesterday in that text except me and S so this person is her or they know everything and S has no idea who it is. Also she got fired from a job recently and K said she saw her yesterday but S said she hasnt been there in weeks. So i'm not sure who's lying. it seems like someones setting up S cause it all falls back to her. And S is lying about not working at her job anymore cause K works next door and sees her go in and all the time. So if s is lying bout that, she could very well be lying bout not texting me that. But i have no concrete proof. Just texts that sound like her and things said only we know and she swears she has no idea and is even risking her job so that i believe her. I don't know who to believe, and i still have no idea who texted me.",07Nov2017,1
16,"As the titles states.  Last week I had an interview which required both a drug screen/physical as well as a background check to be submitted within 48 hours of the interview.  I had A LOT of clerical issues with the drug screen and physical that took up a lot of my time, and as a result I completely forgot to submit my information to the company for the background check.

Here I am today, just a few hours ago sorting through my email and I see that I received automated reminders about the background check needing submission among the spam.

I immediately filled it out and emailed the guy I interviewed with apologizing for the oversight, letting him know that I am looking forward to training, granted I'm still a viable candidate for the position.  I guess my question is: has this happened to anyone else?  If so how did the company handle it?  I really wanted this job and invested countless hours testing and training for it.  Is it all for naught because of my background check info being a week late?

**UPDATE**: Within 5 minutes of submitting this post, the interviewer replied to me (it's 8pm EST - waayyyy past normal business hours and he sent it from his work email), and he said that as long as it got submitted it's not an issue.  I'm glad everything worked out, and now I can tell others that it's not a huge deal (so long as you're not delaying it because you're trying to hide anything).

Months ago I applied for a job at academy and they are just now calling me and asking questions and wanting to possibly set up an interview.

18,"Vague title, I know, I couldn't think for a better title.   
  
TLDR at bottom.  
  

Background:  
I'm in an engineering program at school (currently a sophomore, started the program as a freshman) and next year I'm scheduled to start my first year of college (either electrical or mechanical engineering, I'm supposed to choose), while also being a junior in highschool. During my senior year, I'll also be going to the same college, and for one year after that I'll also be going to college.    
  
Now, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not a smart kid. It is what it is, math isn't my thing. What I want to do, and what I've wanted to do for quite a while is become an English teacher for either middle school or high school (7th-8th and 9th-10th grades respectively).  
  
I don't know much about money, and jobs. You know, basic adult responsibilities. Everybody in my town is very, very poor, so maybe how I see things are extreme, but I don't want to be worried about money when I'm older, it causes too much stress and doesn't really allow you to have fun. I see it every day with my mother. Potential engineering careers make more money than English teachers, which is why I'm still even debating this with myself. I know money can't buy happiness, but it sure does help.  
  
  
**TLDR;** In a pretty sweet engineering program, it's really hard, I'm bad at math, on course to fail, and I want to be an English teacher. What should I do?",07Nov2017,2
19,"Im a junior in highschool and literally hate everything and only live life for the small good things. But its so hard when you literally chased a girl who you knew for a long time and have history. Who then teases the shit out of you manipulating your mind making the finial blow of a already fucked up past. Like being betrayed by friends you thought you can trust. Now my social life is so fucked because im so self-conscious. Feeling though that almost everyone hates you like their something wrong with you. Being stranded for 2 years without not even one little bit from help from anyone. I know this shit is most of my fault but its so hard fixing your problems when you feel as if your in this world alone. Nobody understands you and its hard to voice yourself cause a littlest bad thing just crushes your heart. The thing that kills me the most though is its not like im some weird motherfucker or anything. Like i literally have no clue what is wrong with me. Almost no one tries even talking to me as if im non existent. I dont want everything  i just want somebody to love and friends i can trust 100%. I want to stop hiding my feeling even though its hard when you destroy yourself into thinking everyone hates you and nobody bothers trying to talk to because who wants to talk to a broken up guy anyway.

Do not worry about me to commit suicide or some stupid bullshit like that. Im either going to feel like im being hated by everyone get sick of it and just stop giving a fuck or find out people can love me and be friends with me.

So finally getting to hang out with her, I was pretty excited because after ~7months of talking I developed a kind of feeling for her. I really liked this person I came to know. And our streak wasn't like 1 a day, we have talked everyday all day for 206 days. Anyway back to the story. We hung out at a bar with some of her friends. We got pretty drunk so she said I could sleep at her house (we're both 21 and still living with parents). I was shocked but obviously wasn't gonna drive home. We went to her house and climbed into bed. We didn't hook up or anything, didn't even cuddle, but I really enjoyed sleeping next to her and since seeing her my feelings have like doubled. It was weird, all this time I had thought she liked me like I liked her, but she didn't even try to cuddle or anything, which I thought all girls wanted. She rolled right over and went to bed. Yet she has told me over the time we were talking that she wants a relationship and all that. Also, she called me her ""something"" once when we were talking about relationships and I said how it must be nice for people to have something.

25,"Okay so here's the story. So long story short there's this kid at school who doesn't really respect me and acts as if he's superior. Most recently, we have been playing this board game in one of our classes and basically, he resorted to insulting my intelligence and making fun of me in front of everyone after losing the game. We then continued to play this board game, starting another game today, and the same type of shit happened. Now lemme give some background. I'm kinda hot-headed, definitely have some issues with impulsivity and anger. And being a hormone filled 17 year old boy with testosterone running through my veins, sometimes I just lose it. Don't worry I didn't start like wailing on this kid, I got too distracted with the game to do anything about it at that point in time. But after school was over and I was home, I was fuming. I ended up sending him this long ranty text that kinda put him in his place. I made sure he knew that I wasn't gonna take shit from him. No threats or anything, just a rant. It would've been much easier for me if he would've just responded equally as angry or asking for a fight, but instead he apologized.... im not sure what else he said because i cant bring myself to read the rest of the text. I just feel really awkward and kinda embarassed. I really wasn't expecting him to apologize at all. So is that a good thing? Do you think me doing that made him realize that I'm not weak and that I won't take shit from him? Do you think he now has respect for me...? I mean why would he apologize after me not being so nice to him? It's just gonna be really awakward at school tomorrow..... everyone knows and is talking about what I said, I really went in on this guy. Any advice? What should I do?",07Nov2017,1

27,"There's a long, long story going on here, but I'll try to keep it brief.

I had a horrible childhood. Don't get me wrong, my parents were wonderful and my brothers were as loving as brothers can be, but my school life sucked. 

My mom was the secretary of the elementary school I went to, my dad was a cop. This typically meant that whenever something happened to someone, I was pretty much a punching bag for whoever was slighted; Someone's older brother got arrested? My fault. Someone got caught cheating on a test and had to go to the office?  My fault. By the time I was 13 years old, I had no friends, was constantly getting ""kick me"" signs placed on my back, and was pretty much ostracized by everyone.

There was honestly nothing I could do; I complained to my mom once, that particular incident got punished, and the kids had such a horrendous lashback at me that it actually became better for my ""survival"" if I just shut my mouth and dealt with it. It got to the point where I was scared of telling my mom that one of the boys in my class would peak through the bathroom stall at me while I was trying to take care of business, partly because it was a catholic school but mostly because getting peeped on was better than being called worthless again.

And that's not even going into the accusations of favoritism my mom and the teachers got. Honestly if I was getting favoritism I don't know, though if I had to be completely honest I probably did get a little bit of it; I was the perfect kid who never did anything to misbehave, I was told, but only because I *Couldn't* do anything to misbehave.

And I tell you guys, if I thought I had it bad at elementary school, it was 6th grade that gave me an idea of hell, since it was part of a different school; physical abuse at gym, those ""special days"" like Homecoming and similar usually meant I was gonna get dragged off by my hands and feet and hit/choked off in some random hallway somewhere. Hell, *I* got yelled at for biting someone who was choking me, and when I tried to explain why I bit the dude nothing happened to him (one person versus five you know...). The faculty of that school did nothing to help, and I even had to take counselling for""talking back to a teacher"" when I tried to explain to my teacher that no, I didn't have a pencil which meant I couldn't do the assignment she wanted me to. And I could literally get up in the middle of a lecture to go to said counselling meetings and no one would even notice me leaving.

At the end of the year, we thankfully moved to a different city, but it didn't really help me all that much. Damage was done; I didn't trust anyone, couldn't make any friends (I was friendless until about four years ago at the age of 22), and was pissed off at everyone.

Honestly, the only reason I'm alive today is because my brother would get black out drunk and I could cry with him there to comfort me without him remembering anything in the morning. Because I didn't feel like I was worth bothering someone about my problems.

All the while I was trying desperately to get back into contact with people I grew up with, the ones who didn't directly torture me, slowly realizing they just truly didn't care. Someone, ANYONE, who could give me some sort of worth. It was borderline psychotic and absolutely creepy; I know things about the people I grew up with that I have no right to. The guy who would peep on me came out as gay/bi back in 2011, one of the worst offenders of my bullying is now a locally successful (but thankfully not good) musician, and on and on.

I was probably the most pathetic person you could imagine, but definitely worse than that.



In the past four years, I've gotten a lot better; while my brother kept me alive, my friends have pulled me out of my nosedive. I can program. I can speak three languages.  I respect people's privacy. I work out. I'm writing. I'm eating healthy. I'm finally at the ripe old age of 26 getting into the dating scene. My life is the best it's ever been and I actually feel happy, sad, excited, everything, and I can finally take pride in the work that I do.

I even moved out of the house to six hours away three years ago and don't for a second want to move back in with my parents. Pity I didn't move far enough away.

Recently I've been seeing one of the people I grew up with in town, hanging out at a ton of my own haunts; the Organic Store? yup. My workplace (retail)? Check. Downtown? There too. Hell, the only two places I don't see her are the Gym (there are millions of them here) and my nerdy places (comic store and such).

She's definitely someone who knew me at my worst and she definitely recognizes me if that look of disgust on her face is anything to go by (haven't been looked at in that manner since 6th), and I'm scared shitless that she's going to bring down everything I've worked so hard for in the past few years. I can't exactly ask her to stop doing the only fun thing in town (going downtown), any management worth their salt would get pissed at a worker telling someone to piss off at work, and it's the only organic store in town. That's even if I thought I could talk to her without regressing back into ""nobody loves me, boo hoo, take pity on me!"", and THAT'S even if she'd talk to me in the first place.

I'm freaking the fuck out and pretty much completely shut down whenever she walks in/by/near me, and I have no idea how to handle this situation; I thought this was over when I moved. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt (people change, I know I have and it's hypocritical of me to assume anyone, even the musician, couldn't have).

I'm at a complete loss as to how to handle this, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I know the right thing to do is to sort out my diet and exercise, but I cannot get over the crippling anxiety that it will be too little too late. Just to be clear I'm obviously not asking for medical advice, I'll let my doctor and cardiologist decide what to do in that regard. My motivation is completely stifled by the thought that I may not be able to undo the damage. I can barely get a wink of sleep because of the guilt of wrecking my health like I have. 

Just wondering if anyone of a similar age or older has gone through something like this, and how did you overcome the anxiety and sense of futility? ",07Nov2017,3

I like most people hate my job. I do accounting for a living and have been doing it for almost 6 years. I first started off doing AP, then FA, now I do Project Accounting. I feel as though I have given it a shot to like it and to find some aspect of it to enjoy.

Now this might sound odd, but I do want to get into finance. (Finance and accounting are a lot different). So I just got accepted to grad school to go for a MSF. 

However, I cannot do another 3 years of accounting while I cashflow the MSF. I have been miserable for years, drinking too much, general loss of happiness over the years.

I’m moving out on my own in less than 8 months, I already have a place set up, and yet my mom essentially forces me to lie to her if I want the same kind of teenage experience as my peers.

56,"My grandmother (who I live with) and I have always been on very bad terms. I turned 18 last month and I am planning on moving out by possibly March or April. She has always been an alcoholic and is constantly fighting with me. For my 17th birthday, she bought me an $11,000 car which I can’t drive in the winter because it is a roadster. So, last night, she offered to co-sign on a loan for a $24,000 car so that I would have something to drive in the winter. My family is by no means rich whatsoever. I agreed, thinking that I would be paying around $300/month (according to my local dealership) on a 72 month financing plan. I have been having to take the bus in the winter, by the way. 

I got home from work tonight and she tells me that she won’t co-sign any loan for me unless I pay it off in 2 years which would make my payments at around $950/month. I told her no, I’m not doing that because I want to move out and I wouldn’t be able to afford that. She goes on to tell me that the only reason I want to move out is so I can go “fuck my fat ass boyfriend,” who is going to “dump me” the minute I move out. She called me a dumbass as well as a spoiled brat. She said that nobody my age has a “support system” like I do and I should wait until I’m 20 years old to move out. She screamed at me for about an hour calling me (basically) a slut that would “rather pay a landlord rent to fuck someone” than have a new car. 

Does this sound as if she is trying to manipulate me into not moving out, or is it just me? Am I in the wrong here?

69,"Tldr at the bottom 


Alright, so home coming is coming up Friday, and I really want this year to be the first year I ask someone out. I'm always very nervous around girls who I don't know, but around friends I'm completely natural. I'm by no means a geek, I'm an honors student and a wrestler, but I'm no football team captain. As far as popularity goes, I'm not unpopular and probably am slightly high on that scale. It probably helps that I've known pretty much everyone in my classes for several years considering we are all and have been in honors and we are usually put together. 

Anyways, I've never gotten into the dating scene, chalk that up to anxiety. Well, turns out one of my friends (not gonna lie, he's a no where near as likely to get a girlfriend as me) is going to ask the girl I've considered asking out to homecoming. He says it's a joke, as one of our other friends has a crush on her, but I'm pretty sure we both know that he's kinda in it for real. 

Well, at the same time, I've realized that I do, indeed want to ask her out, partly to put my friend down a little because he seems to think he's better than everyone else, even though he's passing well below the standards that the teachers say we need to maintain in order to remain in honors every year, as well as the fact that he's shorter than me by several inches yet weighs a lot more than me. 

The girl in question is one I've been a decent friend with for several years, and one who's not way out of my league. I also have no real conception about how girls think about me, as I've said I'm not too bad as far as that goes, but still. I already know she wants someone to ask her out, and I also know that I wouldn't be her first choice. Important though, is the fact that I kind of doubt anyone's going to ask her out. 

So, you can probably guess what I'm facing. The anxiety, stress and consequences of being turned down. She probably wouldn't make a big deal about it, but if my friends were to find out, that would not be good in the slightest. Right now my plan is to say something along the lines of ""I know I'm not your first choice, but if someone doesn't ask you to homecoming by Friday, would you want to go with me"" only probably a lot more visibly scared. 

I'm going to have to get into the dating scene at some point, and figure if I even ask someone out right now it would probably make it easier at some point. I'm obviously anxious, and completely horrified of a no. But, it's something I need to overcome at some point, might as well tear off that bandaid quicker. I'm sure a lot of you have gone through this at some point or another, and I'd just like tips. 

Tl;dr : afraid to ask someone whom I've known for a while and who's not out of my league out, need help.

Need to make 'invalid disk' workable (using cmd) and scavenge data from it.

I had windows 10 installed. Last night I was installing Elementary OS in dual boot. 
When selecting the partition to install in I selected one that already has some personal data on it along with lots of free space. 
I created a 2gb swap partition and a 20gb partition for the new OS. 
New OS didn't install. 
I restart the pc and windows won't boot. 
It says 'your windows has winload.exe missing and shows F8 for startup option. Nothing works.
I took the windows10 copy I had on a USB stick and booted with it for doing a ' repair' 
That too doesn't happen. 
It says 'The drive in which windows is installed, is looked. Please unlock the drive' 
I've tied all the options that's there in the recovery. None of them work 

My final resort was to use the CMD. 
I ran the command 'DiskPart',
It showed:
0 (invalid) disk 986GB 
1 (online) disk 7688MB


when I selected  '0 disk'  it showed all the partitions perfectly! 
Which means my files are still on the hardisk(at least it seems so), it's just 'invalid' 

I guess the answer lies is making the 'invalid' disk 'valid'

82,"Alright. Second post to this sub Reddit in in an hour, first was about asking a girl out for the first time, which gives you a general idea of my age bracket. 

So, sometime over the weekend, this girl sent a video of her massaging her vagina to someone (she claims it was hacked) whom in turn sent it to someone who sent it to a friend who showed everyone it. Half of the school knows now, and I'm sure the other half is going to be talking about it tomorrow. 

So, that means the odds of someone somewhere talking about it and a teacher overhearing it is high. This also means that it's likely that they'll implicate my friend in how they saw it, which means bye bye her. It also means that I could get suspended for even being in a group chat she sent it to, which I was. 

You think your school had a zero tolerance policy? My school has a negative number. They have suspended someone for being in the same bathroom, minding his own business, when a fight broke out. They will not mess around. 

They also have a crazy good way of finding out who knows and knew about this stuff. This means that 
1) my friend and anyone who showed this or sent it to anyone is gone
2) they could find out I've known about some girls nudes getting passed around school for days
3) suspension
4) getting kicked off of the clubs and sports I'm in
5) parents freak out
6) these people were distributing child pornography and I was technically involved in it according to their standards

So maybe I should be the one to snitch? Maybe I should completely delete my social media accounts, and start working on a testimony. Not kidding when I say if they find out, I could be on a line. I don't know what advice could be given to me, but right now I'm sufficiently scared for me and my friend who would probably get expelled. ",07Nov2017,2
84,"So a little background story. I am currently a third year student at a huge university, and this is my first year officially living off-campus. I was excited for this moment all throughout last year, because now I can finally live at school independently. Unfortunately, the beginning of the year came with a pretty unusual twist for me. I am living with a bunch of guys, most of whom were born and raised in the town next to my hometown. Because of this, I felt inclined to live with them this year, since they all are super cool and I like them a lot. However, halfway through the spring semester of last year, one of my old high school acquaintances (we will call him S) started to visit one of my current housemates one weekend during this time (we will call this guy B). S and I used to be boy scouts together when we were high schoolers, and for the most part, I got along with him pretty well despite not being really close with him when we were younger. However, after high school S was supposed to go his own path and attend a different college. After seeing him for the first time in almost two years, I asked him how things were going. Unfortunately, I found out that he was recently expelled and permanently banned from his college campus for some drug related incident. I felt bad for him at first, and although I thought he came to my school to visit for one weekend, he started to come every single day from that point forward (he lived very close to us at the time and attended a local community college). He started to hang out and buy weed from one of my friends, E (who is a friend of me and B, and at this point the three of us signed our house lease and agreed to live together this year). He did this pretty much every single day until the school year ended. Once the summer began, S was arrested due to possession of various hard drugs during Memorial Day weekend. As a result, his parents were fed up with his shit, and forced him to attend rehab, which then had him move across the country as part of a sober living program. I thought that from this point on he was by himself, until during mid August, he texted all my housemates, including me, asking to move in with us since he no longer wants to deal with his parents. Everyone in our house including me unanimously said yes, as we all thought he was a decent person initially, and we all could use a little less monthly rent on our lease. However, once S moved in I immediately regretted my decision to let him live with us. He has been harassing me one the regular and has been extremely reckless in his behavior. As a result, I am extremely tired of his shit, and want nothing more than him to leave. However, I am the only person who feels this way, as everyone else in my house is either indifferent to S, or is very close friends with him. This also includes my friend E, whom I consider my closest friend in the house. E also loves hanging out with S, which means that whenever there is a conflict E is usually on S's side. This puts me in a difficult situation, because everybody in my house knows that I am the only one who hates S, which means that if anything ever leads to his eviction, the whole house will assume that I had something to do with it. However, at this point I just want S to leave my house and to get out of my life for good, and I can no longer wait for the school year to end. Leaving the house is also not an option, because I made a commitment that I would live in my house for a full year. However, I do think that there are possibilities to getting S to leave, since he is the only one in our house who is not signed on the lease, meaning he is not legally allowed to live with us. Additionally, since S and I have a past relationship, I am able to get in contact with his parents, as well as any other mutual people that we both know. I have contacted many of my friends back home, as well as my parents and they all said I should try and get the support of my housemates, but that's been very difficult since they all don't really see why I hate S so much. I just need to know what I can do to either get S to leave, or at the very least get him to stop making my life miserable. Please help me.

91,"I have a good long time friend who is currently going to be divorced. I won’t go into much detail about his life but he is not in good financial shape and certainly will be worse after the divorce (child support etc) 

I have been doing all that I can to help him, gave him some money no strings (told him I can loan him more with no interest), help him with college, and try to make my self available to talk about things pretty much whenever.

Recently, he asked me if I could move in with him to help pay the bills. My life is just now barely getting back on track. I have had lots of issues with bipolar depression, attempts suicide, and drugs. And I still live with parents, don’t have steady income as I lost several jobs due to my erratic behaviors. 

When he asked me I knee jerk responded that I think I could. As the days have gone by I realize now that doing this could probably severely impact my future. I am a full time student with supportive parents and I would need to get a steady job at least 30 hours a week to pay the rent and all my money would go toward it.

This is greatly stressing me. I want to be a good friend but already I am thinking of relapsing or hurting myself at the thought of leaving him hanging like this but I know inside it’s a bad idea to get myself caught up in this mess so early in recovery. 

Any opinions on what I should do would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

95,"Forgive me for the format (on mobile and i’m tired; thousand pardons, etc. etc.) 

Also it should be noted that up until about a year ago it had never crossed my mind to work out, and until about 4 months ago never daily.

So recently I’ve started finally seeing results after starting to workout seriously for a few months. But I’ve started to notice changes in my behavior and in how I assess people when I first meet them. Used too when I meet someone I didn’t know already their physical appearance was taken into account but I always waited for them to talk for a bit before I made a judgement. But in the last few days I’ve started to steer away from new people who  are overweight (if you can’t tell I’m not in exactly peek physical condition myself). And the most worrying of all was i was hanging out with my best friend yesterday and I noticed my attitude toward him had shifted slightly to where I viewed him in a slightly contemptuous fashion.

this horrified me when I realized it because I hate people who only view, and judge people based on their outward appearance and never for who that person is on the inside (that sounded less sappy and cliche in my head).

What can I do to combat this change in my behavior and still improve my self image?",07Nov2017,2

99,"Please refer me to another subreddit if I’m not in the right/best place. I’m 19 and majoring in biochemistry. I’m in my third semester of college with five more to go. I plan on going into perfusion after I earn my bachelor’s, which would require two more years of school. I’m doing moderately well in school (3.5 GPA) and don’t hate my classes (except labs, but as a perfusionist I’ll be in the OR, not a lab). My future is very secure right now as long as I continue to do well in school and pursue good internships.

The problem is: I can’t shake the thought of being a literary editor. I’ve always excelled at English/writing, and as my hate for labs progresses, so does my desire to switch to an English/communications double major. I can see myself being much happier with more freedom in a job I would be good at and enjoy. That being said, I would definitely be happy making six figures as a perfusionist (more than half of what I’d be making as an editor). Plus, the double major would, I feel, give me much less security after I graduate. It would also set me behind at least a semester. Ultimately, though, I believe I would have a much more wholesome life as I take advantage of the many doors the double major would open for me.

I have many pros and cons to consider. What should I do: risk potential failure at a job I would love or pursue a more secure career that I could bear?",07Nov2017,4
101,"Quick backstory I recently got a job at a grocery store, in the deli, about a month ago. So does (did, rather) my co-worker. Let's call my CW Bob. Bob has an ankle monitor, which constantly goes off at work and is loud as .50 cal. He also just had a kid, who is now a week or so old, and is married living in a hotel due to a lack of finances. Anyway, today at work, he politely asked if he could borrow a few bucks from me for gas, so he could continue commuting to work. I said yes, handing him 15 dollars to last him until payday. He very quickly says that he will be going on break and will fill up his car then, and I said sure have fun. It's a 30 minute break after all. Well, two hours later, he returns. I ask him what took so long, noticing a slight stumble as he walks towards me. He says ""shut up dude"" and then puts on gloves to continue working. Rude. I just gave him money, he took a two hour break and then swears me out. I keep letting him work for another twenty or so minutes, when he shouts at a customer and slurs everything he is saying, telling the customer to ""politely fuck off"". That's where I had enough. I went and told my manager about what was going on, and she promptly noticed he was very drunk. She took him and he was fired an hour or so later. Someone however noticed me going up the stairs to talk to the manager, and now everyone knows who reported the drunkard and got him fired. Everyone knows me by name, even people I haven't seen around the store. They hate me, I have received threats for being a ""snitch"". I'm not sure what to do. I know I did the right thing, keeping a drunk man away from spinning blades used to cut meat. But I feel horrible for getting a broke man fired, who just recently had a child, and is living in a hotel. What do I do? This feels like high school all over again.

102,"I have a friend who is mid/late 20s like myself, and I just catch him making things up quite often. They are small white lies, I just wonder why the hell he'd make things up in the first place.


For example: 

* Just now we were betting on the Melbourne Cup which is Race #7. He said his colleague who (he claims) won $300, put his winnings on race #8 and won! ... Except race 8 didn't start for another 15 minutes.


* If I brought up a subject and talked about it, he would act like he has basic knowledge about it and effectively rephrase what I was saying to sound like he was already informed...


* In a complex shopping mall car park that I know very well he points to one area and goes ""Don't go in that way, it's just got a ramp that takes you to straight to the exit"" which it doesn't.. He's probably never even parked there because it's a super obscure spot (that I've used a couple of times).




I don't understand, these lies are so insignificant, but they are quite frequent, often multiple times a day.
Why does he bother? It would be super awkward to confront him about it. I tried today with the horse race example, I said ""What? Race 8 hasn't started. I put a bet on, it's in 15 minutes"" and he just carries on conversation like I never caught him out on it.

109,"Hello.

I've come here to request suggestions for remedying my current situation.
When I was young (about 16), I was in a terrible situation at home and had been for a while. I wanted nothing more than to get out of the area where I grew up, and luckily I had the SAT and GPA to do so. However, the school to which I went was too stringent on money and offered me no scholarships. Being Out-of-State, yet so desperate, I attended the university for less than three years, when I graduated due to already having college credit. While somewhat quick, I gained over $120k in UG federal loan debt, 85% of that being legally owned by my parents.

Having graduated with a liberal arts degree in anticipation of graduate school, and not as a pathway to a lifelong career, there are currently few options for me right now. Rent and loans themselves consume 90% of my income, and my family is unable to assist me financially. As you can tell from my previous posts, I have been drowning in anxiety which has yet to completely subside.

My real issue here is that I can only yearn to revert my decision when I was in high school and choose a cheaper university. Of course, this is impossible, but this thought has been on my mind since I started at the university. How do I shake this? I've been regretting breaking up with a girl a couple of years ago who happened to be wealthy--though and because I did not feel affection for her--so that I would at least not have these financial troubles. My morals prohibited such an excursion at the time, and while she did fancy me greatly, I could have never seen myself being happy with her as a person. I do not want to eliminate my morals, honor, and integrity to ease the anxiety or worry. How can I stop myself from becoming overwhelmed and making another bad decision?",07Nov2017,3

113,"I’m an engineering student at a pretty good university. I’ve always been a Computer Science type guy, ever since I started playing video games at the age of 3. My life has always seemed to trend in this direction, and my schooling has followed suit: I took math and physics and chemistry in high school, I was on the robotics team and I had a rule until my sophomore year of Highschool that I had to play 2 hours of video games a night, every night. 

This and my dedication to band got me into the best school academically in my state.  Whoopie!

That all started when I was so young, but it’s not the only thing that peaks my interest.

Starting in about 7th grade with the onset of puberty, I started secretly really liking artful things. First it was writing, then I stole my dads camera and started taking photos of things I thought looked nice. Later on, bleeding into my freshman year of Highschool, i fell in love with making videos and movies of things. Now I’m a pretty socially anxious guy, so only a couple of things I made ever left my computer screen, but instantly I had something that ran right alongside my engineering as something I learned to love and enjoy.

Even further on towards the end of my Highschool career and I’d mostly left the art behind, the emotion and itch to create never left, but I got busy with my schooling and I had a depressive spell. Then I tried theatre my senior year. ho.ly.shit. All of a sudden I remembered all these things I had felt before, and being in a show did nothing but worsen that drive to create I already felt.

Over the next summer I rediscovered my love for movie making, and explored my newfound interest in acting, all the while preparing for engineering schooling the fall. I also did something that will have changed my life no matter what I end up doing, I went to New York City and fell in love with it before even reaching Manhattan. 

Sorry, but Before I get to my problem, I need to explain why i feel compelled the way i do. I have something similar to what people call the “acting bug,” and I definitely got that when I started auditioning to shows, but my drive to create and want to affect people didn’t start then, it just got worse. I get this itch in the back of my head the screams for me to do these things, none of which I’m particularly good at in any way. Last week it came back hard, I couldn’t concentrate, I started shaking a bit. I was a nervous wreck. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I need these things in my life to some extent and my focus here is trying to find the right path. Also as a final note, I describe it like it’s a vice that I have to do these things just to be normal, and it kind of is in a way, but moreover it’s that I feel so greatly compelled because the sense of accomplishment and explosion of emotional release is incomparable for me

NOW:

Assuming you’re actually as driven to help as I am to tell my life story on an online forum and you’ve miraculously made it this far: Congrats! That wordy preface is over! So here we go.

THE DREAM:
Study film at my university, move to New York, and start making movies and hopefully make it somewhere out there.

THE LOGICAL PATH:
Finish my engineering degree and go to New York to start my long and hard career making ass loads of Money in computer science

THE REALITY UNTIL THIS MORNING:
Struggle to double major in film and computer science, move to New York and work my way up the tech ladder, making a lot of money and pursuing films as a side hobby.

Today I found out I can’t double major...
(Also notice how every choice includes New York? :D)

Now I have to make this decision: do I follow my dreams and hope for the best or do I commit my life to doing what I’ve always done. My first one I would love every minute of work but probably struggle for money, and the second one I would be alright with work, it’s not bad, and have time off of work to enjoy myself, making loads of money on the way.

I’ve got like, one or two semesters after this to figure out what I want to do and that’s fine, I’m not in dire straits yet, but some point soon I need to decide so that I can make connections and work towards my career.

As it stands the only reason I even started considering this is because I haven’t liked my engineering courses so far, it’s not dazzling me like I had hoped it would, and I worry that this may be my only good time in life to admit I need to be in love with my job and accept that I might not be the richest man in the world

Either way, I’m going to New York and getting out of this midwestern suburb.

And advice welcome! Please!

Next semester I am going to try to take classes from both and see how I like both of them, other than that I’m pretty lost.

114,"I've been dating my boyfriend for the past 4 years and change. I care very deeply for him but I don't know if I love him anymore. This is a long story I need to get off my chest, but the long and short of it is that I don't know how to break up with him. 

In January I left for a semester abroad in Spain. We're normally long distance so I didn't think it would be too different to deal with the distance. I was, of course, terribly wrong. Because of the time difference, he was only around starting at 4 or 5 pm and I would go to bet at 10:30. I barely had any time to spend with him, especially since he was in class. 

This was added to my initial group of friends ditching me and flaking on plans we would make. I made one really good friend, but he's only one person. I couldn't expect a stranger to keep me company every time I was lonely. I asked my bf to go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier so that I wouldn't sink into the isolation and depression. He would do it for a day or so after I asked, but ultimately he wouldn't keep it up for very long. I was going 6 or so hours on a daily basis with barely any human contact, much less conversations and companionship. 

This exacerbated my existing depression and I relapsed into self harm. I didn't feel like I could tell my bf because I (rightly) assumed he would unduly blame himself for my actions. Also a few months prior when I was going through a rough patch he told me he ""couldn't really support me like I needed"" and that I'd need to give him a little more room to breathe. At this point he wasn't really a trigger. I was desperate for someone to be around for me so I reached out and confided in my one friend (who I'm just going to call Greg for kicks and giggles). Greg made every effort imaginable to be a good friend and to be around for me as my depression got worse and worse. He'd just sit and do homework with me and just being around another person who cared was enough to help. 

The issue was that I started going to Greg first with my emotional distress. When I came back from Spain, my boyfriend confronted me about this because he felt cut off from me. I told him the details and he accused me of emotionally cheating. I'm asexual so to him that was the worst betrayal imaginable. I suppose it is, but it's hard to castigate myself for something I did for survival. I pulled back from Greg a bit and tried to repair what I had broken with my boyfriend. I visited Greg when my family was near where he lived after my boyfriend told me it was okay (which I later found out was a lie). I'm gullible and naive, so I took him at his word. 

I tried very hard, but it was so hard to get past him saying that he couldn't support me and the fact that he made commitments to be there for me that he couldn't complete. At the start of the new semester I asked for a short break to sort out myself. Towards the end, someone at a party tried to sexually assault him when he was emotionally vulnerable and drunk. He called me the next day and we spent hours on the phone. Ultimately I decided that I loved him enough that I wanted to stay with him while I figured myself out. We agreed that mg mental health came first. He would visit me instead of the other way around so that it would be easier for me to go to therapy. It was going so well and I felt like I was finally getting back to a place with him and my health where I was going to be okay. 

Then he went through my (main account's) post history. He found a comment where I had responded to an askreddit thread about what you would be willing to admit on reddit but not in real life. I said that I was falling for Greg. It was just a crush, but I was concerned that I would hide in those feelings to escape the dissatisfaction of my relationship. It was just a way for me to get my fears  off of my chest. Once I was secure with my boyfriend I was going to tell him about the crush. I just wasn't equipped to handle the stress of that and trying to get better. I did it wrong. I know it was wrong. My bf was furious. He almost broke up with me. He said he would stay with me as long as I was trustworthy. To him, this included me not self harming. 

He effectively made him not a safe emotional support. I can't guarantee that I won't hurt myself and putting that kind of stress on me was too much. It was a fair thing for him to ask, but I'm just not capable of confiding in him if I'm afraid a mistake will mean he would leave me. This on top of all of the other things he's done to unintentionally push me from getting support just... crushed me. I put all of my energy into trying to fix it, to make him trust me again, but I left hardly any energy to take care of myself. My chronic migraines got worse. I couldn't go to school because of the stress and pain and depression. I know that's my fault because I'm weak. It still happened, though. 

Now... now I don't think I can be with him. I just carry so much hurt inside me that we can't fix it no matter how much we talk. 

I just need to know how to end it. Do I wait until after my birthday? After Christmas? Do I tell him I'm drowning and ask for help even if I know there's hardly any chance of fixing it? I don't want to hurt him. In my mind, if one of us can definitely be happy, I want to preserve that. I know I'm flawed and mostly in the wrong, but I just need help getting out. ",07Nov2017,2
115,"Kind of in a rut here and just need some second opinions from an outside perspective.

First of all, I live in a 3rd world country where the pay sometimes doesnt even measure to the workload you have to do. That much, Ive accepted. 

I worked in sales for close to 8 years since graduating from college and when youve been in that type of work for that amount of time, you get good at it. Problem was, it wasnt really what I wanted to do. For the longest time, I loved the whole art aspect of life, from graffiti, design, fonts and advertising. This helped with my sales angles of course, but not to a point where I felt really compelled to live out my career in sales.

Im now a fresh 30year old that finally has a nest egg for whatever comes in the future so here I decided, ""hey, why not try doing something different.""

So I quit my job, enrolled in a pastry course which is something I found really exciting to do. A year later, I graduated, got my certificates and looking to ply my new trade.

Problem is, jobs for chefs arent really that abundant here. I need XP to go out of country so I figured id get 2-3 years here under my belt and learn about other techniques and recipes elsewhere.

I have been to most of the hotels here, gave them my CV, but most of the time theyre not really hiring since they got a full staff. I have been jobless for 3 months since I graduated.

Ive pretty much exhausted all my known options and I really am tempted to go back to sales since living like this is really starting to shake my confidence. So, I just wanted to get an opinion whether I should go back to my old job and make good money or tough it out with my pastry work and wait til something comes along. 

I hate being useless and but at the same time, I dont want to go for just any run of the mill bakery here that sells 10cent breads, since THAT for sure is a dead end.

Im still okay, Im just posting here since Ive pretty much sent every employer my CV through this online job website I found. Right now, I got nada ideas. ",07Nov2017,2
116,"I just got my driver's license 10 days ago and when I was at the DMV I was asked what political party I was. I answered with Republican, and after getting the license my intensely liberal mother proceeded to ask me countless questions about it, such as if I knew what that meant, or how I knew, and things of the like. For the record, I do NOT support Trump, nor am I pro-life or against gay marriage; there are just other beliefs the Republican Party holds that I also hold. And I know my mom is somebody that thinks EVERY republican as a gun-wielding racist southerner and that's clearly not the case. 

A couple nights ago, one of my friends, who is as Christian and as Conservative as it gets, was over at my house. He and I were in the basement and somehow he steered the direction of the conversation to politics (he was unaware of my political beliefs). He went on a tirade about Sharia Law, how it is ""politically incorrect"" to be Christian, and 2nd amendment rights. The rant spanned nearly 20 minutes and while I didn't particularly enjoy having the conversation dominated like that, I saw good points in the things he said. Due to the general loudness of it, my mom apparently vented her disagreement to one of her friends.

They're in the basement and I can hear him preaching from the first floor. Jesus H Christ. Now he's on 2nd amendment and free speech. Basically Fox News in a nutshell. No no no no""

I completely understand that people are entitled to having different opinions but to have my own mother regard something I believe with such disrespect is hard to take. I don't want to ignore it as the bell can't be unrang. How should I go about this, respectfully? Any answers would mean a lot! Thank you!",07Nov2017,3
117,"Long, jumbled life story ahead. I'm sorry if it's hard to understand, I've never been good at conveying my feelings through writing, I just need some guidance. If I need to clarify anything, let me know and I'll try my best to explain it. Also, I apologize for the weird format, I've typed all this up on mobile.

When my grandpa died several years ago, I got really depressed, nothing super serious, just really unmotivated by most things I spent my early childhood doing with him. But still, I was functional, had friends I'd talk to a lot, still participated in school, etc., but around middle school, I just stopped caring about grades because I was getting bullied for my weight and lost a few friends from it.

In high school, the grades dropped severely and I almost failed, but I also got my first serious girlfriend. She was great, for a while (or maybe it was high school hormones) but she always seemed to support me and care about me. Then it started going downhill. She started lying to me, really obvious lies that any sane person could see through, making fake social media accounts to ""test my loyalty,"" and flirting with one of my classmates that I really didn't like. I stayed with her because I really didn't care about anyone else the way she made me care about her, and also didn't feel I deserved anyone else. She ended up pushing away most of my friends, to the point where I only had 3 or 4 people that would actively talk to me and hang out. Eventually, it got to the point where my mother wouldn't let me see her anymore because of how badly she'd treat me, and the relationship ended, thankfully. She was the first and last relationship I've had so far. 

After HS, I started going to junior college to take basic courses since I didn't have an idea of what I wanted to do career-wise (still don't). I ended up having to drop out to help care for my grandmother who had lung cancer, but I would've flunked anyway because I can't make myself wake up to an alarm and ended up missing several classes and got dropped from 2 courses.

So for the next 2 years I lived at home caring for my dying grandmother and not leaving because I was the only one who could move her (she was bedridden and had suffered a stroke after my grandfather's passing). She passed away, an aunt I had was with us at the time and had a heart attack in the room when my grandmother died, she died a week later, followed by my grandmother's sister a month later.

After everything happened I ended up working at my current dead end job, doing nothing with my life, with few friends that I've never actually met because it's just casual online friendship, fat, and alone. I really think I need therapy, but we can't afford it right now, and I feel like time is slipping away faster and faster. I know I'm still young and have a whole life ahead of me, but I just can't find motivation to do anything about it.

I should add that I've never once considered suicide, and won't, I just feel more and more apathetic every day.",07Nov2017,2

128,"I've been drinking for a fairly long time and I generally have a good handle about it. Sometimes I'll say some dumb shit, alcohol makes me very honest but usually if nobody is persuading me I can keep things to myself. But that's when I'm tipsy or buzzed. I wanna be able to get blackout drunk and not confess anything crazy. 

To be honest, there's just one thing I'm worried about confessing. I really like this guy, he's the ex of a friend. I'm not going to go for him, girl code, but I think ab him a lot. It'll eventually pass, but he did text and flirt with me for a little while and I was polite and told him no (he wanted to get to know me/have sex). Also, when he was dating her, I thought he and I were like friends, so I went over to his place. Nothing happened, bc I left when he made it clear what he wanted and they broke up a week later, not bc of me, just bc they hadn't been on good terms for a while. I'm just worried that I'll confess this to her or one of her best friends when I get drunk. If I'm tipsy or buzzed I don't think I would, but I want to be able to get blackout drunk w/o that worry. Can a person control themselves that much? And she is going to be a big part of my life pretty soon so I can't just avoid drinking in front of her.

130,"I’ve just a good amount of time deleting old posts from my facebook because I’m getting annoyed by the “You have memories with X and Y...” notifications. 
It made me realise that going back 6/7 years ago I was a completely different person.

I know people change and I can’t be expected to stay the same as I was in 2011 but I had a booming social life, friends I saw and spoke to daily, people I cared about and loved and who loved me. I was “popular” during high school, I’m not sure how relevant that is but then during the first year of college my family moved away. 

I lost so many relationships, so many friends. We moved a total of 21 times during my teenage years and it all appears to be for no reason at all. 

I got diagnosed with depression and developed a scary amount of sociopathic traits. I’ve been to anger management, I lash out and hurt everyone around me and I think (although I’m definitely no professional) that I’m still torn up over events and losses that occurred in 2011. That’s kind of the turning point in my life, I can see almost a timeline of where things have gone bad and downhill since 2011.

Every girl that’s shown interest in me I’ve been unable to reciprocate or commit to or even get involved enough to care about her. I know this sounds a lot like humblebragging but I don’t know how else to word it other than straight forward. 6 girls have told me they’re in love with me, hinted they wanna get married, settle down. I pushed every one of them so far away from me that they ended up hating me. 

I don’t know why. 

It feels like my feelings have literally been severed and I’m just a shell of a person, as though I don’t exist beyond my physical body and there’s no soul or being occupying my form. 

I want to go back to 2011 and not move away. To stay with the girl I loved when I was 16/17 and have meaningful relationships with my friends. I want to know, how do I go back to being “normal” is there any way I can be happy... do I have any hope of truly connecting with another person ever again?  ",07Nov2017,2

132,"I am dating a black woman and I am a white guy. This has gone down not too well with her friends, (as black men can sometimes have quite possessive attitudes towards black women, especially those who date inter racially).

Anyway one of her friends in particular is quite unpleasant and they followed me into the bathroom and started threatening me to try and get me to stop seeing her. We got into a fight that ended up in a bathroom stall. Somehow I managed to get the better of him and I am ashamed to say I flushed his head down the toilet. He kept struggling but I held his head down and kept flushing the toilet (it was an automatic flush) until he was nearly unconscious.  I then took a photograph of him with the hope that I could use this embarrassing photograph to stop him bothering me. If he ruins my relationship with my girlfriend, I will spread these photographs across the internet.

I am very concerned this is not like me at all. In the circumstances I think I acted for the best as he is very malicious and if I had let him get his head out of the toilet bowl he might have pulled a knife and attempted some other grievous bodily harm.

 So far he has avoided me for the moment but I think he is going to probably try and do something again soon. He is a bigger guy than me and it was only by luck that I was able to get the better off him. I do live in an area of the United States where you can conceal carry and I do have a gun but I don't want to do something as drastic as that.

In the past I filed my taxes with TurboTax, but that was simple because I kept up to date with it and could request W-2s from my current employers very easily.

I started trying to file my taxes in 2016 but hit a roadblock because I couldn't get in contact with anyone from one of the jobs I had had in the last few years, and another place I worked at had since shut down.

I moved to the opposite corner of the country in 2015 so I can't walk into the place I used to work at, and I don't know how to proceed with the place that shut down. I can't even remember what year it was the last time I filed my taxes and don't know how to find that out. I tried to find out on the IRS website, but I need the last address I got my tax return mailed to. I can't remember where I was living when I got my last one, and not a single one of my previous addresses are letting me get the information I need.

Where do I start? Can I do them now or do I have to wait until April to submit my old returns? At this point I'm willing to spend one or two hundred dollars on a specialist who can help me through it. Would they be able to help me get my W-2s somehow? If I still needed to get my old W-2s myself I should just file them myself with TurboTax, right?

So he gets said job and we start asking him for money for food and bills which he had been eating our food and such and we ask him for $200 which we find fair since he doesn't have an actual room. He thinks this amount is too much, our actual rent is $700 and doesn't include utilities. We had to practically beg him for the money, and when he finally gave it to us he threw the money at us. He stays here for a bit longer buys himself a nice phone and then thinks he can do it all on his own so he moves out and gets his own apartment which was very expensive for just a one bedroom and works his ass off barely able to afford anything and gets a bit of a wake up call. My boyfriend has a well paying job and so he tried to get my brother a job and he ends up walking out on his shift. Months later my brother knows his lease is going to be up soon so he asks us about possibly moving in except he refuses to come to our place to talk about it and we don't think we should have to go to his place to discuss it so it gets put off and at the last minute we make some what of an arrangement for him to stay here he had to pay $300 up front and he told us it shouldn't be an issue because he's used to working and he even got to use our dining room as a room this time. He starts indulging on food so we ask him to pick up some things and he comes home and tells us he's still paying off his apartment. 2 weeks after moving in he puts his 2 weeks in at his job but his manager stopped scheduling him.

146,"I'm in a bit of a difficult age right now (23), identifying who I really am and who I want to be in the future. In my childhood I primarily struggled with low self-confidence, resulting in myself adapting to every situation and the behaviour of other people.

I learned a lot about myself in the last 1-2 years and am at the point where I consider my friend's feelings and how they react to my actions.

The problem I'm facing right now is that I'm not sure if the way I behave, my real own behaviour, is okay with my friends. I know that real friends should usually address the things that bug them about the other person. If this process of addressing problems is honest and kind, I think that a lot of miscommunication would vanish and people would be able to open up and be themselves more.

But I still feel like there are often minor problems which simply stay hidden, which subsequently hinders everyone in their self-development.

There are a few possible solutions for this, but I'm unsure which one is the best one.

I could straight up go to my friends and ask them how they honestly feel about me. I know this could end up being crushing, but that's how life is sometimes I guess. The one thing with this solution is that I'm unsure how to deal with the information I acquire through this. Should I then try to adjust myself and at the same time discard certain parts of my character? Or should I accept their opinions and see for myself how much I can change myself without trying to fit in, not being myself?

I could still try to interpret how others feel about my behaviour and then adapt to that. Even though as I'm writing this I see how ridiculous this idea is since my thoughts are irrational most of the time.

The last thing I could try is to stay the way I am and go on without considering other people's feelings. Which I think is not the right way to live a life in a community with friends.

After writing all this, I actually came to a conclusion myself lol. It's obviously best to talk to my friends directly and then view their opinions with a little grain of salt. If it's not possible for myself to change myself without bending and twisting my own character, then I gues it's just not possible. And if they are not okay with my decision, then I guess we simply are not made to be real friends.

157,"I'm a 21 year old male. Full disclosure, I have come from an extremely privileged background. My parents are from the professional class of doctors, engineers, lawyers, nurses etc, but certainly not the multi-millionaire group of CEOs, entrepreneurs, or investment bankers. That's not particularly important, but it does explain the tension. Growing up, me and my siblings have gone to standard public schools, been able to experience vacations, played organized sports, had our parents pay for undergrad tuition (in state public tuition), etc. Our life has certainly been *incredibly* comfortable and statistically *abnormal*, but also not to the point of extreme extravagance where I lose grounding (in my opinion). My parents would never buy clothing at 'mall store' prices, or send their kids to private schools, etc, and are certainly far more egalitarian than lots of the other semi well off people we know.

I have recently gotten more exposed to the 'other half' in a study abroad experience, and it has definitely opened my eyes a little bit about how lucky I am. However, it has also made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. At my home university, there are people from all backgrounds, and specifically in my faculty, I think most people come from places of some privilege. Kids my age have gone on vacations to all kinds of crazy places, regularly go to NBA games, you get the gist. Same with my city as a whole. Most working adults with a degree or qualification make greater than 40k per year, and generally that equates to people being able to afford a ""middle class"" lifestyle. 

Coming here (Europe) has been a bit different. Most people here are relatively similar to my circle at home, in that they have some financial comfort, but I have also interacted with people that have far, far less. I definitely know people in my home city who are also struggling, but never really have lived with them as closely and seen things at such a granular level. 

For example, my living situation is when I first really noticed it. Four of my roommates and I are all fairly similar in that we seem to not think about money. We regularly buy groceries (some of which are basically mini luxuries, like Oreos), can afford to go to bars and coffee shops every now and then, and fairly minor expenses are a matter of 'is it worth the money,' instead of 'do I have the money.' But my one roommate, ironically the only other one who's from the US, is way different. It seems like they have to constantly monitor every expense and cut costs whenever possible. Like, I would on a whim decide to take the bus for $2 instead of walking an hour, or buy a drink at the convenience store when I'm thirsty. I've never really seen them do that. Also, some of it becomes social. My upbringing has made me think that it's just common custom to bring a cheap bottle of wine or bag of chips to a party if you're invited, but they never seem to do it. Same with sharing food. And 'minor luxuries' like joining a student society for $10 or going to a movie seem to be thought about far more critically. It's just really tough because I feel like while I have so much in common with the large 'middle class,' the entire way of life I have is different than the less privileged roommate. It's confusing because part of me feels so guilty about how I have been able to live, but I also realize the wedge between the entire way we have been taught to live. It would become a big hurdle to overcome if I ever dated or became very close friends with a person like this. Additionally, I've also generated new appreciation for people like this, and see that in many ways, they have better life skills and survival abilities than I possess.

I've recently encountered this dilemma a little bit at home recently. I am reaching the point where in a few years, I can realistically get a job with a decent income and afford to go to the 'trendy' restaurants, keep up with my sporting hobbies, or even go on a trip or two every year on my own dime! It does get a little bit frustrating when a few of my friends never have the money to do anything, especially when it's just a product of them being lazy and incapable of getting/holding down a decent job. Like, with one of my best friends, doing anything more than going to McDonalds is pretty much out of the question. Forget going to a concert, almost any type of athletic activity, or anything costing more than $15. 

So, I'm sure many other people have reached this point in modern times. How do you deal with it? ",07Nov2017,2

At the time I couldn't afford it on my own, and talked to my husband, brother, and sister-in-law about going in on it together. We did not get it because it was too expensive. 

This year I have been talking to my husband about getting one (I've been looking all year, but he kept saying we could find a better price). It was just the perfect gift! I decided this year I was getting them one. 

My brother and sister-in-law came up to visit last weekend, and while out with my brother, I started talking to him about these propane lanterns again. He replies with ""oh yeah! Rita just bought one of those for our parents for Christmas this year. I was completely crushed and caught off guard.

Basically I was watching porn like a normal college male student on xvideo when i stumbled upon a video with girls with  very questionable ages.  I was super freaked out that it could be CP that I closed it immediatly. Calming down I opened back up the page to try to report and make sure my judgement was right, but alas it was a ""verified"" user so i could not without sending a proper email. I know this was a really stupid move and maybe even unbelievable, but I went on the video like 3-4 times because I was in denial and desperate to find something to prove that my age judgement is just bad. I mean it was a well known site, they are definetly 18+, right? Am i fucked? This was all done on my college's wifi so I assume it knows where I've been and I would prefer if i didnt get arrested on the charges of Cp since I been on the video a couple times. I know they dont go for someone who viewed it accidentally, but this was on my college wifi and i completely panicked and viewed it 3-4 times just to alleviate that this wasnt actually cp. I am now facing the reality that I could have watched the same video with possible 3 times to prove my innocence, but it just makes me look like an actual offender.I am also considering making an appt with someone to clarify what happened.

172,"I was woken up by a call from my mother this morning. She called me out of desperation to tell me that my younger sister (19 now) was raped when she was 17 by an older guy she dated for only a week or so. 

She told me that her and I are the only people that know. She told me she was sorry for telling me but she didn’t know what else to do. My sister, since telling my mom, has gotten emotionally unstable. She keeps saying that no one can help her, that my mom isn’t doing the right thing to help her. She keeps going through outbursts of being very angry and sad.

My mom told me that she’s suggested going to the police but that my sister doesn’t want to. She’s tried taking her to see a therapist but the first one my sister didn’t like, the second therapist they were referred to was dead, and they’re trying again for a third therapist. 

The reason my mom called me was because tomorrow my sister and I are going to see a concert together. She’s hoping that on the drive there or back, which will be a few hours round trip, I can get her to open up about this. The problem is that even if I do manage to get her to open up, what do I say? How do I help her? This has never happened to me before, and I’ve never known another person who’s gone through this so I wouldn’t know what the best advice would be. 

Even if I don’t get her to open up about it tomorrow, what advice can I give my mother? Is it too late to go to the police?

Please note that I had already had some shots of whiskey before I had even picked Jasmine up and in addition to the other alcohol we had. Over, the night I had a total of 2 Margaritas, 3 shots of whiskey, and 2 and half beers. I wasn't totally smashed but I definitely wasn't thinking clearly, to say the least.

We're out all-night doing stupid stuff and eventually we all part ways. Jasmine doesn't have a way to get home so I take her home and went into her house to use her restroom.

It's about 5-6 am in the morning so in addition to being drunk, I was tired as all get out. Our conversation eventually turned sexual and we got onto the topic of pillow princesses and how Jasmine had been on both ends of it. I said I never had been one or done one and wanted to try it. I drunkenly asked her if we could do it and she shrugged and after a few things, I ended up eating her out. After I finished, she fell asleep and I left.

I googled it and apparently 1981 bills didn’t have that light strip inside of them to check, and I asked the teller if he had the special pen and he said “we don’t use those to check anymore”. Huh? Anyways I googled 1981 hundred bills and apparently they’re very very old and not in circulation commonly anymore. The teller told me he’d deposit it but if it was found to be fake it would be deducted from my account. He told me I could get in trouble possibly... I’m a broke college student who works a $10 an hour barista job. I really needed the money desperately. I started crying bc I don’t know if I should have taken that risk but I did. I can’t see how it could possibly be counterfeit?? It seemed to have the legitimate paper. And looked exactly like the 1981 hundred dollar bills I googled. 

What will happen to me? What are the chances the 1981 $100 is a counterfeit? It looked VERY worn out. 
 
My boyfriend just researched and found  out that before 1990 the bills didn’t have a lot of security measures to determine legitimacy and that you have to go by look and feel. We also just found out 1981 bills are VERY rare.

I'm currently an intern at my school's computer science department and I have previously worked with the careers department on a social media project and they all loved it. My advisor thought I would be a great fit to help out the philosophy department on their website. At first I was hesitant but I said yes, I want to see what they want to do.

Just to backtrack a little, I am going to school full-time (I have two hard classes that I need to focus on), I have a part-time night job right after school, I get up early in the mornings to help assist freshmen with coding, I'm working on a white paper for my capstone to graduate, and also a big programming semester project. Needless to say, I'm really busy. I hate disappointing people so I agreed on this project even though I'm constantly burnt out.

The people were all nice to me. For the website, they are using an artist's lyrics to find philosophical meaning and writing scholarly articles on it. I was under the impression that it was for the artist himself so I wanted to jump on it so I can possible get a autograph (stupid, I know) but it's not even tied to him. They are going to pay me month to month based on my hours but it's $7 an hour and I don't really need that money. I'm just working my part-time job to pay off my tuition. 

Anyways, so it's been close to a month. I have only been doing research on different website platforms to see which is best for them and then going on from there. I presented a website but a person who wasn't really part of this project keep disagreeing no matter what I said about it. So they want to do the research again. I'm tired and I don't even have time for myself on the weekends because I have seminars to attend.

I know it's an asshole thing to do but how do I back out of it? Is it too late? What can I do?",07Nov2017,1

He didn’t, and instead he started offering details that lined up.

188,"Alright gotta start with saying my situation really sounds sketchy and just an excuse for my cheating. Please bear with me regardless.

Now we had an exam today(not gonna specify what exam it is just in case) and I had prepared for it the day before for hours, memorising a shit ton of words and preparing a little paragraph about the topic we're given. Our teacher had already told us the topics so it was fairly easy to study, other than writing examples and explanations on my notebook I also prepared some post-its about the most important points so I could look back to them whenever without bringing out a notebook. 

Before leaving for school I revised the post-its and put them in my pencil case.(we're only allowed to have a pencil and an eraser on the desk) When the exam began, I had totally forgotten about the post-its that were in my pencil case (I had 2-3 hours of sleep so that kinda explains itself). Our proctor didn't ask us to remove the pencil case which was out of norm. I originally was using the eraser behind my pencil, but I made a bunch of mistakes in the first question of the exam which I realised later on(like 15-20 minutes in). Since I had my pencil case I thought I could grab my bigger eraser from the pencil case and at that moment I saw the post it notes that I had left there in the morning. 

At that point I was pretty fucking panicked because whether if I told the proctor about the papers or not it was going to count as cheating. She didn't have an angle to see the papers from where she was standing so I chose to leave the pencil case open to not draw any more attention(would be weird if I closed a pencil case) and unfortunately she saw the papers as she roamed around the classroom when she went behind me. I tried to hide the papers obviously but the corner of it was visible anyway.

She took my pencil case and looked at the contents of the post-its, which was basically the summary of all the topics as I said previously, and told me that she would use them as evidence. However, I hadn't used the papers to cheat in anyway, (couldn't even if I wanted to lol we're talking about post-its in a small pencil case and they were on top of each other, there was no way I could take them out without it being really really obvious) but she claims that I had cheated without actually seeing me do so.

I haven't cheated and it would be pretty fucking stupid for me to do so since I'm on a scholarship. Even if I had an intention of cheating, it's just dumb to do it by writing it on huge post-its that will be visible from a mile away and in my pencil case(as I said which normally isn't allowed) I study a lot for this class and my class teachers knows this as well. I feel really stupid for letting something like this happen and I'm just really frustrated because I think it's unfair.

I've talked with both the proctor and my class teacher and will talk to our dean tomorrow. I think they're going to give me a 0 regardless, but is there anyway I can get myself out of this situation or possibly ask for another exam?",07Nov2017,1

It was my first serious relationship and her third. Dated for 14 months. I made so many mistakes and mistreated her in the end because it was my first relationship and a lot of things I experienced were new to me. Anyways, towards the end, I fell out of love with her and I am guessing she did to. We mistreated each other and were not helping each other out at all by being together. A lot of the mistreatment was on my side too. I basically stopped trying and putting in effort because I realized I had fallen out of love. At the same time, I still wanted to be with her, probably because I was more physically attracted to her than her personality.

Anyways, she dumped me 2 months ago because I was neglecting the relationship. Fair enough. I handled the break up pretty badly. I acted immature, insulting her and what not. I regret all this now and I realized I did this without rationalizing through my emotions. The thing is, I wanted out of the relationship for so long but when she dumped me I did not want it to end. I was a mess for some reason. I just wanted to be with her again even though I knew how bad our relationship had gotten.

The thing is, I miss her so much, but I know there is a chance we might never get back together. And even if we did get back together, I dont see it going to well.

I've never been evaluated for any learning or metal disabilities, and as far as i know i don't have any, but with the way i am i don't see any way i can get a job, 
honestly i don't know what type of advice i'm even looking for here, but any is appreciated. (i'm a guy btw i forgot to mention that)",07Nov2017,1

Is there some network that could find him a sponsor of some kind? He is pretty hopeless at this point, after years, and thinks the most practical option is suicide. 

Wondering if there's an option for him to get funding for therapy and a new chance at recovery. Maybe someone in California could help him for free, idk. It's a shot in the dark. At this point he is too weak to post this himself.",07Nov2017,1

I accept because I can use my girlfriends car after she gets off work.

I start my new gig and its tough but ok at first but eventually it gets really hard and they leave you alone and you get no breaks and you have to stay really late if the work load is more than can be done in a straight 8 hour shift

I just up and quit one night and no call no showed again. 
I hated the job but I knew I fucked up right away.
I had to say something to her dad so I told her my grandma died and I'm with my family a few states over for a while.

213,"Thanks in advance for reading - tl;dr at the bottom:

I've been living with my girlfriend for 3 and a half years, and recently we moved to a new city where she's starting her post-graduate degree. We both graduated together back in September, and I'm currently unemployed, having just finished off a summer internship. I had planned to take a short break before looking for work again around Jan/Feb next year, but just got an unexpected offer for my dream job, to start in 2 weeks. The problem is that job is based in our original city, 500 miles away, and I now need to make a call on whether to move back there for it without my girlfriend.

We would definitely want to stay together, but it would be quite a strain, both emotionally and financially. I'd hate to be away from her for too long, especially if she needs me around. My girlfriend suffers from mental illness, and can occasionally depend on me for taking care of her, sometimes for a couple of days at a time. The journey between cities is at least 5 hours, so I could realistically come back for weekends if I can cope with that journey time every week/two weeks. That said, tickets are expensive, not to mention that I would have to pay rent for 2 different places at once. My salary would cover it, but I would only just be breaking even.

How can I possibly make a decision here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Other info:
* My girlfriend's Ph.D lasts at least 4 years, and she has no intention to drop out
* We eventually plan to move back to our original city once she's graduated
* The job is in quite a niche field, and there are no similar companies in our current city
* The job is with the international leaders for this field, so would be the best start to my career regardless
* My background isn't quite the same area as the job - I got an interview by chance through a lucky connection, but otherwise would struggle a lot to get my foot in the door at other companies due to my lacking experience
* My girlfriend would greatly prefer me to be around to support her through her Ph.D, but also thinks I should accept the job, and doesn't want to me the deciding factor


**tl;dr**: I've been cohabiting with my girlfriend for the past 3+ years, but I've just been offered my dream job in a city 500 miles away, and my girlfriend is unable to move with me. How can I make a decision on whether to accept it?",07Nov2017,1

215,"Here's my predicament, my and my fiance have been together for a few years. At first i didn't even know what her mother looked like until one day i said i'd like to meet her (i asked and i received).  Of course at first she came off as a nice woman and all that extra BS but over time i realized more and more that she is a fucking mentally unstable fucking monster. She has one daughter 2nsons one of them in jail and even he says "" i don't lnow why she even had us she's acting crazy 24/7"". When i say she is mentally unstable i mean she can sit there and call her daughter ugly, put a wig on say that she looks good and her daughter needs to be more like her, she randomly has fits where she cusses at nobody and then randomly cries and blame all of her problems on the first person she sees. Mind you this is a women that just turned 60.

I've met my fiance's sister and brother face to face and they were fine normal people as if they came out of her house unscathed, even though they both ended up moving to another state i could see why. This woman would try and have sot downs with me tell me what i'm going to do or we are going to do what my life is going to be like. I'm a grown ass man with a short temper as it is so trying not to blow up every time she tries to open her mouth is like trying not to breathe in fire. It came down to justbthe other night she went on another rant about how good her life is shes a child of god shes an angel she has been an angel all her life (her own kids have told me every fucked up part of her life for this exact reason, she simply thinks i don't know about her fucked up past) and how if i or my fiance don't do something thats not god's way. Mentally unstable, POS bible thumper that begs to see her grandkids and then throws them on us so she can chill with a man she just met telling me if i don't do what she wants its against god.

She said ""and i need to meet your family that needs to happen today if not today tomorrow"" i responded telling her theres not a fucking chance she is every going to meet my family and that she'd be lucky if we ALLOWED her to sit in the very back row at our wedding. My family is a very family oriented loving group but also are no bullshit kind of people they go to church all that but aren't psychotic bible thumpers etc etc. If this lady met my family she would more than likely get stabbed, that's how infuriating hearing her talk is.

What would be yoir advise for dealing with such a sack of shit of a ""mother in law""? Me and my fiance do our own things and still get calls from her like she is having a break down every other day, at one point she called us yelling at the top of her lungs while she was at work ""YOU OK?! YOU OK?! YOU OK?!"" Like she was being murdered while she was high on LSD. What can we do about this because at this point im not above getting a restraining order out on her and telling her if she comes within 5 feet of my family (including my fiance) i'll shoot her ass and have zero remorse for it.",07Nov2017,2
217,"So I have this best friend for over 5 years, let's call her M, M has another friend, let's call her Bitch.

I have always hated Bitch, she's rude and keeps saying mean things to me but I always let it go for M's sake, I sometimes felt that this girl is out to get me but I always told myself that I'm the one who's too sensitive.

M is very secretive ( or so I thought), she never really told me the things that matter about her and honestly I always thought it was who she was.  M and bitch stopped being best friends and I noticed this for a time but didn't want to get involved, Last week M took me out and told me she had a big fight with Bitch they're not the same anymore and idiot me advised her to patch things up and it's not worth it ... blah blah blah.

So anyways M proceeds to tell me that bitch has been telling her lies about me for 4 YEARS, she has been saying I have done some shady crap and broke people up (which I did not, I barely talk to one person a week, I am not the type of person who get involved with ANYTHING) and according to M, M kept telling her no she wouldn't do that but never actually called her up on it or thought about telling me.

My problem now is this, M has been telling Bitch everything about her indicating that she didn't trust me enough and might have actually believed some of the bullshit bitch was saying, she never told me until bitch stopped talking to her and honestly that infuriates me, I have told M things even my parents don't know, I have gotten her every gift I could think of and while she got me nothing over the years and honestly I didn't mind since I don't believe in demanding things from others.

So what do you think should I call her out on this? or just play dumb and let things be?

A large 1br with a patio. It's in a newer building in a suburban spot, has lots of storage, a shower and separate tub. The kitchen is newish, looks a bit modern. $1300 and $500 one time for stove and fridge. It is a 20 min walk and maybe 10 minute busride +walk to work. It is close to the metro. It also has an air conditioner and a dishwasher and washer/dryer. The landlord seems nice but we've only communicated over email since he goes away alot.

A large 2br, maybe slightly larger than the 1br. It is directly above a bunch of stores/grocery shops on a kind of busy street but it isn't too busy at night. The kitchen is older but bigger. It is within 5 minutes walk to work and has lots of restaurants around too. The buses stop right outside of the apartment kind of, convenient.

I was perfectly happy being her friend, she's a positive person to have in my life. But she noticed I had been hiding a little bit lately, so she asked me why. I told her I been depressed a little, so I been hiding out so I don't spread it. She asked me why I was feeling that way. At first I tried not telling her but she kind of forced it out of me. So she found out that I was feeling lonely and feeling that I'll always be that way. So out of nowhere she says why don't I go on a date wit her.

Let me preface this by saying I’m a senior and high school, and this decision will not be made solely on the opinions of people on the internet, but I would like to know your thoughts. Since I’ve started high school I’ve wanted to go to USC in California. I live in Florida and qualify for a unique scholarship that would allow me to go to any Florida state school I want to and would pay for 100% of my tuition. On top of that my parents have told me that if I get this scholarship I can pocket the funds in my college account which is around $75,000.

223," I'm more or less looking for an objective viewpoint on my employment situation as I can't seem to see the forest through the trees. Am I being stupid and selfish, or do I have justified concerns here? 

For some background, I've been in my industry about 8 years. I left my last company of 5 years to move to a new up and comer, and I did so under the promise of management (how many of us get screwed this way, I wonder). I alone got this business running (company is based outside the US), provided my personal address so the company could ship stuff here, get their tax licenses, etc. I bent over backwards to help them, because I thought they were going to take care of me. 

Well, I'm a year and 3 months in, and they just hired a manager above me. They want me to train her, they want me to include her (not this lady's fault, but fuck her), they want to ""support"" me without giving me the title. I'm just livid, I feel betrayed and used and I'm wondering if I'm just being stupid.

225,"We got married in 2007. Fast forward to 2013, when we still had  great marriage and had just had our first child, my wife spends an unusual amount of time on the phone laughing, giggling and generally like having a good time. At some point I realized that she's been talking to a coworker, that I'll call D for d-bag, I ask her to stop carrying on that way(didn't read any messages just what she was telling me). She didn't stop.  

In 2014 a bunch of her coworkers get together and go out to a club, she decides to go and when I ask her why she hasn't left she tells me that D is on his way to pick her up. I didn't make a big deal out of it because i trusted her and I certainly  don't want to insult my wife with false accusations. She comes back 4:30 am in the morning.

A few months later in 2014 she's invited as an extra in a movie and we had a get-together with my in-laws 2hrs from home so I drive and the kid there and she was supposed to drive there when she was done but supposedly it was taking all day and at about 10pm she's finally able to “make a phone call” and tells me that they still got a couple more hours and that she's really tired and she doesn't want to make the drive. The next day I found out that D was there. A few weeks later I found some troubling messages, nothing concrete but it doesn't feel good at all. 

She changes jobs towards the end of 2014 and in valentines day she receives a message with a song that D wrote for her (yes, he's a friggin musician) where he sings about how he misses her. I confronted her and she said that he always had the wrong idea about her and she had asked him to stop contacting her so she just “ignored” the message.

January 2016 she takes another job and guess who works there now? Yes, D. I found some messages, nothing concrete or incriminating but I confronted her about how she's still talking to him. I was angry and very disappointed this time so she confesses that they did have a thing going on and I “extract” the truth about that night when she was an extra and she confesses that that's the only time that they had intimacy (she blew him), obviously I don't know what to believe. I do some soul searching, we talk, we cry, I scream and decide to give it another chance.

Two weeks ago kids and I go to her work and I found, yet again, some troubling messages on her pc through their own internal messaging system. This time she claimed that he's the one that won't stop contacting her and she's just trying to keep things at ease to keep her job. She even told me that back in 2015 she tried to put a restraining order on him but the PD didn't find enough evidence to support a non contact order. I tried to put her out of the house but she begged and cried and I felt so bad and sad that I decided to let her stay while we sort things out. It's been an ok couple of weeks, she is apologetic and keeps her head down. We don't really argue it's just me giving her a hard time for everything that's happened. This weekend we had an episode when I start giving her crap about how I feel, how bad she makes me feel and tell her how shitty I think she is and she confesses to more, they have had lunch together  once or twice a week.

TL, DR My wife cheated on me in 2014 and she still “talks” to the guy.

I'm in a situation where it's really hard to start over, it's so hard for me that I'm considering going back to my home country. 
I need advice on what to do, how to organize my thoughts and feelings to make a better decision, or how to keep trying to keep this sinking ship afloat so that my kids don't grow up without a father. Or someone tell me that I'm taking it too personal and too hard and my wife is really not that shitty person.
Please, anything.
Thanks in advance.   ",07Nov2017,19
227,"i'm (19F) and i was in a very close, intense friendship with this boy in 10th grade. i was super depressed and just had everything going wrong but he was my rock and there for me. he had a girlfriend who hated me even though i never did anything or flirted or disrespected their relationship in any way. she would say awful shit about him ('he's not cute enough for me' 'he doesn't have enough money' she even called him a dirty mexican once) (he's guatemalan) i told him and he didn't believe me. i had to go to residential near the end of the year, i was there for 11th grade. then i came back in 12th and all of a sudden he hated me. he talked shit and just disregarded my existence for the most part, EXCEPT on weird occasions he would talk to me or express gratitude to people who were being nice to me. once i handed him his jacket he forgot in gym class and he just said ""thanks love you"" 

it ultimately led up to me having 2 seperate incidents where the first i punched him in the face and the second i hit him a few times because he and his friend were throwing a kickball at me during gym class and thought i wouldn't react. (i explicitly stated ""you do it again, i'm going to beat your ass"" and so i did) i ended up in the hospital the same day i had the big fight and apparently he was asking a mutual friend if i was okay/where was i. he did it frequently apparently. on graduation day everyone was ignoring me so i went to a separate room. i hadn't seen him in weeks, but he walks in and almost a whisper says hi. i respond back and he gets really excited and sits down and spends the duration of the time talking to me. after the ceremony, he comes up to me, says we made it, and hugs me. 

skip later to a few months after high school, he matches me on tinder. i say hi he doesn't reply though. more months later, it was just his birthday (he's 7 months older than me) and i messaged him saying happy birthday and he said thank you. 

i see him in my dreams at night, i still think about him, i have my friend check up on him for me every once in a while. people said we would've made a great couple but i feel like he wouldn't date me because of my weight. he had written a poem about how beautiful he thought i was, i wrote him some. he even jacked off in front of me in class once. but nothing besides that.

how do i move on or have some peace? i feel like i'll love him forever, but i also feel i can't let it stop me from living my life. he was basically me but in male form. we were so connected and understood each other. he knew how to talk to me and calm me down like no one else could. i just will always feel so strongly for him.

231,"Hi, I'm 19, and I just graduated High School, and by 'just' I mean last June, 5 months ago. So, I've had kids that were my friends, that I haven't seen in 5 months, and it's already felt like forever. I already am hearing about some of these kids moving away to other places for college, some already have. Others, I want to hang out with, but they are always busy with new jobs and college. So, I haven't seen them since June. And my parents, who both graduated in 1989, always bring up that they have friends they haven't seen since then. Like, they told me, ""To be honest Jack, your fear might happen. I had a kid that was my friend, but I haven't seen him since June 1989. He could be dead for all I know.""

 It just...freaks me out whenever I hear something like that. And, my dad just last night went to visit a friend he hasn't seen since...you guessed it, June 1989. I just...it flips me out whenever I hear about it. Why go that long without seeing someone you considered your friend? It makes no sense. Like...why was this guy only in my dad's thoughts NOW? Like...why didn't this guy go see this guy in like...2002? It had already been 10+ years back then. And the idea of not seeing someone for that long and then seeing what they look like now. The last time you saw this person that was your friend, they were a teen, now their all adult looking. It just...freaks me out. 

I wanna get over it because, I know it's not gonna go away. I know that people not seeing each other for 10-30 years after High School is a fact of life. I know that, there is a particular friend that I haven't seen since June, that I REALLY want to see, and, 10 years from now, it may still not of happened. That's what bothers me the most. The idea that this particular friend I really like and want to hang out with again, that it might be years, even decades before that happens again...

It really freaks me out. But, I know it's a fact of life, and that's it not going anywhere. I wish I could just ""get over it"", but I can't. Before anyone says, ""Do you to talk to a professional?"" I actually did have brief conversation with a person I know that's a social worker, and she just said, ""The best you can do is keep contacting these people that are your friends and, if you can't see them, at least talk to them, since adults now when we were your age didn't have social media and texting."" I know that, but, texting someone versus actually seeing them is a huge difference. And even so, this whole thing does really bother me. So...any advice on how to handle the whole situation better?

My parents didn't know what they were doing when getting my older brother off to college and they want to make things ""right"" for me.

I am in Boy Scouts and have my Eagle Project (already approved, just need to build) and 6 merit badges (all just paperwork now, I finished all activities) until Eagle Scout. My local council needs the paperwork for review on the 1st of every month, meaning if I want ""Eagle Scout"" on college application I need to have everything done by December 1st.

From Nov 17-21st I will be on my HS Class trip to Disney, meaning I have a total of 16 days until I need all my paperwork in for Eagle. 

Out of my college list my safety school is the college I want to go to, Columbia College of Chicago, and it has an 89% acceptance rate. My family isn't poor by any means, but that doesn't mean my parents want to help me with a full college tuition, they want as much off as possible and that's understandable.

As of right now if I were to apply to my safety school I'd get in on grades alone. Sure I could get money off with Eagle Scout but I seriously don't think I can realistically get it done in time.

Not to mention I have other things I need to get done. I need to keep up my grades, work in my High School's stage crew, find a job, work on my personal projects (I'm going for filmmaking and am making a short film), and maintain my social life.

All in all I'd like to hear your thoughts. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I’ve been there for a little over a year, the ER for 3 months, and it’s a 6 month commitment. It’s usually a 30 day commitment in one area. The ER is very popular. The majority of the volunteers want to do so in the ER when they’re old enough, and it was somewhat hard to find a volunteer time just because of how popular it is. So there are plenty of volunteers. We’re easily replaceable. And we don’t have projects or anything. We just come in and help the patients once a week. I think I used to be a relatively valued volunteer there.

The main volunteer guy (not a coordinator, but a volunteer that is the head of the volunteers if that makes sense) has made comments like, “I don’t have hair because of people like you.” “I don’t even want to talk to you right now.” “I had faith in you, and you ruined it.” I still like helping people out, but I don’t think I’m doing a good job, especially after those comments. I’ve been doing my best, but I just don’t seem to get the memo. I used to look forward to volunteering, now I’m dreading it and feel both worse about myself and unhappy upon my shift ending. I’m also a college student and currently have a paying job, but have considered getting a second one to help me through college. I also want to be able to afford a place to live upon graduating.

So, I’m considering putting in my two weeks notice. On one hand, I think they might be happier and I can focus on making a living and a future for myself. On the other hand, they haven’t fired me yet (and they don’t hesitate to fire you if they feel the need. They say we’re held to the same standards as the staff), and before those comments, that once a week job enriched my life. 

What do you think? Do you think I should put in my two weeks notice?

242,"It's a problem with the ear, I don't feel any fullness in the ear but when in crowded, loud, public areas I have trouble hearing what other people are saying and I can't hear clearly. I have to try hard to hear what others say. Like I said my hearing is reasonably ok at home, but I know it could be better.

Also I have constant ringing in my ears from tinnitus, mostly noticeable in quiet settings.

I believe I remember having similar symptoms (at least I can remember that I was hard of hearing in loud public spaces) as much as seven years ago. 

I know it is probably not the ear wax as I had micro suction done a short while ago. When the doc asked how my hearing was, I said it was fine because my hearing is fine in quiet areas and I was in a quiet room at the time of micro suction.

I think I should go to the doctor soon but I'm really anxious about what this is, even knowing what it possibly is could calm me down a bit and relieve some stress while I wait for an appointment. 

If you guys have had similar symptoms you are welcome to share.

243,"Hello all! I  have a question concerning next steps to take toward a future teaching position. 

I am currently completing an alternative certification program for the state of Texas while living in Maryland with my parents. I have completed the bulk of the program online and am now at the point of needing to acquire observation hours. Many teachers I have spoken to also advised me to do some sort of student teaching or substitute teaching before I apply for or get a full-on teaching job. I wholeheartedly agree with this advice. 

The problem I am having is this: I am not currently working and am lucky enough to live at home with my parents rent-free, but I am eager to get back to Texas as soon as possible and my original plan was to move by the end of January. I still have 18 hours of classroom observations to complete, which is difficult to do from Maryland and difficult to do especially at this time of the year.

My question for you all is, what do you think would be the best course of action for me? I have somewhat limited options in terms of living arrangements in Texas and I don't want to be more of a financial burden on my parents while I look for employment. I think it would be best if I was in the area where I hope to teach, but can't do so without money to pay rent. I also think it would be most beneficial to get a job that has something to do with teaching in the meantime, but I'm not entirely sure what my options are that would also allow me to complete my observation hours. 

I obviously need to discuss things with my parents, and I will, but I wanted to see if anyone could point me in the right direction as to possible job options in the interim between now and applying for teaching positions. 

I apologize if this isn't the best place for this or if what I've written is confusing. I myself am having a bit of trouble organizing my thoughts about it, which is probably making things more difficult for me in the first place. 

Thank you for any advice and I hope you all have a nice day! ",07Nov2017,1

245,"So I've grown up in a smallish town (around 10,000 people) and been fairly isolated my entire life. I was homeschooled, and my only real social contact up until the last few years was with my family and my church. I go to a regional campus of a bigger college now, and am starting to crave a bit more of a social life, something I've never really had. The problem is, I don't really know what to even do about that. I don't really have an issue talking to people. Maintaining a conversation is still a little new to me, but I'm working on it, and I don't really have much social anxiety. My main problem is finding a place to even meet people. I don't know where to go or what to do. I've looked into student life here on the campus, and there isn't much, for the most part just organizations for the different programs (none of which I'm a part of).

Any advice would be appreciated!

247,"Longish post, sorry!! So my younger sister (“Cee”) and I got into a fight with a mutual friend (“Ess”) earlier this year and we stopped speaking to one another (not Cee and I - but both Cee and I stopped speaking to Ess). We had been friends for about two or three years and the relationship really deteriorated in the last year (at least for me). So about a month after the fight, Cee reached out to Ess and patched things up with her. I was still mad at Ess and decided to give myself more time. About a month after Cee and Ess patched things up, I woke up one morning to a text from Ess saying that she was going to “swallow a pill of pride” and said that we needed to patch things up. The text got me all stirred up again and I responded saying that I needed more time to get over my anger and would reach out to her later. She didn’t respond and I waited another month before I felt like I had a handle on my feelings and sent her a text asking to meet up and talk. Ess never responded to my text so I took that as a no and continued living my life. Ess and Cee hang out sometimes, obviously without me, but not as often as we all used to hang out. So here's the sticky part: Cee met her boyfriend (“Jay”) through Ess and now that boyfriend is getting ready to propose to Cee around the holidays. Jay has indicated to me that he wants to throw a small, intimate engagement party with just close couple friends and Ess and her husband are on the list of invitees since they wouldn't have met without being introduced by Ess. Of course I will be there because Cee is my sister and best friend. My problem is that I have no idea what to expect when it comes to Ess being there. When Ess drinks she get very loud and talkative and has to be the center of attention. I know that this is not my night and everyone will want to have fun celebrating, but Ess has a way of getting not so subtle digs in and I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer any advice for me on how to deal with this situation. Please and thank you!!",07Nov2017,1
248,"**tldr:** This is a long post about my life and how i got to where i am. Would love some advice and help. 

**FYI:** My English isnt really good, i tried writing the best i could. 

The other day me and my friends were talking about the traits each of us had, and when it came to my turn, they told me that i didnt have any confidence in anything i say or do, and that i am not very decisive at anything in life. I understood that i needed to change but i just didnt know how. I feel like i am a very broken person. I have lied about my problems and tried hiding everything that was bad about myself for as long as i can remember. The major one being my grades, and my studies. I have also always had problems with getting distracted and not being able to concentrate in one thing. I also feel like i easily get swayed by other peoples opinions, and i just follow through without having my own opinion. This is my story of how i just keep screwing myself. 


As far back as i can remember I have always had problems with my studies, which was mostly caused by me not being able to concentrate on one thing and getting distracted very easily by anything e.g Video Games, Toys, TV, e.t.c. 


It Honestly wasnt as bad as it is now. I used to be able to study for a few hours without being distracted but now i cant even pay attention to one thing for more then a min. I keep zooming in and out. Before i used to atleast have my parents to control me from playing games, or watching tv or something along the line. But now i feel like due to all the freedom i got i havent been to control myself. My grades were always shit, i was never really that great at studies, i did do well in a few subjects but i think i just got lucky.  My grades  in high school were all D's, C's, B's and few A's. Due to that i had to take an extra year just so i could get into a collage.  After getting into collage i thought i could control my habits and start concentrating on my studies but it just kept getting worse and worse. As for the major that i picked in university it was honestly decided by someone else. 
One day while talking to my cousin about my career i asked him about what would be a good major, he looked at me and Because of my love for animals,my cousin suggested that i become a vet. After that I decided to take health as my major in a university. But i just kept failing from one course to another for two years, i was in depression, i just couldnt focus on my studies. So one day my dad suggested that i go into community collage and get a degree in computer science, i decided that since it had the biggest demand and there were some chances of me being able to transfer into a university later on to pursue a diploma in computer science. 


Fast forward 3 years, i am years behind my peers and the distance between me and them is getting bigger and bigger. I still cant concentrate on anything at school. It has gotten to the point where i dont even bother to do any of my assignments anymore, i know i need to do them but i just get distracted and feel overwhelmed by the amount thats piling up.  Also due to my field being a study in computers i feel like there are alot more distraction when i try to do any of my work. I feel like i have been constantly in between depression and out of depression throughout these three years. 


Furthermore due to depression or just a need to satisfy myself or just to screw myself some more i have gotten into a habit of gambling in micro-transaction in mobile games and have lost tons of money. I have thousands in debt and dont know what to do about it. Even with all that debt i still continue to do small micro transaction. 


I feel like i keep drowning myself in a swamp with no way of getting out. My parents and close friends have no idea about any of this. I feel like it would break their hear if i told them. Since i have no one else to turn to i thought i would come here to see if i could get some help from others who might have gone through the same stuff. ",07Nov2017,3

259,"So I'm definately moving from Sweden to Spain in a couple of months and I have two options in front of me. 

The first option, which was the initiative of one of my best friends, is to go to Alicante with him, his girlfriend and her friend. I don't really know the females of this party as I've met them on very few occasions. My impression of my friends girlfriend is that she is really insecure which kind of makes me uncomfortable and we don't really have anything in common (as far as I know). The other girl seems really cool and outgoing and is easy to talk to. My friend is really ambitious and I'm really inspired being around him. He has high goals for his career and is really into training and spiritual practices.

If i'll go with this option i'd be taking distance-studies and hopefully have time to focus alot on personal improvement in fields I find important e.g yoga, meditation, gym, vegetable-gardening and dancing.
Since there is 4 of us we could split the rent and probably end up in a pretty nice housing. 

I'm the only one in the party which feel that I want to stay for a minimum of 1,5-2 years. The others are not sure which I respect. I'm dying to learn the language and culture and I want to make new friends. 

The second option is to go to Marbella and study graphic design for 3 years. The party mentioned above doesn't want to live there which means i'd be going solo. It's a multi-cultural school so i'd be meeting alot of new people with different backgrounds. 

Having the security of knowing i'll be there for 3 years is comforting and i know i'll be focusing on graphic design which is what i'd like to pursue as a career. I'm not sure i'll be having that much time for other hobbies and the area where the students live doesn't seem to have a decent gym or dance school. 

Anyone been in a similar situation?

At the same time she was starting her first semester of college. I came back and everything seemed fine. There was no red flags other than the usual suspicions every one has when they come home just becasue we are told daily that we where getting cheated on. I've had conversations with her before about her time at college and she denied doing anything and i believed her. So anyway, a couple of days ago we are shopping and she breaks down crying saying that we need to go home. I thought that she was having some sort of anxiety attack because she has had those in the past. I drive her home and she finally tells me that she can't keep it in any longer and that it's to painfully of a secret to keep, but she still won't tell me what she means. I finally get her to tell me and she says that about a month after I left for boot camp she was drinking and doing Percocet with her freinds in the dorm room and eventually everybody left besides her and this other dude. They where just talking at first and then she says he started to kiss her and they started making out. Then he took her pants of and they had sex. She says that she left school the next day and never spoke to him again and has never told anyone about this untill now. I love her and our relationship has been amazing but i cant look at her the same. She kept it from me when I proposed, got married and the whole time we lived together.

I am a moderator, and creator of a subreddit with a significant amount of subs. It is dedicated to discussion concerning a youtuber with about 600k subscribers. He has a reddit account, and is a mod with minimal powers, and a verified identity.  
  
Multiple times I have asked him to put links  to the sub in video description with the patreon, and discord links, and he eventually did it for about a month, before removing them. He is now asking for me to transfer ownership of the subreddit from myself, to him. I feel that this is not the best idea for the sub, and possibly may cause him to remove me completely from modding the sub at all. I really feel a passion for this subreddit, and the community, but i don't know what to do in this scenario.  
  
my gut says not to give him ownership, but I don't know if he has an inherent right to it. On multiple occasions, he has said to me that he does not really acknowledge the subreddit as valuable to his youtube presence, and that he values the second channel, and discord more. He has even said that he has thought about asking me stright up to delete it. I feel that the subreddit is a great place for the community to gather, and discuss about the youtuber, and the topics that he covers.  
  
Mainly I don't want the subreddit to be deleted, but I also would like to retain my mod position. I feel he has neglected, and undervalued the sub, and now randomly asking for ownership is a bit out of place, and even somewhat insulting.

The choices are based off of the programs offered by my local community college.

 My YTD Gross income is already over 40k/yr as a massage therapist. Ideally would like to earn more. My work now is pretty flexible with my schedule I am able to live working 4 days a week which is nice. Would be prefer in a sub 40-hr work week unless the pay is substantially better/work is less intense. Also not a fan of the fluctuations of commission. Would like something steady year round earning the same amount every month, just simpler to deal with, and don't want to be expected to work extra for tips. Am technically inclined. No interest in sales.


My picks:
* Graphic design: not much experience with illustration but an interest in aesthetically pleasing and functional design, may be more appropriate for UX/web dev??

* Music Production/Recording: Not master of a single instrument but familiar with DAWs and intermediate on drums, piano/synths, can figure out bass&amp;guitar, no woodwind/string exp, is this just a silly dream?

* Sustainability management: not really sure what this jobs are available in this field? would love someone to chime in

* Engineering Tech: Mechanical vs Electrical?? Differences/Pros/Cons? How would I go about learning whether this is something I would enjoy? Is the market good for any specific type of engineer?

* Environmental Science Technician: sounds really cool, maybe #1 interest level, but what's the actual job outlook/work environment like?

* Vet Tech: might love it but pays garbage from my understanding. would like to hear experiences 

* Biotech: lab position. seems like the kind of stuff i'd like to do.. pay seems fine. Question about this one: what opportunities does a bachelors in bio grant you that an associates in bio lab tech doesn't?

* Really interested in most Biology subfields but have heard jobs are scarce.. known a few bio majors working at starbucks. Never want to be in that position. Faves are cellular/molecular, environmental, and animal/marine. 

* Not entirely sold on Chemistry but I've heard it's a better major for various reasons. Thoughts?


* My last area of interest is in the realm of computer science. I am interested in programming, networking, security, and possibly web dev.

My girlfriend is very timid when it comes to confrontation and she says that when it happens she is terrified, she is now scared to even leave her house unless she’s with me, her best friend or her parents.



These are the things she has tried and I have suggested doing but they don’t help a lot:

* She has given the guys fake numbers but the guys call her on the spot in front of her.

*  She has said she has a boyfriend or lied and said she’s gay but when she says this guy or guys say she should cheat or begin to say sexual things to her and sometimes force themselves onto her and try to kiss her or grope her.

* She has tried screaming and even called the police at times but she says the guy or guys then get very defensive and say can’t she take a compliment and begin to get aggressive and shout at her until they just leave.

* My girlfriend has also asked her male housemates to walk with her to her uni when they can but the guys she lives with are also very timid and it has happened when they are around and they don’t do anything for whatever reason.  

I’m male myself and I couldn’t imagine doing any of these things to a women. I feel powerless and having my girlfriend breakdown in my arms because she’s scared to leave her house is heartbreaking and its starting to get worse. I want my girlfriend to be safe. I have spoken to other women I know, including my sister but all the women I have spoken to say that there is nothing you can do besides ignore it and say that you’re not interested.

  

This has happened only ever once around me and when the guy wouldn’t leave and continued to harass my girlfriend I hit him and the police ended up getting involved.



I wish I was lying about this situation but my girlfriend says this happens a lot to her, sometimes the guys just go away but a lot of the guys get aggressive to her or begin to touch her or grab her and even force themselves onto her when she rejects them. I’m worried for my girlfriends safely especially since she lives in the city. she walks to her uni almost every day and sometimes doesn’t finish until late at night, most the times she calls an uber to go home but she can’t keep doing it because it’s costing her a lot of money. She carries body spray as well  for protection. 



Any advice would be helpful, I have suggested self-defensive classes to her and I don’t know what else I can do to help her. 



**TLDR**: my girlfriend is getting harassed and cornered when guys come up to her and I have suggested everything I can to help her and I don’t know what else I can do because the guys dont leave her alone.

Pretty much the first two would be about the same credit load over 4 years (124 credits) but doing Math/Chemistry would work out a lot nicer. The last would be a lot easier during my junior/senior year because I'd be in only 12 hours for my last 4 semesters too, but I'd give up doing music entirely and I've done music since I was a child (been in choir since I was 2, and it's been pretty pervasive in my life) but it's easily been what gives me the most stress in my life because I constantly feel like I have to ""prove myself"" to others in music.

I don't know what to do. On one hand, I love music and want to continue with it, but on the other hand it's what gives me the most anxiety in my plans. Plus, doing Chemistry and Math would probably be better for working/grad school, but it might feel like too much STEM all at once.

Now I know that everyone is saying that since I'm already halfway through that I might as well finish it, but I have only just begun to get into classes that are specific to my major, and I'm failing at least one of them. This might not seem like a big deal to some people, especially since I was mostly a B and C student, but lately I've been suffering with anxiety that leaves me crying almost every day and having a panic attack just about weekly.

298,"I've been in a relationship with this person for four and a half years now. We started living together three years ago. We are both in university, nearing graduation.

I am an obsessive neat-freak with ADHD (keeping things organized and tidy is one of my self-regulatory strategies to minimize the impact of ADHD). Being in a dirty or disorganized environment exhausts me mentally, resulting in me displaying symptoms of severe depression. 

Over the summer, I spent my first extended period of time alone in our home in the three years of our relationship. In the first day, I cleaned the entire apartment. Everything was organized. I cleaned the pantry and fridge, reorganized the kitchen, put everything back on the shelves where it belonged. Vacuumed. Sorted all the laundry. Scrubbed the bathrooms until they looked new. I spent almost every minute of my free time during those three weeks cooking healthy food, doing healthy outdoor activities, or working on my hobbies in the workshop of our complex. Everything was organized. 

Then they come home. 

Within a few days, there is rotting food sitting on their desk, their side of the bedroom is literally knee-deep in stray clothes. If they cook, their idea of cleaning the kitchen is to wipe the pots and put them away. Counters filthy, appliances unwashed, floors unswept. The bathroom counter becomes so cluttered that within two weeks I moved my toiletries to the powder room. Their idea of making the bed is gathering up all the blankets and throwing the bundle in the middle of the mattress. The area in our shared office (because university) that they are responsible for has absolutely no visible carpet, it is all stray paper, garbage (not recycling; garbage), and books. Their desk has not an inch of exposed surface area and they slowly move to the kitchen table rather than cleaning their space in the office. 

This issue is apparent at their parents' house as well, they do not clean things well and it is cluttered and disorganized. One of their responsibilities is to clean en-suite, and I have stopped using the shower in that room entirely because there mold growing on the floor of the shower. 

I don't want to give the impression that I hate this person. I love them dearly. When we go out to do stuff it's a load of fun, we love backpacking, travelling, we enjoy cuddling up to watch movies, doing what couples do, and so on. We lead a pretty much happy relationship. 

I have tried to address the problem, but it generally results in responses like ""well the entire apartment is filthy, so you clearly aren't doing your part either."" They do *not* understand that a standard has to be maintained by both people, and not just for comfort in my situation - ADHD is very real and clutter can basically put my brain into stand-by. 

We tried to create a cleaning schedule with equal responsibilities last year. That went nowhere. I ended up having to take over cleaning the en-suite (though I abandoned that after six months), and the entire creation of this schedule was not mutually appreciated - tears were flowing from one end the entire time and I was treated like shit for the next three days.

I need cleanliness, as in *I cannot mentally or physically function* without it. I am not just griping because she doesn't like living the way I live, I know we have different interests. But I find myself not eating for days at a time because I don't want to go into the kitchen and face what she has left on the stove or in the sink. I hole myself up in my corner of the office staring at my computer screens because I know that if I look anywhere else I will send my heart rate through the roof. 

I need help in how to deal with this, I need recommendations in ways to approach this problem. Unfortunately this is a big enough problem that I'm just about ready to break up with this person because of it, but I want that to be a last resort because we have a lot built together emotionally. I simply cannot live with this.",07Nov2017,0
300,"Hey Reddit, I guess I am a little confused on what I should do.

To put it simply, all my life I have been so unfocused and hyper. I never focused in high school, I never did homework, and I never could open up to people. Yesterday I talked to a friend and mentioned how I have trouble focusing and even showing up to classes. They gave me an Adderall and told me to take it in the morning before class and see if it helps.

Today, I woke up and took the pill. Holy shit, I can feel such a difference just by one day in classes. I was actually able to stay awake and pay attention to the presentation. I feel like I achieved more in one 4 hour class today than I did the entire semester. Usually I spend class browsing Reddit(bless it) and mooching the homework off others. But today, I actually tried, and learned something. Not only that, I drove straight home from campus to my mothers house to explain to her how I felt. How this medicine is making me feel, and seeing what she thought about it. Honestly I was never close with my mother and I always found it hard to open up to people but today I actually drove home and spoke with her and it was amazing. This is why I am so conflicted.

Honestly, I don't want to think there is something wrong with me and I do not want to be dependent on a medicine to make my life better, but I have noticed even the tiniest of details that have changed under just one day of the drug. I feel niave for thinking I should see a doctor to discuss this, but I honestly feel liked it helped so much. 

What do you think  reddit? Am I being a young dumb adult? Or is it possible that I have struggled with ADHD my entire life and just now am accepting it? 


I am sort of embarressed to ask you guys for advice, I guess it makes me feel weak as a person, but If this can be an improvement in my life then why not seek out help?

Thank you.

303,"Hi all!  I have an idea that I have been mulling over for a while, and I thought I would take to the internets to get some outside perspective.  I would genuinely appreciate any thoughts our guidance you may be able to offer.  

So I am the HR Manager for a large company (about 10,000 employees nationwide, around 200 at just my location).  I have been in my role now just two months, so I am still very much learning the operations and the culture and all that good stuff.  One thing that was made obvious to me in my interview (and that I can see for myself now that I am in my position) is that this company really struggles with employee engagement and retention.  The company just went through a merger just about a year ago, and the employee population at large is having some difficulty adapting to the ""New Company"" way.  The majority of the positions we have here are entry level call phone jobs, so not the most glamorous or coveted positions out there.  And our pay ranges are actually below market for our area, which is clearly a huge factor killing our engagement and retention.  We have an aggressive growth strategy for the upcoming year so we definitely have to get some of these things sorted out if we are going to meet goals for next year.  As the HR Manager I am actively working with Senior Leadership to move the needle on some of these things, but for the moment it just is what it is.  

In the short time I have been here I have had hours upon hours of conversations with employees, supervisors, managers, etc. in an attempt to get a temperature gauge for the current state of affairs.  They universally agree that pay is killing retention, the adjustment to the ""New Company"" way is hurting morale, and the lack of activities and reward and recognition programs is affecting job satisfaction.  But one thing that seems to be keeping people here (we have a lot of employees with 10, 20, even 30 years of service) is the family-like atmosphere they describe and the care and compassion they share for one another.  So yeah, we have lots of work to do.  But it's not all bad here.

So here's where my idea comes in.  This company has done the Adopt-a-Family type events for the holidays in years past, and it's always been very successful and a huge boost for morale.  If you're not familiar, these types of programs work so that you reach out to an organization (a church, community center, Salvation Army, etc.) and ""Adopt"" a family in need.  Employees are given the family demographics (i.e. boy aged 5, loves cars and wears a 5t, etc.) and teams work together to buy presents, clothing, and anything else the family would need to make a great holiday.  I have myself been involved with these programs in the past, and I absolutely love participating.  It's so much fun to think about helping people who might not have a great holiday otherwise, and it always brings people together.

So - I would like to continue doing this, but with a twist.  We know that some of our own employees are struggling to make ends meet and would certainly benefit from being the recipients of the program.  Why not ""Adopt"" our own employees for the holidays?  I could see this being HUGELY rewarding, as much as they have gotten into doing this in years past for strangers, I could see even more enthusiasm knowing they are helping some  of their coworkers.  And given that the thing people seem to like the most is the ""family-like"" atmosphere here, I can see this really playing that up.  I think the payoff could be huge, IF (and ONLY IF) this type of program is handled appropriately.  

Here's how I am thinking it will work:

1.) I send a VERY sensitive and tasteful message to the population announcing the program. Nothing about ""needing help"", or anything like that.  I am still wordsmithing it but maybe along the lines of ""Help us launch the 'New Company'-family hand up program!  If your family could use a 'hand-up"" this season, please let the HR Mgr know...""

2.) I would gather the responses and meet with each one individually.  I don't want them to feel obligated to give me a horrible sob story so they could ""win"", I would just have an informal conversation with them about what they might need, their family demographics, etc.  

3.) No one is denied.  If we have 2 or if we have 20 people who are humble enough to throw their hats in the ring, then that just means we allocate our resources a little differently.

4.) I will be the only one who knows names.  Then I would break them down and say - this team, you have an X year who likes X and wears a size X, etc. so no one knows who they're buying for.  We would have events and contests during the few weeks of the program to amp up the interest and really get people excited about it.

5.) Teams even wrap their presents, maybe I can give each participant some kind of identifier to keep things straight.  Then the management team divides the gifts and contacts the employees individually to arrange a pick up.

For what it's worth, I have floated the idea by all supervisors, managers and above for their input.  All seem on board, no one has alerted me to any reason they think it might not work.  So for now at least, I have some leadership buy-in.  

I believe this hinges on a few things - 1.) my ability to sensitively and respectfully word the message, and 2.) my assurance to keep participation 100% confidential.  I believe I can make it work, and the impact it might have could be tremendous.  BUT - I am also a very optimistic person by nature, and I might not be seeing the red flags here.  Help me out - what am I missing?  Could this work?  

tl;dr:  HR Manager would like to do an internal ""Adopt-a-Family"" program for the employees who may be in need this season.  Am I just doing nothing but creating a trainwreck here?",07Nov2017,1
304,"21M here, studying systems administration and security. And by the way hello my fellow classmates and friends who are gonna laugh at this behind my back :D but I don't care.

A little bit of background first:

I've been single my entire life, never kissed a girl (yes I'm straight), never been in a relationship, up until like I was 19 I always though of women to be the devil (long and off-topic story) but matured a lot and learned from hundreds of mistakes the last couple years. I'd call myself an introvert and live mostly a quiet life and spend my time learning Linux, playing chess, riding my bicycle, running or playing poker with friends from high school, watch movies and listen and play lots of music (mostly progressive guitar stuff, I own a 7 string) and if I spare some time I play video games, but that's been decreasing a lot lately.

At the same time, I've been battling mild psychopathy, shyness, social anxiety and antisocial and self-destructive behaviour for quite a while, went to a psychiatrist last year, made it much worse and had made me do very stupid crap, but I figured it out by myself and my self-esteem levels and overall image of myself its much improved to the point I feel comfortable being who I am and being with other people. I even had friends recently asked me stuff like ""why do you always address everyone as sir or miss?"" or ""why are you always so kind?"" (this might sound stupid in some areas/countries but here it's increasingly rare, especially amongst the youth) to which I reply ""respect and values guys, treat others how you want to be treated"".

So with that out of the way, here's my situation:

My mentality towards an emotional relationship has always been something like ""damn, I wish I was with someone, but hey, it'll come, enjoy life for now"" and it actually worked out great it seems, all these people I knew from high school (none of my friends lol) who have slept with more than one girl have all been heartbroken and knowing myself and knowing how I bury all my emotional issues deep inside not to deal with them I'd have had a much rougher teenage days than I already did. But now, I began thinking stuff like ""yo mike, what are you gonna do about this huh? you're going to miss out on it, you crave to be with someone, love and be loved, the clock is ticking, you're 21..."" and etc. etc. and I'll explain why I'm getting worried in a second.

This started after I began noticing this very pretty girl who's outside at breaktime every morning, she studies at the same place I do, just one floor above, and I'd really like to talk to her. Problem is, she's always surrounded by her two other friends, she comes outside the building just as we do, sits down somewhere and talks with her friends, then walks up the stairs again, and that's it. I don't know at what time she comes in or leaves, I don't know what she's actually studying (we suspect something but we don't know - my buddies and I) and I decided not to stalk/follow/etc her because I'm not coming back to that again.

And with all that, hopefully not useless stuff, here's what I need help with:

I need to talk to her. And if not, I wanna have the chance to meet more people. I know, there's plenty of fish in the sea, but I don't think that's a very valid way of looking at situations like this. In the computer science world there sadly aren't many women involved, I've looked at a few local chess clubs but there's also barely any women who attend too (not to mention, that's a very bad place to seek serious relations anyway), the bicycle stuff, my friends and I are extremely laid back about it so clubs and stuff isn't an option because they take it very very seriously (like we'd just walk uphill and talk for a couple hours so we don't get too tired and then risk our lives downhill and laugh about it at the bottom of the hill lol), and music and the guitar, well I'm still quite shy and I think I'll never get rid of it so looking for a band to play in front of people and so on wouldn't be something to my liking. Not to mention, I'm not that great of a musician still, I need a couple more years :)

I spoke to my sister and she can't quite believe what I'm telling her so she doesn't take too me seriously, I spoke to her husband (a very simple and charming guy) and he gave me some remote ideas on how to talk with her but again, it involves very mild stalking (like finding out at what time she leaves so I can find her alone on the street as she walks home), again, don't wanna do that because I feel like I'm 18 again or something, all my friends be like ""dude, let it go, if you just walk up to her and say hi she'll immediately figure out what you're there for (implying sex but those are not my intentions at all, at least not the first bloody time I talk with someone obviously)"", and I spoke with my mother and her reaction surprised me because instead of a ""you should focus on studying and finding a job"" she was very happy and interested about it, but that was a bit dampened by the fact she's very religious so bottom line of the conversation was ""someone will be sent to you, when you're ready, so if you can't manage to talk to her, it means she isn't yours, so you needn't worry, when you find that person the process will be natural"" and I honestly call that bullshit but hey, family is family.

Issue is worse - and mostly in my head I reckon - because I've noticed I became more nervous again and have anxiety all of a sudden, I began blaming myself again for being naive and stupid when I was younger and ""missing out on things"", I began fantasising about her in bed (it feels great and all but I never had that in my life) and my head's been filling up with this ""I wish this was real, I wish I had this"" to the point it went from annoying, to uncomfortable, to straight up painful and agonising, and this is the bit I slightly regret because I tried to suppress all these feelings again with alcohol (like I used to do) but stopped when I realised 1. this isn't solving anything, it's rather making it worse and 2. this problem goes beyond being single, this goes deeper.

Now I wish I could cover this last part but I'm not writing a book here, I think it's off-topic too. Plus thinking about it I might not even be in the right subreddit anyway.

I have several options here: Do a ""yolo"" and just walk up to her, introduce myself, try and semi-forced conversation and maybe get my friends to fill in too for a few days/weeks to make sure we're all good with each other before I ask her on a date or something, find a better reason/place to talk to her and take it more responsibly, wait and find a less forced/half-desperate way to approach her and take it from there (and potentially having to manage the issues described above for a while), or give it up and be like ""if it happens great, but there's nothing for me to do here"" resignation kinda thing which again isn't going to solve anything I suppose but not everything is as we like it in this life.

And about potentially meeting new people, that's been kinda tough for me because I hate clubs (crowds and noise mostly), so that's out of the picture for me. Plus, I wouldn't feel very happy about meeting someone in a club for some reason. I know people who have and live happily married together now, but I'm not one of those.

Any ideas or comments are much appreciated. I'll read and answer replies tomorrow, I'm hitting the sack for now, been writing this for more than an hour.

Have a good day :)

**tl;dr**: Been battling emotional and behavioural issues for a while, feeling good with myself now, noticed a very pretty girl at the place I study, began having issues again because I can't seem to naturally approach her and in retrospective, also noticed how few chances I have in life to meet women in general.

Often then not and I do not know what to do. I could really appreciate some advice as
Maybe how to realize I can't make everyone like me and how to just let it slide off my back. Thanks. ",07Nov2017,1
307,"My parents are divorced and as I am about to enter university (next year) I need to make a choice on which house to live in for legal and financial reasons. My mother is a control freak, yet she is the one who has paid for all of my schooling from age 8. My father is much more hands off and I have more in common, but I would have to live with his partner, who I only mildly get along with.  No matter what, someone is going to get hurt, but I want to make the transition as smooth as possible. At the moment, moving out to live independently is not an option at all (no job and no money). Please help me. ",07Nov2017,1

314,"Am I a bad person? I'm 19 and I told a 17 year old I really like her. She has a boyfriend. I kept trying to chase her at work and she didn't like it looking back (not literally chase but like you know what I mean). I cannot stop thinking about this.

Ugh.. Sorry i just needed to get that out..
I think something is fundamentally wrong with me. Do I apologize? Will this bite me in the ass 5 years from now? Not sure what to say.. it's been like 2 months since we had a conversation",07Nov2017,1

316,"I met my boyfriend 6 months ago on Tinder. We have been very happy except 2 months into our relationship he was deployed overseas (he is in the military). He seems very committed and asked me if I would make the commitment to go long distance for 6 months. He constantly brings up a future together and even moving in once he returns. We are just two months away from being reunited.

Long story short, some behavior made me suspicious so I made a new tinder account and pretended I was close to his location and matched with him.  There were new pictures of him, and the one that burned most was the one from our vacation that we took when I went to visit him in the other country.

 I am not sure whether he would actually talk to the match but I called him within a couple hours and broke up with him without telling him why.    I think he is suspicious as he immediately unmatched the fake tinder account. 

Now as I look back I thought I had deleted tinder previously but hadn't.  I only deleted the app and not the actual application. I fully believe his behavior of having a tinder account and updating it was wrong, but I was equally wrong still being on Tinder (unknowingly).  He may have had friends here see me on there and tell him I am still on there. 

I have already broken up with him and told his family and friends, which I have grown close to, what happened.   I still have this nagging thought however.  If he is a cheater, and fully intended to cheat on Tinder and meet new women, I do not want to be with him.  However, if he was only on there because he got insecure because I was on there I would understand.

Any thoughts about where to go from here?

317,"I've been overweight for my entire life (Currently 6'5 390-400lb) and I want to do something about it.  Whether it's because of depression or will power I can't force myself to stick to anything.  I honestly don't care enough about myself to do so.  I have no friends and I'm coming to terms with realizing that I've been a terrible person all my life.

I'm 22 and I've never had a serious job.  I started driving after high school.  Technically my first job was at 19 in a factory, got fired first day because I had exhausted myself.  Tried again after college (TCAT Networking Specialist degree with Copper, Fiber Optics, Cyber Security certs) on my 22nd birthday and was fired first day for the same thing.  My parents help me financially but will not help me with weight loss or finding work (mom will randomly explode about me not finding a job).

I literally feel like I'm retarded.  I'm honestly just going to end it at some point if I can't get it figured out so that I can stop being a burden on my family.

I'm always working.  She works also, and is taking care of her mother with dementia, our child and all of the animals.  She cooks, cleans, does it all, but the thought of more space to clean is seriously worrying her despite the fact that we desperately need more space.

I purchased a weekly maid to come to the new house and do a lot of the cleaning chores.  This is a birthday gift.  How do I present her with it?  

I don't want to go the cheesy ""coupon for house cleaning"" or anything silly.  ",07Nov2017,1
