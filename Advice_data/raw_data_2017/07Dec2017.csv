0,"Throwaway because I don’t actually have a ‘main’ reddit account - I don’t usually use reddit.

I’m a girl, I’m 25yo now. 

She and I were friends at the time. We were lying down in bed together with several friends, drunk, in a sleepover. We were maybe 14 or 15. She kept whining that she was horny - obviously wanting one of the boys to touch her. I had never been with another girl before and so I rubbed her thigh. She said no. We were drunk. There was not consent. I reached into her pants and I touched her, rubbing her until she said no a few times. After the third or fourth ‘no’, I took it seriously. It took me that long. I stopped after that, we went to sleep. 

I thought it was normal for girls to ‘pretend not to want it’, to ‘play hard to get’. I now know that is not the case. That a drunk girl saying no in any infliction - lightly or whispered or any way - is no. 

My guts feel sick thinking about what I did. I don’t even know if she remembers. I haven’t spoken to her in at least 8 or so years. Maybe it didn’t hurt her at all. But maybe it did. 

What should I do? What is right to do and feel? ",07Dec2017,1
1,"I have higher education, some work experience in my field, but couldn't find a job so took a non-paying internship because it was work in my field, with an interesting company, interesting tasks, not too big work load, and I could afford it. It's been well over a year now and I want to quit. My worry though is how would a gap on my resume look to prospective employers - since I currently have nothing lined up and I don't know how long the job search will take. I have been looking for a job while interning and haven't landed anything yet but I wonder if having a gig, even if not a paying one, was holding me back - like I felt there was still time to look around and chill... I'm hoping to find a job soon but I'm terrified to just let go of the internship. I wonder if my fears are substantiated.

3,"My manager has been seeing a coworker for what seems to have been about a month,during this time she has given him and his friend more hours than anyone else on the schedule even the supervisors (I am one of them) she used to be a really good friend and we also messed around at some point and time but I NEVER took anyone's hours from them. One of my coworkers has proof that she is seeing the associate with text messages that say something to the affect of ""Ben (fake name) and I are seeing each other and we love each other,I'm living with him and his mom and we're gonna move in together"" My main concern with the matter is 1-she used to be a really good friend 2-she probably still has explicit texts or one picture of myself 3-she promoted me knowing I don't have my GED as of yet and you can only be promoted if you've obtained one (she promoted me before we even started flirting) 4-if she goes down for this and in ANY WAY finds out I was involved she will likely take me down with her. I have told her an associate wanted more hours and she all but demanded to know who it was,I wanted to give her a chance to give more hours out because I don't care what she does outside of work and Im not jealous in any way but I'm not sure how much later I should wait for that,it's holiday season so everyone is pretty much gone but me,the other supervisor and the lover and the friend,I want to protect my employees hours without being fired but if I am I accept this because I'm technically a hypocrite,what can I do in this situation if anything at all? Should I go to the DM? HR? If I show the texts to HR/DM will they show them to the manager?

5,"Long story short, I think with little doubt that I truly hate this guy. Essentially there's this gangly chinese dude in my house who regularly pisses in the bathroom and NEVER closes the door, never washes his hands, gets water all over the sink counter when he brushes his teeth, and has a history of dumping food/soup down the sink or toilet. Not to mention, lets just say whenever he sits on the toilet seat he leaves 'signs' that he's been there.

I'm honestly tired of this. And I can tell my other housemate don't enjoy this either.  One of the other housemates is the person who wipes down the sink regularly, and I doubt he enjoys the messes he finds on the sink. Since I try to keep the toilet from being a city-wide biohazard, it infuriates me that this guy just wrecks shit and doesn't stop when I ask him.

11," This post will kinda be specific.

So I am a sophomore in high school and I got my first smart phone last Christmas (freshman year). I immediately got the Snapchat of a girl I liked and to make a long story short, I sort of texted her A LOT. She soon blocked me but we talked occasionally irl.

We're talking a bit more nowadays and I thought maybe it'd be a good idea to apologize for being so annoying. Good idea? We're often amongst people and I'd prefer to tell her alone so maybe over an Instagram DM? What are your thoughts? ",07Dec2017,1
12,"Sorry, long post incoming.

So, some background: I am an out-of-state Male Freshman at a state college. I was the only one from my high school to attend this college, and knew no one coming into it, so I obviously had to make new friends, which I did. I made a friend group on my floor in my dorm building (Which I soon moved out of due to having serious roommate issues, but I was still very close to them in terms of distance, and we hung out all the time). Particularly, there was one girl who I really bonded with, and after we became very good friends, we did a lot of things together, and hung out basically every day. While I have feelings for her, I did not (Or at least thought I wasn't) acting on them, as she is in a relationship with someone else. We share a friend group, and did lots of things with our friend group as well, although I hung out with her more than anyone else within the group. 

Fast forward to coming back from Thanksgiving break, which ended a week and a half ago: It's finals season, everyone has lots of work. She tells me this early on, and as a result, I kind of tone down the whole hanging out everyday thing. The problem in that is that I have a lengthy past history of severe crippling depression, and I relapsed during the break for the first time in several years. The relapse was still present when I came back to college, and as a result, I really did want to hang out with friends, as when I'm alone, the relapse only gets worse. After a couple days of no contact with her (Which was irregular), I asked if everything was alright, and she said that she was focusing on studies. Unfortunately, I didn't really get the hint there, but, I did stop bothering to contact her for about a week after that. Meanwhile, the depression relapse was slowly turning into full on depression again, and as a result, I started having a very hard time focusing, or really doing anything in general. Also, some unfortunate things happened outside of school and friends that weekend, so it only worsened everything. 

Yesterday, I saw her at dinner at one of the dining halls sitting with a friend, but I didn't approach her. Instead, I sort of sat in her field of view, and didn't really do anything. Now that I think about it, that was a serious fuck up and very likely came off as stalkerish. Later that day, I messaged her and said I was sorry I didn't say hi. She said she 'thought' she saw me as well, but didn't want to be rude to her friend, and stated that she still had a shit on of work to do. 

Fast forward to today: I wake up to find that I had been blocked by her on multiple social media networks (All the ones that I had her on). This was done without any warning. The only things that I had sent her the day before were the texts that I mentioned, and a single Snapchat, which I had mass-snapped, and which she didn't open at all. That made me feel even more like shit. 

I went up to two guy friends in our group to talk about how I was feeling. They didn't really say much, and I got the vibe that I was not welcome there anymore. One of them stated that we never really hung out much (Which is false, as we hung out as a group almost every day of the week/weekend before Thanksgiving break). He also said that I should just go to a therapist, which is good advice, but that was about all that he had said. I mentioned that the girl had unadded me on everything, and asked if he knew anything about that, to which he replied that he didn't really talk to her much. Alright, whatever.

I left their room, but I kind of lingered around on the back stairs in the building (Out of sight of their floor), and I noticed that soon after I left, the girl and my whole friend group hung out for a little while, and the two most prominent voices that I heard while lingering were the girl and the guy who stated that he didn't really talk to her much. 

About 45 minutes later, I went back up to their floor and saw the girl sitting in the common room alone, entered and asked if we could talk. She said sure, but uneasily. I stated that I knew that I had fucked up somewhere along the way, and I apologized about it, was sorry about perhaps being an asshole to others (I was fishing about that, I don't actually know if I was an asshole or not), and that I really wished for another chance of being friends with her, and being back with the friend group. I kind of said this all in an incoherent and unstructured manner, as I was really at a loss for words. I also asked where I went wrong. 

That's when she replied, in an upset/stern voice, saying that she felt very smothered by me (Which I was unaware of), and that her main priority was school, and that right now, she couldn't see us being friends. I replied with the fact that I realize that I had been very clingy, apologized for it about three times, and mentioned that it was due to the fact that I really hated being alone. Also, one of our friends from the group walked in (I think she called him over via text when I came in and asked to talk) and asked if she wanted to work on something together, which she said she did. I left after that, and now I'm writing this post. 

I have no idea what to do right now. I need to focus on finals, but my mind is all over the place. I really, really, want to rekindle my friendship with her and with my friend group in the future (After finals, obviously), but I have no idea how I should approach that. I realize that I fucked up. I realize that it's my fault that all of this is happening, but I really do value her friendship, and really enjoy being around her. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm in a bad place, and I have no idea what to do. I feel super alone, and it is just making things worse. Thank you. ",07Dec2017,1
13,"In recent weeks ive gotten myself into a pretty awkward situation. I currently have a girlfriend who is great and i get along with so well. We have a history though, i have already broken up with her (after 3 years) and gotten back with her after a break of a year, its now 2 years later ( so kinda 5 years but not really). Things were going great and ive been so much happier with her back in my life.
The thing is though, I work with this girl who I find both more attractive and and overall more fun than my current gf and always have, (scumbag i know please dont judge me) and ive been working with her for 3 years now. Only recently has she shown a real interest in me and it has me thinking of what could be. I havnt done anything with this new girl just general workplace flirting and stuff, harmless but really want more.

Now I know it seems easier to just bite the bullet and being young (23) just go for the new girl, but here are some reasons why I cant justify it.
1. New girl is super hot but I work with her. weird maybe? idk
2. I really dont want to go through another breakup with my gf as last time seeing her that sad honestly tore me apart. So maybe I care for her too much to break up.
3. My gf is so good to me and patient with me (im abit of a control freak and she lets me be me) also helps me with everything e.g. assignments in college and other everyday tasks, which helps me deal with pressure buildup
4. Finally (this one might sound the most petty) my gf and I booked a holiday for July which cost a fucking but-load of money and most of it would go to waste. Is it bad that I feel I have to go on it?

Just a short insite into my current situation. sorry for grammer/structure, its my first time writing anything like this. Also any furthur questions just message me.
Would love to hear some feedback. Ive asked my own friends but can only trust afew people not to spread rumours, so who better to ask then some random online users, thanks for reading this far too. Feedback is much appricated .

So what do you think?",07Dec2017,1

15,"A couple months back, my older sister and I went to a party. Someone brought booze and we ended up getting drunker than we planned on. Long story short, during the drive home my sister lost control of the car and hit a tree.

I was okay, but my sister broke her nose on the steering wheel. Before we knew it, we heard sirens and realized that someone must've seen the crash and called 911. I felt so bad for my sister. She'd just turned 18 and would be charged as an adult. I figured she didn't need that on top of her nose being broken and her car being wrecked. So I told her to let me take the blame since I'd be charged as a minor.  She agreed and I was the one arrested that night.

Fast forward to this week. I was in court this afternoon. I pled guilty to DWI and vehicular assault (on account of her nose) and was sentenced to spend all of Christmas break (17 days) in juvenile detention. I report to start serving my sentence on the evening of the 21st and won't get out until the evening of January 7th. 

I know we shouldn't have been drinking that night and the decision to drive ourselves home was a really stupid one. My sister and I both caught hell from mom and dad, of course. I've lost my license. And my boyfriend dumped me because his dad found out about all this and forbid him from seeing me anymore.

I guess what I want to know is...did I do the right thing by taking the blame? I mean, my juvenile record will be sealed eventually whereas her record would've been permanent. Plus, she wouldn't have even gone to that party if I hadn't wanted to. And she only drank because I told her to loosen up for once. So, I feel like I'm more to blame. I'm certainly not innocent at any rate.

Also, I've never been in trouble with the law before and never been to a place like juvie. Can anyone tell me what I'm in for and any advice on how to make the 17 days go by smoothly?

Finally, I just want to say I'm sorry we ever drank and I hope whoever's reading this will learn from our mistakes.",07Dec2017,0

I have 2 questions. The first one is about whether my preference in guys is normal or not. My ideal (in my mind anyway) guy would be slightly older than me, slightly sadistic and homicidal. I know that sadism is called sadism for a reason. They don't care about anyone's emotions, but I'd like for a guy to only care about me and treat others like crap. I've always had a thing for guys who are ""bad"" or ""evil"". Right now I am slightly obsessed with the Columbine shooting and find Eric Harris very attractive. I used to have a major crush on him which would cause me to cry and 'mourn' him.

20,"Hello. I am an 18 year old student and I’ve been stressing out lately. I know college time doesn’t come without its stress, but I just would really like another mind to give it’s input.

So here’s the situation: My Mom works at a small, local, catholic college and her job grants me some perks. There is a small list of schools that are also Christian based that I could attend tuition free for the last 3 years of admission. I’ve checked some schools out on the list and nothing has really caught my eye except one that I checked out. I kinda liked the campus and to be honest, it had some pretty good academics. However, something about it just rubbed me the wrong way. It was just too small and too “friendly” for my tastes. Not that I want people to be mean, but it just felt like I was going to another High School.

Anyway, I looked at some other schools off the list and fell in love with two of them. They were both very large, flagship state schools that I thought were great. My parents weren’t as delighted however. They have both made it very clear that they don’t want me going to a large school, and should just stick with the small school I mentioned earlier due to it’s close campus and price. I have a pretty good chance (I believe) to get into all these schools, but it really just comes down to the matter of cost. Don’t get me wrong, I understand the rising epidemic in college debt among graduates and how badly it can cripple you later on in life, but in what cases does the value of an education outweigh the price?

Another issue they also raise in relation to college cost is my uncle. To put it short, my uncle attended Boston College, Columbia, and a school of journalism and has little to show for it career wise. I try to tell them that I am not going to 2 of the most expensive schools in the country, but they refuse to listen. They have their minds and hearts set on this small school and won’t budge. What should I do? I am extremely nervous about telling them how I feel, but I can’t help but think they have a point in a way.",07Dec2017,1

25,"So the more and more I think about it, the people who are remembered and loved the most are musicians (rappers/singers/maybe even producers in this day). Their music inspires millions and people from all across the world in the poorest of areas love them. They are more than their looks. I can't think of a single other career that gives that kind of fame and respect. People obsess over them because they (most) have talent that doesn't exist in anything else. Looks is the only other thing I can think of that people are just 'born with.' But having musical talent is so much better than that because it has so much meaning behind it. Musicians are timeless. Their lifestyle is amazing and the awe their talent inspires is unlike anything I have ever seen. 

When I was younger I always thought I would be famous (lord knows why). But at 24 years I'm starting to realise I have no talent. Given all that I discussed above I just feel the only thing I would want to be is a rapper/singer. But I didn't grow up around music and therefore have no musical bone in my body. A part of me wonders if music is something that happens to you without trying too much - like its either naturally a passion or a talent. I would never normally think about music as a career but I know a girl who went from a nobody to someone famous and I see how obsessed everyone is with her. And its not just about her or her looks its her talent. She truly has value because she has talent. 

I don't think I have explained this well. But I just don't know what to do. Do I try and do music because I will feel like I lack value without doing so? If not, how do I get over this horrible feeling of inadequacy and talentlessness? ",07Dec2017,1

She was diagnosed with a social emotional disorder at, I wanna say elementary school age. When she was as young as 7, it was a constant, huge yelling ordeal at night for to clean her room, these lasted at least 4 hours. She was a slob, clothes everywhere and such. And as years went on, it only got worse. Our bathroom was disgusting, while i tried to keep it clean, but to no real significant effect. We lived at my grandmothers for a very brief period before moving into our new house after a divorce, and I hate thinking back to it. Crumbs on the floor, this awful stench of what i can only describe as feet with a slight tinge of fish in it. I hated sharing a room with her, and towards the last week of us living there, she ruined my grandmas old matress she was using in  our room, permanently, because she got her period, all over it. This was also common occurence at our old house, dont know why she doesnt have the common decency to clean up after herself. Now that i share a bathroom with her, its absolute hell, our bathroom is in our basement, but she never runs the fan, so the steam rises into the ceiling and and cracks the paint. Her dust and hair are everywhere. She uses MY razors. We have silverfish in the bathroom because she lays down damp towels as carpet. Why towels? Because she got the actual bathroom rug wet, because she doesnt know how to dry off after she showers i guess. She wears smelly clothes. She has came down into the basement (where im playing xbox at night) in her underwear. She lets her stomach hang out with some trashy t shirt and sweat pants constantly, and she looks like a truck driver.  My father owns a mens clothing business, she goes there (we help him out roughly every other saturday) wearing a black dress with a stain (happened numerous times) bra strap hanging out, etc. A few years back, when she was 17 i want to say, a customer complained about how she smelled, to my dad. Needless to say he was completely ashamed of her. Socially, while she does have a very good heart, shes very immature.

She wore her ex's old sweater up until last year when i threw it out cause i was sick of looking at it, and this other boys trashy gray sweater with a hole in it and green marker drawings. Her friends are immature as well, she plays pokemon go with her 2 friends who honestly arent in the best of social situations, one of them lives on her own because she hates her mom, the other friend is just this girls cousin. She is seeing a therapist but we definitely know she lies to him, as when my mom said something to her she started saying, ""you cant talk to me like that."" Her car smells, she cannot wash dishes, she asks me if the dishes in the dishwasher are clean or not, yes im serious. We have sent her to live with my dad before and all is well, as my dad is more strict than my mom, but she comes home a month later because shes gotta get something.

37,"I praise the people who post on here with their issues. I've spent a long while trying to articulate something that isn't s**t or 2000 words long. I have retyped paragraphs over and over.

I'm in a situation where I know what I should have done and what needs to be done to start making things better. Although the things I did do were not the right decisions and what I'm doing is nothing. 

I'm 20, I'm rationale yet emotional, I'm calm yet stressed, I'm smart yet stupid. This can go on and on, as I believe it can do for a lot of people seeking advice.

For hours, typing and deleting. 

I feel so lost but I know exactly where I am, if that makes any sense. Clearly, I'm seeking something, yet if I know what to do and what should have been done why am I here?

Its as though I'm drowning in this ocean of emotion caused by the situation, but have a tricky and hard ladder right in front of me, that I know I can climb to get out of the ocean but won't. 

All of this might make zero sense, I don't even know if advice can be given to this, so yeah thats that.   ",07Dec2017,1

I got transferred and we drifted apart.  5 years ago she showed up to my birthday party out of nowhere.  We made out...she stopped talking to me after that.

43,"Hello folks, please look at this hypothetical circumstance and tell me what you would do in this situation.

My father pays child support, which is available for full-time students in college until the age of 23 in certain states.  The school that I attended deals in terms, where the first term is half of a semester and the second term is the second half of the semester.  I did not know that I had to be full time to be eligible for child support, and I was tremendously unhappy at the school that I was attending, so I dropped my second term classes because I was in the process of transferring to another school where I would return to full time status.  Taking the second term's classes would have been a waste of time and resources as they would not have transferred to the college I was going to move to or apply to anything useful, even if they did.  During this time, my father contacted me requesting documentation that I was full time for his job to cover me under his insurance.  I will be considered full time in the following semester and I depend on child support and my wages to get through college and pay for tuition, books, and health-related costs.  This is the first time that I was not full time since the beginning of my college career and I did not know that it could have revoked something that helps me in college tremendously.  Can child support be discontinued for this semester and then start back up when I am full time again?  Is that something that can happen?  What should I do?

Again, hypothetical.  Just in case something like this were to happen in the future, or if one becomes unhappy at their current college and needs to go somewhere else to pursue their education.

Please give advice! Thank you.",07Dec2017,1
46,"I received a letter in the mail today that said that my partner was being unfaithful. It doesn't have a return address, it was all typed--even the address on the envelope, so I can't figure out who sent it. 

They have my address and know my partner's name, I feel like this person has to know me and him. We're pretty private people, we don't post information about our relationship or personal details on social media (we're both teachers, we don't really want students to have the ability to look up information about us). 

It's a serious accusation. I don't know how to address it or bring it up with him. I don't believe it, but it's making me wonder why someone would say something like this. None of my exes would be vindictive and do something like this. I don't think his would be--and even if they were, I don't know how they would have my address (we live in separate homes).

My mother is rather closed minded and believes that A) My post-high school path is somehow HER decision and not mine, and B) that University is the one and only correct path to getting a job based on whatever degree I get. Because of her initial reaction to my Community College plan, I feared what she’d do next and acted like I forgot the plan and now I’m playing this charade where I “Plan on going to university”. She is already signing me up for something soon that will cost $500 (Some Freshmen Orientation I think). I feel when I leave her after she sets me up with this place and pays these fees, only for me to go leave, she will try to track me down or in general try to ruin my life as best to her ability. I see I may have to either start a different charade, or tell her my true plans. She still has enough power to potentially fuck up my communication with these two friends and my birth father who transports me to them. Any ideas on how I may take this on?

63,"So im staying with my mom and when she talks shes very negative very psychologically abusive. I cant say anything without her chiming in telling me the 100 reasons why i did it wrong or 1000 things i could have done better. She also tries to manipulate me into being late for stuff, weird i know.

Anyways i would consider myself fairly attractive and girls hit on me more often then not. I try to stay out of my moms house as much as i can for my mental healths sake, but shes been rubbing off on me. 

Example: i tried to take my son to an indoor playground because it was raining. They close at 8 we were leaving at 6. As we're leaving out the door, my mom is ranting and raving about how i HAVE to feed my son before we go and blah blah blah. Then insists on buying us taco bell. Then forcefully insists on going to taco bell together. Then forcefully insisting on eatting inside. Then taking an hour to eat, but she doesnt want to go with us to the playground. Finally take her home shortly before they close. All while erroding my self-esteem abt how my hair is ugly i cant drive well. Im going to the wrong taco bell my music is too loud. Etc etc.etc

So me and my son went to the mall instead. This pretty russian girl was hitting on me, she was persistant too. I was very standoffish and negative thoughts were spewing out of me like  She doesnt like me. Theres no way we could connect, shes russian im not.

66,"So I met this girl back in the first week of June, (In case it's important I am a guy) we hung out and got along well. We were both moving really slow, I never told her my true feelings, but I wasn't really subtle either. After 3 months, we held hands and I put my arm around her once or twice, and near the end hugged her when I left her house. We saw each other almost once a week and she never told me she was uncomfortable with our limited physical contact. I had invited her to my homecoming and so she invited me to hers. (I was planning on telling her how I felt after the homecomings as not to screw anything up) They were back to back weeks, with her being first and mine the following week, both on Saturdays. The Monday between, she told me she only had platonic feelings, that she forced herself to go along to see if she would develop feelings, and never reciprocated my feelings.

However, I feel confused and feel like she is at least lying about the never having feelings for me part. When we first met, her friends chased me out before I could actually ask her to hang out, but I managed to get her number. She then texted me and asked to go mini golfing. I feel like if she really didn't have at least some interest in me she would not have done that. Especially since this was about an hour after we parted ways. (I should probably mention this was at a week-long program at a college to learn more about it and do engineering-related things, and these friends were friends she made there and not her everyday friends) Also I never perceived any negative reaction from holding hands, not a grimace or trying to pull her hand away.

Another reason I feel skeptical is that she has a twin sister who is gay. According to her, her mother took a while to adjust to that. Also, this girl got me a gift, a teddy bear. She then told me at a later date that it was her mom's idea. So I don't think it would be far-fetched to say her mom might have been encouraging the idea of a relationship between her daughter and I. Her mother was also very friendly to me. So I feel that her mother's pressure might have scared her off.

Now we are just friends, we text once in a while, but we are both busy with school, work, or extracurricular so they don't last long. Also, we are both bad at holding a conversation over text. For the first time since my homecoming, we are hanging out Saturday, as I wanted to do at least something to celebrate her recent birthday. (As you will find out below I have seen her in person since then, but to just talk not to actually hang out and do stuff.)

I am unsure if I should confront her about it, because I spoke with her three times before, once to clarify her position, because initially, I thought she said she was not ready and she meant we could become more at a later date, but I misunderstood her. In that same conversation I also asked what I did wrong, as I felt that she was interested me at one point. She said I did nothing wrong, but I feel I did. The second talk being that I was glad she did tell me instead of continuing to lead me on and that I support her decision and do not think any less of her. The last talk being that I was in a depressed mood, started thinking the worst and called her asking if she really wanted to be friends and just didn't cut off the relationship completely just to not completely break my heart. (I should mention the first two times I talked to her was in person in case that makes a difference. Also, these were not recently, they were about a month to a month and a half ago.) So I feel I hesitant about mentioning it, as we have talked three times before.

I am really at a loss. I have been turned down by girls before, but this once I just can't seem to get over. Am I just being a douche that won't take no for an answer? Or is my inkling that she is not telling me the full truth not just my pride getting in the way?",07Dec2017,1
68,"Good evening, I wish you're doing well.

I feel really confused. I'm in this relationship for more than 2 years now. Before it started I knew this person for almost 6 years, she was my best friend. She knew that I wanted to join the army for 5 years, it has been my dream since I was a kid and I'm getting older, so I was planning to join the forces.

When I started the relationship this person made me choose between that dream and being with her, I gave up on my dream and started the relationship, I was an idiot and I liked some photos of some friends on facebook, let's just said that they were not appropriate, she is a underwear model, this person got hurt and cheated on me with somebody else, she slept with some other guy and broke up with me, while that she talked to that person and me at the same time, until we got back together and months after I found out about what happened. I forgive her... but since that things got worst. She thought that I like everybody else but her, and she asked me to do really crazy things to prove myself, I had to report where I was and a what time I was at home, if the bus or metro was late and I got late at home she would attack me, I lost 3 job interviews in really good places because the persons that called me where women and she said not to go. A year passed in that situation. I gave up to all my friends, I gave up even to half my family in facebook because she said that they were friends with disturbing people.

After all that I realized how abusive the relationship was been, and how I gave up to many dreams and things that made me happy for her.

Right now she left to her parents, things were not okay, I tried to kill myself, and even then she accused me of being flirting with the doctor. 

She left to her house and I took away the password from my social media that I gave her and I told her how insane and surreal things were becoming, she said that I'm not ready for compromise and that I don't know what a mature relationship is.

I tried to tell her that I don't want her to have my passwords because is a symbol of all the control and pain that she put on me, she said that if I don't give her that I won't make her feel safe.

I also told her about going to the army again, at least for one year while she takes one year of university. She said no

She said that my dreams were not normal and that I should just focus on our dreams as a couple, I said that it will make me really unhappy not follow the things that I wanted to do with my life, and she said that it was compromise, I said to her okay to giving up on that dream again, but it made me felt horrible, I felt like I was being forced again, I gave her the password again after she attacked me all week for it, and now I don't know what to do.

The term was from may - aug and the rumours of governmenr work were true: it was relaxed and not alot of work. In fact i was so bored i would spend have my day learning how to code. That being said i completed all the work assigned to me and asked on several occasions for more work. I was resigned for part time for the fall semester. 

I am currently assisting on an important project with an older employee and contractor. I was gaining confidence  because i was finally grasping more difficult concepts and consitantly getting work.  My contract ends december 28 and i was informed i will not be rehired. My boss said he doesnt like hiring ppl part time as they're hard to track. Then i asked his boss if there are positions available and she said no, then told me i should be giving more feedback to my boss as to when i will be getting stuff done. He NEVER confronted me about this being an issue and when deadlines were set i reached them

The team i am on needs people as we're busy and i was already working part time so i feel i was pushed out for not being as smart as my coworkers (some are very smart and it would takr a fuck ton of training for me to reach their leve)l. Also they take pride in devoloping students so i feel it had something to do with me or my performance or just general knowledge. 

I've felt like shit because all my friends are excelling at their jobs and getting offers and promotions but i can't even keep an office job. 

I guess i just needed to rant and i need help on how to get over this. I'm not a confident person but i know I'm not dumb. I get good marks and i have friends its just i have a fear of falling behind and i hate feeling like i don't fit in. How can i move forward and be confident if i luck out and get a government job next work term?  

On a side not i felt like half the job was how you present yourself, like the employee who just got hired part time but has the same skills as me my boss likes because he is outgoing and fun. Also I'm not used to having a passive boss its hard to read what he wants and there was no real direction on what i should be doing and whether he likes certain things or not. This made me uneasy

I know I fucked up and skipped a lot even knowing this, but I'm just trying to figure out how many it was exactly so I can calculate my grade and what I'd need to do on the final to save it, provided it hasn't tanked my grade to an F, even though I don't think it's that bad, my grades in the course are really good otherwise.

























What should I email the professor so it doesn't offend him? I don't want him to think I'm looking for pity or something like that.

75,"Hi all, I'm 19(M) and a college freshman. I plan on asking out a girl I'm into, but here's the caveat - all of my previous relationships have never required me to ask the girl out. (It's coming back to haunt me, I know, but I can't change the past.)

This is the first time I'll ever be asking someone out ""on my own,"" so to speak.  I have absolutely no information about her that I didn't get myself. We haven't really talked that much, but we seem to get along well when we do(and have flirted every now and again) and we have the same kind of humor(sarcasm).

But anyway! I've made up my mind that I want to ask her out, even if the thought terrifies me. However, while I think I will be able to cope with being rejected(as well as one can be expected to), I need some advice for how to kind of wrap up the conversation from there. I like to think that I'm good at talking to people, but when it comes to asking someone out I'm... less than stellar.

I would really appreciate something that's not as simple as, say, ""that's too bad, see you around."" I'm not really the kind of person who can pull that off, and I feel like it's a kind of cold response. This is probably(stupidly) one of the hardest things I've ever decided to do, so any constructive advice would be a godsend right now. Thanks in advance!

76,"Hi Reddit,

So theres this girl I've been seeing/dating for a few months - I'd say things are pretty serious and we definitely like each other quite a bit.  We're both late 20s early 30s.

Well, she works in a Geography field and loves maps, so I thought it would be neat to find an old map of her hometown.  I ordered a print of the county she is from, as well as an 'insert' of the town (how it looked in 1850).

This was pretty cheap, maybe $20.  I wanted to get them framed, so I went to Michael's to check around and ended up spending almost 45 minutes personalizing and designing a frame with the chick there.  It looked really good....but was expensive.  Like just over $200 expensive for both.  I know its stupid to frame something that cheap, but its a quality print...

Now we both make decent money, but as I'm sitting here thinking about this I'm starting to worry her present to me is going to be the typical 50-100$ or so and she will be embarrassed regarding my gift.  But I don't have to let her know how much it was to frame.  I've thought about saying I got a great coupon or something like a buy one get one (ended up using 2 frames).


I've been thinking about just wrapping them and putting in my closet for a year or so and finding a new gift, but this is literally the 'perfect' gift so I know it would be appreciated.

I'm just here to ask you guys what I can do to be happier and move my life in a better direction.

Academically I am doing well enough. I was accepted into the University of Calgary for computer science with a high 80s average, and I was happy about that for a week or two, but I keep finding myself worried and almost shocked by the future that is fast-approaching. 

I am a track athlete but I have asthma and some other breathing problems which have been interfering with that + my track club nearly doubled in size and it isn't the same tight-knit group it used to be. The few guys there were some of my only consistently great friends who I would see and talk with often but it feels like I've lost that. 

At school I don't have many friends and I'm pretty introverted despite being pretty confident in myself. My last semester begins in February and I might see my counsellor to see if I can transfer to a different high school where I have some more friends to help bring my spirits up but other than that I find myself alone and pretty upset. I have really struggled mentally this semester but I'm afraid to tell anyone seriously about it because my parents are rarely home and I don't see them reacting very well.

86,"This happened after school yesterday, I’m a high school junior, several people including me were in a very large unsupervised room. 

Let’s call him S. S was working on schoolwork and I started doing some pretty stupid shit in the room. Inb4 I’m blaming myself. I was doing some objectively stupid shit (which doesn’t justify the violence) including lightly making fun of his group member (who I’m on a better basis with, and mutual playful insults are common) about the fact that their group was turning the project they were working on late. S doesn’t say anything to me. 

So S just fucking punches me. And again, and again. So I keep saying “S, what the fuck?” while laughing, and he yells “GET THE FUCK OUT.” 

So I say “You can’t just punch anyone you want you fucking animal.” And he says “You are the ONLY person in this room I want to punch.” 

Now I should want to attack him, but I just don’t. I just didn’t feel like attacking him at all, and it didn’t really cross my mind that I should return the favor. I just kinda stepped back with a huge smile on my face and left the room. After I left I regretted leaving and feel like I should have 

I really want to fight him now and keep replaying in my mind what I would do if that happened again, but I’m afraid I’ll never get such a justified position to do so ever again. 

Today at school I didn’t directly say anything to him. Despite not having any negative interactions with him for 2.5 years (true story) I no longer consider him an acquittance. I did not acknowledge his existence throughout the day, which was awkward because we sit next to each other in two classes. 

I feel ashamed for not fighting him when he repeatedly struck me and would gladly do so if I traveled back in time. I want to know how I should go about this going forward.

90,"Warning: Very long story ahead. Can't really shorten it because it's kind of messy.

So I am a young male and I don't really know what to do next with the situation I'm in, simply because I just haven't had enough experience yet. So, long story short I have been talking to this girl on and off for about 7 years now. We meet early on in high school through a mutual friend and really connected. She wanted a relationship at that time and me being young and inexperienced with that type of thing, I declined. We continued to be really good friends though (I thought anyway). She continued to hint at us getting together at some point as she cycled through boyfriends and as I stayed pretty much idle as far as girlfriends. She would get a boyfriend and would become distant because she has a bad habit of attracting controlling guys. When it was over we would pick up where we left off. This went on for about 4 years. Later on, after high school was over, we decided to be roommates and things took a weird turn. I realized, just from being around her a lot more I guess, that I really did like her and was a little bit older now and wanted to try a more serious relationship. We tried it and it ended up not working out for her as she felt that she had gotten rid of those feelings since I wouldn't act on them in previous years (friend zoned). It ended ugly and we both moved out and didn't talk for a year or year and half. Now, we are from a small town and there is really only one major job opportunity around here. I happened to start working there and moved into management there. One day I get a new employee for my crew and low and behold, its her current boyfriend. He kind of talked to me here and there, I'm guessing not really knowing who I am. I find out that they have been together since I moved out and she is pregnant. I take pitty on him and her because there will soon be a child involved and try to give him tips to work better and get him more hours and everything so he can support them. A couple of weeks later she texts me and breaks the silence. She starts off by saying thanks for helping her boyfriend out and explains that she's sorry for the way things turned out and wants to be friends again. I hesitantly agree and we start talking again, picking up again like we had done before. This goes on for a few months. Eventually, it came to the point where they were fighting and he moved back to his state and she is still here. I went over there a couple times to see her child and hang out with her. Her boyfriend found out I was over there, accused her of cheating and (I'm guessing) gave her the ultimatum, because shortly after, she blocked me again and I haven't heard from her since. So now, I'm guessing that eventually that relationship will come to an end too and she will message me again to start the cycle. That's what I need advice for, what do I say to her this time? I have dealt with this many times now and each time I lose my friend because she doesn't have the guts to stand up for herself and expects me to be friends with her every time after. Do I be friends with her again? Do I just say ""fuck you, don't talk to me again""? I'm stuck here.",07Dec2017,1

I'm just worried that even though it's been a lifelong dream, it's not worth chasing. The chances of me getting in are really small (it's harder to get into DVM than it is to get into MD), and even if I do get in, I'm going to have a life of paying off student loans (although I have been fortunate enough to get a nice scholarship, and government support). 

I have been wondering since pretty much week one of this term if it's worth it to continue here, or if I should quit uni now and get into something more worthwhile. If I can't get my DVM (doctor of veterinary medicine for those wondering), should I quit while I'm ahead and just go to college for a trade or engineering technology or something like that? From what I've heard a B.Sc. is pretty much useless these days, so I just feel like it's not worth it to keep going.

I was talking to my grandmother (on my father's side) and she says ""I've noticed your parents have been strained lately. I know why."" My grandma can be... rude. So I assumed she was just going to say something bad about my mom. Instead she says ""Don't tell anyone, but when you were little your dad had an affair... with a black woman!"" (My grandma is racist, I ignore it lol). This was... surprising. I saw no signs of this in my parents marriage. In fact I always compared other relationships to theirs, because it was so great! After such a long marriage they still love each other. They rarely fight, and seem to get along really well.

Later, sister A got into a fight with my (only) brother, and she punched him, despite him being 4 years younger than her. I believe she is twelve and my brother is 8. She also broke a doorframe, although it broken to an extent before. 

At some point, she seemed to done something to my mom. I do not have all of the details yet but after this, she couldn't breathe. Sister A repeatedly asked if she could call 911 but my mom said no. I decided to let my mom use one of my  inhalers, and she was able to breathe in a little bit, whether it was because of this or because she calmed down is something I'm not sure of. My mom admitted she may have just had a panic attack.

After hearing this, I was very mad at sister A, especially for keeping sister B up all night with the intention of doing so. I told her she was insane and that I would called the police if anything like this happened again. I know calling her insane wasn't a good move, I was very mad like I said. I told sister A to not sleep in the same room as them anymore and she agreed. 

Was my response a good or bad response? Should I honor my claims of calling the police If it gets as bad as this with my mom not being able to breathe and all? Or am I just overreacting?

I had an ex-girlfriend who hates me now, so she told a few people ""I had a penis"" that would get laughs and teasing which led to me dropping out of college. But it couldn't end there, these other girls kept messing with me till one day I beat the shit out of both of them, ruined their faces, even had them bleeding and etc. 

They were PISSED. So they said, ""since I was ""a man"" I can fight their boyfriends. Who were both huge guys around 6ft tall. And here I'm just like 5'3. So they were upset and I wasn't planning to fight, but I did talk a lot of shit, granted I was also keeping things between us.

After a little bit of back and forth one ran for me and I tried to run, but he caught me with ease. They pull me into the woods and start stripping me naked, I didn't scream because I was scared they'd hurt me, but I did beg them to stop. They didn't, just continued till they saw my dick, then said, ""You really do have one!"" Laughing at me. I played along and agreed and said yes it's true, I'm a transgender so please just don't hurt me. I apologized as well but they didn't care. They said I was still sorta hot so they wanted to fuck me anyway. And then here I am butt naked on the ground with a guy forcing me to so blow him and the other literally doing me anal.

Even worse my junk kept hitting against the ground which cannot be clean in any way. What really made me upset is when I started actually cumming and they laughed even more claiming I was enjoying it and from there to when they came inside of me, I could not stop the tears from coming out of my eyes.

I did report those two to the cops and they are indeed in jail for rape. But everyone is pissed at me now, they call me a fake liar who fucked these guys then lied and got them arrested.

Tom likes to write stories, very much enjoys writing stories, loves creating characters and complex plots and the artistry of storytelling. Tom can be a really good writer. 

Tom is also talented in business, closing deals, figuring out strategies.  Tom is tall, and muscular, and handsome and people instantly like him. He can talk people into loving his ideas and valuing what he has to say. Tom can be an amazing businessman. He figures he could turn his writing habit into a business, only for the mean time to make a few thousand dollars. After that he would join other, more bigger business and increase his wealth, he would start bigger companies himself and take himself to great heights in the corporate world. This makes Tom VERY happy, he loves the idea of being his own boss and making money and having his own company. 

But here's what Tom is scared of. To make money with his writing, he believes he has to really dive deep into the art of writing, and if he does that, he believes that he will fall in love with it. And if he falls in love with it, he would have a hard time leaving it behind to start other businesses. But, Tom knows deep down that business is where his true passion lies and that is what he wants to do and achieve in his life.


So, the problem comes down to this-- if following your passion means entangling yourself with another passion and then killing it, what should you do? Make the hard call and kill it? Or abandon your original passion and never leave the second one?

I facebooked a girl I had met and we talked pretty occasionally on facebook messenger. After a few months she messaged me randomly telling me something that happened at work (she's a teacher). So we chatted a little. At the end of the conversation I suggested we get lunch one weekend. She said yes and gave me her number. I didn't even ask for it she just gave it to me. So that was a surprise. 

So I started texting her. I eventually asked her to lunch on a specific day and she said yes. That day rolled around and she messaged me about 1.5 hours before saying she was sick, and she was sorry but she wanted to reschedule. I definitely believe that she was sick.

So two weeks later I was going to ask her again to lunch, but I a post in my news feed on facebook that she was sick again. So I didn't even ask. 

The following weekend I texted her just to chat. I was eventually going to ask her out again, but during our convo she mentioned she was going out of town for a training. 

Finally the following weekend we made plans for lunch that actually went though.

She met me at the restaurant. We had a really good conversation, and I thought the date went great. She did too apparently because about an hour later she texted me saying she had a great time and that we should do something again soon. 

For at least the next three weekends after that she was always having something to do. But like they weren't excuses or anything. I know she was actually doing these things. Like one weekend it was her daughter's birthday and the other two were work functions.

So at this point I thought maybe I could attempt to try and see her during the week instead of on the weekend. So I just did the simplest thing I could think of and asked if she wanted to go the movies. I typically hate movie dates, but at this point I was like fuck it I really just want to see her. Again she was really busy that week with a perfectly acceptable excuse. This time it was a project for the club she heads at her school and the competition was that weekend. 

So the next week I asked if she wanted to get drinks after work on Friday. She said she would have loved to but it was a playoff home game at her daughter's school and her daughter is in the band so she was going to watch her. Again a perfectly acceptable reason. 

So at that point I just decided to cool it. I'm just trying to figure out if she's interested or not. I've still been talking to her over text but I haven't asked her to do anything. 

Like I know it's more appropriate for the guy to ask a girl on dates but like I feel like if she was really interested she might ask me if I wanted to do stuff when she's free rather then me constantly asking. 

I'm sure the obvious answer here is that she just isn't interested, but it's the things like texting me after the lunch date saying we should do something again, and always saying ""maybe next weekend"" when she wasn't free the weekend I asked her out. I feel like someone who isn't interested wouldn't say those things. 

So what do you guys think. I really like this girl, so I really don't care if things keep going like this, but I just don't want to be wasting my time if she's not interested. ",07Dec2017,1
119,"Heres the backstory, I went to a buffet today and I had a regular breakfast but when I left I accidentally took a ceramic cup with me.. Keep in mind that the buffet is on my schools campus, so I only realized that I had the cup when I got to class. While I got my stuff out for class, someone knocked the cup off the table and into the ground. So my chances of returning it are gone. What should I do? I've racked up a total of three choices: come clean, hope there was no video of me leaving with a cup, or face a theft charge at worse. Also, I'm a highschooler under 18 so I'm not sure what the punishment could be and I'm hoping its not anything with the law. I want a clean record and this was a fuck up.",07Dec2017,0
120,"I have almost no way of shortening this but will try. I am the middle of 3 brothers, no sisters. Each is separated by many years and were treated very differently growing up. Eldest was very typical (was into the same things as our father - common sports and school activities), I was thankfully odd (uncommon sports and member of the less-popular school activities), youngest was also different but this time very academic. Father was older and for the most part dying as the youngest was coming up. Died prior to HS graduation.

My father and I rarely connected though he did try pretty mightily to show an interest in my interests. I didn't know until later that 1) I struggle with depression, 2) I probably have since I was in my teens, and 3) it runs in my family (mother's side). I am the only one of the brothers that has depression, or at least is open about it (one of those I am 99% sure I would know by now).

I am guessing that part of my uncontrolled crying when I was younger was a part of my depression. In any regard I was prone to a good cry, and quite often. Usually associated with darker thoughts and such but not exactly here to vent about that - just trying to give any needed back story.

Father hated the crying. To get me to stop he would hit me. Different than the beatings that Evil Dads would dole out on after-school specials, but punches nonetheless (if important I would call them weak-arm punches, straight jabs without rearing back).

In one of those dumb but good epiphany moments I started to connect this to some of my own destructive behavior, hopefully in ways that fix it. But in the course of that big think I started to think of something that really has me at a loss of words or sleep.. as such I am asking for advice.

I have been assuming that my father only hit me. Older Bro speaks glowingly of father and to all memories had a pretty good to great relationship with our father. Younger Bro was sadly not really raised by our father but by his mother, as father's health was in bad shape. I feel very confident, but not 100%, that it was just me that sparked ire in him. But, how can I ask if my brothers are OK without destroying the image or idea of the Good Dad in their own memories?

Truth seems wisest but only slightly. I don't know if I should ask if they were hurt by him or not. I feel I could do more damage by bringing it up and not.

A couple of complications.

Younger Bro is technically a half brother, though it has never been an issue. Its just that an option of talking to Mom would involve 2 not 1. Both mothers are living.

Also, my father's generation of brothers feuded. As in can't-make-this-up feuded. Shooting guns next to your bedroom window level feuding. This odd and random division has never even slightly happened between my brothers and I. I would like to avoid this.

Also, also, I feel my mother ought to know. Not thrilled about telling her, I do 'know' that she would have never thought the abuse possible. Probably destroy her too, but maybe I am required to be honest there too.

It is killing me, eating me alive or whatnot that my brothers could have been hurt too. But if I am correct that it was just me, I could hurt them myself. Yes, it was my father that chose to do this, but the ball is in my court, so to speak.

Anyway, advice?

121,"I am having multiple problems in my personal life, that somehow don't seem to be affecting my professional life.

I started to lose weight about 10 years ago and lost about 80 pounds, which was ideal.  I kept the weight off in spite of several bouts with depression.

123,"Surely, some of you have found yourself passionate about a topic so much that you commit yourself massively to do something related to it. This could be a physical project, a research project, a design project, or anything else at all. For some of you who have started large projects personally, you have also found yourself changing the path of the project. Maybe you wanted to build it *this way*, but that didn't work, so then you try to build it *that way*, and so forth. The overall goal of the project doesn't necessarily change, but it might even become completely unrecognizable from the initial plans.

Anyway, I'm in a stagnant situation. I've worked on this project forever, and I'm losing my vision for it. I'm struggling ahead, but I feel like I've lost the energy that I once had for it.

125,"I'm a 21 year old guy that has all the answers on how to create a more improved and productive version of my current life. When I was young, I had a 'go with the flow' attitude with life. I didn't really disagree with anything that was suggested or forced upon me, and simply accepted whatever was put in front of me. This could have been sports, activities, studies, foods, etc. Because of this, I feel that I grew up never truly understanding or knowing who I was or what I wanted for myself. When I began college, I even followed the suggestion of family and friends who told me I should go into Computer Science because I was always on the computer anyway, and the field was good for money.

 &amp;nbsp;

At 19, I finally began the process of self reflection and understanding. I pursued my interests, or rather, pursued the understanding of what I was interested in, what I liked, enjoyed for myself. I was able to come to the conclusion that I really loved Psychology and the study of it. Understanding behaviors and what causes them. Understanding feelings and emotions and how to control them better so they don't control you. A pursuit of self-love and self-understanding, as well as self improvement and development through things like exercise, diet, knowledge growth. For the first time in my life, I knew what I wanted future me to look like and had a basic, though broad idea of what I wanted for myself.

 &amp;nbsp;

I spent 19-21 basically consuming all the knowledge I could find that could help me improve various aspects of my life. As I said above, I know that I want the following things for myself:

- **Financial Stability and Understanding** (I studied the many aspects of income active/passive and how to use both)
- Dietary Health (I studied the effects of sugar, benefits of healthier foods, diet plans, super foods, etc)
- **Physical Health** (Different aspects of physique building, workout plans, different tactics, forms of exercise like weightlifting/calisthenics/cardio and the benefits of them)
- **Mental Health** (Meditation, reading, pursuing personal enjoyments to avoid depression, etc)
- **Emotional Health** (Self love, self acceptance, habit forming/breaking tactics, self development and improvement, etc)

 &amp;nbsp;

Over the years, I've amassed all this knowledge on how to improve myself in these aspects of my life, and for those areas that lack more depth, I know where to start in order to gain more knowledge. My issue now is that while I feel I've made a huge step forward in figuring out what I want for myself generally, I'm now stuck between that space of holding all the knowledge of what I need to do and transferring it all into action. I find myself procrastinating on taking the actions I know I should be doing for myself to improve. I find that sometimes I get distracted easily when I try to force myself towards these changes. And most concerning, I feel that I've procrastinated and stayed still for so long, I'm now addicted to the search for knowledge on how to change myself, without actually taking the action necessary to implement what I learn. There are days where I'll literally spend the entire day watching YouTube videos on how to invest and grow your wealth. How to start eating healthier, how to begin meditating, how to set up a schedule for yourself, how to wake up early, etc, etc. I'll watch or read about all these things, and spend the entire day doing this, instead of actually doing the shit, and by the end of the day, it's like I'm satisfied with just knowing how to change, but can't be bothered to take action. Like my brain tells me, ""You've had a productive day because you learned how to improve yourself. Good job!"". Only to be sitting around 2 weeks later realizing that I still haven't done anything yet.

 &amp;nbsp;

I apologize for this post being so long, I intended for it to be short and to the point, but I really wanted to express what it is I feel like I'm going through in order to get a detailed response from you guys. I'm genuinely curious in knowing if any of you went through a similar situation in always knowing how to improve, but not taking action, and if you were able to break free from it and finally act, how? What was the ""No more planning/thinking/preparing, time to act"" moment or tactic(s) you used?

 &amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** - I'm a 21 year old guy who spent the last 3 years reading articles, watching YouTube videos and reading self help books on how to improve various aspects of his life. Through those years, I've learned a lot about myself, and even more on how to change, and what to do TO change. However, I never act, I just seem to search for more knowledge without actually being disciplined enough to act on what I learn, even though I know what I'm learning is beneficial, and if I simply put what I learn into action, I'll reach my goals and desires. Anyone that has struggled with something like this, how did you finally act instead of just soaking up knowledge and never using it?

131,"I'm going to say straight up that our parents (both late 40s) don't have their shit together, and they haven't since before my brother and sister (12F) were born. They got a divorce 8 years ago and have been in a constant war since then.

One of their problems is our mom is a serial cheater. Every relationship she has ends with cheating on the man until he finds out, and she obviously did that to our dad too. Both my sister and brother could be from different dads, but it's most obvious with my brother. Both our mom and dad are white, and my brother looks like he's black.

He gets really dark in the summer and has fuzzy hair like a black person. You'd have to be an idiot to deny it, but that's exactly what both of our parents do. My brother's friends tell him he's adopted, and he gets in trouble for repeating that. I know in a couple years when they learn about where babies come from, they'll change that story to, ""Your mom is a s**t,"" and he will get bullied to death for it. We live in a mostly white small town where every adult already knows she is a cheater. It's only a matter of time.

My brother is also not stupid and knows he looks different from our dad. He asks me if he looks black. (He also gets in trouble for saying that.) Right now he likes how he looks because he looks up to black people on Youtube who he likes, but I'm worried that's also going to change if he starts getting bullied.

I feel like I should talk to him about what's going on and tell him the truth before he hears it from his friends. Our parents definitely won't do it. At 20, I've still never gotten ""the talk"" from either of them and had to look up all that stuff on my own. When my sister (12F) had her period, our mom just said, ""Nobody wants to hear about your ass or privates,"" and my sister was embarrassed by going to the school nurse about it. There's no way either of them will talk to my brother about something that reflects badly on them especially if it's related to sex.

Speaking of my sister, I think I should talk to her about our brother too. Judging by appearance alone, it's possible our dad is her father, but they look nothing alike. Our dad hates her and treats her like garbage, so maybe it would make her happy to know he might not be her father. I know I would be if he weren't mine. I don't know if what he does is considered child abuse, he makes mean sexist comments to her about her appearance and punishes her much more harshly than he does to our brother for the same thing. I've gotten in fights with him over that among other things, and nothing ever changes.

I feel like both of our parents are a lost cause. They are old with ingrained habits, and arguing with them solves nothing. I visit home about every other weekend, and I take my siblings places where it's just us and we have a chance to talk. First of all, what age is best for them to understand these topics? Secondly, how should I go about bringing it up?

**TL;DR** My brother's father is obviously not our dad, and he's getting close to the age where he's going to learn that fact from his friends at school, leading to bullying. How should I talk to him about it?",07Dec2017,2

Background: I’m an incredibly shy and anxious person (25/F). I hate going out in public because I’m sure I’m somehow going to embarrass myself. I’m overweight, so I constantly feel like I’m in the way of other people and inconveniencing them by making them look at me. I try to make myself as small and unnoticeable as possible. I feel like I’ll be someone’s second choice to fall in love with because their first choice (who was fit) wasn’t available. When I try to tell myself that I have a distorted opinion of my body and that whoever I end up with should love me for who I am rather than what I look like, I feel like I’m only deluding myself and I should just settle for whoever I can get, rather than people I’m actually interested in romantically. 

I go to therapy for my issues and I take medicine for my anxiety, but neither seems to be doing much for my social anxiety or self-esteem. I’m working on losing weight and have dropped about 7-8 lbs. in a few months, so it’s slow going, but I’m getting there. I have a nice face and pretty hair, and I know my personality is amazing once I’m comfortable enough around people to show it, so at least I’ve got that going for me. 


The situation: I literally have no friends that I hang out with who aren’t family. I mean literally as in the actual definition of the word. I have Facebook friends and gaming friends that I talk to and message, but the only person I go out and have fun with is my mom (I know that sounds even worse, but she’s an absolute riot and would be my best friend even if I hung out with hundreds of people). So, knowing that not having any friends other than my mom isn’t good for me, I decided to download the Meetup app and join a few groups near me. I joined one I was interested in and rsvp’ed to a an “ugly Christmas sweater bar crawl” they’re hosting this Saturday, even though I don’t drink in public. No one I know is going to be there and I’ve never been to the bars before. I desperately want to make new friends and maybe even find someone to date, but this is completely foreign territory for me and I’m freaking out. 

My questions are: how do I get past my fear of embarrassing myself, how do I go about making friends and introducing myself, how do I not do what I always do (stay in the background not talking to anybody, then leaving disappointed because  I didn’t say a word to anyone), and how can I gain confidence - or at least pretend like I have it?

Billy - Billy is an idiot. I could describe why, but I don't feel like typing it out. He's my friend, but an idiot all the same. 28

Bob - Bob is guy I met through Billy. We play games online together and have hung out a few times. He's actually a generally good person. 28

Bernice - She's a coworker and friend. She went through a very abusive relationship for a long time before finally leaving. She then enters another toxic relationship which she has ended just a week ago. 18

The situation is that Billy is trying to hook Bernice up with Bob. I have a complete objection to this and it's not secret feelings. She has, on numerous occasions, talked about how she doesn't really know who she is because of the long abusive relationship. She jumps into another relationship where the dude isn't abusive, yet, but started being invasive with her privacy and turned into a creepy stalker immediately after the breakup.

Now, I'm not saying that Bob is unfit to be a good boyfriend. I'm saying that maybe, instead of jumping into another relationship immediately, she takes some time for herself. I know how this will all end. I've been Bob before and I've seen/heard about situations like this. They're all generally the same.

Normally my stance is ""Do whatever you want, I don't care."" But these are two people that I don't dislike. I've tried to help Bernice before with advice and I'd have had better luck convincing a rock to float. That's expected because she's young, though no less frustrating. Billy is an idiot who won't listen to logic and reason.

I haven't made my opinion known to anyone since Billy proudly announced his plan. Bernice was there and she seemed skeptical, but was arranging something anyway. Do I have a responsibility as their friend to at least make my objection known and why? It would feel the right thing to do so they could at least make an informed decision. Bob is more receptive to my logic and reasoning than the other two. Do I talk to him on the side and present my argument? I get the feeling Bob isn't working with the full deck as I don't know how much about her Billy would have told him, or thought to tell him. All he may know is that Billy has a coworker he should date. I've considered telling everyone that they're being dumb and that when it blows up, I'm laying down I told you so's.

150,"Hello, 

I am 13w pregnant and I need some serious advice... 

The father (F) is a man I love and have been with for a year and a half. Our contraception failed, we were not trying to conceive. Yet I have been desiring a child for several years and had just recently decided that I should keep building my life (financially, emotionnally...) in order to be able to have a child one day, with F or, if he didn't want to, with someone else... I had not ruled the possibility of staying with F and not having a child, however.

F, on the other hand, does not want to have a child, not now, not before, not in the future. This was not clear to me before I got pregnant. From our current discussions, it seems that we didn't communicate clearly on this. Perhaps I was blind because of my desire for a child. Perhaps his speech was not as adamant before.

When I learned that I was pregnant, my instinctive reaction was sheer joy and excitement. I texted F without really thinking. In the following discussions things were unclear. He said he didn't want to have a child but that ultimately it was my decision to make and that he would stand by me. I said I desired to have the baby but couldn't imagine myself as a single mother, and that aborting was something I had always thought I would never do but that, given how he felt, I was willing to give it some thoughts (which I did and rejected quite fast). From then I decided we should keep the baby... 

Weeks went on, we were both feeling awful. He felt very anxious and sure he didn't want to have a baby, was not up to it. As for me, aside from being very sick and weak from the pregnancy, I felt terrible about his feelings. I could sometimes feel the initial joy of being pregnant, although it seemed to vanish weeks after weeks. He, at times, seemed to come to terms with it. 

Now our last conversation was dramatic. He told me terrible things about me (immature, selfish, fucked up), that he didn't want us to move together, that I was looking for any father (not him in particular), that I wanted to change everything he was... He blamed me for not aborting and was bitter at the fact that I had chosen everything and he had chosen nothing, except for having sex with me the wrong day. And he may be right.

So I ended up giving him the choice (I can still get an abortion in a bordering country...) and he wants me to abort. So there we are. 

Except the more I think about it, the more I know that I prefer killing myself (and the foetus) than aborting. As for taking care of this child alone, I just don't think I could do it. I already feel like I've been a terrible mother to this unborn child and that I would only add to his misery. 

I just don't know what to do... Any advice could be helpful. Thank you. ",07Dec2017,1

154,"The Background: I'm a post-40 male with a family. A person, who called themselves a friend, has been telling an awful lot of lies about people (some little, some pretty big). I knew he was a bit of bullshitter, so I'd mostly just partition off what was being said and pretty much ignore it, figuring that I was just a bit of a sounding board for his crap.

&amp;nbsp;

The Catalyst: Recently, however, one of the things that had been said to me I wanted to check on (that Person A had had a massive argument with Person B and that had caused Situation X), so I asked a friend of Person A, who knew nothing about it, and then I asked Person A themselves, who was pretty apoplectic about it. Long story short, the bullshitter, who was confronted by Person A, told Person A that he'd been told the story (about the argument) by me and Person A believed him (if you lie a lot, I guess you get good at it) and ripped into me about that and various other things that I hadn't done.

&amp;nbsp;

The Checking Stage: Based on what I was told that I'd done by Person A, I sent some e-mails to people whose names were mentioned who hadn't spoken to me for a while and discovered that they'd been told all sorts of crap about me and things I'd said (which I definitively didn't). While I now defended myself, it was pretty pointless, the damage had already been done a while back and me arguing back against it now was shrugged off (they'd moved on from it, and didn't care to talk about it anymore - I guess I'd be the same).

The Now: I've seem to have lost friends, I'm losing more friends (not close friends, but the people that you interact with quite regularly), people have actually shouted stuff out to me about the lies (that were spread by the bullshitter that he's pinning on me) while my children are present. On the plus side, some people are already well aware of the bullshitter and tell me not to worry about it, it'll blow over. But as an introvert, and pretty emotionally fragile, I'm having a very hard time dealing with it.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyone got any advice on the best ways to cope? (As a note, revenge help isn't really useful to me, I'm just not that kind of person). Thanks.

155,"I met this girl from work and we’ve both been talking. We now have been in a relationship together for 2 months. It’s still early I know, but I know it won’t last longer if I’m still being stupid. 

She has an eating disorder and purges. She has some weeks where she is good and others where she is really bad. When it gets bad, I don’t know what to say or what to do. I’ve never had to deal with something like this before. The one thing I always manage to say is “it won’t last forever” or something really idiotic. I don’t know what to say. I always freeze up when she starts talking about how she has starved herself and that’s she’s crying because she had a tiny chocolate. She goes councilling but the guy barely sees her.

What do I say in times like these? What can I do as her boyfriend to show her that I actually love her and want to support her? What should I do?",07Dec2017,2

Then the third semester some people talking shit about me coupled with my anxiety and weird antic left me almost friendless.

That's something I've never done, and this the kind of fun I missed out on in school too due to my social anxiety. There's not a lot of people that like to do the same things as me in this college and it kills me that I might be missing out on the usual college experience again, after the same thing happened in school.

160,"Two days ago we got the call that my wife’s mom was found passed away in her home. My wife and her mother hadn’t been speaking for about a year. Mom, divorced, in her 70s, had a substance abuse problem with alcohol and painkillers. My wife spent the previous year trying to get her the help only to have her constantly go back home, alone to continue the behavior and finally had to put her foot down and tell her if she doesn’t want help, she won’t be around anymore. 

So we get the call and it’s apparent mom has been dead for a long time. We’re talking months. I don’t think there’s going to be any toxicology reports or a time of death given, but from what we’ve gathered it could have been up to half a year.

I’m doing my best to be there for my wife, but I can’t imagine the guilt she’s feeling. She’s a pretty sensitive woman and while she’s not exactly freaking out, I know this is probably the hardest thing she’s ever been through. I’m a pretty decent guy and I’m doing my best to be understanding supportive and attentive, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice for a husband who is trying to help in this situation.

I ended up finding a receptionist job and thought the hours were good (9-5 or 12-6) and the pay was about $.40 more than what I was making. The first couple of weeks were nice because it was really relaxing and a good change. I have my own desk, can eat whenever I’d like and there’s basically no dress code. 

My duties are handling cash, answering phones and on occasion selling things. Our cash register system is very confusing, you don’t have any buttons that you press to tell the computer what to do next, you have to enter in a code to tell it what to do. We have around 150 codes we have to memorize and it’s really difficult. Like if I wanted to cash someone out I would have to enter 2-2 UI**** enter enter ML enter ML.

173,"TL;dr Girl in multiple classes and study groups is incredibly annoying and clingy, to the point where I can't stand being around her. What is the best way for me to cut ties?

I recently became friends with a girl in some of my college classes. she was friends with some of my close friends so I figured she was a decent person. Long story short I'm the only person from my friend group who still consistently talks to her. Since we have multiple classes together we are in study groups together. I cannot stand being around her anymore.

She betrayed my trust by ratting me out to my roommate. He fell asleep in the living room so I sent her a pic of him with a joke as the caption and she told him, which understandably made him upset. She also is impossible to talk to, she commandeers all conversations and forces the topic to be about what she wants. This usually means complaining about something. I'm all for talking shit and venting, but every conversation is about this now. This girl is also a one upper, I say I'm tired because I was up till 3:00 she says she was up till 4:00. If I got 1 hour she got none. She also is incredibly clingy, constantly blowing up my phone with texts, snapchats, and facebook messages. 

Recently an event took place which was the last straw for me. We were studying on the second floor in the library on my college's campus and I had to print something out so I told her I would be back. As I went to go print I went to visit some friends in a group study room. Within five minutes she had tracked me down through Snapchat, found the room, and swung the door open asking where I had been.

176,"I’m stuck in a rut. Right now my whole family is stressed and I’m frustrated with my life. I’m in high school still but I feel like giving up on everything. 

First,
I’ve been distant from a good friend because all she does is spend time with her bf and I get jealous because i can never see her and i don’t see my bf. (I know i shouldn’t be jealous) She also isolated herself from everyone whenever he bf is around and actually left me to go out with him when i was hanging out with her. I tried to talk to her about it but i dont see her so i had my other friend talk to her. It went kinda bad and now she won’t talk to me. I feel like i value the friendship more but I still want to try to fix our friendship. It’s wrong for me to be jealous but I wanted to try and work stuff out. 

Second,
My dads been frustrated with his job and wants to move. I have one more year of high school and terrible at making new friends, I feel like if we move I’ll be even more depressed than i am now and just quit school. I understand it’ll be better for him though. He also doesn’t like my bf and they refuse for me to see him. My dad and i used to be close but now we’re distant because of this, I want to ask him to give my bf one more chance but I feel like he just doesn’t want him to exist. It hurts knowing that if I leave my bf he’ll be 10x happier. 

Finally,
I don’t see my bf. I get frustrated because i see couples in the hallway and stuff but I don’t see him. I don’t have many friends but the ones i do work and i can’t see him so i don’t go out at all. I dread going to school because i want to avoid all this.

179,"TL;DR: Can't seem to find a ""calling"" in life, not ""feeling"" depressed or suicidal but just feels meaningless.

Long post:
Hi everyone, I'm a late-20s individual living in a ""fast-paced"" Southeast Asian country (I state this because if the reader has an idea of where this is, it might help with context). So anyway, I went abroad for college and came back home as staying is prohibitively difficult due to demand and not for my course of study (psychology). Now, I did good at school and have a fantastic... wall decoration, that kinda just hints ""did above average"". But I don't mention this for pride, I say so because finding a job in the ""field"" has been trying. 

I came back and was offered a job not long after, barely had time to unpack. The job was alright, in fact it was in non-profit welfare home environment, but the hours were torture to say the least. I got in around 7 in the morning, left the office around 12 midnight, give or take. Paperwork was a killer. Not that I didn't want to give it my all, but day in day out, the boss was down our collective necks much like an army sergeant, telling us how bad we were at our job and if we didn't like it we should just up and quit. He did this, several times per month. The place has one hell of a turnover anyway, staff cutting themselves loose around the 4 months mark on a regular basis that prior to me joining, they had about 8 or so staff having done so over the past year.

I left though, before my ""trial"" period was up (6 months). I felt that this job was grinding me down and how I was being treated started to eat into how I'd treat other people, I saw what I did was wrong, being quite callous and uncaring towards people under my charge (I tried so hard to make up for it in the last couple months prior to leaving, I learned to talk with them, get to know them and it did work, I won't lie, it has left a lasting impression that I can and will do better, for others and for myself).

However, since I left, I started searching for another job (I did land one, as a commis chef with zero experience which was much to the frustration of the owner/head chef but he was a good, patient and fair superior (more than anyone could ask for, and I was grateful) and I tried my best but I left soon after because I felt I couldn't keep up and would never get good fast enough for them to want to keep me. Being a chef wasn't a ""dream job"" for me, as I never wanted to wear the whites, but I loved to cook. It is a hobby, a thing I can't put down and something that I find gives me direction, like there are objective ways to ""get good"", much like a game. I enjoy jobs like that, things that have some measurable element of improvement (not for comparison, mind you, like so I know that I am getting better at something, it's for me).

Now, I'm finding it terribly hard to find a job or career. I've posted my resume just all over the place. Career sites report that my resume gets received but rarely read, so I'm fine with that, it's probably not my papers, but the demand. That and my first job above is one of the largest in the non-profit sector in this country, leaving on ""fair"" terms means I'm unwilling to reapply for other positions in the same organisation, they'll get reviewed by the same end-person, my boss' superiors, who I can only imagine, having signed off on my resignation, don't think too highly of me.

I have no idea what I'm doing anymore and I'm not even sure if this is what I want to do. Psychology for me, was fun, it was good, but I have no aspirations to be a registered psychologist as it would take more time and pile more debt on from fees. I am raring to go though, I know what I can do to be better but I don't know where to look for opportunities, career sites were my option and that didn't seem to work out too well.

Though, if I had to really sit down and identify my fault here, I would think a problem with me would be a fear of rejection of some kind. Trying to bail on my own terms before it goes south and out of my control zone. I don't have any specific idea what I'd expect from advice though, direction? Purpose? But I'm open to anything, just any advice in any direction is just fine.

After 4 years of working as a student worker, I graduated the university in 2016 with a degree in Family Studies with a minor in Sociology. I was hired on as a temp in the same department because I couldn't find a job yet.

The temp job consisted of mainly paperwork, answering the phone, scheduling appointments for our advisor, etc. Basically an office assistant. Then they told me they were 'creating a position for me' (basically an assistant to our advisor - more paperwork) and wanted me to stay on permanently. I considered it but ultimately said no.

I kept looking in my field but couldn't find anything. I had been actively looking for jobs, interviewing and not getting the jobs, for about a year. So I decided to stay on as a temp for the time being. Then the department told me they wanted me to interview for the permanent position. I didn't have any other options, so I interviewed and got the position.

So, the problem is I don't really like the work and I feel like I'm stuck. I didn't have any other real options and took the job because I still need to pay student loans and eat.

196, I’m with my current girlfriend right now who is three months pregnant and I’m blessed that I’m going to have the privilege to bring someone into this world but I also haven’t gotten over my ex we did break up a year ago but we were going out and living together for almost 4 years and I don’t know how to let my past go because I do really love her and do want to be with her ............yes she is still single and yes we still talk but she hates the fact that I’m in a relationship telling her that I miss her but  I haven’t told her that the girl I’m with now is expecting a baby and I know once I tell her that I’ll lose her forever… Should I just let my Pasco buffet for who I truly love not trying to be a cornball or anything but my ex was legit wasn’t just any other girl or any GF she was my best friend ,07Dec2017,2
197,"I've been in a relationship almost 2 years now and have been thinking about ending it. I'm the type of person who blames themselves for everything and tries to fix myself first but it's just getting worse. Are these good reasons to leave? 

1. They're a super romantic person and I'm the exact opposite. I've tried to understand that that's how they express themselves in a relationship but I just hate all the traditional 'romantic things'. Now they feel like I've taken something away from them for not liking flowers and chocolates. 

2. Their friends have been very excluding/inconsiderate of me when I've hung out with them. I don't want to hang out as a group at all anymore. I've been told that they're trying to be my friend and I should give them a chance but it's been multiple times I've felt pretty burned by them and my parter is getting fed up I won't budge here. 

3. We have next to nothing in common. We both like video games and that's about it. Not even the same kind of games. At first it we had really fun conversations about our interests but now it's actually killing me that we can't find anything to do or talk about together. 

4. I haven't really laughed or had any fun in the past year. I think this mostly has to do the the previous reason but they literally never make me laugh. My sense of humor just does not line up with theirs.

5. I feel like I can't be myself at all. All my jokes seem to go ""too far"", everything I say gets taken the wrong way, and it's like I have to rationalize everything I say, do, and feel. When I'm with my friends it's like this weight is lifted from me and I don't have to be anxious or hesitant to say anything. It's getting harder to ignore. 

6. I get no comfort from this person when I'm upset. This is the absolute worst for me. It's broken me to the point that I know I can't go to this person to vent about anything. They take things very personally and blame themselves if I complain about something or they just ignore me because they think they make it worse. It doesn't even have to be about them. I can literally never vent about work, friends, what have you. They just look at me like I'm a time bomb over the tiniest shit. I can't take it anymore. Plus they never come to me with what's bothering them or just to talk about shit. When I can see they're obviously bothered by something I try and ask what's wrong but get a ""nothing I'm fine"" then they tell me I'm bothering them when I try keep trying. It tears me apart that I can't be the person they go to for support. 

This has all been sitting on my chest and I needed to type it all out. One of my friends offered to let me live with them and I've been considering taking up their offer. I've brought all of this up to my parter before and things don't seem to be changing. I've been trying to take more time for myself too and that hasn't fixed anything either. ",07Dec2017,2

203,"I know the logical answer seems to be ""no"", but the circumstances are strange. I was working as Quality Assurance at a home insurance company for 2 years 3 months. After working on a few different ""teams"" for several months (different insurance companies mainly) I was transferred back to My main team. I was a little slow getting used to those reports again, and my error rate dipped a little due to different companies functioning differently. I was told in early October that I had to get my speed up and my error rate down, and I had 3-4 weeks, at which point we would revisit my numbers and go from there.

Well, 4 weeks later, I was fired, and wasn't given a reason. My speed was definitely increasing, from 55% production to 81%, and my error rate had dropped from 14% to 2%.

Would it be ridiculous to go back and apply, and hope I get the chance to be interviewed, and explain? Or since I was just let go a month ago, would they just laugh at this point?

Also, my attendance was good, I made up any time I missed (scheduled absences, since you could make your own schedule), and I only called off 1 time the whole time I was there. I had to leave early a handful of times due to my kids getting sick or something at daycare, but my manager always said she understood, and I always made that time up too. So besides my production numbers, I was a ""model employee"".

213,"Two of my closest friends were dating and just recently broke up. I’m awful at advice and consoling people. I’ve only been in two real relationships and one ended mutually and the other is still going on after ~2.5 years so I have little to no experience with breakups. 
They were together for almost the same amount of time as my current relationship and, to be honest, I wanted it to end. I saw how she treated him and how often they fought and it just seemed to me that they didn’t work well together anymore. 
It’s been like just fighting and growing apart for the last 6 months of their relationship and I feel like I didn’t really see it coming that he would end it now. My usual advice is “boyfriends are stupid” and “you’re right in this situation” but I’m too close to her ex this time that I know who’s right and I’d be hurting one of my friends if I said one was right over the other, even though they both expect me to side with them. 
And, recently, i’ve been thinking of ending my friendship with her. Now my boyfriend and her ex aren’t talking to her much and have kinda cut off contact. Her ex is trying to end it nicely but she’s miserable and feels like everyone’s leaving her. I’m trying to stay friends with her cause i know it’s a tough time, but i’m at a loss for what to say. I know it’s mostly her fault but i can’t say that cause she’s a very emotional person and does not take criticism well AT ALL. All I can seem to say is “don’t worry” and “things will work out eventually” but i can tell it’s not helping.
I would try to avoid her but we have several classes together and i can’t just cut contact. 
How do i help her even though i know she’s at fault? Should i keep sparing her emotions cause i know she’s in a rough emotional state? Should i continues this friendship even though we’re kinda growing apart ourselves and every time we hang out i can’t help but be miserable? I’m really at a loss here and i have a feeling that if i keep being friends with her ex (one of my best friends since kindergarten) she’ll be mad at me

214,"EDIT: I'm from the EU

.

Obvious throwaway. The title isn't an exaggeration, it took me a lot of time to write and rewrite everything, I was banging my head on the desk every couple sentences. I know maybe the full story wasn't necessary, I intented it to be one paragraph at first, but I'm bad at cutting words. There are a lot of posts here and I bet this one is too long to get noticed, but I don't care at this point, I probably wrote this for myself.

.

I'm 22yo, haven't gone to uni, I have been working since high school as a graphic designer, later moved on to mainly website design/programming. First I started as a freelancer, a project here and there, nothing major. Then I had to move out, because after my parents divorced my mom sold our flat and bought another one with her new boyfriend. I couldn't stand living with her anymore, prior to that she tried to throw me out twice anyway. Living with my dad wasn't an option because he was practically homeless at that point (and there are other causes too). I moved out at the last possible moment when the new owners were moving in, rented a flat and found a semi-stable job. 

Now this is key - my new job was at a company which my dad in a way co-founded, or I'd say helped a lot when it was starting out, he had and still has a high manager position there, working closely with the owner. However, **he is not, by law, a co-founder**, he doesn't have a stake in the company, because when it was beginning, he was in deep financial troubles, so they agreed to unofficially split income. The company growth was kinda slow at first when I was still at school, but at the point where I joined it was already up and running, over 50+ people and a lot of money for everything, new employees and new investments. The job was paying better than any freelance jobs I could've found and I liked it quite a lot, also it felt friendly and safe, because my family (well, dad) was close friends with the owner and I've known him for years. What I did was to start my own single person company, because only then I could get financial help from local municipality, which I got and bought a new PC and other stuff, at that point dramatically needed to keep working. 

**I don't recommend repeating what I've done next:** since there was a lot of money in the company, I was friends with the owner, I didn't sign an agreement, we just agreed verbally to an invoice from me every month.

After a year (so a year ago) I've asked for a raise, because I have learned a ton, got into more serious programming work and I started getting other offers. I realized I was severaly underpaid - and I was barely making ends meet, living on your own is way more expensive that I thought - I asked to match the average of those offers, the owner agreed to double my pay. First 4-5 months everything was fine and dandy, invoice payments were never late, I practically got the money on the same day as I sent the invoice. I cleaned up my finances, saved some money for emergency, set up a proper budget, bought a bit of BTC. Problems started just before summer, it was related to a huge multi-million investment made around the time I got the raise. My invoice payments started getting late and finally not at all. I panicked, started calling my dad and the owner, I had never been put in such a situation before. There was a lot of deception, ""you're getting paid this week"", avoiding my calls etc. Other people working at the company were being owed money too, but nobody (as far as I know) to such an extent as me, certainly not people officially employed, because that would be a legal disaster. I realized I'm last on the list to get paid, I talked to my dad a couple of times about maybe taking a loan.

**I don't recommend repeating what I've done next:** I was owing taxes, rent was late over a month, couldn't pay for utilities, so I've taken a huge (for me) loan. It was equal to 5x my monthly income, I took it in July.

It didn't last me nowhere close to 5 months, because my dad asked me to borrow him 1/5 of that sum and I was already ~1.5 month behind. Through that time only one monthly invoice got paid and I ran out of money in late October. I didn't buy anything what wasn't necessary with the loan, I can honestly say I rationed the money well, but it ran out. I kept talking to my dad and hoping he'd pressure the owner, he was critical of my attitude, telling me I should be grateful for the job and that I should be ""loyal"" and patiently wait, as everyone is, for the money. My dad is in a corner himself, he has no other option than stay with the company, looking for anothe job in his spot would be catastrophic, he has built a house near the company logistics base in the middle of nowhere. I was still on quite good terms with the owner for some reason, let's not forget he was our close friend for years.

It all sounds like a typical /r/personalfinance thread where people make every bad decision they can and I realized that even then, but dismissed it because I kept telling this situation is different, because my boss is a friend and the atmosphere was friendly. I got paid once more about a month ago, with a promise there will be more money promptly, but there wasn't. 

Yesterday I got a text(!) from the owner saying he consulted with other people in the company that I'm not worth the money they ""are paying"" me and that we are ceasing our partership. Moreover, he said he would only pay me for up until October, because he feels like I haven't been up to much last month, which is untrue and a lie - except for all the small stuff people called me with and I'm not able to easily prove, I had at least 5 graphics projects with many iterations in November which I sent off to print by e-mails and I'm able to prove that. He said he won't accept my November invoice (I usually send the invoice around the 10th of the next month). I wasn't expecting that turn of events at all, but maybe I underestimated how bad the financial situation in the company is. I was the only IT guy, there isn't anyone except me even on the ""I can google stuff if something happens"" level in 50+ people company with two offices, I had a call almost every day with some trouble from people. Except for making the company's website and all projects of any kind, I chose (1920x1080, SSD and 12gb ram for a fair price yay), ordered people's notebooks and set them up, fixed computers, managed e-mails, did some networking and sysadmin work (nothing advanced), like setting up DDNS to access monitoring from outside, which no one else in the company had any idea how to do. It makes NO sense to let go of me, they will **for sure** pay more for outside help and will be forced to employ somebody else in my place, which is even more ridiculous.


Next loan payment is due in 3 days, I have no money, I owe rent, utilities, taxes, I have no job and turns out I was working for free since 1st of November, but nobody told me that. I took it all really hard since early summer, I think I might be depressed. I would never ever admit it to anybody, because it's ""tough man"" culture around here and I would be stigmatized as a pussy, but I seriously think I'm depressed. I have problems getting out of bed often, not to mention out of home, I haven't been this disappointed with myself and other people in my life ever. I had a girlfriend for 6 years, we broke up in early September due to multitude of reasons, it was the last person that was offering me any support, but in the months leading to that she didn't care too. I feel betrayed by everyone, I thought I approached everything properly, I budgeted my expenses, I don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs, I always spend money responsibly, yet I'm practically bankrupt and I owe a ton of money. I realize they're in the wrong and are supposed to pay my invoices, but I have no money for any lawyer, that company employs a full-time lawyer and other ones from time to time, I don't know how to do anything of that kind anyway.

If I was on the other side of this post I would have no problem listing all the mistakes I've done, I know I should have jumped ship as soon as invoices were getting late, I shouldn't have taken the loan, I should have signed an agreement, I should have been distrustful. The whole point is that I haven't done all that and I'm in a really bad situation, I don't know what to do, even if I magically found a job today I won't earn even close to enough money in time. I just don't see any solution, the thing which I could write on a post-it note and stick to the wall next to my monitor, so I could work towards something. I'm fucked

216,"Very recently I went and am still going through the worst event of my life. You can read it all in my post history on here(I've only posted once on this account other than this). But I'll briefly explain it to you as well. 

On December 3rd, I made the worst decision of my life and hopped in a vehicle after a few drinks(5-6) and drove. I was distracted while driving(trying to call my girlfriend) and I rear-ended a vehicle at a light. I'm so disgusted with myself and it's hard to look at myself in the mirror. I could have killed someone. Thankfully the person I hit is okay. But this experience has been so eye-opening. I don't think I'm an alcoholic but I did drive a car after drinks so clearly I have some sort of problem right?

Anyways, If I tell my job about the DUI I will get fired, if I don't tell them and they find out I get fired. Regardless of that scenario, I've had so many changes in my life over the last year. I landed this really cool job at an airline and I fell in love with a girl from my past. Things are getting serious between us and I realized that the really cool job I have that allows me to fly for free isn't as perfect as I thought it was. Part-time at an airline isn't as great as it sounds. You can fly for free but you never have enough money to do it and they aren't flexible with scheduling. 

Knowing that before I got into the accident I started looking into the prospect of returning to community college, I want to be educated and not feel like I have no options. I want to have enough money to support a family and have a job that fulfills me  and I want to help people. I had always considered being an EMT   or a Physician's assistant at some point. Now I know that more than ever. When I was in the ER the next day after my accident (I didn't go the night of because I was so concerned about the safety of the person I hit that I just kept telling EMS and the police that I was fine, but my chest is in a lot of pain) I told the doctor and medical staff about my DUI and for the first time I didn't feel like a monster. The doctor pulled me aside and told me that I'm going to make it through this and that meant the world to me.(Holy crap I'm crying). After looks of disappointment from everyone I love, hearing that felt like a light finally appeared at the end of the tunnel. 

I told myself that I want to be able to do that for people I want to have the opportunity to save people's lives and while that is happening give them a peace of mind. 

I called my community college that I live near and had attended in 2011 and they said I have a hold on my account for $1025 and I can't register for classes until then. I want to be able to start in the spring semester but I know that I won't be able to pay that $1025 off by then. Especially considering I'm working at a job that I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep and I have all these expenses to pay off. It just feels like if I wait until fall semester to try and start this that I'll never make it out of this. 

Is there anything I can do or anyway to get this money without an incredible high-rate loan? I contacted my bank and I wouldn't be approved for a loan like this on my own since I recently had taken out a loan from them that I'm currently making payments on. What can I do? 

Any advice helps, I just feel like my life is in shambles right now.",07Dec2017,2
217,"I've been struggling with this for quite a while now. I've always had difficulties paying attention to something, keeping my body still, becoming easily distracted, forgetful all the time, listening and keeping eye contact with people etc. I got really depressed about it because I was jack of all trades but master of none. That ''master of none'' thing bothered me so much, i was good at sports but not not enough to do it professionaly, i could sing and play instruments but not really ''that'' good at it, I was in the best class but my grades were little below average etc. I felt like the character in video games with all equal stats, it seems practical, but you arent really good at anything. It caused me to feel like I dont belong to anywhere and people around me dont really like me that much. I've also had financial problems and struggling with my family at that time which caused me to depress more and more. It became so brutal for me I even tried to commit suicide but couldnt. Then I became ''empty'', like, I wasnt really sad but I wasnt happy either, I didnt really care about anything, didnt give a fuck about anything, wasnt trying to success anything, just living in the void. I've started smoking, tried to do drugs, anything that could make me escape reality. Then I've met with an old friend of mine, he had his skateboard with him I tried it and fell in love with it instantly, I bought myself a board and we started hanging together with another friend of mine. It didnt have any rules, you werent really competing with anyone but yourself, it had this fuck it attitude, it was the thing I've been looking for to escape the pain, I loved it because I could adapt my thoughts in real life at that very moment, it is really amazing how a piece of wood with 4 wheels can make you feel. Last summer we skated everyday, made new friends, our group growed a lot more, those people became my family, we shared everyhing with each other, everyone got each others back, we all had our own problems and that was the place that we could forget all about those and have fun, when we were together i felt like i was immune, nothing could hurt me. Then I became happy, extrovert and creative again. As time goes by like I said I got over those thoughts or at least thought I got over it, I'm not really sure it still does bother me but I'm happy now at least. You see, i got over my depression but it didnt really change the fact that I've had problems which i mentioned above. I wanted to raise my grades but had problems studying and paying attention to class. A month ago i decided to go see a psychologist and she diagnosed me with ADHD. I've been using Concerta for a week now and It really helps me study, still have problems paying attention to class because I still got lost in thoughts for like 5 minutes straight and when i do recognize it I dont really remember what they've been telling at that period of time. Imagine a room which has 10 clones of you each one telling you a story, talking about science, his/her opinion about the girl's hair who sits in front of you, what you should do this weekend, what you shouldnt have done in the past, etc. at the same time. My head works like that all the time. I thought that adhd drug could help me silence those voices but It doesnt really do anything in that matter. What can I do to prevent this ? How can i completely focus at something or listen to someone without thinking million other things. Do any of you have this problem ? I could really use an advice because I really dont know what to do at this point. Thanks already.",07Dec2017,2

221,"I had never heard of the game before, I think my aunt made it up. There are 9 of us, so each person buys 9 gifts that are exactly the same (~$10). Then, the gifts are passed out to everyone, and you have to guess who bought which gifts for everyone. The person who guessed the most correctly gets $50, and then everyone votes on who got the best gift, and they also get $50.

The nine family members are: Me, my Father, my Mother, my Sister, my Aunt, Uncle, Cousin (M), Cousin (F), and her Husband.

The problem is, I can’t think of any gift that would be good for my situation. I live with my sister, mom, and dad. So any gift I get has to be able to work with 3 other of it in the house.

229,"I recently got a full-time job for a very popular delivery company as a driver helper (basically just bringing packages to doors from the truck). The job is easy as hell and the pay is good, but I'm having one huge problem with the driver to whom I was assigned. 

This guy NEVER, EVER stops talking. He will literally blab on and on about every vacation he's been on with his wife, every job he had in the 80's, and basically everything that he thinks makes him sound badass. He will literally not stop talking from the moment I meet him in the morning to when he drops me off at night. Literally 9 hours straight. 

I could almost deal with this if it weren't for the fact that he doesn't give a shit about what I have to say. He'll ask me a question about myself, and as soon as I start to answer, he will either loudly interrupt me and start talking about himself again, or he'll OBVIOUSLY not be paying attention (either looking at his phone, or by simply using a little snippet of what I say as a launching pad into another story about himself). He's in his late 50's, I'm in my mid 20's, and he constantly makes condescending remarks about my age, and strongly insinuates that I'm stupid because I don't talk much (Even though I CAN'T talk much). If I met this guy at a bar I'd walk away from him within two minutes, but I'm stuck in a fucking delivery truck with him all day.

I have stopped trying to be even slightly polite to him. During our downtime when the truck is parked, he'll turn towards me and start staring at me while he's talking, and I'll be staring ahead looking irritated as fuck, giving surly and short answers in a pissed-off tone. He doesn't pick up on these hints. I'm starting to think that he has a legitimate mental illness. I've tried everything short of telling him to stop fucking talking. I called the main office one morning and asked for a different driver, and they told me that every driver close to where I live is taken. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with a guy like this? Maybe I don't have the balls to just tell him that he needs to stop talking? I'd really appreciate any advice because I don't want to leave this job, but I feel like I'm going to go insane if I have to deal with him any longer.",07Dec2017,3

Well, before everything went to shit she gave me one of her $80 paychecks to cash for her because she literally does not have a fucking bank account... like what 20 yr old just doesn't have a debt card or ever has had a bank account!?! 
Ok that's besides the point haha. 
She gave me this check to cash for her and now that she owes me around $425 I cashed the check (she endorsed it over to me) and decided to keep the damn money.

240,"I also posted on legal, but you guys probably have some good advice, and we're desperate. We live in an apartment and the neighbor next to us is driving us crazy. 

Hi everyone. I am at a loss. It seems our landlord can't help. The cops can only help if we call, which causes her to escalate. Let me start with a recap of what has happened so far:

First Incident January: She woke us us by ringing our doorbell over and over because she thought we had called the cops (we did not, it was the woman upstairs)

Second Incident - February: She was blasting music so we called the cops. Long story short, after many cops calls and her ringing our doorbell over and over she ended up getting a citation.

Everything was fine until November. Since then, we've had to call the cops because of the loud music (i'm talking so loud we can hear every word of every song even with our tv volume up). We have a noise log to hand into our leasing company to start the eviction process, which I'm told takes forever. I haven't sent it into the leasing company yet because every time we take steps to resolving this through the police or our leasing agent, she gets worse. She and her husband have been spoken to numerous times by the leasing company. They tell them they're not playing loud music or that they'll be quiet.

My husband and her husband had a nice conversation about the noise the other day, so we thought it was done.

*A little about the woman so you can understand why I say she's unstable. We know her and her ""husband"" fight, we believe he is living some place else and she has actually called the cops on him once because he ""stole"" her children. We know the woman is a drinker. We've also heard from other neighbors that she's asked for drugs.

Last night she rang our bell and ran about 4 times. She then left a note saying if it was loud to let her know. My husband caught her ringing the doorbell before she could run and let he know it was too loud. She said it wasn't too loud and asked to come into our apartment. My husband told her no. She proceeded to blast music well past when we went to bed. She unplugged our Christmas lights a few time (no big deal but immature)

We're afraid to call the cops because the last time we called the cops, she called in a completely false report saying there was a domestic dispute (which I feel like is illegal). Once we call the cops, we know our night is ruined and there will be no time to unwind. So, we just avoided it last night. Long term, that isn't a solution.

We were told we can't get a restraining order because she isn't a relative or in a relationship, is that true?

What recourse do we have? The situation is extremely stressful. I'm fearful for my safety and for more retaliation from her.

There is not an available unit within our building to be moved to
We can't afford a different apartment in our area even if we were able to break the lease

I'll be happy to answer any questions. Thank you in advance for any assistance. I'm desperate.",07Dec2017,1

242,"Hi, 
I'm studying some sort of engineering and have only one exam left to write before starting my master theses. But this exam is really hard. Like, really really hard for me. I have also quite acceptable grades (well for me at least) of 1.x (more weighted to 2.0 though).
But for the first time ever I skipped the lectures and seminars because everything was just so much over my head that I could not handle how dumb I am. I wasn't able to listen to the teacher because I had to write so much and was lacking so many basics because I just forgot them. I even went home crying because I wasn't even able to tell what was talked about. That was the point where I just skipped it to not interfere with all the other things I had to do. I wanted to learn it from scratch, at my own pace. It is now the only thing left. But I don't know where to start learning. When I look at exercises, I don't even know what the basic concepts are that would needed to be considered and checked ....
...
I am paralyzed and can not concentrate on the task. 
...
And all the time I am thinking of a tool that could help me learn. I've been thinking of this tool for a couple of months now. I searched the whole web multiple times. My idea just is not realized. But I see people asking for it. I can see so much potential and have so many ideas already clearly mapped out in my head...  
... there is such an urge in me to program this tool ... it is very distracting.
I have no real experience in programming applications. So I would have to learn it. I do know some programming though. I wrote a magnetic simulation in Matlab and I've learned some high level concepts from programming Labview applications (like Event based, Object oriented approaches and how important it is to avoid race conditions).
But I know this is basically nothing and that my chance at succeeding in achieving what I want would be pretty low. I see how much more talented people struggle for many years (Josh Parnell anyone?). So yeah ...
...
I don't know why what to expect from answers here XD

I just feel like I am fleeing in some fantasy ... but I am seriously not happy at the moment. 

Has someone experienced something like this? How did you go about it?  
But also everyone else ... I don't know ... I guess hearing that I am not crazy would be awesome atm XD

255,"I just really need to vent out what has been happening to me for the past 4 months. 

I'm originally from South America but flew to Canada to study as an undergraduate in University. I was pretty stoked about it at first, although holding unrealistic expectations, I still didn't imagine it to be a thing that made me self-doubtful in every possible way. Man, I don't know who said Canadians are nice... cause there's just as much shit here as any other place. After 4 months I can't say I've made any real friends and this really bothers me because I miss having a ""normal"" life where I had friends and would constantly hang out with them. Throughout the day constantly ask myself what I'm doing wrong or what is wrong with me. Maybe it's even though I can communicate in English, I'm not the best speaker, tending to mumble a lot and having people constantly asking me to repeat what I say. Or the fact I'm foreign and don't have much in common with the people here. But what bothers me the most is the fact I stand way shorter than even the average guy everywhere I go. I know 5'3 is pretty short and I'm okay with not being attractive to girls that are few inches taller, but I never expected to be blatantly ignored by people (especially women), constantly having people talking over me, and pretty much walking around the streets/parties feeling like a ghost. My social experience has been so shitty that I developed a fear of being seen in public because I'm alone most of the time. I fear people will think I'm a weird loner, mainly in the residence cafeteria because I usually don't have anyone to have lunch with me. It got to the point I'll sometimes go for more than 24h without food because I don't feel comfortable sitting by myself in front of all the faces that live here and I have to see every day. I never had social anxiety before and seeing/meeting new people used to be something I craved back home, now I just tend to avoid them. I know it's a bitch move to call that I feel depressed about something so mundane, but sometimes I find it hard to get out of bed before 12 pm. It usually goes on and off between ""fuck everyone! I don't care what people think!"" and ""Shit. This potential friend just started not greeting me when I pass by and ignoring me when he is with his friends"". The only person that seems to genuinely like my company is this girl from my class that I exchanged texts with before coming to Canada and now I'm in a relationship with. When I'm with her I forget about all of the above, but spending time with her doesn't really help my case, it's not a healthy relationship if I don't have my own people and my own life. It especially hurts when she says she wants to meet my friends and I low key come up with excuses. I don't know what to do anymore, life's just sad and boring. I had about two months of psychologist sessions that just ended in my going back to square one as it felt like I was wasting 2 hours of my week. Oh, and before I get the ""go join clubs"" suggestion, I really suck at collective sports, I guess I could TRY soccer, basketball is out of the picture unless I was playing with 12 year olds, the only reason I'm kinda fit is because I loved surfing, which is not a thing here. The only reason I did not get into skating is that I'm always wearing boots with elevator soles that give me about 3 inches so I can look the same height as my girlfriend lol.

266,"I moved abroad with a scholarship to study. I love to study and learn new things but I'm also a bit messy. I always get into trouble because of not being more systematic and orderly. Well this problem finally caught up with me in a hard way. Thing is that my scholarship contract required for me to do something I didn't do on time, I did it later and now my scholarship could be taken away because of a breach of contract. I have great scores and an almost perfect average but somehow this damn bureaucratic issue is making me lose all this effort! Now I'm in a personal crisis because I have low self esteem and I'm really insecure and this doesn't improve it. Now I'm full of doubts and my motivation is on the floor, I feel like a complete failure. If my scholarship gets cancelled I would have to go back to my home country with my tail between my legs, I would be seen as a failure and I'm pretty sure my self esteem will be forever even more damaged so I think this will seal the deal of me being a complete failure in life and a disappointment for people I care about. In summary I'm getting sort of depressed.

So I have two possibilities: 1) renounce the scholarship in which case I would be left stranded on this foreign land (european country) looking for work or a PhD that will support me AND would have to pay for the part of the scholarship I already received which are around $70.000. 2) fight for my scholarship but without knowing if I would manage to save it, this could take a lot of time and energy from me and the result could be the same as the above but with me having to return to my country. On the other hand if the effort pays then I would have a scholarship for most part of my studies and I would just have to fund a small part of it in the end. Then I would return to my home country with a PhD and all will be right the world.

So this heavy decision is killing me. Both paths are difficult, both have high stakes, both can end up really good or really bad, both are attractive and scary in their own way. 

Also, Christmas is close so things are not working efficiently anywhere so I think I'll be stuck with this conundrum during the end of the year and it will suck completely.

2) I am unaware of how much many a person with an Economics degree can make as it is a broad degree
3) I would like to make a six figure salary. Im sure everyone would like this but it is my goal.
4) I am hesitant to assume the debt that medical school or a phD for research would entail
5) I have invested so much time and effort in both the economic and science-based route.

269,"I’m in high school. My friend, let’s call her A, and I have been friends since we were really young, but since then we’ve gone into different social groups. Despite that, we still consider each other to be our best friend.
A few weeks ago, I found out that another girl, B, was ranting about her to the other people in a school club. It was super petty stuff too, she was angry that A was “like a puppy” and that she almost missed her curfew once.
A found out because after B literally talking behind her back, like five feet, about how much she hated her.
A also found out because another member of the club, C, told her. According to him, at that time, B was talking about stuff that he actually liked about A and making B was trying to make herself the victim.
A asked B if there were any issues, and B said there was nothing wrong.
Then, today, C used As computer and forgot to log out. A went to log out, but noticed that a chat window was open. B and C had been chatting about how horrible A was.
B said that A was hogging a member of the friend group and that she was a brat bc of it. Apparently, she asked another person about a time A and a friend were touchy and he said there was a reason for it so B decided that it meant A was too mentally ill to control herself. There were also multiple times where she said she wanted to expose her, but she knew that A would cry and get people on her side.
A read it during lunch and freaked out. Then in study hall, she looked again and found out that that was most of what they talked about and it had been going on for months.
Its gotten to the point where her relationships with a lot of people are being torn apart because some people don’t like her. I really want to help A out but I just don’t know how.",07Dec2017,0

She’s a nice lady and I didn’t mind it at first but it’s way too much now.  It turned into polite teasing to full on flirting.

286,"Background I’ve been dating my girlfriend just over two years. Overall the relationship is great. I love her to death, we’re both really happy overall, she’s incredibly sweet and just an overall loving loyal girlfriend. 

There’s one problem though that’s been persistent since about a year in. Our fights always blow up, they always start small, and I don’t think she knows how to healthily handle arguments. 

When we have an argument, usually it’ll be one of us getting an attitude toward the other. Typically it’s because the other person has it first. I’ll admit that I do this. I am not perfect, neither is she. 

However, when she’s in a bad mad she’ll make sure you know. She has a hard time getting over it, where as if I have an attitude and she points it out, I’ll usually stop within a few minutes. She does this with her parents too, her and her mom have some pretty nasty fights occasionally cause one of them has an attitude and they just keep going. 

With her I’ll apologize, and typically her response is along the lines of “you’re not sorry” or “you’ll just do it again”. I’ll try and keep a positive tone but it gets tiring. 

Then it’ll turn into how she does it too, or how I always deny it at first (I do this too, but I am a very serious person anyway and usually always have a serious tone). 

When we argue, no matter how much I try to make it even, it always turns to me. She’ll tell me how I treat her like shit, or how I’m a douche bag. She curses at me, and then when she’s had enough, she tells me to leave or that she’s leaving.

Typically I persist and our arguments resolve, but it takes a lot. 

She never makes eye contact if we argue, she’ll sit on her phone. I try and tell her that bothers me but she doesn’t listen. When it gets to the point of her telling me to leave or she says she is, she doesn’t listen to me on how I don’t like that either. I bring up the fact of when we’re older and we live together or have kids, how that won’t be healthy. She just tells me “that’s how she is and she’s not changing” 

Twice I actually left after she kept telling me to, then she would text me about how I left her while she was crying and all that. I know it’s manipulative. 

I always try to calmly talk about how if we both are in the wrong why, and how we could maybe try to fix it, but it always delves back into above. 

Every argument is the same, I try to reason and change things, I try to get her to listen to me, but she doesn’t. I’ve had friends of mine tell me she’s treats me like shit. They’ve read our texts back and fourth, she goes ballistic over text too. 

Many here will try and tell me to leave. I understand that may be the go to for some, but I love this girl a lot. As I said there’s a lot of good here that I didn’t get to highlight. We’ve both invested a lot into the relationship and love each other but I’m tired of these types of fights. 

Tl;dr girlfriend of 2 years doesn’t fight in a healthy way, may be emotionally abusive, but it’s always over small fights. Everything else is great and I want to try and fix this

(1) I'm asked how my jobs going. As a quantum physicist (I know Reddit won't believe me - I'm happy to post credentials if needed) this is a dead end because nobody can discuss the topic properly. I start talking about math, but they don't even know what an eigenvalue is.. I don't blame people, not many can even comprehend them, but it's still annoying. The conversation inevitably degrades toward the double slit experiment, universe is a simulation, or Neil Degrasse Tyson pop-science talk. It's tiring. No, you don't understand these topics. Stop blabbing about things you don't understand.

(2) Small talk. Ugh. I discuss ideas, not people. I don't care what grades Linda's kids got. I dont want to hear about Jade's new boyfriend.

299,"I am a Mechanical Engineering major. I entered my university through the Arts and Sciences program, with intentions to transfer into the Engineering program. The problem is that my first semester could have been better. I originally wanted to make an internal transfer between these fall and spring semesters. This univ. has a very demanding entry for Engineering and there is also an incredibly high number of students trying to enter it. Because of conditions, I have postponed my internal transfer to next fall's semester.

The curriculum for engineering is pretty tight. There are several classes that I can only take if I am in the program. Setting myself back a full year would affect me, as I can only keep up so much of the classes from outside of it.

Am I wasting my time? I could have entered a univ. that I was admitted to as an engineering major. Do you think going through another year like this would hurt more than it's worth? I'm a freshman, so I've got time to take all of my classes. And I am perfectly willing to take a few over summer, to catch up. But I'm worried that I am wasting my time.

305,"When I first married my husband, he lived in a tiny place that was very far from my job and my place was a studio apartment. So instead of one of us moving in to the others place, we moved to a new place. We are renting and have a 1 year lease which is about to expire. We weren't quite ready to buy last year (actually we could've but blah life), and weren't really sure if we wanted condo, house, city, suburbs, etc. We also weren't trying for a family yet but decided we could stay at the place we got until potential baby was 6-12 months old. Well, now we've been ttc for months and nothing's happening. Meanwhile I'm getting a little depressed that everyone else we know have taken the plunge and are home owners. Plus we are much better off financially now than we were last year due to my higher paying position and a gift. So we could comfortably buy something very nice. 

 I'm sort of struggling, though,  because we *just* moved. I do really like our current place. We are settled and comfortable there. No pregnancy happening so no need to hurry into something bigger or more permanent. Plus it seems like a waste of money to have spent thousands on moving costs (broker fees, increased rent because it's a bigger place, board application fee, etc) for 12 months. We hardly got a chance to enjoy the place. Also, it's in a nicer location than we can afford to purchase in. Those are all my reasons for wanting to stay.

 I only have two reasons for wanting to move:

 1. To get on the property latter. Everyone says it's so important to have equity and be a home owner. We feel like we're being judged. 

 2. The place we rented is furnished. If we do manage to conceive one of these days, we have no where to fit crib and other baby stuff because there's no room and we can't throw out our LLs furniture. 

 So are those good enough reasons to move before committing to another year in the rented place?

306,"I am 23 years old. For the past 5 years, I have been in employment.

I started at a cinema. Zero hour contract. I loved it. Yes the people were challenging, but I loved the diversity and the interaction. I hated the management. After 2 years of being treated worse than the dirt on their shoes, I found another job.

I now work for an educational organisation. I started as an apprentice. After 6 months, I finished that course and was coerced into doing the next one. I say coerced, because I worked for the department that delivered the apprenticeships and not progressing would reflect badly on them ... so I progressed.

I was 21 and wanted to keep my job, so I went with it. It didn't go well.

3 years down the line, I have not been given a permanent contract. They are continually extending my fixed term - but they have given permanent contracts to others.

We are in a merger. I lost my manager and it took 6 months to replace her. Now we have a new manager, they have realised I don't have a position in the new structure.

It took them 7 months to decide where I sat in this structure. If they stick with their current decision.

They are destroying my job. I was never given an official job description, but I do four major things. Three of those things are going to other people/teams going forward. I have instead been assigned to basically push data around for teams I never agreed to work with. Areas so far removed from what I was hired to do.

My new manager was dismissive of my telling her that I was looking elsewhere. She is trying to get me a permanent contract ... but as far as I'm concerned Now, it's too little too late.

I want out of this job. I do not want to do admin. But there is no way I can support myself on a customer service role like I used to - I have a flat to pay for, pets to feed, bills to pay. I don't live at home now.

So I have applied for an admin role and so far, it's looking positive. I have a meeting with the company coming up.

When I have interviews, my mind goes crazy. I lose the plot. I've talked myself out of so many applications because I can't bring myself to do it, and I'm doing it now.

This job sounds awesome. Same pay as I'm on Now, same commute. Smaller team. More interaction with external customers. The snag is that it is an admin role.

But I'm questioning myself about every decision right now. I don't know what to do - whether I want this job or not, even. Right Now, all I know is I can't stay where I am. Not even for double, or triple what I'm earning. I cannot do it.

I'm just not sure what to do to get out, without ending up in the same career that I really never wanted to be in. I don't want this situation to come about again but I can't see any other way out of this toxic place.

307,"Sorry this is long. TL;DR I think I’m being picked on how do I know for sure and how do I react. 
I'm not sure, but recent and past events have lead me to believe people might be bullying me. It started in October when some kid in my debate class started making random remarks toward or about me. I didn't think anything of it at that time. I just thought he was annoying. Then around two weeks later my debate teacher called me in saying that someone had told her I was being bullied. At the time I had no idea who the hell she was talking about, so I just figured it was a mistake. I’m still not sure who reported it or who they were talking about, I can only guess. 
I had little bit of social anxiety afterwards but other than that I was fine. I had just made sure to keep an eye out. Well around last week this random kid from   History started randomly saying hi to me when I would walk near him with a sort of smirk. I say hi back every time. He says nothing else. Then today in history I was sitting in class with my earbuds in. Keep in mind my earbuds are noise cancelling so I can’t hear anything but David Bowie. I looked up and he seemed to be pointing his phone at me to take a picture. Maybe it was a selfie, but I don’t think his face would have been in the frame. Later when the teacher asked for a volunteer he said “oo Macy should do it”
Then later in the history I felt something on my shoulder. Some girl I’ve only talked to twice very shortly was leaning against my should about to get a selfie with me while I was doing an assignment. Apparently “her friend Gina thinks she knows me” but I don’t know anyone named Gina. Then she goes on to ask if I like movies. What do I like to do. Do I like baking. Chocolate or vanilla. Gave me compliments and offered to take me shopping(which honestly sounds dreadful). Then she went back to her desk for a few minutes, and came back asking for my Snapchat. I gave it to her and now we are following each other. The whole situation seemed so staged though. 
I have no idea what to think of all this. On one hand they seem to be acting really strange, but I have no real proof. Maybe them both taking pictures of me is connected I don’t know.

So my Dad has been sick all semester and died last weekend. His illness caused me a lot of difficulty during the semester, and now his death is causing a lot of stress. Especially because all my finals are next week.
Mostly, I'm concerned about my stats course. I am not doing super well (about a C) and I am really nervous about the final.

Due to my situation, my instructor has offered me the option of taking an incomplete. this would allow me to either a) take an alternate final exam in the first 2 weeks of January or b) take the final next April with the winter semester students.

I guess I have mixed feelings because, on some level, I just want to be done with the class as it causes me A LOT of stress. However, I'm worried about passing, and I""m taking 18 credits so I have other classes to prepare for the final as well. So taking an incomplete would allow me to probably do better in those courses.

I'm also concerned that taking it next spring or in Jan would just prolong my stress about passing the class or that I will forget everything and not do very well.

I'm on the farthest side of this little walkway/yard, and one or two of my neighbors from the front side (only two units have dogs and they both live in front) is/are letting their dog shit right in front my door in the gravel lining the walkway. We're talking shit twice a day and these are big dog turds so it piles up quick, it stinks, and every time I leave the building I have to smell it, and I like to leave the door open for fresh air but I won't because of the odor. 

I cannot figure out which of the two it is or whether or not it's both of them. One owns a big bulldog and the other owns a husky/pitbull mix. I've seen the bulldog owner in front my place before with their dog but I didn't catch them in the act so I'm not sure if it's them. I'm gone from 6:45am till 6pm and during the time I'm gone or during the night they are appearing.

I've complained to management and they *say* they gave notices to the dog owners of the building but I don't believe them.

How should I go about catching them and or getting my revenge? Should I just knock on their doors and kindly ask if it's them and if they'll pick up their dog shit? Should I yell at them? I'm fucking pissed and it's rude so I want to yell at them and tell them what a bunch of shitsticks they are. 

One time I got so fed up I shoveled up the dog shit and dumped it in front of both of their doors but that didn't solve the issue. 

What should I do reddit? How should I get my revenge, or should I be more civil about it?

326,"I actually have 5 finals, but all 4 of them are back to back on the same day.
I have Math, English, Chemistry, and Geology back to back starting at 6:15 am. I don't think I will have enough time to review since I only have 10-15 minute gap to get to the next class. I'm currently really sick and I feel so unmotivated and overwhelm  to tackle these tasks. Any tips would be helpful. ",07Dec2017,1
327,"OK so theres this girl I got talking to once, and she has a really nice personality and shes very pretty. We hit it off pretty well, and though I know she has a BF, we always talk for ages and shes really friendly. Obviously, even though I know she is taken I've found her FB profiles and linkedin. Come on, I know literally everybody does it.

So I ran into her today and we talked for ages as usual, and at the end, I told her she should add me on linkedin. So I turned my computer around and asked her to type in her name - her name came up in the search history. I'm fairly certain she noticed it, even though I quickly tried to get the screen off. 

I'm not sure if I made it awkward afterwards, but it definately wasn't the same friendliness as she left. Almost 2 hours after I sent the linkedin request, no acceptance. Shes even viewed my profile. 

So what are your opinions on this? I know if I found out somebody was checking my online profiles, I probably wouldn't care, but I'm a guy...",07Dec2017,1

329,"Sorry this kind of long but I wanted to tell someone about this and want to know what i should do. 
I tried weed in my eleventh grade (late 2016). I enjoyed it and immediately bought a quarter off a dealer. (This year) I began using the drug daily until I smoked before school and I suffered from psychosis. I had extreme anxiety and thought i was dying. 
I experimented with ecstasy and used four pills in like three days. I remember waking up in the middle of the night with chattering teeth. I dont remember any euphoria from it.
I used dxm (cough syrup) as well and had psychosis again. 
My parents discovered my weed usage when they found a quarter in my room. I told them about all the drugs i had used and i was sent to rehab for 10 weeks. I have been out of rehab for 2 months and have went back to weed and drinking  (only at parties) but have been eating healthier and excercising again. 

The thing I want to say is that I want to know how I'm still alive? Do I have brain damage? Is there anyway to do a brain scan to check?  Often when im high and sober i wonder what life was before i was using drugs. I don't feel the same to say the least. My memory is ok but i forget a lot of things. I also have trouble forming sentences sometimes and have anxiety as well. I have had derealization and depersonalization too. I have floaters and visual snow in my eye sight. I have seen a doctor and he just put me on anti depressants and didnt care about my usage or floaters. I also saw an escort while high and did unprotected sex and have red dots on my dick (follice glands i think) and the doctor didnt care either
I used to be depressed but now i have seen life is easy and im just throwing it all away.  I don't want to die, maybe im just paranoid. What can i do? :((

Tl dr:
Abused a shit ton of drugs at a young age, 
Wondering if i have any health problems and what to do.",07Dec2017,1
330,"For my fafsa. How many nights a week minimum would i have to spend at my dads to legally be considered ""living"" with him?

331,"I used to be a very loud, happy person who didn’t care for the thoughts of anyone, but more recently I’ve become extremely self-conscious and I want to go back to not caring about looking like a fool in front of people. I want to stop being afraid of the person that I am.

334,"So the good thing is I already know she likes me back. We don't talk that much, but we're decent friends and have hung out once. I've never had  a real girlfriend before, she's never dated either. I've got friends that are girls and i've rejected a few, just don't know how to make the change from talking to her as a friend. 
I also have bipolar like mood swings where I either completely withdraw for a period of time or an just super uninterested in talking to her which I know have thrown her off before. And then times where I'm talking so much she probably thought I was high ( she would never say it though) 

I could honestly truly just say I want to date and she would most likely say yes, but that would make it feel forced imo. I kind of know how to flirt, and i've done it before but she's the only girl i've actually been interested in. 
She is just pretty shy and i'm not at all. So I don't want to make her uncomfortable. Just talking to her in a place she wasn't expecting me/prepared she was obviously nervous. ( stumbling over words and leaving quickly) 
So what are some ways of flirting/talking to her as someone i'd like to date instead of as a friend without making her uncomfortable or nervous? ",07Dec2017,1
336,"Let's start off by giving a bit of context. I'm a few months shy from becoming 22 years old, a recent college graduate; graduated university about 6 months ago with an alright degree and currently living with my parents. 

For the past 6 months I've been unable/too tentative (although I would say mostly unmotivated) to get into work that would be relative to my degree and have been coasting from of place to another, doing menial, dead end jobs in warehouses and fast food restaurants. This of course means that my resumé as a potential employee is rather poor, as aside from my academic credentials I really have no relative work experience. Besides that, my social life has take a tremendous hit since graduating. All of my friends from high school and university are slowly slipping away to have their own lives, occupied by work and relationships, meaning I'm left without almost anyone. I suffer from bad social anxiety, never been in a serious romantic relationship and always found making friends difficult. I'm trying to improve; I work out religiously, eat healthy and try to be as disciplined I possibly can, without much avail. Furthermore, life with my family is slowly starting to deteriorate too and they're starting to suggest I should leave soon or get into more meaningful work.

I'm really anxious to move out, knowing its gonna be difficult, but at the same time, I feel like it's the kick in the ass I need to get a sense of direction, as life has never felt so meaningless, even though I've been chronically depressed for a large proportion of my childhood. I want to get into a different environment and just simply take a chance. 

My parents have been discouraging me, saying it's an extremely dumb idea, since I won't be able to save much to purchase my own place, however I feel like it's an opportunity to change, and in a way, my last shot at life, which brings me to the question: Should I take a chance, move out to a different city and attempt to make it on my own, despite odds being stacked against me or stay home and carry on what I've been doing for the past 6 months and try to make it work?

337,"I've had somebody approach me 3 times in the past month, I'm 16 and I often go for walks in the evening to the shops.
The first time was on the 13th Nov at 17:35ish
The second time was in the same place on the 27th Nov at 18:00ish
The last time was today (7th December) at about 19:55 in a completely different place.

He looks about 25/30ish and he always asks for directions/if I know the area and one time asked to use my phone, the last time really shook me.

I need advice on what to do, should I keep going out?
What happens if I see him again?
