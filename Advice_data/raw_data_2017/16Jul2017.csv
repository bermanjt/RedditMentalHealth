0,"Ok I would like to apologise just incase this post is long. But last weekend (8th of July) to be exact. I was out drinking at a local pub since it was my dad's birthday. That's not the point. The point is one of my friends who happens to be female was forced into a toilet at another pub. I have recently found out this guy has aspergers and a urine fetish. But my friend is scared beyond point because she thought she was getting raped. He doesn't know this but my friend is scared to go out for a night out because of this incident. Guys, what can I do? I know you would say I should phone the police but what else can I do? Everyone I've spoke to about this thinks that just because he has aspergers that he should get away Scot free and I don't agree with this. This means thst he'll just do it to someone else and the cycle will continue. Please, everyone help me out. Even if I'm wrong can you let my mind to ease. Thanks again. I just wanna do right in this world.",16Jul2017,0

6,"TL;DR- I outed a guy, whom i never thought i'd meet/see to my girlfriends, his friends and my friends have hung out at least once a week for the past month, he asked who i told in which I told him and then he said it was fine but ""it wasn't my place to tell anyone"" and I completely agree and would never do it however I never thought i'd see him as much as I do. I feel guilty and shit about it all. 

Alright so let me first say that I myself am a gay man and I completely understand that it is not my place to tell people that they're gay to anyone. SO here's my story. 2 people that I work with told me that one of their friends is gay and he just came out. I knew OF this guy so I was like ""yeah he's a cute guy"" Anyways, Not thinking i'd ever see or meet this guy I told my 2 girl friends about him saying ""oh yeah he just came out and he's super cute"" and they couldn't really care less. Anyways, fast forward to maybe a week later, me and one of my girlfriends went to one of the work friends house and he was there and so that was the first time I met him and didn't think too much of it. Myself and my girlfriend didn't bring it up or mention anything to him cos obvs we wouldn't. Then the weekend later the same work friend had a house party and so we saw the gay guy again. My work friend told me ""none of the other guys know that he's gay so you can't mention anything and my girlfriends shouldn't know either"" in which I said 'yeah ofcourse ofcourse I won't mention anything"" At this time, the work friend knew that my girlfriends knew but whatever. ANYWAYS, the party was fine, I felt like the gay guy knew my girlfriend knew so they were super close and i was like okay so she knows. Fast forward to last night and we were out for my girlfriends birthday and the work friends and the gay guy was there. He brought it to my attention that he knows that I know that he's gay and he was wondering who else I had told. In which I said, just my girlfriends, whom he really likes and gets along with. Now he was like ""yeah thats cool just so we're on the same page"" I told him, Look, It's not my place to tell other people about him and I knew that, but I thought i'd never see or meet you but I wanted to tell my friends about this guy who was gay and who i thought was really cute, but then we started hanging out weekly and I didn't know that was going to happen. He said ""yeah i get that but you're right, it's not your place to tell anyone so just keep that in mind for next time, its a learning experience for you"" Anyways, He said he was chill about it and wasn't taking it to heart and that he still really likes me and stuff but I don't know, perhaps it was the way he said it but he just made it sound really patronising and like ""i'm gonna say im not pissed but i actually am?"" 
TBH: I don't even know what advice I need right now, I feel really bad about it all, I know not to out anyone well cos i was in that same position, but he made it sound like it was something i'd do willy nilly and it isn't. I never thought i'd see or hang out with him so I didn't see the harm. I guess I'm just hoping people can see that and make me not feel so bad about it.",16Jul2017,1

This is a painting I did of my college girlfriend. I don't have feelings for her any more but I kept the painting for almost twenty years since I, shit, I made it with my own two hands. It's never been hung up. Stays in my garage or basement behind other junk. Well we cleaned out the garage and it resurfaced. I feel like I need to do something with it. 

She's married now, should I try to send it to her?
Her mom lives in the same city I do, should I try to give it to her?

10,"Background here and it seems grey. One of my best friends has these room mates that keep me from going out with them. Three years ago the roommates girlfriend came over to drink and have fun with myself and my three room mates. It's not uncommon that people come over and we drink and watch tv and fall asleep. The issue here is that the girlfriend of my mutual friend came over, had too much to drink and fell all over the bathroom and fell asleep in my bed. She is convinced that we had sex and it keeps me from hanging out with all of them even though none of that happened. The issue is that it keeps me from hanging out with my friends because she thinks that something more happened even thought it didn't. How do I stay friends with everyone and make it so that I can go downtown with them? Nothing ever happened between me and her and I can share more details if necessary. It seems off to me because after three years from this incident I am still not able to go downtown with them.",16Jul2017,1

13,"So me 24f and this guy 30m have been talking for a few months and he had a birthday last week. We are not together. I got him a card and a small gift and asked him if I could drop it it off to him when i get off of work and he says yes i dont mind.  I text him that im on my way and I get to his place, he wouldnt answer the phone or text back. About 20 minutes go by and he texts back and says that he is bathing his son and will be outside in a moment. 10 minutes go by and i see a white honda Circle by my car three separate times and drive really slow by it. It was really dark outside so I can barely see but it looks like it was him in the driver's seat and another woman in the passenger seat. 

I left after this but kept telling him that I was still outside just to see how long he would keep me waiting and it went on for two and a half hours and he just stopped texting back. He kept saying he was sorry but wouldn't come outside. I kept it to myself for a few days and then told him that I saw him Circle by my car multiple times with another woman in the car and I don't understand why he wouldn't just tell me to go home or to not come in the first place. I told him that we were not together and I would not have taken any offense to him telling me not to come. Not only did he get upset but he completely refused to answer the question or confirm that it was in fact him. He just kept saying that that's in the past and we shouldn't dwell on it. He also said that ""he's pretty sure we've moved past that by now so we should just leave it alone"".

I just don't get this. It's obvious that for whatever reason he wanted this other woman to see me and he wanted me to see him with someone else but why tell me to keep waiting.",16Jul2017,2
14,"Hey all, I'm in Spring Hill TN and I'm in a really tough situation where I'm essentially locked out of my own home, due to a tenant there that I'm in the process of evicting. I'm sure this will all be sorted out eventually, but in the meantime I am not able to live there and I make my living taking customer service calls from home. 

Fortunately I have found a place to stay for now, but they don't have internet access and I don't want to intrude too much having him get that set up and then me taking calls all day long in their house. Every day that goes by though, I'm not working and I'm losing money quickly. 

Does anyone have any ideas for a situation like this? I am really at a loss and it's really tough. I've thought of something like an internet cafe, but I don't think that would be practical. I'd need to plug in a VOIP phone and a remote terminal computer, and a bunch of random noise in the background probably wouldn't go over very well with my employer. 

Are there any options for someone who just needs a place to sit in a small room for 8-10 hours taking calls, with internet access? I am willing to pay a little, but renting office space would probably be way over what I could afford. My job isn't that much over minimum wage.

If anyone has any ideas, suggestions, or advice, please let me know. I really appreciate it, thanks for reading.

15,"last night, my younger brother [10] found a stray black cat in our neighborhood. He says that the cat was just sitting by our neighbor's steps and when he got closer to the cat the cat wasn't scared. So then he called all of us to come out and play with the cat. The cat wasn't scared of us and when we gave him milk, he drank it and we bought the milk to the front steps of our home. This morning we saw that he drank all of the milk and today at 9:15 we heard the cat meowing in front of our steps and he's back for some more food. Today, we noticed he kept meowing and doing tricks for us. I think he's a lost cat because he loves attention, is a pretty normal size and does tricks for us too. What should I do now? We are afraid he might have rabies too.",16Jul2017,1
17,"Hey there, reddit! So this one is a bit of a doozy. 

I have no idea what I want to do in life, like, at all. I've talked to my mom and her boyfriend about it, and they've both agreed to let me go ""off the grid"" after completing my senior year for two months (so in a year). I have a few thousand saved (of my own money) and a car, and I was just wondering what I could do in those two months.

I'm interested in driving around the country and try out working for free in different careers. This sounds super strange, but would anyone in the states even be interested in letting me work as a free intern of sorts at their workplaces? Just doing menial tasks and getting a feel for what different careers entitle. Is this even possible? 

I'm okay with living in my car for those two months, but do you guys think this is possible? How would I go about this while remaining somewhat safe? I'm a fairly petite female who knows all too well that the world isn't always so kind or safe, but I really want to do this.

I just want to know my plethora of options before I commit to going down a traditional path and pursuing a 'stable' career instead of finding something that I enjoy doing. Is this silly?

20,"I love talking to everyone, making new friends. Etc. I mean this should've been in personal but my main focus is relationships with girls. 

The problem is I'm sorta alone and don't have many friends. I'm not really an attractive guy so I don't know how I can get girls to talk to  me. I'm going in grade 12 in September so maybe I'll meet someone then. 
For now during summer it's sorta boring, no one really texts me and it makes me sad, makes me realize know one really wants to talk to me, girls and boys. 

How can I change this? Is their any tips on how I could get out there, thanks for the responses. Have a great day!",16Jul2017,3
23,"Forgive me in advance for being vague.

Let me preface this by saying I'm in my mid-20s and I live with a roommate, not with my parents. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I am also 100% financially independent from my parents. In a few days I'm going out of town to visit a friend for several days. I've been there quite a few times in the past, no nervousness on my part.

The issue is I don't really want to tell my parents I'm going. A few years ago something happened to me (long story short I very nearly died) and ever since then my parents get very overbearing when I'm ""with somebody they don't know"". My mom texts me multiple times a day including at night before she goes to sleep, assumedly to make sure I'm still alive (edit: I realized this was a bit unclear: she does this regardless of if I'm with anybody, i.e. everyday). It does get annoying at times but I've put up with it and not been mean/told her to stop because, as she said to me herself, what happened a few years ago changed everything for her as it was the closest she's ever come to losing a child.

The thing is if I tell her (this will be the first time since this incident that I'm going anywhere out of state - or even within more than an hour radius of my apartment) I imagine this will only get worse while I'm out and would become an annoyance for my friend as well. I don't want to feel like my parents are constantly breathing down my neck while I'm trying to enjoy myself - but at the same time, I also don't want to feel in the back of my head like I shouldn't be lying to my parents.

It would be no issue to simply just never tell them as there's a 99% chance they'd never find out (the 1% chance is my roommate, who is family, telling them - but I don't think he would) but when I think about doing that I get anxious and feel like I should tell them, but I can't give myself a good reason *why* I should.

Writing it out like this it almost seems obvious what the solution is, but I've always been close to my parents and something in my mind is telling me that not telling them I'm going is an attack on them. Am I right in feeling like telling them is more trouble than it's worth or should I feel obligated to?",16Jul2017,3
24,"Hey all. This is probably a silly question.

Caught HFMD last week, rashes started appearing on Monday (10/7). My doctor told me to stay at home for the week and return on Friday for a follow-up. Got a medical certificate for those 5 days too (it's like evidence to my employer that I was unfit for work).

Returned on Friday and was told that I shouldn't go back to work until all my rashes have cleared up. The doctor (different doctor from last time) then gave me another medical certificate for 6 more days, which means I'm not supposed to go back to work until Thursday (20/7).

I'm currently a trainee solicitor (not exactly the right term but close enough) in Singapore. Only been training for a month before I caught this stupid disease. I've already been away from work for 5 days and I would hate to miss any more. At the same time if my disease is still contagious I wouldn't want to go back to the office tomorrow and risk infecting other people. Currently the rashes on my palms have sort of dried out but they haven't cleared completely yet. Thinking of going back to the clinic tomorrow to check with another doctor whether I'm fit to go back to work. Sounds like a good plan? Or should I just wait till Thursday before returning to the office? ",16Jul2017,3
28,"so i've had this friend for less than a year. she's a straight girl, i'm a gay guy, we're both in our early twenties. we grew very close at college, but this last semester i had to drop out temporarily (but i don't know if/when i'm going back so it could be permanent.) we both knew we might not see each other again, and we've both kind of grieved for the friendship even though we know we can text and such. there was a lot of crying the night i left. there's also a background of her having crushed on me in the past which is why i bring up our genders and sexualities. 

anyway. a month or two ago i was texting her. she was telling me about her parents, and i told her that their relationship with her and her brother sounded unhealthy to me--the specific words i used were ""borderline abusive."" she got upset and i didn't push it further than she wanted to argue about it, although i did get a bit passive aggressive at the end of the conversation. but we stopped talking about it and didn't revisit the subject. a few weeks in, she was very reticent with her communication. we wouldn't text more than a few lines at a time. i tried bombarding her with the lyrics to a silly song we both like; that worked for a little while. a few more weeks passed: nothing, except when i texted her she told me she was feeling weird and that she couldn't talk. this made me really worry and she should have known i would worry, because she's struggled a lot with depression and anxiety. i assumed that her saying she couldn't talk meant she was in such a deep funk that she was generally incapable of doing anything. so i asked my friend, who was still living near her, to check on her and see if she was doing alright. my friend said she was doing well and that there was nothing wrong with her, and they're pretty close too so i gathered that information was true. but i was still worried so i (somewhat frantically) texted her asking if she was alright, did she need help, etc.. aaaaaand she responded with this long, lawyerly written text which contained the bit, ""I will continue to ask that you respect my request to limit our communication, of course I still care deeply about you"" etc.. it was very hurtful for me to be addressed like some random douchey stranger that she wanted to keep off the lawn. i didn't write anything back, but it was a big wound if i'm honest. she hasn't talked to me beyond that for almost a month. 

she didn't give me a reason beyond ""I just need some time to figure myself out"" and i don't know of any real explanation for this type of behavior. the closest thing i can imagine is that she's actually experiencing conflicting feelings re: her parents and my criticism of them, but if that's the case why wouldn't she just tell me about that? why would she need to cease communication? i hate waiting for something which i don't know if i even want to arrive. most of me is saying just to tell her fuck you as loudly as i can and then block her on any and all channels. should i try to salvage the relationship and probably watch it slowly die? or should i kill it now and enjoy that satisfying crunch? or something else?",16Jul2017,3
29,"So, this has a lot of moving pieces to it. Sorry for how long it is. I also apologize for the throwaway, the usual reasons for that apply here.

I'm a 25F who just finished her Masters degree. During that time of getting my Masters, I had a perpetual problem with sort of living in the future. Ya know, ""Oh, I'll do this after I graduate"", ""Oh, I'll have so much fun after I graduate."" That sort of thing, not really enjoying my youth. My Dad died suddenly in March, and the way that I coped was throwing myself into my work as usual.

Now that I've graduated, I've found myself antsy and sick of waiting to create a life for myself. I've taken steps to actually put myself out there, and I've been fairly successful thus far. I'm very suddenly taking life by the horns, and it feels good. The problem is that I don't have a job to fund the life that I want.

I graduated in May into a field that is becoming increasingly hostile to newcomers. Nobody warned me about this because it's a very new phenomenon, and frankly, my mentors just didn't have to deal with this. To give you some perspective: I apply for a job in my direct field, I never get a response, even if its a low on the ladder, perfect first job sort of situation. I apply for a job in a related field, I get a call back within a week. I'm not kidding. The reality for many people who graduated with my degree is that they have to take other work and pray for something to come along, or they have to move across the country. There was a time in my life where I would have grabbed at the chance to move somewhere else. But my father's death have put things in perspective for me. There are many places I am willing to move to, but I have to at least be within an easy plane ride of my family.

I wanted this to be my career, but after facing down reality, I'm wondering if I made a mistake. I gave myself this summer to stop and look for work, but I'm realizing it may not happen. I'm thinking of jumping into another field that I certainly qualify for, is nowhere near what I studied for, is constantly hiring new people, and has very defined ways of moving up. I could certainly still look for work in my field in this position, and I plan to, but if I enjoy this different field I could also just give up on the job hunting all together and take the steps necessary to start working my way up. I did try going into this field once before and didn't enjoy it. However, this different field is one with many parts, and I think part of the problem is that I didn't like the part I was in. (Sorry for the vagueness). 

To be frank, I've come to you guys because I don't know if I'm being rational. There's a lot of things going on in the background that seem to be putting pressure on the job hunt for me. My mother received advice from a friend to not make any major decisions for a year after a major event like this (edit: this being my Dad's death). I don't have that luxury. I'm looking for outside perspective, additional advice, or anything else you guys are thinking in this situation. Thanks so much.",16Jul2017,2

36,"I'm considering moving out and parting ways with my roommate, Chris. If I were to do so, then he and I would have to decide who gets to claim our cat, Archer. He's by far the best cat that I've ever had the pleasure of caring for, and Chris certainly feels the same affection for him. We both love him dearly, as he's been the only consistently good thing in our crappy lives ever since we got him. As far as ownership goes: he and I split the vet bills evenly; Chris is the one that found him and took him in; he also bought Archer a bunch of cat toys and a nice cat tree (it was only like $20 though); but I feel as though I've been a bit more diligent in caring for him. To elaborate on that last part: I don't think Chris has ever bought cat food and I was almost always the one who's gave Archer his medicine. Also, as much as I like Chris as a person, one of his flaws is that he's rather incompetent, so I think I would be a better owner in this unfortunate situation. Just the other day we ran out of cat food (an irresponsible moment that we both share) and I asked him to go buy some on his day off, as I was too busy with work, and he failed to due to no good reason.

Of course, this decision hinges upon whether or not I'm actually allowed to take Archer into this new place. The people I'm considering living with already have a cat, whom Archer may not get along with. I plan on introducing them to each other just to see how they react.

43,"Two 20 year-old buddies and I (all college students) just moved into a rental home in a culdesac. Naturally, we expected 'those neighbors' and from the start we've made it a priority to break the 'frat house neighbors' stereotype. However, we quickly discovered the title of 'those neighbors' had been claimed by the family next door. One of their quirks was regularly having 6-9 cars parked at the house. Due to the volume of their vehicles, we quickly realized that we would rarely have to opportunity to park in front of our house.

One night we had a friend over, and 'those neighbors' decided to stop by at 1:30 AM. Keep in mind this was a weekday. Anyway, they politely told my roommate that we had a car in front of their house and it needed to move. He thought this was a joke, but after an uncomfortable pause, he realized they were serious. We were all really surprised and decided due to the time it would be best to just move the car.

The very next day we realized that they were way out of line as it is a public street and anyone can park where they want. We were all annoyed, but also rationalized that they would follow their own advice and quit parking in front of our house.
Unfortunately this wasn't the case. That very weekend they filled the culdesac with their vehicles. This has been going on for over a month now and it is a rarity when one of our guests doesn't have to park around the corner.

44,"I'm not sure how to put this in words but I'll do my best.

I guess I'm just not happy with myself or my life. I know I'm in control of both me and my life, but it doesn't feel like it. I'm 23, pretty much broke, living paycheck to paycheck. I work for my dad's business, and it's just me and him, so things are busy enough for both of us and I feel like if I left then it could hurt the business because of all we'd have to turn down. I want to leave and actually live somewhere else, a different state would be nice, but that costs money and I don't even have a vehicle that isn't a company truck.

I only have one person that I could actually call a friend, but they live far enough away and we're both busy enough that we see each other maybe a couple times a year. Everyone else I have as a friend is either family, or really just there because I hate being alone.

I don't have any motivation or focus either. I've had a couple hundred different hobbies in the past few years, I do something for anywhere from a few minutes to a few months before I either give up, or just completely lose focus and move onto something else. I've yet to find something that actually makes me happy.

Basically I'm a poor excuse for a human being that just exists and not much else. I don't even have the motivation to live except that if something happened to me then my family and my one friend would be pretty messed up over it.

I'm just tired of life in general, and I don't know how to fix it.",16Jul2017,2
46,"My girlfriend and I have had a unique backstory. We knew each other from kindergarten, I eventually moved away for about 10 years, and then we eventually reunited and have been dating for a few months. There's something very special about her and I don't know why. We have a very strong connection and I honestly am in love with her and she has said she is in love with me. We are both 18 years old and we have our entire lives ahead of us. We are also going to be attending different colleges this fall which will make our relationship long distance (we've already both told each other we want to stay together). Since we are so young it seems foolish to assume that we are meant to be, but honestly I feel as if she may be the one. But I'm not 100% sure on anything right now.

47,"This morning my mom and I got into an argument. I flipped her off directly in her face, she told me to stop and I didn't. She could have simply been an arms length away from me but she wanted to keep screaming in my face. So I accidentally lightly tapped her nose with my middle finger, there is NO WAY it could have caused her any pain whatsoever, then she flies off the handle and starts screaming that I smacked her. At this point I'm thinking WTF ARE YOU INSANE? but then she takes it to the next level by taking a large ceramic bowl and threatening to hit me with it, faking me out and everything whilst still screaming at the top of her lungs. I ran downstairs and grabbed my can of mace for self-defense. She was threatening me so I felt that I needed it, she's assaulted me before but I never reported it. She has been abusing me emotionally and mentally my whole life. She has some chronic pain disorders, and she takes an herb called Kratom. I grabbed all of her kratom and told her that she could have it back when she said one sentence: ""I'm sorry for threatening you"". It sounds fucked up but I just wanted an apology for ONCE in my god damn life. I went back to my own business and started ignoring her.

Apparently she hadn't realized what I took from her because a few hours later she just runs down the stairs and starts clawing at me and trying to choke me out. I put up with it for a little while until I decided to go grab the mace because my mom is fucking insane. I told her to get off of me and she ran off, stealing my guitar and saying she's going to sell it (my guitar is the most important thing in the world to me). Then she starts saying she's going to have me involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. She says she's going to call the police tomorrow and they're gonna ""take me away"". I haven't had mental health issues in 4 years, but there is documentation that I have depression and have made attempts on my life. I'm completely not suicidal in any way and I didn't assault my mom, but she has bruise marks all over her arms simply because she has lupus. She is threatening to falsely tell the police I beat her because she has no mark on her face. 

I'm probably gonna pack my bags and try and live in a tent in my friend's back yard. What do I do about my mom? Do you guys think she'll really be able to have me involuntarily committed?

55,"Hey, I have no diagnosis or anything like that. Though that does not mean I havent got trouble socializing.

I have improved a lot at talking to people, and find myself genuinely interested in the conversations about every day trivial things (which is something I never used to before).

My issues with talking is that I often find myself, and very often to the surprise of others say really just.. wierd things. I sometimes completely lack a filter. These fallacies are often results of thinking too far ahead in a conversation, and the result of this is my compliments sound like low key ""retarded"" insults.

A consequence of that is that I am scared of talking to people, because now that I am aware of having this quirk, I am too afraid to talk at all. Because they arent rare, everyone can say stupid things occasionally. But I do them constantly. It has become character defining of me at this point.

I am very much self aware and it has been pointed out many times to me and I am able to bursh them off or even explain it as stupid mitakes or something that defines me as a person to do if I am beginning to know people better.

Still, I am really tired of teaching myself to talk to people. It has been so long now, I am so envious of how other people just eem to be able to keep and spark conversations left and right. Cause I feel like I lack a genuine interest of knowing certain things about them. I feel like I just cant get past the effort of asking boring ""where do you come from"" stuff.

What do I do with my lack of interest? Cause I really do want a lot of good friends, but I just suck at getting em because I am my own worst enemy right now.

57,"Bought a car ""As is"" from dealer. Had a mechanic give it a quick inspection for $45. He did little more than give it a visual inspection. Paid cash $3,700. Agreed to pay another $400 for cost of registration and title transfer. Written in contract as ""Title Fee"". Seller still has title and spare key. Seller said it would be slightly cheaper if I took the car for a Vehicle Inspection. He said if he did it, it would be more expensive but he wouldn't need the car to acquire a Vehicle Inspection Report. A day after purchase: Car showed catalytic converter and hybrid battery problems. I am unsure of specific faults but I don't think it would pass an inspection: Specifically the emissions test.

I am unsure of what to do, advice would be very welcome. The best course of action I think I have is to pay the dealer the remaining $400 for the registration.

67,"It's not really work because I don't get paid but I volunteer once a week for a couple of hours at a yoga studio to get free classes. I usually just clean or work the front desk like signing people in and work the cash register.
I just gave them my 2 weeks notice the other day but today's shift had my partner working double and asked to be on cleaning duty, so she could nap in a room at the back.

 I worked the front desk and a client brought an iphone to me that I put aside, until someone claims it. There is no excuse for my actions but once it range had notice it had no passcode and my partner asked if it was mine just nodded and thought to turn it off and try to sneakily put it in my food container as she went in the back but the security camera might have saw me. 
 
Anyways, the poor bastard came to me at the end of class saying he dropped his phone in the dressing room and forgot to put it in his locker but he was without a doubt, certain that he brought it with him to the studio. I automatically felt guilty realizing this client owns the phone and I should have straight up told him that I put it in my food container..like for safe keeping? 

However, im a coward and hesitated saying ""um, I have no idea"" but tried to play it off by asking my partner, if she saw it while cleaning. There is also a male yoga teacher that overheard and he is also the little brother of the studio's owner but he became very concern as the guy kept claiming that it has to be theft and search the entire place again.

 I tried to find a way to sneak it out of my food container and pretend to find it anywhere else but it was sitting underneath the front desk by everyone. My partner left as did the iPhone-guy but I offered to stay longer and wait for a client that wanted to shower off. Its closing, so I maybe I could have hidden it for tomorrow staff to find but the studio's owner, lilbro wasn't leaving and had me send a message to the manager to make aware of the missing phone.

 I managed to put my food container in my bag without lilbro really noticing because there was an untouched fruit cake for everyone to share but I offered to take it home because I hate food waste and pushed it in my bag with my food container. We all walked out together and I'm paranoid but he said the security cameras will reveal who stole it as a bye.

I felt incredibly guilty all the way home and would like to return it with no questions ask or without them knowing it was me. My boyfriend suggested taking it to the Apple store have them contact the person but I'm not sure if it's anonymous enough? I thought of maybe sneaking it back into the yoga studio somehow without other volunteers/teachers and people or the security cameras seeing me leading them to believe we just didn't look hard enough?

I know there is should be no empathy for what I have done like even with being at risk of homeless by the end of this week, thus had to give them my 2 week notice. I decided in the moment that I didn't want to finish this last week, after having enough of listening to these rich and privelleged problems of clients being too stressed on not knowing where to get the next tattoo or unsure which country to travel to next. Even the guy whose iphone that I stole had mentioned it's not a big deal because next week he's traveling across Europe for concerts but I still think that I should give it back for karma sakes.

68,"I don't know how relatable what goes on in my head is, so please bear with me if this all sounds strange/awkward or dumb.    
  
While I was at my parents house last week, we talked about many things - they live 500 miles away from me so it's a lot of talk whenever I visit. One thing that came up was that 2 of my close friends are going on a very cool vacation sometime next year. Well, why aren't I going? I can't recall exactly what I said but it was probably something about me not having enough money or it just not being worth the cost or I'm busy saving for other things or something similar to any of that. To me this was more like small talk than something very important.  
  
A week later, I'm home, mom calls me today. ""hey guess what? We'll pay for you to go on that vacation.""   
  
My immediate reflex is to reject. I absolutely can't accept that. But I think she really didn't expect me to reject that. I'm surprised by the offer and am having difficulty articulating &amp; choosing words to say to politely decline it. She seems surprised by my rejection. She insisted I think about it, I don't have to say no now; we kept this call brief, but I know there will be followup tomorrow, because I said I'll call later. So now I have to figure out what to say by tomorrow when I call back.    
    
I'm not rich, but I'm not poor, either. I do have a job, I do generally buy things I want. If I *really* wanted to go on this vacation, I could just take some other discretionary luxuries out of my budget, and squeeze this vacation into my budget. I just prefer not to, and I made that choice myself and I am happy to live with it. I'm frivolous enough with my own money, without needing to suck in other peoples' money to be frivolous, too.     
    
All I want to do is decline it and make this awkward situation go away without hurting anyone's feelings. I could tell over the phone how my mom was excited to make that offer to me. And then here I am, being the asshole to say no and ruin the fun.

My sister- who we will call K- is my half sister. K has always had problems in her life. 

K has 3 kids. Kid 1 is my nephew. Kid 2 is my niece. Kid 3 is my nephew. K also has an ass of a boyfriend who we will call Asshat. 

Asshat is a drug addict. He has been in and out of prison. Once, Asshat got high in front of Kid 1 and passed out. He later died but the EMTs brought him back to life. You would think that would change him, but no. So. 

K has Left Asshat many times but always goes back. I think I may understand why. 

See, the thing we have in common is our father. He is a piece of shit honestly. I think K stays with Asshat because she wants her kids to have a father in their life who they will see every day from when they wake up to when they go to sleep. 

I get that to a point, I really do. But Asshat is well an asshat. 

She recently- in June- left him for what my family and I thought was for good. I just got the news that they are moving to Cumberland, Maryland to live together.

I accuse others of being tiring and off putting, and to a certain extent I believe what I'm saying, even after my little mood swing has ended, but I look back and realize that I was the one being tiring and off putting. That even if what I was saying was true and worth addressing, I just put in way too much energy into it. I'm fearing that I'm becoming this source of negativity that's ruining my friend's nights because they never know when I'm gonna tip at the smallest thing.

83,"19/m

My 31 year old uncle invited me to move to New York City with him but I'm starting to think he's a bad influence and a douche. I plan on saving at least 1k and then driving up there and selling my vehicle but I feel I should act with caution. Once I'm up there I'll be trapped, with no way to get back. In a sense I'm wondering to what extent I'll be at his mercy. He seems very put together, doing comedy shows and starting law school soon but he has a drinking problem. The biggest problem I have though is that last night he and my older cousin suggested we go to a strip club. We smoked a joint and headed there. The whole drive there I was thinking it was a bad idea, but it turns out they had more in mind. My uncle was going to pay for VIP service and pay to get me and my cousin (and himself)blowjob service...aka prostitution as far as the law is concerned. I lucked out and didn't have my ID on me so we canceled the whole thing when the guy wouldn't let me in. The whole thing has a creepy uncle vibe. I visited him in NY once and he wanted to buy a bottle of alcohol and drink with me at his apartment. 

The second half of this revolves around him being very rude. He doesn't let me finish half of my ideas and disregards the things I say. For instance after that stripper thing went down we went to grab a bite. I said I just wanted an orange juice but he insisted I eat a taco and did not get an orange juice, he also has the propensity to get unnecessarily mad with me over trivial things. 

Just tonight he texted me and I responded quickly then asked what the address was I would be moving to with him. He's ignored my question so far. 

However these are all suspicions of bad faith. I have to wonder wether these fears stem more from being bullied in high school. Where I was always on the look out for a perceived slight. 

My uncle has never done anything bad to me. In fact he let me live with him during my freshman year of hs when I became dependent on marijuana and he was a very reasonable dependable person. What I'm thinking now, about him really being a douche, is contrary to the majority of my previous observations. To me that suggests I might just be being a paranoid pessimist. But at the same time if this is paranoia it's also my gut instinct and I'm not sure whether or not I can trust him or myself.

it's hard to get personal with him and talk about stuff. i get stuck at conversations with him. we mostly talk about novels we've been into lately and other stuff but he can't open up and it's hard to get to know him on a more emotional deeper level 

he doesn't use social media, he doesn't believe in it which i find attractive idk why, he's an introvert 

this is hard for me because i'm very open and i get clingy sometimes and he is the opposite and if anyone has been in this situation please help give some advice?!  i really like him.

97,"   So my partner and I, (we're in a heterosexual monogamous relationship), live together AND work together. We've been together for a year now. We're also both in our mid-20's, want a family, similar future, etc...

   The problem is... All of our co-workers and I will be cleaning, rearranging things, etc... But my partner will be talking to customers, or friends, or just generally fucking off... But my partner will complain about it anytime ANYONE else we work with does something similar. I'll notice it happening when they do it, and try to warn them, (so our bosses don't notice and get upset, because it's been brought up in meetings before), but they ignore me, or blow me off, and I'll get aggravated. Then, later, they'll FLAT OUT ASK ME what's wrong, and I'll begin to tell them.

That's when it goes bad. Suddenly they'll explode on me and ask, ""Why did you bring this up?"" 

Well.... I didn't... They asked me what's wrong.. I'll try to say it doesn't matter... They keep pushing. Then, finally, I'll start to tell them, and they... What? Don't like the answer? Feel internally guilty? Feel like a hypocrite?

Am I going crazy? Has anyone experienced this type of thing? What should I do? Should we see someone? 


SIDE NOTES: We get along 96% of the time. This stuff usually only comes out after work. Then, by the time we get home, they're telling me to sleep on the couch (lol). I don't WANT or have any desire to leave them. And vice versa. ",16Jul2017,2
98,"im not sure how to format or present this with as much information organized. I wont lie everything could always be a lie but i knew this person for 2 and a half years who i will call CRA. 

---
**Background info:**

CRA is currently 18 who lives in reading pennsylvania which looks like a shit hole. she lives with 2 older brothers,19 and 21, and a younger one 15. her dad apparently dealt drugs in the past and was forced to move out of state before getting to pennsylvania because of a hitman. her mom goes to school for what degree im not sure but she always use her and her 19 year old brother to do her homework for her. if they dont they get threatened in multiple ways. Her mom gets a lot of financial aid as long as no one works in her household as she is seen as a single mother with 4 kids even though their dad does actually lives with them and uses his income on luxuries like owning 4 cars. one of them being getting $500 a month for classes as long none of the kids work (how this is supposed to work or if anything really works like that idk). so as long as they live in their roof they cant work or they get kicked out. problem is she lives in reading pennsylvania which appears to be just a shitty city overall. CRA says a lot of times she doesnt feel safe walking around as an 18 year old girl. even if CRA and her brothers moved out and 3 of them were to look for jobs she doesnt feel confident they can find some there fast enough and have a reliable income for all of them. There way more problems like her dad locking her in a dark room for the whole time her mom was at work because she snitched on her dad that he would go out at night with other women when she was little and believed in ghost but the list can go on
[some little bio she wrote about herself for school that can give an idea on what shes willing to share about herself with people](http://imgur.com/a/QPeyL)

**Family Meetings**:
apparently CRA and her family has meetings where they supposedly are to speak their mind about any issues oor problems. problem is they are almost always afraid to say anything and things will turn personal and get scolded for thinking anything negative about her parents. Couple months ago when CRA was talking to her 19 year old brother about making sure she will not let her parents get to her financial aid. her mom overheard it outside her room and got mad about not only the money but some sly remark was made (what is was i dont remember). a day after their mom forced a family meeting about it and [this is what happened](http://imgur.com/a/vWKxu)

 She recently believes her brother has OCD as her always tries to hit his elbows against something til they bruise and cries uncontrollably. when she brought this up with her parents they again made it about them worried about being accused of neglect and she sent me an [audio clip](http://vocaroo.com/i/s0br429ykSLd) she apparently had 4 recording but only wanted to share one. ive asked for the others but i cant say why as she doesnt know im making this post and this was [CRA complaining about it today](http://imgur.com/a/qvluc)

again its the internet but i have reasons to believe and worry about a friend. I just want to know what can CRA do? what can i say? i cant relate but obviously i have empathy and wish to help. Its easier said than done to say just leave and work or crash with a friend(s) till you can get on your own feet but she said she doesnt trust anyone she knows irl and is close enough to ask for something like that. she is smart enough to know suicide isnt the answer but even after all that she doesnt really wish to report her parents to the police or anything. im open to anything",16Jul2017,2

ok. here goes. ive been dating my wonderful girlfriend for almost five months now. both of us struggle with mental illness, but im in treatment and doing much better. she is for the most part, an emotionless void. the only time she feels is when she drinks, and when were both being dumb and lovey together. 

i just turned 18, and shes 17, and we both live with our parents*, until we graduate

*she recently moved in with her sister for the reasons following

her mother is a bitch. her father is a right wing extremist, and im pretty sure the company he owns has been classified as a terrorist group by some southern organization, i cant remember which off the top of my head. considering shes a communist lesbian, they dont exactly get along. the mom is just as bad, and is an unstable alcoholic who used to beat all of her children. shes stopped beating them, but shes still incredibly abuseful. 

gf broke down the other day, telling me she had a gun to her head. the only thing that stopped her was a phone call she had to answer. it hurts me so much knowing shes struggling and theres nothing i can do, but until shes 18, i cant get her out of there. shes living with her sister but her horrific mother still finds ways to permeate and ruin her life. i worry about her constantly, and theres nothing i can do to help. if i leave her, id probably fall into depression for a while, and shed probably kill herself. not because i left her, just because theres nothing else left for her. she knows itd be abusive to base her happiness on me, and i feel the same about basing mine on her. both of us have borderline personality disorder, and iur therapists are having us work on avoiding abusive behaviours. 

gf struggles with alcoholism, and feels like shes gonna turn out as bad as her mother. neither of us want kids, but shes afraid it wont end well  

i just dont know what to do and im rambling cause its 5am and i couldnt organise my thoughts for this post but i need help. please. what do i do. how can i help her. i cant call the cops or 911 because if she's committed her parents will never give her any freedom after that. her mom already takes away basic privileges/rights when they argue. i cant call CPS or DSS or whatever state child protection agency is in the state we live in, because theres no proof against parents. the only two sisters ive met are too scared of the mom, and the other sister is a methhead on the other side of the country. i just dont know what to do",16Jul2017,7
103,"So, I'm a single mother. I met a guy and got to know him a little, and we began to date. He treated me great, and I have never felt so loved by another person before. The twist, he shared with me that he had gone to prison in the past. When I asked the details, he told me that his ex wife was on drugs and that he took a hit for her neglecting or abusing their child, as she was again pregnant. She promised to get help with the drugs, be a better mother, and never put their child at risk again. Basically, she did the damage, and he protected her on good faith that she would turn her life around. He said the injury came from him, even though it didn't, and he was locked up for two years. 
However, when he was released from prison, she was back on drugs, and so they ended it, and the now two children they had went to live with grandparents (as he still couldn't see his kids from the charge he took and no contact order).
As he was working on trying to get visitation and custody back, we continued dating. I tried to find ways to help him, and urged him more than once to go back and tell the truth of what happened so that he could have his kids. He said it was too late, and he just had to see the process through now. Over a year he worked on getting them, while also spending a lot of time with me and my child. He said one day he would have it sorted out, that he loved my child and me, and that he wanted to marry me.
I can't remember when I first felt it, but I felt something wasn't right in our relationship. Long story short, I found out while telling me he was faithful to me, he was talking to other women and playing around with the idea of cheating on me. I was hurt and furious, but he apologized for being such an idiot, and promised to never make the same mistake. He mostly chucked it up to being because of his own self- esteem issues, and I somehow found myself feeling bad for him after. We continued dating, and as far as I know, he never did anything like that again.
We made a lot of great memories together, experiencing all kinds of things...my kid, him, and me. He was goofy, fun, and full of life. He would do anything to take care of us. He'd show up to walk me to my car from work or school, run out in the middle of the night to leave flowers on my doorstep, sat in an emergency room with me on new years for hours when I was really sick, surprised me on mother's day, etc., and it was a really great year full of love.
Then one day that instinctive feeling was there of something not being right. The exposal of one lie led to many, and quite literally dozens were revealed in the end. He was smoking pot all the time and hiding it. Hiding friends houses he was going to. Hiding bars he went to, the club, and other late night activities when he would tell me he was tired from work and going to sleep. It hurt to be so decieved. He was sorry, he said. He thought I would be upset and that's why he didn't tell me. 
I gave him another chance. No good, and after a couple months the same thing happened.
Finally, I told him he had one final chance to not be a compulsive liar to me anymore. I told him to come clean on any lie he ever told me, and start being honest and open. He did. More lie confessions spilled, but then came the giant one that is still messing with me today. He told me the worst lie he ever told me was that his wife was the one that hurt their child on drugs. It was him. He did it. He did it and had been smearing her name, telling friends and family his false heroic tale of him going to prison for her crime. I couldn't believe it. I literally couldn't believe it and lived in denial for a month, and ended up still talking to him. He said it wasn't really him that did it, but the him that was on hard drugs years ago, which he would never do again. However he continued to smoke pot and lied to me about more things in that final month.
I broke up with him. 
My question is, why, given the facts, am I hurting so bad from the break up? I've missed laughing, being playful, romantic, etc. with him. It hurts me, yet the fact that it hurts me enrages me. Why do I hurt, from something that was so hurtful to me anyway? Why am I struggling and thinking abiut happy memories with him? Is something wrong with me?",16Jul2017,1
106,"I work for a small company doing manual labor. For the sake of keeping this somewhat private for now, we will say I do lawn maintenance although what I actually do is specific to the area I live and is in high demand. I started working for the company about a year ago. My boss (owner of the company) hired me to fill in for someone who had recently been fired, and him and I (as his helper) were the entire company. I started at $10/hr. As time progressed, i took on more responsibility and after about 4 or 5 months, started doing nearly 100% of the work by myself. My boss then hired a worker to be my helper, and began more of a role that consisted more of doing estimates and taking phone calls. He is not a super presentable guy, though he is very friendly, he's just kind of got this very country/hillbilly vibe about him. Ever since I started working with him, business has been growing substantially faster than it did in the previous 2 years of him owning the company. business is now stronger than ever, and i am being worked to the bone in the summer heat every day using and depending on equipment that is far beyond being in need of repair. It has gotten frustrating to be in charge of everything, working my *** off, and maintaining to represent the company to the best of my ability, all while making $12/hour on jobs that bring company $2,000-$3000 profit every two days. 

This being said, I learned a few months ago that my boss had taken my social security number that he made a copy of when I first started working for him to make me an LLC, unannounced to me. This also included filing a ""workers compensation exemption form"" on my behalf for me. The worker who is my helper is also filed on that llc as my employer/subcontractor (not sure which)I do like my boss, and don't really mind the work if it was for more money, I just feel underpaid for the major role I play in the company. 

For the past few months I've been saving and working towards gathering all materials I need to begin doing jobs myself (trailer, about $2000 worth of equipment). I now have almost everything I need, and am only short of getting my own business liability insurance and business license to have everything complete. 

My question is, how would you approach the situation if you were in my position? I do like my boss and wouldn't mind continuing to subcontract for his company. However, I'm not sure how he will handle the news that I may become his competition. The way I see it- For the entire length of employment with this company, I have been miscatagorized as a subcontractor. I am now doing what is necisarry for me to actually be subcontracted by him (or another company in the same field.. 2 of which have offered to pay me more than double what my current boss does, but those two company's were both under the impression at the time that the equipment I had with me was all mine when it was actually my current bosses). An arrangement where I help to train my worker to fill my position while my own business picks up seems ideal to me, but am I being too hopeful thinking he would continue to employ me when he knows I'm going to give him competition on my own? I know he is going to feel betrayed and tell me it's a bad idea etc. I'm just trying to think of the best way to present it to him so that the process that both he and I will soon undergo is relatively seamless. I feel like we could both still help each other to an extent, I'm just not sure how to phrase it. ",16Jul2017,2

I don't know if I can say that I love this girl, as a friend I do but to say I love her romanticly and want to be with her for the rest of my life, I'm not sure. I just don't want to have sex with her and take her virginity and then end up breaking up with her because I realize that I don't want to be with her for whatever reason in the future. I also can't think of what it would be like having a kid at this age, no college degree yet no job that could support a family.

121,"Context: I live with 4 siblings and my mother, who has BPD. 

My mum has BPD and she is heavily irrational and has problems controlling her emotions. She gets angry at the tiniest things and is verbally abusive on a daily basis. Words that she has called me and my siblings include : cunt, bitch, slut, slag, wanker, bastard, whore and many others. 
She is unemployed and on benefits, so spends most of her time at home. Theee of my siblings are quite young (4,5 and 5), another sibling is 12, and I am 16. I understand that she does a lot and has a lot of responsibilities, but she loses her temper constantly and never listens to anyone. She had a very hard childhood, and her mother was worse than she is, but I can't help but feel that she projects these problems onto us. 

Today, I was helping my younger siblings clean my room, but they were badly misbehaving so I shouted at them a little. They proceeded to pull my hair and kick me, so I grabbed one of them to get them off of me. I have a really bad temper and it tends to be explosive, since I hold a lot of it in. What I didn't realise was that my nails had punctured his skin a little and it was stinging him. I was so sorry when it happened and apologised sincerely, and he was OK. When my mum saw, she went absolutely crazy, and I'm not talking just shouting. She was screaming abuse and being absolutely horrible, she wasn't listening to what happened and was threatening to run my face in the dirt etc. I understand why she was angry as her child was hurt, but she was being absolutely horrid. 

She does this all the time and is quite manipulative, whatever goes wrong, goes wrong because of me, even when I had nothing to do with it. If we don't do something trivial, or forget to do something, it's because we hate her, an dont care about her. She even talks about killing herself in front of the younger siblings. 

Today I almost lost it. After her explosion of anger, I started making lunch, and to put the knife in the sink, I had to walk past her. I'm telling you sincerely, I have never had such temptation to kill someone as I did at that moment. When I walked past her, what I would do to her just ran through my mind, and despite it being morally wrong, it made me smile. 

It's difficult because although I know she has problems, I know that I do as well, but it's like she doesn't even care. What can I do to calm myself down, and stop myself from doing something I regret?

I'm 17m and she is 17f. Her family is visiting for two weeks, and a few months earlier, her father died. Her and her family have been going through some rough times, and this might be why they are visiting. That's just some backstory as to how this situation started.

About 10 hours ago, my cousin has confessed to me about how she has been in a downward spiral since she lost her virginity last month. I can't and won't go into too much detail, but after she lost her virginity, the guy broke up with her the next day. After that, she has been seeking attention and 'love'(censoring myself in case NSFW) with multiple boys around her age. She's had one night stands, FWBs, and she even hooked back up with her ex bf again. She has been reckless at times, as well. Even if its a low chance, there is a possibility she could be pregnant. She hasn't taken a pregnancy test yet. I'm the only one in her family that knows about this. Other than that, only some of her friends and possibly her counselor. I'm not sure about the counselor because she only mentioned that the counselor has told her that she was looking for a father figure after the loss of her father. I'm just glad she has a professional to go to and that she is...""aware"" that this search for a father figure could have resulted to her recent actions. 

I want to know if there's any way I could try to support her or give advice while she is staying over. I almost tried to have a heart-to-heart conversation with her or expressed what I thought of the situation over text, but I stopped myself beforehand. I don't know if I'm overstepping my boundaries or if I'm just putting salt in her wounds. I wouldn't want to ruin her trip, as well. Well, really, I just don't want to say anything that would make the situation worse. As I'm the only family member to know about this, I'm worried that she might dig herself a deeper hole for herself before her family becomes aware of it. I wonder if I've typed too much filler? Anyways, need advice on how to move forward on thi- wait, this is the part where you put a tldr.

Tl;dr- Cousin who is visiting for two weeks has a foolish boyfriend that popped her cherry and broke up with her the day after. Cousin has since been hooking up with multiple boys and even back with her foolish ex the past month. Might be pregnant. Only family member to know about this.

128,"So Im trying to make this less confusing then how its is playing out in my brain, My mum has a friend I call her mama G because she is like a second mum to me. Mama G also has two sons who I see as brothers but the oldest had a friend that would come round to Mama G's house all the time and I started gaining feelings for him. 

Apparently this guy did too as the oldest son of mama G had spoken to him and he said he was interested. We didn't ever speak of those feelings, it would always just be a case of a little bit of flirting but that was it for months until he told my Mama G that he was going to ask me out on valentines day. 

Little did I know he went clubbing the Saturday before and then said he wanted to explore his options, he didn't end up asking me out and so I was really gutted with that. He then stopped turning up to Mama G's house like he was before and I soon found out weeks later that he's went back out with his ex girlfriend. 

How did I feel about it all? absolutely heart broken. I then found out he then for a second time broke up with his ex and was then taking drugs. I knew he did weed but that was all I thought until I heard other stories. I then decided it was time to get over him and honestly Im fine when I don't see him for a long time but its as soon as i see him again, its as if all the feelings come flooding back and I'm that giddy little high school girl. 

I also know that in the back of my mind I'm still wanting to be with him because although other people have heard stories of him, when I was with him he was such a gentle man. He was so sweet and cute. I also went clubbing last night too and seen him working so I called for him and I don't want to sound conceited but Im pretty sure he checked me out and he was proper trying to look at me. 

what do I do ? How can I get him out of my mind... Or how do I give him a second chance even though he blew me off the first time? he might not want that though so any advice will do.  ",16Jul2017,2

i told the son I didn't want anyone over the first night. kind of jokingly but then it gradually more serious that it would be best if I could have time alone, if he wanted to have friends over why not invite them back to his apartment? he never gave me a solid reason why 

he insisted hes coming over with friends and it would be fine. i got annoyed because i KNOW these immature, young friend crowd he can't leave behind and they slam doors and laugh like a gaggle of geese and i hate them. we're not in high school anymore we're almost all 30. it's saturday and I'm not going out. if you want to go out - go the fuck out. respect the people who are paying tenants and let them sleep.

he called me to tell me they were coming for sure. woke me up. this was at 2 am. an hour later...
he brought them over. woke me up to let them inside the gate. i was frustrated. 

i let it slide. they eventually got here. made a bunch of noise. i texted him if they could please keep it down. they didn't. texted again. hour passed. text again. texts get more pleading.
eventually hours have passed and i go outside and say hey its 5 am please I need to sleep i have homework and stuff I have to resolve tomorrow. 

eventually we're at a stand still because he's just staring at me. it was a big deal for me to have to go outside to ask them to keep it down. i can't believe common courtesy is that much of a problem. not only were they loud inside they were loud OUTSIDE even worse because the mom has gotten warnings from the neighbors before about noise complaints. this is not a good three strikes you're out situation for her. she could get kicked out of the neighborhood for stuff like that. they're drinking, blazing up, total disregard...being SUPER loud. obviously i can hear it especially next to the window near the bed because the window is near outside where they are. and them being inside is also terrible. they just can't keep down the noise.

eventually the standstill starts rifting into ""well you should be grateful to be here you only pay a small portion of what it is to rent here"" like wtf? you want me to pay 1/2? i'm not 1/2 of what the population in the household anyway. plus there's no basic utilities. wtf am i paying for? + the fact you're subjecting me to something that's worse than staying at a crummier place with peace and quiet. 
i am paying your mom money. that still counts. if two people go to get a movie ticket and one gets a discount because they know the friend would they not complain if someone is being ridiculously loud in the theater? like wtf????? 

so it got really bad. the argument. he disrespected me in front of a group of people by assuming common courtesy is defined by how much money I pay and to somehow imply that me being grateful is subtracted by the fact that I am requesting a biological need like sleep. I didn't sleep all night. I was patient practically all night. he says i threatened him LOL that my tone was menacing

if polite texts + coming outside and saying please I would like to sleep is menacing then wow

what planet am I living in.

how could this situation been handled differently?

135,"I went to a store that my wife and I frequent, while waiting for my wife to get off work.  The location I went to is not the one we usually go to, and lo-and-behold, my ex girlfriend from 14 years ago works there.  We were shocked to see each other.  It was cordial, we hugged, gave a 20 second rundown of how our lives are going and I left.  

Then it started.  She started texting me that night around 1 A.M.  Nothing NSFW or anything.  Just stuff like ""I never thought I'd see you again!  We should all (my wife and I, plus her) should get together for drinks!""  

A touch of background:  She's EXTREMELY bi-polar.  When we ended our relationship, we were living together, and she kept accusing me of calling her ""crazy,"" ""a bitch,"" etc., which never happened.  It was a weird ending to a whirlwind relationship.  We met a few times after that, but in the end, we ended on a weird note.  And now... now I've been incredibly happily married since 2012.  My wife and I do everything together, and I love my life.  She, on the other hand, had to end a career, move back in with her parents, and still acts as though she's in her 20s (drinking, staying up all hours of the night, etc.).  In short, we have NOTHING in common, and I definitely have NO feelings toward her.  I'm completely indifferent to her.

I say all that, because she's been persistently texting me, but only between midnight and 5 A.M.  This morning was the first in a few days, and it just said ""I remember you saying that you guys are really busy until August.  When in August?""  I've been COMPLETELY open with my wife about this, because I don't even want the appearance of anything funky.  She sees every text, etc.  At first, she was like ""yeah, I'd like to meet her.""  but mostly because my wife is a psych student with a nursing degree.  But after a few more texts, and he friending me on Facebook, my wife is more on the side of ""Why would I want to hang out with her?  You two have nothing in common, and I know I wouldn't either.""  And in general, I realized, I do not care to see her ever again.  

Where I need advice is, in how to handle this.  Because I'm a grown ass adult, I should just be able to text her and say ""Look.  We were together 14 years ago.  We have nothing in common, and I don't want to make my wife uncomfortable by hanging out.  Plus, you text at the dumbest times.""  (In better words)  

However, I also know how unstable she is.  And part of me just wants to block her number, block her facebook, and get on with my life.  How would you all handle it?",16Jul2017,14
137,"English is not my native language.

I cant solve this can you help me? So, i have a best friend for 8 years now but i feel this friendship is a toxic waste since day one. He is a whining crybaby mostly and i am his motional trash. Since i know him he whines a lot about stuffs. Girls, life, or he hates this digital life and so on. Now we are at that point where he whines at least once a week.

And i dont know wtf he wants because he just busting his stuffs but never ask for advice like ""what would you do?"". No, just petty crybaby stuffs like ""ehh i cant solve this problem at work"" or ""ehh i think i have a drinking problem"". And im always try to give advice. Sometimes write a help guide book lenght as an answer, sometimes just a few cheering words. And thats not enough. 

But when i write down my problem there is mostly no answer. Maybe a ""ehh thats sux"". And when i dont write a lenghti answer what he wants to hear he acting out. Maybe i have things to do, or dont have the knowledge to answer, or im not at home and this is the reason. And he thinks when im home i jump immediatelly when he wants.  When we meet he whines to.

He knows that he sometimes using me as an emotional trash. He thinks its a thing what best friends do because im the only one who listenes this. He likes alcohol because of escape. I have an alcoholic herritage but luckily i dont like it. Still he using me to have a reason to get drunk and i go with him. He buys me alcohol just not to see him as an alcoholic. And we sitting on a waste while drunk.

I always tried to be constructive, cheerfull back then. There was time when i jumped to listen his girl problems. I always ask around or invest in his problems. But i will be honest. Now ive bored with it and i dont care anymore. I just dont. I have my own problems, goals. And i tried to fix this. Really. But i just dont think is this how friendship works. I have nobody now. No connection with life just him. But he has a ton of other friends. Other activities. Whom dont use as an emotional trash rather than a time waster.  He is the connection to those people. I dont know how to get friends. People was never interested about me. But i really want friend. But i dont know how to get.

142,"This is going to be a long read, but I am at a loss as to what to do and need honest help. I REALLY need help.  I can't think clearly anymore and things are getting out of hand. Please, reddit. I need somebody to hear this and tell me what they would do. 

I am a 25 year old female who has been in a deep and pervasive two year long depression that I cannot climb out of. I have tried therapy, multiple medications, CBT, and I am very healthy and in shape. I don't have a strong social support system due to a chain of stressful life events that separated me from my friends and prohibited me from forming new friendships. I am at a complete standstill, rock bottom, and have been for a year. I am making no progress and am watching the days go by extremely distressed and eager to have a normal life. 

I am isolated and my mental capacity, decision making skills, and social skills are quickly deteriorating to non-existent. I can feel it happening, and it is immensely painful. I am living day by day, just dragging my feet... because I am unsure what to do about the situation I am in.

I used to be extremely sharp, passionate, and involved. At 18 I got accepted to one of the top universities in the country. Both of my parents, however, were physically and mentally abusive and did not want me to escape the environment they had me trapped in. They are very poor, and were using my money as a major source of support. Going off to college threatened this. Before I turned 18 which was shortly before graduating high school, my father drained all the money from my bank account that I had been personally saving for my education, as I knew they were going to try to prohibit me from attending school. I was then berated that I didn't have enough money to move myself to college, was bullied because I had no full time job lined up in that city at the time, and was scared into attending a school a 45 minute commute away in the next city so I could work full time to afford school while living at home. 

I was set up. My mother decided to begin attending school at this time as well. They used me to support her online education. She quit her part time job, to focus on her two online classes a semester. In my second semester of college, my parents divorced, my father disappeared across the country to another family and drained the bank accounts, my little sister who was in high school got pregnant, and we lost our home. 

I was left sleeping in my car in a very cold environment while trying to locate housing for myself, my sister, and my mother. My mother could not get housing anywhere because of the foreclosure on her record, and she had no job.

I did not know, at the time, that I could have taken a break from school. My mother had broke my computers throwing temper tantrums about her schoolwork so I was not able to research these things on my own between working 40 hours a week, a full course load and sleeping in my car. 

Eventually, I got sick, needing to see a neurologist, MRI's, EMG's, ect. at 19 which was extremely scary, and which I went through/ paid for completely alone in the midst of all of this.  

I told nobody. I did not tell my school counselors because I thought I could not/ should not tell them personal information. I did not tell other family members. I only told my boyfriend who was my age and was also struggling. 

Eventually, all of this ended up destroying my college record. I did not have a computer, I did not have money for books, or even for a pencil. My parents refused FASFA completion, and certainly were not cosigning on any loans. My mom, however, got FASFA money and loans.

 I kept trying to attend classes, because I literally did not know I could have withdrawn or taken time off. It was a bigger public school, so it was easy for this type of thing to go unnoticed by advisors. I thought college was this super-rigid, no excuses thing, and that I had no choice but to plod through. This led to a year and a half of failed courses, literally. 15 F's. Most of them attendance- based. Most of them failed BEFORE the withdraw period, if I only knew I could have withdrawn when then happened. But I did not, and kept attending even after I got an ""F"" for attendance. 

I got kicked out of college for 2 years. I was supposed to have a meeting with my advisor, who was supposed to tell me about an appeals process but he was fired at this time and his students ended up getting swept under the rug. 2 years later I leaned this... and was in shock that I just wasted a ton of time that I did not need to. I could have had grades retroactively withdrawn... I could have appealed things on multiple accounts but was not informed of any of my options. 

In that 2 year break I worked full time in marketing, writing, and some programming and got away from my family. I moved across the country to a tech based city and excelled. This was not something I was interested in, my dream, or the track I ever wanted to take but rather something I fell into for survival. 

But I had looming over my head the fact that I was trapped from actually starting a life there if I ever, EVER wanted to finish school. I could not transfer due to my atrocious GPA (that couldn't really ever be repaired after so many F's). I had countless meetings with school advisors who told me even if I aced my way through a CC I would never be accepted anywhere, again. 

So I had to come back. To a city I hated, to a toxic environment. This was about a year and a half ago. I came back, learned there was so much I could have done... and it was shock. The whole 4 year span through struggling with all of that I was in 10-level stress every single day. It never left my mind and ate away at me. 

I moved across the country with my boyfriend and one day had an enormous mental breakdown, before having to come back to fix this. I used to be so good, and the life I was living was such a huge far cry from who I am and was. 

I came back. I put my head down, and I soldiered through fixing this thing as best as I could (I think). I got all but two of the F's changed to W's (although most of then were ""F"" before the withdraw period and in my opinion should have been removed from my script altogether if I had basis for removal of them). I took on 7 courses at a time in a year and a half period, aced them all, and somewhat repaired an irreparable GPA. 

I also isolated myself studying and digging myself out of this huge hole. Appealing grades years and years later is a very difficult thing to do, at least at this school where they are rigid and systemically failing students for profit.

I've been dragging this problem around for 7 years now. Everyday it has haunted me. I'm still not through school after all of this. My resume is super choppy-- good, professional-level jobs and a stop and go school record which I do not know how to convey in a nice way.

I have never got to try any of the things I was actually interested in pursuing as a career (performance based, don't need a degree).

I never got to really take ANY time to consider what I wanted, it has all been repairing damage and survival.

My boyfriend of many, many years (the one who was there the whole time) recently broke up with me because my depression got so disabling and scary. I have been doing therapy, meds, everything, however, to get better and nothing was working. He left me for another girl, and kicked me out of the apartment (she has since moved in).

I am living with my abusive mother, her husband, his 32 year old son, my sister and her baby in a tiny house at the moment, because my things got thrown out so last minute by my ex. I had no time to get anything lined up.

My mother got to graduate school, but not me. A man married her and took care of everything. 

All I ever wanted to do was to escape the abusive environment I was put in, and I can't seem to because of the problems it caused me. 

So, here is my dilemma.

**Mental Health**: Nothing is helping, have become 100% non-functional due to this. Suicidal thoughts (would never, ever act on it but for some reason threaten it and think about it, being honest). Have tried and tried to no avail. The circumstance I am in is just too much, and the level of chronic stress I endured insane.

**School** Have applied for transfer to about 15 schools for the fall semester. Was too ambitious, and applied for too many top tier schools that were just not going to accept me (the thing is, I was smart enough for them before and thought there was a huge upward trend in my transcript where they would obviously understand something went down). Applying for transfer with a mess of a transcript is a horrid experience. I do not know how to explain what happened to me, I do not want to relive any of it, and it is exhausting. 

I have been accepted to one of the top 10 public universities in the US. (I should have applied to more of this level of school, as I think I could be accepted to more). It is in-state, I have been given multiple grants and scholarships to cover the full cost of attendance.

I do not want to live in a smaller college town.

I came back to fix things to move back out of state, to a bigger city where I thrive and can be social. Coming back has been so very isolating, and I fear a college town at 25 is going to be awful for me.

I have also been accepted to some last minute application, mediocre schools in the city I wish to live, where I feel happier and healthier and can try everything that has been put on hold in my life WHILE finishing school.

Or I can try applying for the spring semester instead in an attempt to get into a higher tier school where I would like to live, but that is wasting more time. 

... or I just stop going. Try the things I want, move where I am happy and figure things out from there.

**Environment/ work**: While I was fixing this I was only working part time. This creates a mess resume and I do not know how to float myself through all of this. 

**Social**: 2 years ago I deleted my facebook and social media. I did not want to see my friends graduating and moving on as I held my breathe just waiting to fix things. I isolated myself to study, and work, write appeals, and complete transfer applications. I came out of this looking to reconnect with my friends, who were also mutual friends of my boyfriend. When we broke up, I lost all of them to him, as I went MIA and didn't keep up my facebook for anyone to be able to reach out. I'm approachable and people want to be friends with me but I let nobody get close because I am so ashamed and embarrassed and up in the air. On the outside you would never suspect this, because none of this is who I am. 

I do not know what choices to make. I just want to have a chance at trying the things I actually wanted. It's going to be a decade wasted to fixing school problems. This also separated/ separates me from others my age who are through school and free to build the lives they please. I want this so badly. Don't know whether to just give up school altogether and move on. I just want to live like a normal 25 year old so bad, I deserved it and actually did quite well for myself when I was not in school. All of my coworkers were grads from very good universities. 

I don't know what to do. With school, work, mental health wise, socially, financially. It is all a mess and I am not functioning at all anymore. 

**TLDR**: 25 years old, put in perpetually bad circumstances by family that destroyed college record, fixed college record after prolonged stress, became isolated, do not know what choices to make from here.

**Please excuse horrendous writing, I just needed to try to get things out.**",16Jul2017,5
143,"It is a Sunday when I write this and I feel this absolute sadness of thinking about having to go back to my research internship tomorrow. My internship is 10 weeks and I have four weeks left and my internship is a 9-5 from M-F. 

I don't hate my research in my internship but rather am frustrated and annoyed by my ""mentor"" in my internship who I consider to be a bully to an extent. He is already constantly criticizing me for the littlest of things and giving me disgusting faces. The internship is 10 weeks and I've survived the first six weeks so far by keeping close contact with my family and close friends. I always talk to them whenever I have the chance to destress and let out my frustration. I've also made small treats for myself after work like getting dinner with my mom and watching Netflix and made long term treats like going to a BBQ and watching movie after this long week. Doing things like this for the past 6 weeks is what has gotten me through those weeks.

However, now it's a Sunday and even with Game of Thrones coming on tonight, something I love, I feel the happiness sucked out whenever I think about the fact that tomorrow is a Monday and I still have four more weeks.

 Some of my friends and family have suggested I quit but with 6 weeks done already I just want to see this program through. So

So, I'm here looking for advice from people who were in my situation before on what they did to get through an intimidating boss or an internship they dreaded. Even just some encouraging stories or words would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for the long post but I'm just dreading work right now and I just needed to let my feelings out.

144,"I recently started a job but I'm finding it really difficult to carry on because of anxiety, I've suffers with anxiety for about a year now and can deal with it fine, whilst I'm in control of what I do, but at work I'm really out of my comfort zone and it's weighing on me.

I have spent the last year trying to sort my life out, I learnt coding, I stopped smoking weed and tobacco, fixed my sleeping and tried to get healthier, so I thought the next step would be to get a job and bring some money in, but its only been a week and I feel pretty horrible, the work isn't too difficult but there is a steep learning curve and I'm receiving no help from my manager, which means I just spend 99% of my time asking ""what's this?"" Or ""how do I do this?"" And I can see its visibly getting my team annoyed, but I have no choice because I've never done this job before and they expect me to be an expert, and I feel like shit at the end of the day, which makes my anxiety bad.

Also I am struggling for time, I enjoy having my own time but I've literally not managed to do one thing I enjoy since starting, I'm out the door at 6:30am and I get back at 7:00pm, get some food and basically go bed, and I don't get the point of making money if the only things I actually enjoy doing I cant, I want a job and money, but I don't want to sacrifice the things I love for it, when I'm 30 and I have kids and responsibilities no doubt I'd sacrifice things, because its about priorities, but I don't have any ATM, so its different.

I'm not sure if I should quit and look for another job, the job itself isn't bad, once I get good at it I'd be able to essentially not try at all and get paid good money for it, but with the 3 hours a day travelling, steep learning curve and anxiety, combined with the fact I'm not sure why I really need a job ATM, i'm not sure if its worth it, I can go university in September, but thought a job route might have been better, although now I'm not so sure, I'm also not sure if I'm just making up excuses because of my anxiety and lack of motivation.

I'm just wondering if anyone has some advice, I'm not sure what I'm going to do, and no one else can answer that but me, but some insights or reasons why I'm a baby would be good, sometimes its hard to see the forest for the trees. Thanks!",16Jul2017,1
146,"To put things into perspective, I've suffered from rejection my whole life. I've dealt with fear of being rejected by my peers and thus limits what I do in terms of social interaction. I can't take risks because I'm afriad, but for good reason. Anytime I try I seem like a creep, and I've tried to improve on this and it just makes things worse and I like weird or crazy. When I actually had a group of friends, the head of the group was a sociopath who singled me out and turned everyone against me. He would basically twist my eccentric behavior into malice in the minds of others. So I left. No one cares. I tried dating apps, to little to no avail. The only way I got into contact with other people was through Facebook, and this severely limits what I can do and who I interact with. I found a girl on there, we went on a date and talked for a month and she seemed interested in me, but I became too overbearing and said too much too quick and scared her off. I surprised her at her job with flowers one day, and she at first told me she really appreciated them. But when I went home the next day she said she was creeped out by it and was uncomfortable. Any good action I've tried to take has been misunderstood. It doesn't help that I get nervous and make myself appear as some serial killer because I'm monotone and stoic. I'm afraid of death. I'm afriad of life. I'm afraid of what's to come. I can't leave my room and the only minor satisfaction I have is from video games. I'm addicted and can't find a way to leave them.

150,"(Warning: english is not my first language) 

Everybody around me seem like they know what they want to do with their lives. Many of my friends knew that already in middle school, but I didn't. I still don't. I still don't know what the fuck do I want, I lived in 4 different cities, tried different things, studied 3 different majors, but failed after first semester every time because I lost interest and everything I tried I didn't gave me any joy. I don't even know why the fuck I am even alive, I just eat, shit, work out and sleep and work at a shitty job with no future. My parents think I am soon done with college but in reality I am considering to hang myself.
I am a lazy piece of shit who hasn't done anything productive since I left high school. The only positive thing I do is taking care of my body. I eat healthy, don't smoke and don't drink alcohol, I excercise regurarly because I feel if I didn't do these things I would be dead long time ago because of this constant stress and anxiety that I have no fucking future. I don't consider myself dumb, but I know I am not very smart either. I am just average. I've always been average in everything. I did okay in high school because I felt I was forced to, by my teachers and parents so I had motivation. 
I can't even talk about this with my parents because they would not understand and they would be devastaed if they found out how I really feel about my life. They also work at shitty jobs and they did not even finish high school. My two older siblings turned to drugs and one of them is in a mental hospital. The other is a pothead and also work at a shitty job but he seems like he's okay with it.  All of my family members both on my mother's and father's side are either alcholics or drug addicts, and rest of them have shitty jobs. I am starting to feel that this is actually what I was meant to be too. The only reason it didn't happen is because my parents moved to a more developed country when I was 12. I was put in a very nice envoirement with intelligent people and I always felt like I didn't belong there, but somehow I managed to do allright untill the age of 19. I feel like I am wasting my life, I haven't felt happy in many years,  I just wait for something that will never happen. I've never had a girlfriend either because as long as I am in this shit state, I don't want to put other people down by my misery. 
I had to work since I was 17, and moved from my parents when I was 19. So I made my own money since the age og 17. I did survive for these 4-6 years on my own, made my own food etc but I never felt like pursuing any career. There was a period of time where I did absolutely nothing for 6 months, except for eating and working out, I havent even talked with anybody, just some chatting through game with strangers and occasionaly calling my parents. And the scary thing is I didn't even mind doing that. But right now I start to feel this is a sin to be such a waste to this world, where I can't contribute to anything. All I want right now is to live at least one day where I feel like I matter. This shit hurts my heart. 

The problem is, I feel like I have potential to become something more, that is why I feel so shitty, but at the same time I have no fucking idea what I want. I feel like if I put my mind to something I could maybe achieve it, but without any excitment. And I feel working at a job that I am not passionate about is something I don't want to do. I have no passion for anything. I am jelous of people who are passionate about something, I am not. I do like working out, but I am still not really passionate about it, I just like it to a certain level, just like everything else. 
I just need somebody who could point me in a right direction because it seems I can't do it for shit.

If you read to this point, thank you very much and I am sorry again for my broken english. ",16Jul2017,69
151,"I've known this girl for a while (she's in college now and I'm still in my senior year of high school). We hadn't talked in person for a while cause she lives kinda far away. When we used to hang out it was always a sort of big sister-little brother type of thing. 

We've been hanging out a lot this summer and yesterday we made plans to take some shots and go to a party. At one point I pulled her aside and told her that I liked her. She was kinda surprised but she admitted that she'd been thinking I was cute for a while too. 

Later that night, when I was dropping her off, we pulled over and decided we would talk about it. She told me to re-evaluate everything when I was sober but then she moved in closer and we made out for like 30 minutes.

So here we are now. I'm kinda confused and not sure what to do. I really do want to be with her but I want to make sure I say everything the right way and at the right time. I also want to be a 100% sure she is ok with us having a relationship before I ask her. Advice?

**TL;DR: Made out with a girl who seemed kinda flaky about having a relationship and need to talk to her soon about moving forward. Need some advice.**",16Jul2017,7
152,"so, my fiance has bipolar disorder and extreme depression. when I met her she was completely un-treated for her symptoms and things werent going well for her. since we've been together she has sought treatment. the first place she tried basically kept rescheduling her appointments and then refused her service claiming she missed too many appointments, when she hadnt actually missed any. She finally found a place that accepted her health insurance and actually helped her, untill the Dr. who was running the practice had died and left over 6000 people without help. she finally got ahold of another place that accepted her insurance but wont see her for nearly a month. This doesnt sound too bad and I didnt think it would be that bad, but she's already lost her job and I cant do anything to get her out of bed these days. if anyone has advice Id really appreciate it.",16Jul2017,1

157,"Some context: I live in the South and currently riding a heat/high humidity wave, 3 bedroom two bathroom house with wife and three girls.
Outside air unit began malfunctioning yesterday morning. Only vented air from the blower fan from the unit, no condenser fan or compressor running. 
Called a few places and found one business that works on Saturdays and agreed to pay their $119 diagnostic fee. 
Guy comes out, takes a look, mentions he hasn't been doing this for very long and this is the first time he's seen a unit from 1997. Guy does a test or two and it seems everything is working..great!
Guy makes a short call the tells me he thinks the compressor may be on its way out and is probably no longer compressing the freon (note that he never hooks up a gauge to check the pressures).
I am then told that my only option at this time is to wait until the part store is open on Monday (it's Saturday before noon) and that my best bet would be to replace the entire thing, especially if the compressor is on its way out and needs replacing.

Shit. Okay. I make arrangements for the kids to stay in climate controled environments and prepare for the next how ever many days it may take to repair. 

Wife and I decide to get a second opinion from someone with 26 years of experience on the subject. 

Guy comes, bypasses the logic board with a jumper wire and it starts up no problems. After a few more tests he concludes the logic board is bad. Easy fix compared to completely replacing for sure.

Of course I should be prepared for the 20 year model to be replaced soon, but such a task is not a great option when one of us is a stay at home parent.

My question is this. Should I demand a refund for a very poor diagnosis? I'm not mad at the tech, I'm mad at the company for letting this happen. He shouldn't have been there alone and I paid $120 for someone to tell me I'm screwed and to wait until Monday. 

Or should I go directly to management and tell them about the situation at hand? I want the company to not make this kind of decision in the future and finacially screw someone over who may take the techs word for it and replace an entire unit because of a misdiagnosis.
 
Or should I post a review of the company on social media platforms informing any future clients of the bad practice they have at this moment? I say at this moment because 6+ years ago the same company was used to diagnose and repair my units condenser fan with no problem.",16Jul2017,2
160,"Phone calls give me anxiety. I hate the intrusion. Much more of a text guy, and I try to incorporate that in my dealings with people by treating them as I would like to be treated. If I feel I need to call someone, I will text first. ""Ok if I give you a call?""' 

I have become ""friendly"" with a co-worker basically because our kids get along well. He phones me ALL THE TIME. Once on the phone with him, he will blather on for at least 20 minutes. I have stopped answering his calls and will instead reply with a text. ""Busy with my daughter, can't answer phone, what's up?""

162,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. I live in a 4 bedroom house and make extra money by renting out 3 of the rooms.

I let a long time friend move in with his girlfriend. At the time of the move in, there had been another tenant there for over a year. He was promised a quiet house with no parties.

The long time friends girlfriend constantly had people over, among other issues. The long term tenant HATED her.

The situation ended up resolving its self when the couple broke up. 

The couple has reconciled. I was told she was moving back in Wednesday. I immediately told my friend ""No, she's not welcome to move back in. She pissed off my easiest and most stable tenant to no end.""

So a couple days after that, he comes to me with this prepared speech as to why I should let her come back. He makes a ton of promises, so I cut him a deal.

The deal was, if he can convince the long term tenant that it's ok for her to stay, she can stay.

Me and my friend approached him, I mediated as a neutral.

They came to an agreement that she, can't do drugs in the house or anywhere else, she cannot have even one friend over EVER, and she must be gainfully employed at all times as an occupation other than stripper.

I'm going to write up a contract for her to sign that has all these rules. It's also going to say if she breaks them she's out on the spot, no 30 day notice.

My concern is that the long term tenant really REALLY hates her with a passion and he might have felt cornered. On the other hand, he's not a pushover in the least bit, and he did agree to this deal.

A little backstory as to why I'm even floating the idea of letting her move in: When she lived here she wasn't a drug addicted stripper. She basically went on a downward spiral after the breakup. I have a lot of experience with drug addicts and I fully believe she can kick the habit. On the other hand, if she doesn't, the contract will get her out of my house immediately.

Basically all I'm asking is if I was being fair to my other roommate by giving him the final say. My thoughts were ""If he's going to make rules, he can go ahead and enforce them.""

163,"So i have a lot of problems with my thoughts/feelings etc... Im pretty sure its OCD (which a psychologist once said, but i only could afford to go 4x in the past). But what happened was, i talked to this girl online. I liked her, it felt like we both liked each other, but just as friends. However, i have a very high libido, so i was trying to make the friendship more intimate, almost like a FWB kind of situation. In the beginning she said she was conservative, but that she did have sex etc... But as we kept talking, i send her intimate things, nothing too bad etc, she took it well etc... However, i asked her if i could see her in a bra, which she was not so sure about, so i didn't push her or anything, she even said it herself that she just doesn't want to be pressured, which i didn't. But we kept talking to each other and she told me multiple times she didn't mind me asking and being intimate, cause she says she knows thats how i am.

Now yesterday, i gave her compliments and stuff and one of the first times i sent her something nude, she took it really well. After a bit of complimenting and stuff, i even got her to promise that she would send me a picture of her in a bra later today.

The problem is that my thoughts are killing me about this. I feel so happy that she finally feels safe and good enough to do it. But i also feel like i manipulated her or something? I feel like i did/said all of that just to see that picture, but at the same time i actually like her (as a friend) and i do think she is attractive, but i feel like i kinda exaggerated or something? Im not sure, i get a lot of thoughts that tell me im horrible, i manipulated her etc.. So i feel like telling her now what i say on here, because i dont want to lie and dont want her to do it if she doesn't want to..

I was expecting a positive reply such as ""That's so cute. Of course you can go as every teenager should do."" but OMG, she got really angry and blamed my girlfriend of behaving improperly. Considering the local culture and customs, she is right but I couldn't think of it when I was telling her about this. Moreover, I talked to my girlfriend about what happened and I told her my family didn't allow me to have a vacation and right after that, she got angry, too and told me that she hides me and this holiday from her own family. Then I understand she makes sacrifice and by telling my mom about her and her intentions for holiday together with me, I fucked up everything.

I'm around the age of a preteen. High school is beginning, and I thought I was physically ready.

I then realized that the 1-hour workouts I were committing to daily actually was shaping me up for the real deal, so although I didn't waste 50+ hours of my life, I feel as if I could've done more.

I don't have access to a gym (I should mention that I'm very skinny, and whenever I ask to hit a gym, my mother says I'll get snapped in half trying to complete a rep).

I know general push-ups, sit-ups, etc. help, but can someone give me the full exercise?

Currently, this is my plan:

-25 push-ups (increase by five)
-30 sit-ups (increase by 10)
-30 seconds of six inches (increase by 5 seconds)
-30 seconds of wall sits (increase by five seconds)
-Cycling for one minute (increase by 20 seconds)

30 Second Break

Repeat with increases

I should note that I never put this into play (yet). Is here anything that should be added/reduced?

171,"So we have a pretty complicated situation here.
There's this girl I really liked, about 3 years ago (I'm a girl). We were... you can't call it friends. Basically she was depressed and suicidal and always said I was the only one she could tell about this because her other friends don't understand. I did stupid things like smoking and drinking because that's what she did and I wanted to be close to her. Again, I was the only one who knew she did those things, so we were alone when this happened. But in school she never spoke to me. Hell, she didn't even look at me. Not once did she greet me in the morning. But at night she would text me saying she's crying and she wants to self harm and I had to help her calm down. This happened a lot. I became very anxious and insecure because of this, I have no idea what went through my head back then but I used to tell her that I hated life too and wanted to kill myself etc.. It wasn't true, but I wanted her to feel that I cared about her and that I understood what she was going through. When we were together she was very touchy and told me very personal things. We kind of were close, but then again we weren't. Also, she used to 'jokingly' flirt with me, texting me things like 'I'm just wearing underwear right now' and shit like that. Even after I told her I was in love with her that didn't stop. She basically brushed my confession off with 'ohw that's so sweet of you' - she neither said 'I love you too' nor 'I don't like you that way', so she didn't take me seriously, she just thought I was being nice. But I really loved her. I loved her so much that it hurt. I missed her the second she hung up the phone. I was lying awake at night thinking about her and listening to her favourite music, sometimes crying too. Thinking back to it, that was probably the first time I was REALLY in love, not just having a crush on someone. My mood was entirely dependent on her. I was happy when she complimented me, and I felt like I was dying when she didn't have time or was angry at me. That's not healthy, I know that. Eventually it became rarer that she had time for me (she kept on seeing her other friends as much as usual), and at some point we lost touch completely. Now, in the year 2017, not having spoken to her for about 2 years, I'm still not over it. When I hear people mentioning her I feel sick, same thing when I hear a song she recommended to me back then. I still look through her tumblr from time to time, wondering why we don't talk anymore. I have felt so strange about her over the past few years. I've hated her. I've loved her. I've felt indifferent. I just don't know what to do anymore. I tried to forget her but it won't work. Why am I still thinking about this? She has clearly moved on and had several boy- and girlfriends, so why can't I do the same? I'm not in love anymore but I'm still thinking about her (not all the time, maybe like every other day). She has just hurt me so bad. What do I do to make it stop? How do I move on? Any advice would be helpfull.",16Jul2017,8

I'm 15 currently living with both my parents, an older autistic brother, and my younger 14 year old sister. Our life is honestly really nice, my parents are back together after some drama and it's all good. We're a religious household (Christian), and both of us go to public school.

My sister has been having a lot of trouble lately, mainly with the fact that she cannot for the life of her, take ANY sort of criticism in any way. Not in a snotty ""I'm-better-than-you-way"", she will break down and start crying at any pressure or any criticism of her character. 

Here's an example: 
My sister loves her phone, she goes on Amino (a community chat/fandom app) to interact with her friends. But she's a little obsessed. When my mom tried to help her with restricting her time (she's on it for 8+ hours during the summer time), she freaked out and started crying. We kept trying to get her on a schedule of some sort, but it'll always end with her uncontrollably crying until we reach some sort of agreement. 

I don't really know what to do or how to help her. My mom thinks she needs to grow thicker skin or it'll really hurt her in the future as she's growing up. It's gotten to the point where if she's failing in a class or missing schoolwork, she won't ask a teacher for help because she's scared they'll yell at her or criticize her.  

What should I do to help her out?

This guy that I am dating is very nice to me, he's one of the nicest guys I've met, and he have a strong connection. However, we both find ourselves feeling frustrated because of the family politics. It's impacting our relationship. I have been able to date a different guy with my mom knowing about it before. My mom had to meet the guy, she got to know him, and then we got to out by ourselves. For some reason when I try to do the same thing now with a different guy, she does not respond to it well at all. I've had to lie to my mom a lot because she is so uptight. I've basically had to live a double life. Another thing that may be contributing to the problems that I'm having is that this new guy is different. He has long hair, he has more art related hobbies (he was an arts student), and he is more like me because I'm different too. I would consider my mom to be conservative and I think that these things about him would turn her off. Like I said, my mom is very overbearing and she likes control. The other guy I dated (with her knowing about it) was more laid back and conservative. So I think that made it less difficult to talk about. (This newer guy I met is more compatible with me and we have a lot more in common. He's a better match for me overall.) Sorry about the long story, but I would just like some good advice and some communication strategies I can try on my mom to make things better. I have a very big problem on my hands, it is very hard to deal with and very stressful. (I've known this new guy for like a year already.) My mom and I have a lot of differences, unfortunately I don't think she can learn to just accept it and move on. One suggestion I've already gotten for this problem is to just be straightforward with my mom, keep it simple, and just tell her. Like I can't come up to her and just say, ""I want to talk to you"" because that puts her on the defense. Any more suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",16Jul2017,1

I know he owns a business in a neighboring state and I know the business information and  I recently found out he has a Facebook page. I have been considering reaching out to him. I do not want anything other than to connect with him and get to know him if he wants the same. I do understand he might not, however I feel like it is worth a try.  How should I go about this? What should I say to open the conversation?",16Jul2017,1
211,"at my daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have 
it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable 
and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause 
distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting 

My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is 
this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this 


this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? 

can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? 


School management should arrange different time table for boys and girls for swimming. Boys and girls can attend same class at the same time to know each other. They also can work in the same group in debate competition, in quiz games. Those things will be enough for boys and girls to know each other. There is no need to arrange swimming in the same pool at the same time. 


I am shocked that SCHOOL of all places allow this. This is not like a public pool that is voluntary to go to. This is part of school curriculum and they are providing this avenue to look at bathing suit clad students to kids. This is not a public pool that is voluntary to go, this is a school of all places 


this seems like a very bold thing for a school to do 


whose idea were these classes? These classes only seem to benefit males and it gives them an opportunity in school to leer at their female classmates in bathing suits. Why create a class just for boys to look at girls basically? I just don't get it



I am thinking of going and asking if boys and girls can be separated or if boys can be required to wear shirts while swimming",16Jul2017,0
213,"So, I discovered a few days ago my rommate was eating my butter (without asking me before, nor simply saying :``yo, I used your butter, I didn't have any`.  I confronted him, he just said ``oh ok`` then tried blaming the girl he brought over the night before. 

 Today, he did his laudry while I was at work and used my fabric softener (after I told him to get his own a week ago since I was the only one paying for it).

216,"I've always been very insecure in my past relationships, and it's been a huge problem for me. My main issue is I become intimidated by girls who I think are better than me or more attractive. For some reason, a girl in my sorority has gotten under my skin this past year. She's not very pretty but I've heard about her sleeping around and I've seen her always dressing slutty to get attention. In truth I think I'm insane for feeling any envy because she doesn't seem to have anything going for her other than her body. Shes a senior with no plans after college, she was on academic probation, and frankly she's a bitch. She is however a very flirtatious person and a lot of guys are always saying she's hot and they would fuck her. I've always been a tiny bit jealous of her because she received a lot of attention from guys and was super popular, but that was more of an admiration of her confidence. But then it got bad when I was at my formal with my SO of 5 months and I saw him watch her walk by in a low cut dress wearing a push-up bra and he said ""she's cool"". He said this because apparently when he's smoking with his frat brothers, she and some other girls from my sorority smoke with them and hang out. This stuck with me and kept me up at night thinking about how my boyfriend probably thinks she's hotter than me, and maybe that's true but if I think too hard about it I go crazy. The jealousy subsided later on until I went to visit my boyfriend at our university and while we were getting lunch she walked in wearing nothing but a thong bikini. And to make matters  worse my boyfriend told me he smoking with friends the other day and she was there. Now I just picture them hanging out talking while she's dressed slutty and wondering if my boyfriend wants to fuck her.
I know I sound jealous and crazy, i realize that if my boyfriend wanted anyone else he wouldn't be dating me. But she's just always so present and she seems to be everywhere reminding me of my insecurities. I want to know how to just ignore it. If there's anyone who's dealt with having a lack of confidence in relationships before, tell me the secret to ignoring all the sluts and just having trust in your SO. ",16Jul2017,2

 I have a gambling addiction that has relapsed recently when I was introduced to a new gambling site (this is CS:GO skins gambling). Since then I have been compulsively gambling regardless of whether I'm up or down, and it's costing me a lot of money.

225,"I'm about to sign a lease with a roommate (we just met each other recently). It is for a 2 bed 2 bath that costs $1245. There is a master bedroom which is larger, has an ensuite bathroom and a walk in closet. The other room is smaller, has a much smaller closet and the bathroom is outside the room. We are trying to figure out who gets the master bath and under what terms. The apartment comes with only one assigned covered parking space. 

I proposed to him 2 options. 

* One person gets the master bath. The other person gets the assigned parking space. We split rent 50/50
* The person that gets the master bedroom pays $40 more in rent than the other person (would also like feedback on this amount) . The assigned parking space is shared equally. 

He seemed a little confused by these options. When I gave option  2 of paying $40 more for the master he asked ""does that $40 also come with the parking space?"". I was like no wtf, if you pay the $40 that's for getting the master bed. The parking is shared equally. He wants some more time to think about it. 

So Reddit, I need your advice. Are my options reasonable? Is there a better way to decide? I personally have no preference for the master or the parking space - I just feel like it should be equal. On the other hand, he seems to think he can just get the master and share the parking space and pay equal rent. Any advice is appreciated!",16Jul2017,2
229,"Legally here, she isn't at the age of consent until 16. Her parents have talked to me about breaking them up, and my son has told me and them ""If you try to break us up we'll run away"".

Which would be kidnapping I think.

Is there a way to get them to break this up or is my son going to probably end up in jail or a criminal record for this...

Before you ask ""How far into 15 is she"". She turned 15 in June. She told him she'd be 16 in August. Her parents showed me proof of her birthday being June.

So, yeah, my son doesn't care. He's going through a ""I don't care about anyone but myself"" phase so he's not gonna listen to anything. The girl seems to be following his every word as if he's manipulating her.

I don't want my son arrested and put on a sex offender list for something stupid as this, yet it may happen.

So anyone got any advice on how to break these two up? Taking away his car is not an option as it's his car, I didn't pay for it so I can't take it away. The parents of the girl can't stop her because they both work during the day and can't be there to watch her.

So yeah, any tips on how to split this two would be helpful.",16Jul2017,20
231,"Hey everyone
This is my first time using reddit and idk if this is the right place to talk about this but here it goes.
So, i'm a Portuguese girl turning 17 in 20 days (August 6) and i'm caged at home.
My curfew is at 8pm and if i arrive 15 minutes late it's already an excuse for my parents (mostly my stepfather) to argue with me. Even tho i explain to them that it wasn't my fault (i use public transports to travel) they won't listen to me and proceed to scream at me saying that i'm an irresponsible, spoiled, out of control kid etc. I can't stand up for my self 'cause they will either take a privilege away from me(which i didn't ask for in the first place) or ground me. The one time i actually stood up for my self, my step father kicked the door (broking it) and touched his forehead with mine, staring at me in the eye. I calmly said ""oh what, you're gonna hit me?"". That happened because i tried to have a calm and mature conversation while he interrupted me to scream at me. So i said: Ok, look, I've been trying to be calm and mature with you and i'm not answering you until you do the same. and then that door thing happened. My mom pushed him by the arm and i went to my room and listened to them. He was saying that i'm a ""puta de merda"" (roughly translates to fucking whore in english) and stuff like that.
They have a really bad stereotypical vision of me and my friends.
They see us as stupid kids with no maturity or mentality.
Like most people, i want to be free and have fun without worrying about being 5 minutes late and being screamed at. I'm taking a 2D/3D course and most of the people i hang out with are 17-19 (almost20), the oldest being my bf of almost 2 years which they know AND LIKE. They all are free to go to parties and spend nights out. Yes, i'm aware they're older but i've known them since i'm 15 and they were already allowed to go out, even the ones my age. The only reason my mom gives me for not letting me go out is 'i don't like it'. If i ask her for another reason than ""i don't like it"" she turns her back on me and goes away. They must think I want to go to those bars to get drunk out of my mind and rub my ass in 30 year old guy's cocks when really, all i want to do (which is what my friends do) is walk around lisbon and just chill. Going to bars (not THOSE bars. There are a lot of nice places in downton lisbon to spend a good time with live bands, cheap drinks etc) and just goof around and have fun. Yes there is drinking and smoking (thc) involved but no one forces anyone to do anything if they don't feel comfortable with it. Personally, i'm not a big fan of alcohol so. If i may, i smoke hash and weed and started doing it at my own will, no one forced me to do anything. (Note: I never touched a cigarette and I never will).
I know i'm capable of knowing my limits and make my own decisions and i know that, contrary to what they think, i'm not influenced by other's decisions. Most of my friends smoke cigarettes and so did my mom and dad, meanwhile i never touched one.
Another thing they get freaked out about is the dangers the night might offer. Thing is, rarely less than 20 people go. we're a big group.
I've missed out on a lot of things because how over protective they are. Even to go to my friend's 17 years old birthday party (which was: going to the cinema and sleeping over at her house with no drinking, smoking and with parent supervision) was a problem. I never stayed out after 20:30 (not counting that birthday party)
I showed my mother a video of my friend being slapped across the face because he lost a stupid bet and she told it to my step father (making sarcastic imitations of my friends like ""LOOK AT ME I'M SO STUPID I'M GONNA HIT MY FRIEND""). she said:"" where and the moms and dads in these situations?"" to which he replied: ""see? what did i tell you? why do you think she showed you that"" i didn't hear what he said after that but then he said ""She's just one more sheep. She wants to be a part of their little group"".
The image they have of me and my friends disgust me. And the reason why this gets to me so much is how they treat me.
I mostly eat pre prepared food becuase my mom doesn't cook for shit and my step father (that actually knows how to cook) won't bother doing it. I would do it myself but i'm not allowed. They ground me for stupid shit like not closing the toothpaste lid and blame me for shit they did. they give me expensive shit that i don't ask for and call me an ungrateful spoiled brat later. 
I have good grades, i don't talk back, i follow their rules. I'm afraid of disobeying. I have a corn snake and she's my precious little baby and i'm afraid they'll do something to her if i don't do what they say.
I have a party in 10 days and i know i'm not going,again, and it fucking hurts.
Sorry for the long post, there's a lot more i could talk about but yeah, i kinda needed to let out some steam and hear someone's opinion and whatnot.",16Jul2017,2

235,"Greetings !

This is gonna be a pretty long text, so i appreciate if you could read and understand what i have to say..

All my life i've had ups and downs, i turned from the wildest kid who had many friends, many girlfriends, the happiest kid alive while living life like it was his last day to a hermit.

From 4th grade, i started playing video games DAILY. I loved this game called MapleStory. It was hella addictive, such as other games called Flyff, World Of Warcraft, Grand Fantasia etc..

Days, months and years passed by, even though i was a video game addict, i still had a few friend and did all kinds of shit, i even had some girlfriends too, but video games were still 5-7 hours a day a part of me, sometimes even more ! ( 10+ hours ) . I've quitted playing video games last year. I tried to get a life and live it. I did for some time but i just felt like this isn't for me, i just wanna stay at my safe zone and stay away from humans and their problems or just any kind of problems. I've faced many problems but i don't wanna live life anymore, i was the happiest when i was playing video games without living a stupid life with all the drama, all the stress and shit..

I hated school, i never was good at studying, i was mostly a class clown or just laughing at everything, rebellious and shit. I got some good grades such as 10+ from Biology, P.E and music, but those have no meaning to me.

I got a bit depressed when i left 9th grade, everyone went to different directions, and eventually so did i. I started studying at this vocational high school of security officers. I hated that place, i hated those people, adult hood happened, weed happened, problems happened, i eventually had a psychosis due to smoking weed with shitty people and i eventually dropped out of school. 

Now that life has been pretty clear and good for the past 2 years, it's still the same.. 

I don't know what i wanna be, i hate studying, i can't find a job, i'm not satisfied to a job that gives me 1,500 a month, i'm a lazy fuck to be honest.

I am very potential, and i am usually the BEST when i'm interested in something, i've always been like that. But hell i don't care about anything in this world, except for peaceful time by myself watching movies, playing video games or just taking a walk to the store while catching all the look from these pretty ladies, that's it.


I don't know how to explain how i feel right now, but i wanted to take a bunch of sleeping pills last night, but i couldn't find any and it was late anyway, all the stores were closed. 

My life is boring, i have no interest in socializing with people, and if i do, they always talk about something i don't give a shit, everyone. It makes my tired literally.

I even hate my parents, i've said many things to them, i've pushed my mom out of my room, broke things, hit a hole in the wall, done some stupid shit such as waste my dad's car gas just because i hate that asshole.

I hate this world, i wanna fucking see it burn, most people don't even deserve to live. 

I've always had a good heart, but i'm mostly evil and asshole and to some people i'm a dick nowadays. 

Yeah i don't care, but there's nothing for me here, except my dog, i've always loved animals more than humans.

Yes i wanna be a vet, always did. But it's too much work and time consuming so fucking forget it, i will never be a vet. 

I know what kind of careers there are and what my options are, but there are no interests for me. I just wish i had tons of money and i could just relax for the rest of my life and finally enjoy my life. 

I don't have any friends anymore, i never had many after 4th grade. I'm still a virgin even though i had many girlfriends, don't ask.

I'm pure shit. 

I'm not shy or unsocial or anything, i can do ANYTHING in this world, but i have no interest to do anything.

If my life continues this way after my dog is dead, i'm gonna take many sleeping pills and sleep away. 

How should i explain this............. i'm an aquarius

I just lay all day in my room, i grab something to eat and do my private stuff, that's it. Reason i don't have friends because i don't wanna be like them, most people are retards, idiots, braindead and shit. I have no interest with humans, and don't tell me i need to meet new people, i'm sick and tired of being around HUMANS.

I'm unemotional when it comes to humans, i only cry because of animals, and movies / anime, but that's it..

I even dropped out of military service since i don't want to be like others, i've always been unique and rebellious.

Say what you wanna say, but i really am serious about this sleeping pills thing. 

PS. I still live with my parents, and yes i use them for food. I only care about my dog, that's why i'm here mostly.",16Jul2017,1

238,"I am 36 years old. I have been to several different colleges and studied in programs such as IT Security, Pre-med, Game Design, Vetrinary Tech, and a few more.  I have had over 100 jobs since starting work at 15 years old.  I have never felt completely satisfied with almost anything I've done in a job. 

I'm scared I will never find true happiness in a career or even have a career.  I still have some desire to go to school but have no idea what to study.  

I am open to anything anyone wants to say about my life and what I've said.  My biggest question is what job is for me.  I've worked in factories, warehouses, retail, call centers, banks, towing, security, IT, automotive technician, janitor, sales, healthcare, and many more.  Of everything there have been only 2 roles i have really enjoyed.  I worked at a small private owned bookstore.  I enjoyed helping people with the needs that came to the store for but the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and truly getting to them on a personal level as we swapped stories and experiences.  The other role is a lot more recent where I worked as a remote IT specialist for small businesses across the country.  I liked the satisfaction of being able to resolve their issues but again the best part was the business owners would talk to me about life experiences, stories and intricate but interesting aspects of their business.  

I would love to find a job.that offers this again.  Both were slow paced and I truly have not enjoyed anything else the way I did in those two roles.
