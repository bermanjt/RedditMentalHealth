1,"I have a childhood friend of mine who used to be one of my closest friends when we were kids. I had a lot of family trouble of my own while I was growing up and he was always there for me, urged me to get help, and he and his family even ended up taking me in for a couple of months when things got real bad.

I just heard that someone saw him panhandling on the side of the road back in my hometown. I got in touch with his mom and she said that he's living out on the street and has severe drug addiction problems. I know he's been in and out of rehab over the last few years and I was able to visit him a few times then, but now I live a few states away and I'm at a loss on how to best help him. 

It's heartbreaking for me to hear about his situation, but I just don't know what would be most helpful in this kind of life circumstance. I reached out to him on Facebook because I heard he checks it regularly, just in a casual manner hoping to be respectful of how he feels about everything that's going on. Looking for any suggestions or advice you can offer on how to help him. 

Thanks in advance. ",19Aug2017,29
2,"I am a young adult, but I do still live with my mother.

I think my mom has a developing eating disorder. She only has one waffle for breakfast if she eats it at all and a medium-ish sized dinner. She never eats lunch or any kinds of snacks. 

If I'm ever hungry any time she's not or for more than she is, she'll shame me for it. Things like ""Don't you think that's a lot?"" or ""how can you possibly be hungry? You just ate."" (6 hours ago, one waffle)

I try to sneak food while she's gone, but she notices and starts screaming about there being something wrong with me. 

I don't know what to do. Is there something wrong with me? Am I too hungry too often? 

Before anyone says anything: I am trying to get a job and move out. I've applied to hundreds and all kinds. Nobody wants to hire me. I don't have any ins anywhere. ",19Aug2017,1

As his grandson, I see this as incredibly disrespectful to use my dead grandfathers page as an advertisement for your job.""

7,"I lost a close family member two (almost three) years ago and it ended up giving me a really bad case of hypochondria (the fear of getting seriously ill/dying due to disease). I've been struggling with it for more than two years now and it is the absolute scariest thing every time one of these anxiety attacks happen. Basically, I'll discover a weird/minor symptom in my body that I'm afraid is cancer (or any other serious disease), freak out for hours, maybe go to the doctor (they've never found anything though and I've even had a nurse get annoyed and tell me to stop being a hypochondriac), etc. until I finally manage to calm down. I've even seen a school therapist for it but it's summer vacation right now so I can't see her again for another month or two.

I'm tired of being like this. I've tried meditation, self help books, therapy, etc. over the past few years and yet I still worry that I will die from a serious disease.

8,"Noticed recently a stark difference between my (21f) relationship with my parents (50s, m+f) and my boyfriend's (20m) with his (50sf)- I don't tend to ask my parents for permission unless it affects them or uses their resources (i.e., can I borrow your car, can I have someone to visit our house), and if I ask for permission for something else they remind me it's my choice and I'm an adult, but they're happy to provide their opinions. My boyfriend, however, needs to ask his mom permission for everything, and it's getting in the way of our ability to plan things and see each other- i.e., we can't plan on dinner unless his mom has been asked and granted permission, which cannot happen until the day of the proposed dinner, and the answer is usually ""no"".

9,"Hey everyone.
I'm starting college next week at William and Mary on a full ride. I'm incredibly excited and look forward to it!
I'm trying to find out what I should do with my future. I love politics, history, philosophy, and economics, and I'm an amazing writer and debater. I'm thinking about studying international relations, government, public policy, or government. I really want to be involved in the political world, probably not as a politician but more along the lines of policy analysis or the civil service. 
I have pretty big reservations about being a lawyer- it seems many lawyers are miserable and the potential to protect the guilty and punish the innocent is not something I want to mess with.
Anyone have any advice about career paths or jobs that would be good for me? ",19Aug2017,1
10,"So, my friend (let's call her nana) threw a party. Nana invited me and a bunch of her female friends to go. One of them was my ex, who I had broken up with about a month beforehand, and was hoping shit would get better, besides the point.
We were kissing a lot and shit, been a while since I'd seen her. A whole lotta butt rubbin' ass grabbin' fantastic. I left at like 2:30 AM and everything was great. Mind you I'm a teenager, and so is nana. Now, about a week after the party, Nana is getting evicted because they supposedly caught me and this girl on camera, with me finger bangin' her. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I asked her to show me the video, but she's too pissed off to send it or anything. Is this a valid reason to evict someone?

11,"I met her the first time in school when I was 11 years old, we had the same classes and saw each other alot back then. We liked each other very much, with every year passing we used to know each other better and better. Still, even though I liked her, I had a girlfriend which wasn't her but eventually we broke up. My last year at school with her was when I was about 15 years old, and with school slowly coming to an end we were both in love, though we didn't kiss or hold hands. We spent alot of time together in the summer holidays, but neither her or me made the next move, I even started to talk less to her. She wasn't pleased with that, she said I should talk to her a bit more, and god I don't know why I didn't do it, propably because I was set under pressure and  started to feel defensiv and shy. So we weren't meeting each other anymore.

After the summer holidays I went to a new school which has it's main branches in computer science, fashion and chemistry (I live in Austria, so the school system's a bit different). I chose computer science. To my surprise she joined the same school, but a different branch, fashion. The first year has passed, I saw her occasionly but we never talked, neither she or I had the courage to talk about what happened with us. Either way, I failed my first year at the new school and had to repeat the first class to be allowed to stay in school. She completed the first year with no problems. So here I was, she was in second class and I was still in the first, which distanced us even more. But it had it's goods to repeat the first class, it got way easier because of better teachers and awesome classmates. 3 years passed since then, and out of nowhere she started chatting with me in April of this year, over social media. At first we didn't talk too much, and only met once. In that meeting she talked about a guy who is a good friend of mine, that he secretly hid his feelings for her for a few years but she kinda knew what he felt, they spent some time together but he neve really made a move or something so she dumped him (keep this in mind). 
Then came month May, my hardest. At the beginning of May, my mother was diagnosed with cancer (in the first few days of this year, I lost my grandma to cancer who I was very close with), so I was pretty depressed and sad as fuck, but I still chatted with her sometimes. I hesitated with telling her what was going on with me and my mother, but in the middle of the month I did it. She seemed very sad, and started to talk to me more often and always tried to cheer me up and asked about her.

Sadly my mother couldn't be cured and died in June, on the very same night I asked her for a meetup. So we met somewhere near my place, and she didn't have a clue about what happened, I told her, she cried, I cried, she pulled a bottle of rum out her bag and we drank it and spent the rest of the night together. 
This incident changed everything, we spent more time together again, she even invited me to her place late in the night to sleep with her (no sex though). First I felt like she was in love with me, but I wasn't sure what I wanted, back then. I came to the suspicion that she was in love with me because she was flirting weirdly often.
I let time pass a bit to see what I wanted, but I didn't give her the feeling that I wasn't interested in her. And then all of a sudden, it snapped and I was fully aware what I wanted, her. From that point on I tried to meet her, but it didn't quite work out she never had time and I got a little depressed because there was no real way to confront her without acting weirdly, I wanted to tell her what I feel as natural as possible. Once when we had a short chat via social media, she started to talk about what a bitch she is (even though she didn't even have her first kiss). So I asked for one of her 'bitch stories', but she didn't want to tell one because I would think differently of her, then I jokingly said I hope that it's not to late for that now, and that I would have a secret which I'd like to tell her but for a different time. She begged me to tell her now and after a long time of ""come on tell me"", and ""no I won't"", I decided to tell her. 

She was shocked and said I am her very best friend right now and she doesn't want to lose me again over a relationship. She also said she would really love to have a working relationship with me but something's holding her back and she doesn't know what it is. She also said, she really loved that I told her quite quickly what I feel for her, that I am not that shy like the other guy who hid his feelings for years. Either way she then convinced me that it is just a phase and maybe it'll pass. So I let go for a time, but that what she tried to prevent happened, we were lost communication for a while. Until it was my birthday and I made a party and invited her with some other long time friends, it was a bit of a reunion. We once again were chatting at the party wonderfully, shared the same humour, the same interests and what not. Since that reunion we all, a group of six people spent much more time together. Everyone of the group was quite often saying that we two would be a perfect couple, and every time someone said that she never defended herself why that would be bad or anything, she just played with it.
And then it all of a sudden happen, I fell madly in love with her, because we share so many interests, I make her laugh with every sentence that comes out of my mouth, she is the only one looking straight at me the whole time I am speaking she wants me to buy a new bed (I have a single bed right now) and she wants to come with me when I'll buy one.

And now we come to the present. Her, a buddy and me all go out eating at some chinese restaurant, later we drive a bit around with the car and go for a drink at a bar. Sounds like a nice day doesn't it? But I was depressed for the whole day, I couldn't put a smile on my face, I didn't talk much, and I often just looked into the distance instead of the faces of my two friends and I don't know what was wrong with me. At first I thought it was because of my nightmare I had where I dreamed I had the same cancer my mother had and I had to die and said my goodbyes to the girl but she didn't react in that dream, and this dream repeated itself it was like a loop of disapointment, but later when I told them both about the nightmare (I left the part out that I said my goodbyes to the girl) it hit me harder almost as if I told her again my feelings for her and she dumped me for good this time. I decided to go home but they wanted to leave with me and to know why I was acting so weird. I said that everything's fine, that I just have a bad day, but I kinda have the feeling that she knows. My question now is, what the fuck am I supposed to do, I am so teared apart and I am confused and can't tell anybody what is really going on with me.

TL;DR a girl I know for a long time fell in love with me, I loved her, we split because I was too shy, didn't talk to her for 3 years, magicly appears again, mother died, we got closer, told her what I feel, she rejected because I am too good of a friend but she would really like to have a relationship, silent again, reunion, I fall madly in love, spent depressed time with her and fear she knows what's going on and is going to dump me again

When he hits me, I get the blame for ""continuing"". They even say that I started it. If I tell them about the bruises, they will say the same thing. ""Asi son los niños"" That's how males are. He's 18 and takes these martial arts that uses legs.   He has kicked me in my knees too much one time I couldn't walk right. He's turning mg little brother against me, making him follow me with boogers that he picked off his nose. Older younger hit me in the eye with a spinning fidget spinner, and said ""it's your fault for not stepping back""(we were sitting on the floor playing with my toddler bro). Crazy thing is, he has this way of making you believe you're the wrong one, so I did believe I should have moved back.

I felt the hugest rush of anger. If I'd had been able to, I'd have hit him back. But that would make me look crazy (female hormones). Then again, If I had been born male, none of this would have happened.

17,"I grew up in a wealthy family and have lived near the sort my whole life until high school. I attended a very good but still public regional high school which takes kids from all over the county, most through a choice program of some sort. My one friend is not on this program but regardless, is not from money, as a matter of fact she was homeless for a long time and even now only has a small home because it was left to her 7 person family under her uncles will. She just turned 19 and graduated in June; she has the most amazing personality but is not well motivated and is the type that goes with the flow of life. We both had a great opportunity in the FFA to be state officers but will be doing this next year, which is an amazing opportunity for her as to this point she has never been given a ""chance"". I don't believe she received her degree because she could not afford dues to the school, which while they were her fault, she can not pay. I am attending a good university this year about 45 minutes away but she will not be going to any form of further education. She is skilled in agricultural science and is a beekeeper and works as a farm hand at a local winery. Many of my friends will be doing trade school, the FFA raises many farm or trade fluent people and she fits the bill, I just am not sure how I can help her. 1. What can I possibly do in relation to her degree? She graduated and all but owes about $300 to the school before they will give her the degree.; 2. Should I encourage further education? I'm willing to put in effort and help her enroll and even study if she needs the help as she never had a good time with school.; 3. Any other recommendations? I don't know if I should encourage education, a trade, or nothing at all, etc. Kind of stuck and not sure how I can help her because I really love her like family and she is the sweetest girl ever and wants better but doesn't put forward an effort to become better because having such a rough childhood, I believe she doesn't think she deserves it or can do it.

19,"Copied from an email so apologies for the formatting but I've done my best to change it.

I've been thinking about what people have been saying but I'm not sure what to do.

I know Brendon is in prison and maybe I should heed yours and other people advice and not have a relationship with him; bearing in mind why he's in prison. I think that I have done a pretty good job of turning my life around (in my opinion anyway, I don't know what you and Mike think?) And I'm scared that he might bring out my bad past again and I don't want that to happen. He says that prison has changed him but I'm not sure what's going to happen when he gets released. Is he going to stop the drugs? I can't afford to get dragged into that sort of thing as I'm afraid that it would bring back the bad past that I think I have done a good job of burying so far.

I want to try and find somewhere to live and maybe when I do it's worth settling down and finding a relationship and starting a fresh, as it were. But likewise I don't want him to think that I don't want a relationship with him because he's been in prison or anything like that. We both do like each other but I think that all things considered is this the best thing? Of course I like him and he likes me and we have both said that to each other but I just feel as though I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment as I don't know what to do. I think that it would be a bit hypocritical if I were to be like ""I don't think that this is going to work because you've been in prison and got a criminal record"" but also is he the best influence for me? I don't want to hurt him with this as I know he likes me. Would a relationship with him help him turn his life around too when he gets released? I also feel it would be a bit unfair to tell him this while he's in prison but it would also be nice on both parties to know where we stand, if you know what I mean.

I've been thinking about this for a few days now and honestly among other things such as my housing situation it's stopping me from sleeping and I honestly don't know what to do. 

I want to settle down and have a proper relationship with someone and I could go out and find someone fairly easily but I also have someone that I could have a relationship with come May when he gets released.

35,"A little about me: I am a 22 years old woman who has never been in a real relationship before. I've only ever been on one disastrous blind date. I also have ADHD and I'm a little on the quirky side, but my mother insists I have Aspergers' Syndrome, even though I do not meet the criteria for Aspergers (since it is all but an obsolete diagnosis.)

She knows I am having trouble with the dating thing, and one night this summer, she told me that I should look for men who are on the autism spectrum. She said ""You need to be realistic. The ""normal"" people that you like won't understand you or think you are beautiful or desirable."" She also suggests that I find someone who hates sex and doesn't like to be touched, which will be a huge obstacle to me, because I like being touched (with my permission, of course) and I want to lose my virginity someday -- not right away!

Sometimes I think about her comments, and they hurt me so deeply I begin to cry. How could a mother say that to her daughter?

I also thought I could trust her enough to come out as bisexual to her and while she's not a homophobe, she still doesn't believe me. She told me ""You've never been in a real relationship before! How do you know you're bi?"" Again, she told me I should find someone I can relate to who has autism.

I'm not totally opposed to dating someone on the spectrum. I have a couple of guy friends on the spectrum who are decent people, and if they asked me on a date, I would probably say yes. That's the problem though. They have only ever seen me as a friend and like girls that are pretty much better than me.

Her comments have me feeling completely worthless and undeserving of love. I feel like it will never happen for me and I will never feel loved. I feel like I have nothing to offer.

I should first point out that this happens when we try making friends together and separately.

My boyfriend and I are in our early/mid twenties. We both seem to have trouble keeping friends but him especially. I think my problems come from being socially awkward and having bad social anxiety. I don't read body language very well and have trouble picking up on hints. Earlier this year I tried making friends with a girl who worked at the mall. She was sweet but started avoiding me and stopped replying to my texts. I would still walk up to her and say hi and try to start a conversation. After I started texting someone else working there they started talking about how they heard I was ""stalking"" this person. I seriously never meant any harm or tried to be creepy or annoying. This triggered my social anxiety and for the next couple months it was worse than it ever had been and I was way more hesitant about approaching people.

My boyfriend is a lot smarter than me when it comes to a lot of stuff including people and basic social skills. Actually while I kept trying to be friends with this girl at the mall he would gently suggest I stop trying to approach her. I just thought he was being paranoid until I was finally called a stalker. People seem to avoid my boyfriend and act like they don't want to hang out or talk to him. He has to practically beg and back them into a corner (figuratively not literally) just to spend a day with someone other than me. He's pretty sure it's because he's overweight and has a girlfriend, although I'm not the jealous type at all and make that clear. We're actually poly but have even more trouble dating. He's friendly, polite, enjoys drinking, video games, board games and doesn't have bad body odor so idk why people gravitate away.

My cousin will do this thing where she'll agree to hang out with us and then when the day comes she doesn't reply to our texts or calls and never shows up. It pisses me off. Why not just be upfront? Other people do the typical ghosting or make up excuses. Usually that's after hanging out with us one time. It's like as soon as we chill with a person something changes and they never want to do it again. 

This has caused my boyfriend to become depressed and he's talked about suicide before and I've struggled to pull him out of very dark places before. The stress of wondering if this man I love might die has probably driven me a little crazy. I wonder if it's affected my demeanor and how I come across to people. When we make a friend I stress out and pray that they treat him like a friend and don't disappear. As soon as I see them acting funny I flip out and think about my boyfriend killing himself. I have actually blown up at ex friends over text telling them about my boyfriends depression and suicidal thoughts and that they're making it worse and that they could have been that good friend who helps me bring him out. But then they're like ""ohhh it not my responsibility blah blah blah"" and I get even more pissed off and stressed out. My bf is convinced I'm the only one who will ever love him.

Please keep in mind I'm looking for advice so please don't criticize my boyfriend or me unless you also have good advice.

40,"So a couple of months ago, my friend (let's call him Diaz) and his ex (Johnson) broke up from a long-distance relationship of 3 months. Of course, there was the consoling and venting afterwards that lasted a week, and after some time, he started to slowly get over her. Among all of the emotional vulnerability, he mentioned how he wants to get back with her, and is wanting to in the near future. Alright, this is expected. They were really close and were basically soulmates after 3 months, so I can see how he wants for them to be a thing again. But they can't in the meantime because Johnson's financial and personal issues caused the breakup, so it shouldn't be happening anytime soon. However, my other friend (Bry) received a message from her a couple of weeks ago that read that she's absolutely done with him.

Now, I was confused as to why she said that seeing as how she also said that they wanted to get back together in the future. After some talking with Bry and Johnson, it was because of how Diaz ignored her wishes to stay friends as she got her life sorted out for the next 2 years. He tried and tried to get back with her and even attempted to get a plane ticket to meet up with her. She didn't find this pleasant because of how desperate he seemed to keep the relationship.

Neither of us have told him that it's done and that she's moved on from him, and we don't think that it'd be a great idea. I brought this up now because he's starting to mention how if he doesn't ever get back with her that he may as well just die. I chalked it up to being a bit over-dramatic, but he's *really* starting to make me worry due to how confident he is that they'll get back together while Johnson doesn't want anything to do with him. He doesn't know about the messages and we don't want him to keep chasing a girl who is already long gone and in the middle of a rut. But we also don't want for his heart to break even more if we tell him the truth about how she feels after this whole mess.

Sorry if this was too long; I felt that if I were to make it shorter, it would be missing details in order to give me some advice on how I should handle the situation. I just want my friend to be happy, but reading him those messages might just make everything worse. So, here is what I need advice on:

* **Should I tell him about the messages and her ultimate feelings towards him?**

* **How can I console him further about a breakup that's already a few months old?**

* **And how am I going to reassure him that there'll be other girls and that he needs to work on himself as well?**

43,"hi
I would like to get some opinions about my situation,

So since forever i had problems to retain stuff, focus on things, like focusing on one thing is already hard enough but it become impossible if i do something else at the same time (listening to music, even ambient or brown/white noise)

Yeah i also feel like i have some auditory problems (i'm using earplugs and Noise-Canceling headphones), i also have the peltor optime 3 which is supposed to be one of the best in term of effectiveness (noise isolating this time because i really don't support noise and voices of people feel like they are too loud for me and they distract me too easily)

but still even with it, i can't focus on stuff, and its not even like focusing on 'hard stuff' its only like reading some 30-40 lines articles. (though i can easily random stuff that doesn't need to use ur head like reading news)

i don't even think i use those 'problems' as an excuse to be labelled as 'has add' and to get prescribed ritalin or adderall no, even for stuff that i REALLY like and want to do it seem impossible for me, even playing the like of League of Legends, Yu-Gi-Oh (online) because i don't retain anything, even thought i'm tryharding since years simply because i don't retain anything, and don't get me wrong i watch a lot of replays of those games which means i REALLY want to play them with good cerebral capacities like other people do (i'm jealous of them)

also afraid of 'learning new stuff' because i can't focus even if i would be able too, i would quickly forget what i'v read which frustrate me

I wanted to train my memory and concentration through online exercises but i can't get my head on them even if they are easy just that i don't feel like i'm 'using my head' like something 'blocks me' (i don't think its placebo because i tried a lot of solutions before i'v discovered the existence of the adhd)

I discovered ADHD after making old threads on reddit and looking for the symptoms which i had for the majority (which is the same for the majority of the people too i think, i still doubt about the veracity of this 'illness' even after reading thousands of thread on this subreddit)

i'm kinda afraid of seeing a psychiatrist cuz where i live adhd diagnosis is considered as a meme, they will prolly laugh at me and my parents won't let me to see another psychiatrists (and i don't have money to see one alone)

i'm depressing all the time (i don't have depression i think tho) because i feel liked i'm stuck in a shitty situation, all the time i want to 'use my head' i want to use it , to think use it ....

PS : I **don't** take any kind of drugs or smoking weed

**TL:DR i think i'm using my 'possible add' and 'concentration/memories problems' as an excuse for my laziness, or that i'm still not yet ready to assume my intellectual abilities. Or maybe i have other problems related ?  limit**

44,"I'll begin with the painful facts. I'm a federal employee, and I watched porn at work. I don't deny this much, but I don't think I should be fired, and here's why:

&amp;nbsp;


I've been an outstanding gov't employee for over 15 years. In that time I've moved up the ladder until I became a supervisor a couple of years ago. When the new job started, I was overwhelmed with the stress of it all. Last year, I sought psychiatric help for anxiety and depression. I went through a few doctors and therapists, and tried a lot of different SSRI medications. I experienced an unusual amount of side effects and withdrawal symptoms, and I was mostly miserable both at work and at home. I'd lock myself away in my office, and browse online to get away from everything (I had no useful data plan reception on my cell phone). A couple of times I visited porn sites via proxy bypass services. It's not something I'm proud of, but looking back I wasn't in a very good place mentally.

&amp;nbsp;


When the office IT caught wind of my activities, my PC was confiscated and analyzed. The forensics team produced a report that said I visited proxy sites, and used a couple to visit porn sites. The report stated that I accessed one such site over 2000 times. My supervisor assumed that I visited the site this many times and promptly sent me home on administrative leave, suspending my security clearance and proposed termination.
While I waited at home, I studied the forensic report and spoke with my doctors. I accumulated documentation that verified that I was in a temporary state mentally last year, and that I'd made great progress in rehabilitating myself since the period in question. I also got a testimony that verified the ""2000+"" number in the forensic report didn't mean that I went to a site that many times.

&amp;nbsp;


The bottom line of my analysis was that I looked at about 30 minutes of porn on one particular day, during my lunch break and after hours behind closed doors, at a time when I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

&amp;nbsp;


I wasn't given enough time to hire a lawyer (they wanted 30+ days, I had about 14 to respond to the allegations), so I was forced to defend myself to my boss' boss. I gave him my take on what happened, and my documentation. My argument was that although I did break the rules, it wasn’t nearly as bad as first assumed, and I was emotionally compromised due to the changes in my medication. I never did anything like that before, and was only ever awarded for my excellent performance. I recognized my problem prior to the investigation, and I sought rehabilitation. I deserve the formal discipline, but I think termination is an incredibly excessive step.

&amp;nbsp;


So now I’m waiting for the final decision. It’s been an agonizing three months, and I’m worn thin from constant fear and shame. My wife and I don’t know what to do. Do we wait? Do I resign early? Do I fight the termination with the Merit Services Protection Board? We just don’t know.

&amp;nbsp;


TL;DR: I watched porn on a gov't PC, and I may be fired. I was on lots of meds at the time, and the forensic report was misinterpreted to make the offense seem really bad. Now my family waits in a frightful limbo.",19Aug2017,1
45,"Okay so I'm single again, and I've gotten what I feel like is bullshit reasoning from the couple I was dating. But at the same time I really want outside opinions on whether or not it was me causing problems in the relationship. I want to be a better person and learn something from the experience, but I smell bullshit. 

Before I got together with them I was sexually assaulted by one of their friends. It was a traumatizing experience, and I didn't come out of it completely unscathed. I admit that because of the rape my depression worsened and I developed PTSD. They knew all about this before dating me, and I made sure to make it clear that I was still going through things and dealing with it. They said they understood and that they'd be there for me. 

This is when shit goes off the damn cliff. 

Every time I would see them or hang out with them they'd talk about the dude who raped me. They'd say things like ""he feels really bad"" and ""were still friends with him"". I didn't say anything despite how bad it hurt me, because I didn't want to force them into giving up a friendship. Finally, after 2 and a half months of them talking about how sorry he was and how he was so sad and depressed they said shit that I couldn't really let go of. They told me ""he didn't do anything to us so to us he's not that bad of a dude."" I didn't lose my shit, but I did ask them to stop talking about him in front of me. I didn't ask them to stop being friends with him. I didn't ask them to kill him. I didn't ask them to start a riot in my name. I simply asked them to stop talking about my rapist to me while I'm trying to recover. 

They told me they understood. But apparently it's the biggest favor I could ever ask of somebody. Was my request really that bad guys? Personally I feel like I shouldn't have to ask that of somebody, it's common sense and something you just don't do. Every time we talked there after it was odd, conversations would be short, they'd be pretty cold towards me. 

We got into another fight over it because I mentioned that I was talking with one of my closest friends about it. They didn't understand why I didn't go to them, and honestly didn't think that they said anything bad. I told them that what they did was fucked up, but that I forgave them, I didn't feel comfortable talking about what I was going through because A. They're friends with my rapist B. Whenever I've tried they've shut me out, and C. They're the type of people who have to have the worst and best of everything. 

Things sort of calm down, and by that I mean they ignore me, they won't talk to me for days on end, we went three whole days where they wouldn't talk to me. If we were going to talk I had to initiate, and it was in little bursts of three to four messages. 

They broke up with me this week after I made it clear I didn't want to be friends with benefits again, and after spending months walking on egg shells I'm relieved but confused. They basically told me I had too much baggage... but I don't know if that's true or if they're just assholes. ",19Aug2017,3

50,"So there's this guy. We knew each other for about a year, and about midway things started going south. I left a notebook at his place, when I visited him in America, by accident, and it contained a draft of a rather affectionate letter to him. I don't remember the content, but I remember, he told me it was really stalkerish. All I remember about the letter is that I used quotes from songs from his favourite band. Note: He read the notebook even though I directly asked him not to, because he got s girlfriend, and didn't want to impose, you know? Then a bunch of his friends get invovled, and things got REALLY messy and he and I ended up emailing back and forth trying to hash all this shit out. 

Eventually, he was really getting on my case about emailing him back, right when I was studying for an exam the next day (which I told him about, but he didn't seem to care), so I edited the drafted response a little and sent it. It wasn't very politely written, but it was by no means rude. It just portrayed a tone of how completely done and emotionally exhausted I was with the whole thing, and how I was giving up on argueing, and just wanting to conclude the email chain, and move past the whole thing.

Then he FLIPPED. I guess he took my ""doneness"" to be REALLY bitchy, cause he called me a cunt a whole bunch of times, said I'd fucked up a ton of shit, and went so far so as to say that I ""shouldn't go into music"" and how it was ""really not my thing"".  As well as a lot of other shit about my attitude, and behaviour ('cause apparently I like to act all tough, even though I've had a cushy life), and just generally bitching me out.

It wasn't what he was saying that bothered me, you know? It wasn't the name calling or the dream crushing.  It wasn't the fact he was angry with me. It was the fact he acted with so much hostility towards me, and treated me so badly, when the entire conversation was supposed to promote getting out friendship back on track. We were supposed to be sorting everything out, and he goes and does all this stuff a friend should never do.

So, I don't even bother replying, I just pop into his facebook messages, and tell him, point blank (because he deserves an answer before i cut him out) that we are not friends anymore. I don't know if I told him why, but he didn't seem to care. He just said ""Ciao"", and then ""deleted"" his facebook, casuse, for some reason, hed been meaning to?? It was over a year ago, I can't remember.

SO. Now, a year later, here I am, jusr curious where he is in life, so I start googling him. I find his (reactivedacebook, nothing much there. I find his TUMBLR, and boy HOWDY, its a trove. So, now I know exactly what's up with him (and I'm petty he's doing so much better than me), and all I can think about is messaging him. 

It would be so easy, just. Just a few clicks on Tumblr, type some stuff, and I'm there. I don't even have to tell him it's me. But, like. He could figure it out? Or something? And I see very little benefit to it in the long run, I just. There's some kind of urge in me to be his friend again, despiteb all the shit we went through, and despite know, through introspection and thinking back on the past, that he's a really controlling person.

We both moved off base at the same time and he has a gf who is a few months behind us in joining. They've been together for a little over a year and I agreed to let her live here (who am I to say that she can't stay with us). We all get along alright, but sometimes Tom becomes a middle man and I spoke to them about open communication about things that may bug us so that we don't end up split. 

My dilemma:
When we first moved in, me and Tom agreed on the master bedroom occupant paying an extra $100 on rent. The total rent is $2300. So we split it and I pay $1050 and he pays $1250 (2300/2 = 1150). His gf has been staying here and slowly moving her things into the house the entire time we have lived here. She has payed no bills other than the extra $100 cause she stays in the master bed with him. She also has used all amenities and has been in the house more than the both of us because we go on temporary deployments often. Now we are on the verge of splitting the rent three ways with an extra $50 to both of them. I would pay 668, Tom would pay 816 and gf would pay 816. I've had to explain to them that they can't compare our cost of rent because it looks like they are (separately) paying $150 more than I am instead of just $100 between the both of them. What are some other ways I can explain to them that you can't look at my side of the rent and just see that they are only paying $50 more each than they would if the master bed wasn't in play? Also, does $100 seem fair to pay for the master?

We are in a 3 bedroom house and it was decided that the spare would be used as a guest room, the gf thinks she is entitled to use that room because she is putting in for the rent so she should have a room to herself *including* to her being able to reside in the master. In no way am I trying to make her look like a bad guy but she is stuck on this and I don't know how else to explain it to her or if I can make this more fair.

Well they recently eliminated a different team, and one of the supervisors they kept will be joining my team and I am expected to train them for my role.

The first thing that alarmed me is that we don't need the help, I have two other people that work with me and we have it handled really well... so why do we need another person????

Today I was told by a colleague that is on a different team that my new teammate will actually be replacing me and my two coworkers in our role. This is privileged information, and he heard from a reliable source and it is also happening to their team. 

So they are doing some drastic downsizing, and I really don't know what to do at this point. I don't know if they are going to find another position for me or if I'm out of luck. I just feel like I am the most knowledgeable person on my team since I've been on it since the beginning, and for someone new to just come in and take over is really frustrating. 

I'm just so angry and I hate the thought of starting over after I've invested so much into this role. 

I guess I just am wondering if I should just start looking for a new job just in case it comes down to it, or wait it out and hope for the best?

63,"I took 2 summer classes this year in an attempt to finish my undergraduate degree early. One of them was a lab course that was relevant to my major while the other was a online introductory course on macroeconomics that I decided to take on a whim. The Macroeconomics course is absolutely useless for me since the credit I get from it doesn't contribute towards my graduation and the only reason that I took that course at all was qualify as a full time student for the summer in order to receive student discounts at my university. Thus, I put all my attention towards the lab course and only went online to read up on that course when I had an assignment. This lead me to lose track of the course schedule for that class.

So my university has two weeks of exams after classes ended, this year's exams started on the 7th of August and lasts til the 18th. I made my mistake due to the way my lab course was scheduled: The lab course had no final exam and thus didn't follow the exam schedule, instead I was suppose to submit a final lab report on August 11th which in turn caused me to believe that classes ended on the August 11th instead of the August 4th. Thus, I mistook the exam date of my Macroeconomics course for August 23rd instead of August 16th since the exam was on the second Wednesday of the exam period. 

Now I'm kinda in a spot of bother. I had a 70% going into the exam but since the exam was worth 40%, I won't be able to pass the course. While I could care less about what marks I got in macroeconomics, I am worried about a failing grade potentially messing with my future job application. 

Now I need to talk to my guidance counselor in order to see what he can do about this. I ideally want to be have this course dropped from the transcript, since I doubt they'll let me take the ""retake"" the exam after the exam period has ended. The problem is I'm not sure how I can ask my counselor to do this since its way past the drop date and I didn't have a legitimate reason from missing the final exam.

#TLDR: Took a class I didn't care about. Missed the final exam. Want to have it dropped from the transcript. Not sure how I can ask my academic counselor about this.

68,"Hello Reddit, I have a bit of a problem.

I don't know how to keep myself from getting upset and stressed about the future, and change.

I am a 21 year old female and I am going to be starting my junior year of college at a top-tier institution. I have been blessed with a great life, and I've been able to travel extensively. However recently, something that has been gnawing at the back of my mind has moved to the forefront. I feel lost right now because I have no idea what I want to do professionally, and even worse, nothing really excites me on the job front. I've been going back and forth but I feel a bit stressed because I want to do something that I'll love, while still being able to maintain having a good living. 

I feel that even though many people say they don't know what to do, all my friends seem to have a clear path that they are pursuing while I'm terrified that it will be the wrong one for me and I'll end up sad and miserable with my job. I feel like I know things I don't want to do but nothing I do want to do.

Another thing that gets me unreasonably upset is that I have this fear that nothing will be the same as it is right now. In a few years, my parents will sell my childhood home that I've grown up in and even now the thought of that tears me apart. My grandparents are getting older and I don't know how much longer they will be around. I feel like I'm living in the ""good times"" and things will only get worse from here and there's nothing I can do to stop it because how can working life be better than life now?

I am anxious now because I go back to school soon (I study on the other side of the country) and I'm honestly happy to go back. I love the school I'm going to and the city I'm in, it's just that I can't help but feel dread that my time at university and life as I know it with my family is running out. I try to live in the moment but sometimes I feel so in tune with the moment that I freak out that I can't keep what I have in a bottle. The only thing that is certain is change. 

I just don't know how to get over this mental rut I'm in right now. I'm heartbroken because I broke down crying to my dad two nights in a row of just how scared I am of not being in school and not being able to ""come home."" I know it's irrational and everyone goes through it but I honestly don't know why it's hitting me so hard. My dad was so sad seeing me in such a state because honestly my life so far has been great- I've been getting good grades and meeting tons of amazing people. He doesn't know what to say to me because the world is my oyster. 

Obviously I know fear of the unknown is normal, but is there any mental exercises or any advice for me to stop making it ruin the fun I'm having now and for me to prevent myself from getting as worked up as I do? Thank you!",19Aug2017,2

My concern now is that I will be texting him, and I've never really had conversations through text with anyone. Just the occasional ""Happy Birthday"". When we talked before, it was always in person during school. Phone calls really aren't an option since I'm so shy, and there would be awkward silences. Texting would give me time to think before I speak without it being awkward.

What I really need advice on is how I should go about texting. Like, should I keep replying to him until he stops? How long should I wait if he doesn't reply? What if he just says ""ok""? How should I stop a conversation temporarily, like if I need to go somewhere for a bit? How do I pick back up where the conversation left off? How often should I be the one to start a conversation? What if he never texts me first? These are all questions that have been going through my mind, and by now I'm sure you can tell I'm nervous about it.

73,"I travel for work, for two years now. I'm 30. My co worker is in her 50s, from Peru, with a daughter my age who currently lives there. We are really close, I jokingly call her ""mi suegra"" (like mother in law) and she jokingly calls me her son. I love her, she is a really sweet woman and one of the most positive people I've met in my life. She sometimes suggests over the past year I marry with her daughter. She's sent her pictures of me even, and I've seen one of her. She's cute.

I've asked her what's up with all that.. and she says she's kidding. I don't really take it seriously because I don't know her daughter at all. And i haven't taken any steps to actually talk to her daughter, though she seriously asked me to talk with her to help with her English (plus I want to improve my Spanish). Just as friends. I'm thinking of calling her but I've been drowned in work.

Recently she invited me to go to Peru with her this holiday season. I've been there before with my ex, and I would love to go again especially with someone who is native who can show me around. We would travel to a few different places while we were down there, and she has a friend who would come also.

Recently invited me to Peru for the holidays for her to see her daughter and I am interested in going.

76,"And she said yes!

So, naturally (being the anxious and neurotic kind of person that I am), I have a small list of concerns. They are as follows:

1. This all happened on tinder. I know, but what if she's only interested in me as a friend? How do I know it's meant as a date? How should I act once me, hopefully (maybe), meet? It could get quite awkward if it's obvious what my intentions are if she is only interested as a friend. And what if she's not really interested, but is only saying so because she doesn't see any harm in trying? Maybe she'll ""learn"" to like me...?

2. What if I'm not good enough? I'm quite pale, I'm short (5 foot 6 or 168 cm), and my teeth are a bit crooked (which I'm currently fixing). I also worry about my hair. What if it doesn't look good enough? Should I wear a hat? Will she, if she's truly interested, lose all interest in me if she's taller than I am?

3. Where are we supposed to go? I suggested the cinema because we've talked a bit about movies. I figured we could maybe meet a little bit earlier or something so we can get to know each other a little better. Should I pay for the tickets and snacks? It could get awkward if she is only interested as friends, but it could also get awkward if she's interested in something a bit more romantic if I don't pay for it. 

4. What are we supposed to talk about? I have social anxieties, so who knows what'll happen? I'm not THAT bad when it comes to simply just talking to people, but I still feel like I can easily make things awkward with my one-worded answers.

5. I have no experience. Do I really need to elaborate any here? Jeez, I don't know anything. I could go into details, but I'm sort of blank here... 

6. I also have roughly zero amount of friends. I'm not sure how her social life is, but I know for a fact that she has one. This, sadly, is not the case for everyone. Will she think I'm weird or something? Should I hide this? How? What am I supposed to do?

7. Anything else I should be worried about?

81,"i maintain a shop floor at a retail establishment but the workflow is so boring, i have nothing to do for 6 hours of my 7 hour shift, i work in the garden centre of the shop and essentially water the plants once a day, wait for a customer to ask me something and put stock out when its low, that it. 

i spent yesterday picking up the plants that were being knocked over by the wind, doing a lap of the store and giving the wind some time to do its work, and then repeating the process... for 6 hours, my feet are sore from constant walking for 6 hours and i cant get past my lack of want to do it.

when i leave i am immediately beginning to dread going back, and i don't really know the end game of this job, if i feel like this now, how will i feel in 3 months? 

the problem i am having is that i am getting a crippling sense of guilt when thinking of quitting, i have had and quit many jobs, but i always made up excuses why they were terrible and why i should quit, when really i just couldn't be bothered to go, so when i got this job i promised myself i wouldn't do that again, but i'm already feeling like i cant do this anymore, and i know its just laziness as the work is tediously underwhelming and i could do it with my eyes closed, but i just cant see myself lasting here much longer.

but if i quit i feel ill become depressed, genuinely, i feel like ill be condemned to this pattern of;

get a job

do job for 3 days

quit job

rinse and repeat until i am 40

i have the opportunity to study in September but i cant convince myself that its positive, because if i quit a job, how will i last at studying? how can i believe that one day i will be able to be successful if every time i try to even just do a basic job i quit?

i just want to have a successful career and make decent money (not rich by any stretch, just enough to be comfortable in the future) but i cant see that happening if i quit this job, and if i stay i feel ill lose my mind anyway.

I'm sure you've all these these posts, especially if you go on /r/advice constantly.

I'm 21 and I just feel like I have no purpose. Growing up, I was so excited to get into a good college, and to have a whole world ahead of me. When I was a kid, I would have never expected to be in this position. I go through the motions of life- working part time, going to bars with my friends, playing guitar when I'm down, and barely making it though school.

The problem isn't that I'm lazy. I'm just unmotivated. I  spend a lot of time thinking about ""what do I want to do for the rest of my life?"" And I always come up with a blank.

When I was 17, I was big into sports. I was very good at track (state ranked) and football but ended up quitting because it wasn't making me happy.

The list of majors at my school are grey and bleak. Business, communication, philosophy, English..? I dropped out and I'm going to do a radiography degree at a community college because 1. At least it is straightforward and 2. It will get me out of my parents house.

I like to chase girls around, but it's more of a distraction rather than a fulfillment.

I'm really sick and tired of going through my life and not having a purpose or a dream. I want to wake up everyday and say ""I love what I do"" or ""I can't wait to wake up and do xyz"" regardless of the pay. 

I was researching astronomy, and I have been interested in astronomy for years. The only downside is that 1. I don't have money 2. My grades are bad and 3. I'm bad at math...

Also, as far as relationships, I feel like I've explored tons of girls of different backgrounds, religions, etc. And I have never fallen in love, or had someone support me. It's almost like most of the girls I date/have sex with/talk to are just looking for some handsome dude to swoop them off of their feet, and they don't put out at all. They kinda just want to be pampered and catered to. Like, where is my queen in a shining dress? Where is the girl who supports me in my highest and my lowest? My best friend?

It feels like I can do anything for a woman, and still won't love her because she's just not enough. There is no love story. It's always just dating for the hell of it. It sucks. Like ""let's just date because I want to date. You're handsome and funny, and you would get tons of likes on my instagram page. Lets do it""

96,"I live in Bangladesh and I have to take a Autorickshaw for commute. The distance is 10km and the government approved fare is Tk200. The custom for Bangladeshis is that, upfront the drivers ask for Tk.400 and after some negotation they take the ride for Tk350. 

Things however change if you don't look like a Bengali. ESPECIALLY if you are white!! Then the driver asks for Tk800 and refuses to budge. If its raining the price climbs to TK1200!! This is EVERYWHERE!!! It seems to be a sort of implicit understanding among drivers that they will fleece off foreigners. Even if there are 15-20 autorickshaws all around the place, no one would go under Tk800. 

I have tried reasoning with them but their argument is the following: 

* Its free market capitalism: Everyone pursues their self-interests including the passenger (me). People have a right to charge whatever they want, its up to the buyer to take it or leave it. 

* They have a right to the higher price since the foreigner is rich and they are poor: Since the passenger is a foreigner, that means they earn more. Therefore they are **obligated** to pay a higher price. Conversely it is *their right* too. In fact, people have verbally abused those foreigners who try to lower the price saying that the foreigners are disgusting people [plus add profanity]. Keep in mind that the drivers are not the most poor. In fact among the lower/working class they are the best off [although I believe they earn minimum Tk2000-Tk4000 per day after paying for gas and lease to the owner] compared to other workers who are at the extreme poverty rate of $3/day. 

Now it would be fine if every foreigners were paid in dollars at their home salaries. This is not the case. Foreigners are typically paid 1.5 times the native salary. So an MBA Bangladeshi graduate will earn Tk 30,000 per month pre tax (10% tax) while a foreign MBA holder providing training and consultancy will earn Tk 50,000 per month pre-tax (40% tax). 

This problem is not limited to autorickshaw drivers. EVERYONE from grocers to electrician---everyone seems to have the same problem. 
Advice Needed for: 

1. How should foreigners and people deal with these people and get a fair price? 

2. How should foreigners and people counter their moral and logical arguments? 

PS: There is Uber although it services only a small part of Dhaka and therefore not applicable. Besides for the 10km trip it costs Tk400 and does not go everywhere, even within the city. 

It is also not possible or reasonable to ask every foreigner to leave the country. The country needs help. Besides many come here for many reasons--asking them to move to another place is not justice.

I went out to see what was going on and found him to be in dissociative state. With all the commotion that was going on someone had called the police. He calmed down once the police arrived, I did not want to pry and I could be of no assistants at the time so I went about my day.
The following day he came over and apologised for his outburst. (I found the apology unnecessary because he was obviously suffering mental health crisis and told him) during his apology he mentioned that he was feeling isolated (the only support network he seems to have is an ex girlfriend who comes over very periodically) I said what I thought was the right thing to say “come knock on my door if you ever just want a chat” 

My question is, is this enough? I do go for walks to the local shops and I was thinking of asking him to accompany me? Is this the right thing to do? I am a busy person, but I care about my neighbour and want to help him.  Would I come across as condescending if I invited him along and how do I make sure how to set boundaries ( we live in the same complex and I don’t want to be bailed up every time I go out my front door)  He appears to be a genuinely nice person suffering with his condition, and I want to reach out to him.

100,"If there's anywhere better to post this please let me know. 18 years old. I just moved to a new city to attend school. I struggled to find housing and ended up entering into a house share situation with a very strange elderly couple. It's been two weeks since I moved in, and little problems have been piling up and driving me crazy. My room gets swelteringly hot, but they don't let me open my window for 'security' reasons. They are really particular about where I can place things like toilet paper and toothpaste in what was supposed to be my private bathroom. They board up windows, doors, and doorways with cardboard and blankets. The place is dark and musty smelling as a result, but they won't allow me to use air fresheners or sprays, citing allergies. There are ants everywhere. They tie the trash can shut with a rope and knot it, which I have to pull apart every time I take my trash out. I can't have guests over after dark. The washer and dryer are broken, and they told me it would be fixed by this week. No sign of that happening. They record my school and work schedules and expect me to check in with them whenever I leave or enter the house. They watch my schedule like hawks, I was out until 1:30am the previous night and they called me stressed out, yelling and cursing. I don't feel like I should have to be checking in like they're my parents. I certainly don't know their schedule. None of this stuff was mentioned when I talked to them and viewed the house, nor in the lease agreement, with the exception of a sentence saying all windows must be locked. All of this to say: All kinds of quirks keep popping up and I'm struggling to adapt. I feel trapped here, because I don't have anywhere else to go and I have months on my lease, so my parents would lose a $600 deposit if I left. I would feel terrible forcing them to pay that for me and move me to a new place. I haven't rented before and I fear my credit will suffer as well. My schoolwork and work schedule is weighing on me and I feel extremely stressed out. Any advice is appreciated. I apologize for the post being so long.",19Aug2017,2

108,"So I have a friend that works at Burberry and he received 40% discount on his purchases, so I asked him to bulk purchase a bunch of items for my friends (I personally don't shop at these high end retail stores). The problem happened when one of my friend asked for a gift receipt so that she can exchange items if it didn't fit and get it tailored etc, and originally my friend said that he was able to get it. Fast forward to the day of purchase, his manager doesn't give him the gift receipt and my friend decides that she doesn't want the item anymore. One item was already paid for with the employee discount and the other was on hold.

My friend told me that the items cannot be exchanged or refunded.

My boss and I do not get along. I know that happens everywhere, but this boss of mine is a very very bad person. She has attempted to falsify commission reports to take  commission bonuses from me and my coworker. She wrote me up in March with a list of things that I did wrong, but in reality, 5 of 6 things listed were not even my doing. I don't want to sound like I'm infallible- I definitely make plenty of mistakes. But what I was written up for truly wasn't my fault. Next, she recently had been caught blatantly lying to a client regarding price estimates and contract dates. Another guy I work with reported this to HR. My boss's boss, an area VP, called said coworker and made excuses for my boss. This VP said things like, ""I'm sure she just didn't know the details of the contracts. It had to be an honest mistake."" Apparently that went on for about 10 minutes until my coworker realized it was a lost cause. Finally, today, I get written up again. This time it's because she said I was blatantly disrespectful during a recent heated discussion her and I had where I confronted her about her attempts to steal commissions.

I just don't know what to do here other than just find a different job. I feel like my boss has set a goal to watch me fail. There are many more examples, but I just don't have time to list them all. What do I do here? It has been proven that contacting HR will not solve the problem. I work in a small office where I'm 15 feet from this woman every day, so approaching her is pretty much out of the question unless I want to create a terrible work environment for myself.

124,"So, there I am in China, teaching English and awaiting my departure as I endure my excruciatingly boring daily routine. Despite the crowdedness, I feel lonely and bored.
I learned to become an observer... People find the joys in material things, nice food, and parties. I don't find this that exciting. To me, the most joyful moments are associated with being free of the pressure of having more things or just partying and just looking good for the ""friends"" on Facebook... Instagram.
I find those activities really tiring, almost life sucking.

I am not all into the ascetic life, I just want to amass my possession reasonably. Having this out of the way. My childhood dream was to live near a beach, where the climate is more charming, or just the opposite of what it is in Northern Europe.

I picked a small city in a country not too far away from China where I don't have to worry about the visas, or about the high rent...  Although I don't speak the language, it doesn't frighten me. 

There is a little guilt or whatever. I won't be able to accumulate money by working in a bigger city or a more developed country thus I can't visit my country and even travel abroad that often. Should I stick to the regular thing and make money by staying miserable in a 9-5 job, or take the life into my own hands and listen to my gut?

I met a girl were I worked but she had a boyfriend so I never did anything, I definitely put her on a pedestal I'd not let myself thinking about her because she had a boy friend so it would do no good. 3 years later they brake up and I make a move she tells me she loves me in the 1st week and I say it back it was the best 7 months of my life. Towards the end of the relationship things were less good but we never spoke about it. She was on the pill so we had unprotected sex and told me that if she ever got pregnant we would handle it but she didn't keep up with them and didn't tell me she broke up with me because she thinks I'm not ready for a child. She refuses to speak to speak to me in person about it because she is angry about how I reacted when she told me she was keeping it. She is the only person I have ever had a romantic connection with and the only time in my life I didn't think about killing myself every day, her sister told me she said she wishes I didn't want to be involved with the baby.

I had some crazy inability to deal with everything, and ended up taking things out on them. I don't even remember exactly what was said or what I did, but it was enough that they wanted absolutely nothing to do with me.

I sent an email to an old address which I'm not sure they read. I found a website they had and used the form on the website to say I sent an email to that address, which was basically trying to explain how mentally ill I was during that time and apologize.

I don't know if they read it, but they sent an email back (from a new address) saying not to contact them, that I don't get to dictate if we talk anymore, not to reply and to leave them alone.

I hate this so much. I was mentally ill the entire time they knew me. They make it sound like I was contacting them non-stop, when I've sent like 5 emails in the last 7 years, the last one 4 years ago.

I so so so badly want to reply with something like:

""I had an evil fucking sickness in my head the entire time you knew me. I had thought getting healthy and recognizing things would somehow mean something. I genuinely don't remember what I did that put the nail in the coffin and made you hate me so. I haven't contacted you for four years. I wasn't trying to dictate anything. The last email I had from you said maybe one day you would talk to me again, but I guess it's clear that will never be the case now. I'll never stop regretting or be able to forgive myself for how I hurt you and I hope you know how sorry I am. 

I know you said not to reply, and I'm sorry. You have my word I will never contact you again.""


I want to send this but....there would be no point, it would be self-serving right?

I wish I could let them know how healthy I am and just how mentally ill I was because I feel like it would make a difference

How can I make something right or even attempt to when they won't even talk to me?

This is the only thing I truly feel guilty about, my only real regret, the only thing I want to make right before I die.

139,"I'll start off with saying that I'm currently on short term disability for a few more weeks and this is why my roommate told me to clean up after her if it bothers me. She also said this because she works a labor job and therefore is too tired after work to clean up after herself. 

I'll also mention I own the apartment that we live in. I took her in about three months ago as she was being kicked out from her parents house and had nowhere to go except for her drug dealing boyfriends place. (Whom was still living with his ex gf and their 3 month old baby at the time)

It's obvious she just doesn't understand how to do a few basic adult things. She's tried putting liquid soap in the dishwasher, leaves rotting food on the counter for days, in the fridge for weeks to months. 

At first I chose to just clean up after her because i didn't want to be too confrontational and felt i could only mention to her every few days about different cleaning suggestions with rocking the boat. Also it just seemed like a stressful time for her. 
The past few weeks have seemed to get ridiculous though as I've asked her to help out by sweeping once in a while or helping out with other household chores and she's replied with saying her job is very physical and she doesn't have the energy to do that sort of stuff after work. So I compromised; I suggested to start small and asked her to just wipe the counter after she uses it (there always seems to be crumbs and food after she makes any food). She said she'd try but everyday there's still food on the counter. (She makes her lunches for work in the AM and leaves the residue on the counter all day while she's at work) 
Not the biggest deal. It takes me a few minutes every day to wipe the counter after she makes any sort of food. (However I do think this is a pretty basic human skill people should learn)
Eventually, I started getting really tired of throwing out her mouldy rotting food for her. I find rotting food to be one of the grossest things I can touch. It's a pet peeve..... the flies in the house in general are starting to get disgusting. 

Yes I'm off work right now due to medical reasons. But I still have  specialist appointments about three times a week in the city that take virtually all day. I'll mention in off work because I've had horrendous migraines the past bit. Anyone who has had migraines knows how debilitating they can be.

Now her dirty dishes are piling up in the sink too. I ask her to start cleaning up after herself at this point. Three days later, the dishes covered in food from earlier in the week are still in the sink. 
My mother comes to visit and immediately starts complaining how disgusting it is in my apartment. There's flies everywhere in the house at this point. Yeah my cat loves it. But I'm starting to feel like my apartment is starting to become unlivable at this point. 

So I text her and ask if she could make more of an effort and tell her about the cleaning schedule I've instituted for myself. I ask het to chip in with just sweeping once a week for now. 
This is where things get ugly. She reiterates that her job is too physical and then proceeds to tell me that I'm off work anyways and if it takes such short time to wash the dishes, I should do it myself. 

Now time for some tough love. I tell her it's not my job to clean up after her and unfortunately this is part of being an adult. 
(Btw I'm 27 and she's 18)

Then she lashes out. Brings up how I ruined tons of her stuff without her saying anything so I shouldn't say anything either. (I got hair dye on her bath rug which I offered to replace immediately but  she said no big deal)
She says she cleans her stuff ""eventually"" and that that is more than enough. 
I apologize and offer once again to replace whatever I've damaged. But I also hold my ground. I say she needs to make changes or she needs to find a new place to live and will give her two months to do so if necessary.  (Two weeks ago she was asking to leave to move in with her bf possibly but decided against it)

Then things get uglier. She says I can't legally kick her out anyways and that I'm being dramatic. I've brought this info up as an excuse to start a fight so I can kick her out. She'll clean up her shit on Monday (this happened yesterday afternoon). She says she's trustworthy and I'll end up screwing myself over by finding a new random roommate as at least we knew each other before. 

Now Ill mention that I'm giving her a pretty good deal. $400 a month for a room in A nice area. I could easily get $650 from anyone else. We did discuss that her rent would go up to $500 or so once she got a steadier job. It's quite obviously not going to happen... She asked me to insure her car under my name two days ago cause she can't afford it under her name. But she could afford going to a $200 rave last month. I notoriously am the friend that is ""too nice"" and gets walked over. I feel I usually have a noble cause. But this situation is becoming out of hand. 

My parents are co owners of the apartment and told me I have to kick her out and find a cleaner roommate because they want to protect their investment. Im making about $300 a week on disability right now for about 3 more weeks then i may be cut off. I'm concerned about the house being foreclosed at this point. I'm barely making mortgage payments right now. With disability being cut off, I'll be screwed pretty quick. 

TLDR; I'm a sick homeowner schlep on disability. Told roommate to clean up after herself. She told me I'm off work anyways so I should do it and get over it. Shes too tired. Said I can't kick her out or make her leave. I predict things getting ugly soon x).....",19Aug2017,2

146,"Hey reddit. I actually have to leave for work in a few minutes...I probably should have posted this question yesterday but this little situation has been killing me.

I currently work retail selling wines and spirits (kind of like a wine steward). I have been in the wine/beer/spirits industry for about 7-8 years, but currently don't make a lot ($12 per hour basically, but I get by). Recently I have come across the opportunity to take a bartending position at a somewhat smaller hotel.  I have no bartending experience, but the hotel is willing to show me the ropes. The job is only part-time for now but with high chances of going full-time later, so I was hoping to work both jobs for a time before jumping into the bartending job, if it worked out.

However my retail job refuses to cooperate with me on the hours. And, long story short, I'm in a position where I have to choose one job over the other.  The hotel, knowing I did not want to immediately leave a full-time job, has offered to employ me twice for the time being; as a part-time bartender and as a part-time receptionist.  The work would actually be a downgrade in pay (about $10 an hour).  But would the bartending make it worthwhile with tips? It's a transferable skill to be certain...I just really don't know what to do or think. I need to give them an answer in the next few days. Help.

tl;dr 

Currently work as a full-time wine steward for low pay, I'm being offered a part-time job that would teach me bartending. Is it worth making the leap? ",19Aug2017,4

My name is Hans, and I am an Engineer (and a very good one too! give me a toothbrush and some milk, and ill make you a guided missile :P ) anyways...

Life simply has to taste anymore, I simply wake up everyday, and wait [patiently] for the time when I can go back to bed, where I can wrestle my tears back to my eyes, why? I don't really know. I have simply no plans for anything else. 

Marriage? I can't stand people, let alone live with someone everyday, for years... and kids? OMG. No.

Friends? Bunch of losers. They complain about anything, and I honestly never enjoy their company.

Family? I don't have a family. (But I miss my Mom and Dad to be honest.) My only family is my PC, whih is only used for Dota 2 and boring , headache-inducing excel spreadsheets.

Hi all!

To preface: a lot of things have happened this year to the point that I really want to leave for at least 6 months starting January. I am an introvert and have been diagnosed as depressed (although I will still undergo further testing) and even my therapist said time away really helps me, plus she thinks travelling will be helpful for me. Also, the amounts are in USD just to make it more familiar,  but I live in South East Asia. 

From now until December, if all goes as usual I will be making roughly 7400 USD. I have around 4000 USD of credit card debt that I will be prioritizing and will be paying off by November.

I plan to travel via workx/worldpackers or a similar platform. Thing is, when I get back to my country I don't wanna live with my parents anymore (I moved out last year but am back with them due to a lot of reasons) but I feel like it would be hard to accomplish given that I would be traveling and while I wouldn't spend much on accommodation, there are still other expenses like flights, food, misc. 

This is my last chance to travel before going back to uni on August next year. I really feel like staying in the country any longer than necessary without traveling will drive me crazy, which is why I want to travel but I don't know what to do about living arrangements when I get back.

Should I just postpone traveling (for another 2 years, which I feel will worsen my depression) or travel anyway and be unsure of living arrangements when I get back? My family are good people,  but living with them is hell.

I work at Lou Malnatis and have been here a little longer then a year.  My manager just came forward that he is cutting all of our hours. This would make sense if it was due to sales however a few factors completely cause me to flip my lid :
1) The highschoolers they have hired are already cutting their own hours for football and school. 
2) I was told I was going to be full time for sure.  
3) I have busted my ass for this job doing more then anyone in this little slow store.  I have crosstrained to do about everything... I have came in,  helped where I was needed... Whenever they needed.  I have been here before the manager himself rotated to our store.

One of the people I unfortunately used to call my friend seems to have ostracized me from the rest of my friends. I'll be talking to one of them, and when the other 2 appear they will start ignoring me, leaving me standing on the outside listening on. It's got to the extent where I'm now only able to talk to one person, and the only time I matter is when I bring up drama, or i'm the last resort which is unfortunate because before this aforementioned person came, my friends used to treat me as an equal and we had so much fun. Nothing changed so I don't know what happened, if this person sees I'm talking to one of my friends she will purposely start taking to them and start having them ignore me, I honestly don't know how she does it. The simple answer would be to find new friends because they aren't loyal, but that's not easy since I'm a shy person. I'm ignored frequently at home, or yelled at, so my friends were my only refuge, and she took that from me. It all started when I beat her in this competiton, so I'm assuming she may have become jealous? But I see no reason to be...

185,"I will try to make it short but I feel like a lot of aspects are very important to this story.

I'm 21 yo female, I have 12 yo brother and my mother moved away from my father almost 9 months ago.

My father has been always verbally (and sometimes physically) abusing our whole family since the day one but I was told he was just bad at showing his love.
I never really felt like he cared about me, or my mother, and he never appreciated everything what my mother did for our whole family.

Three years ago my father started cheating, I knew from day one because I saw how he changed in handling his phone and he was never home, his stories didn't feel real to me. My mom found out about it after 6 months and since then, she tried to work it out - my father promised he will stop it but instead continued to see the other woman and her family (her son and daughter are few years younger than me and my brother).
He became even more abusive but I was not present for most of it because I started to study far away from home and then spent one year abroad.

My mother had to get very serious surgery and when she was resting at home, my father told her he had some business travel to go to but he will try to come back asap to take care of her. My mom, being in a lot of pain, was forced to drive to pharmacy for some pain killers and on her way back she saw my father's car parked in front of that bi*ch's house and decided that she will move away from him (I told her I 1000% support her decision).

My grandmother from my father's side hates my mom's guts because she says she gave up too early (after 2 and a half years is early?) and that other women in our family lived even 18 years with their cheating husbands because of children.

My grandmother and grandfather from my father's side never really took care about me but they always gave me a lot of money. When they asked if I needed something for my study abroad, I thanked them and said that I will gladly accept it. I was very busy so I replied to their e-mails maybe 2 or 3 weeks later, but I always made sure to keep in contact. 

I have a very close relationship with my mother so, of course, I am on her side, everytime. 
I do not like to contact my father very often because I just don't feel like seeing him but my brother loves him, so I do it for him.
I also don't feel like contacting his parents because we have nothing to talk about and recently I found out they said that I'm not their granddaughter because I don't like them (which is not true, I love them but I am just not close to them) and that I am disrespectful, very rude and I always text them only for money (again, not true, they approached me first, I just accepted).

My mother's side told me, when I asked them for their honest opinions, that even though I am sometimes very hard to approach because I am not touchy-feely type, I was never disrespectful.
My mother partly agrees that I am rude because even though my father did what he did, he is still my father, and my grandparents are still my grandparents, and I should be nice and I should make them feel like I care about them.

What I need advice about is - what now? Should I really start contacting them often just because we are blood related, even though I feel like they have been kind of toxic part of my life?
Could I have this ideas about my family members just because of what they do to my mother? Could it be that they don't do anything bad but are hurt just because I am on my mother's side?

I just don't know what to do and think anymore. I have this feeling that I am not obligated to keep close relationships with someone like them but my mother keeps telling it's just because I am too young to understand that.

197,"Hey guys, so most of my life my father has been a very quick to anger man. He was never physically abusive to me throughout my childhood, but he has always been very verbally abusive. Not just to me but my mother and my brother when he still lived in the house.

I am coming up on 21 here soon and I do still live in my parents house. I've had a lot of hiccups as I've grown up, from failing high school to not having enough initiative to get a GED in a timely fashion, or get another job in a timely fashion, among other issues that come with growing up and maturing.

 I realize these issues I've had growing up have had some sort of impact on my father's behavior, but most of these things that I had issues with just come with growing up and becoming more mature, and I am constantly improving and learning from my past mistakes, but my father's behavior only gets worse and worse as I do better and better.

The past couple of weeks have been really bad with him, normally you get a feeling of kind of having to walk on egg shells around him because you never know what kind of mood he'll be in, or what will trigger his rage, but it has especially been bad as of recent. To the point where I am completely avoiding him to the best of my ability.

Early today he had asked me to bring the drink I was holding (A protein shake) and bring it downstairs. My mother needed some help with something so I set it down while I was helping her and my father saw it sitting on the table upstairs and started to get upset because I hadn't brought it downstairs yet, so I got up and said I was going to bring it down now and I accidentally dropped the plastic cup which spilled it all over his room. Just a simple mistake but one that set him into a complete rampage. He started screaming at me saying ""This is why I asked you to bring it downstairs!"" and my mother came in trying to tell him that the windows were open and the neighbors would hear him screaming, this set him into a further rage because my mother was interjecting to let him know this behavior was not okay. I walked downstairs to grab some cleaning supplies and when I came back upstairs to clean up the mess he just slammed the door and locked himself in making it so I couldn't clean it up.

This is a common occurrence where small mistakes or things will trigger this kind of rage in him. We have tried years of family counseling, with minimal results. He will often be nice for the day that we go to counseling but the next day it will be right back to the same behavior. He can also be very difficult to talk to even when he's not raging just because he's always outside working on something, and if you disturb him he gives you a treatment like ""Why the f**k are you bothering me?"". 

It's hard to detail years of verbal abuse without you having experienced it yourself, but I decided that I was done with this behavior and it was time for me to emotionally distance myself as much as I can while still living in the same house with him. Unfortunately I don't really have the ability to make it out on my own. It's hard to just keep putting faith into someone and hoping that they will improve and become more loving, and to just be let down time after time. Especially when he claims that the only reason he is the way he is is because of the mistakes I have made, and sure I'm sure there is some validity to that, it doesn't act as an excuse to treat people the way he does, especially since I am making strides in improving my life. He doesn't treat other people this way as well, only my mother and I. Since my brother moved out their relationship has improved. Even as I write this post my father is treating my mother poorly.

Do you guys have any advice or experience in a matter like this? I'm really looking for anything because I feel a little bit lost in what I can do. Thanks a lot for reading this and any advice you have and I hope you have a splendid weekend! ",19Aug2017,7
198,"So I live in Pennsylvania, and I'm 18 right now. I had this idea of saving up $20,000 in the next 12 or more months for living expenses, and driving near Atlanta to get an apartment and find a job. I'm a cook, and sent my resume to a bunch of different places, and asked for interviews already. Obviously I cant do that now but in a year when I get my ServSafe Managers cert, it seems like it couldn't be hard to find a job in the time of me looking for one. 

I plan on driving my car down there with anything that can fit in it and having an apartment ready to go when I arrive. The cost of living down there is extremely cheap compared to up north. Do you guys think this would be a feasible idea?

I also have a good credit history now, so in a year hopefully I'll be good to rent an apartment on my own",19Aug2017,1
199,"For some background information I'm 22, female, and only have a high school diploma. I attended a semester of college and wanted to stay, but my living situation collapsed and I had to leave the state where I went to college or else I'd have been homeless. I have been working in retail ( in the same store i got originally hired in ) for two years. My grandparents are obviously pressuring me to get out of their house and find a job that can earn me more money than my part time retail job ( which i'm absolutely content with ) but I know it obviously can't support me forever. 

However I'm extremely depressed ( think about suicide on a daily basis ) and cannot tell anybody or seek help because I'm dependent on my grandparents for rides places, and they will ridicule me to no end if they knew how I felt. I have no friends ever since moving to this state after my brief time in college, and when I say that I mean LITERALLY no friends, I don't have one person that's not online that I can talk to or physically hang out with. I've tried making friends at work ( I'm an extrovert so this could be a reason for my depression ) but nobody seems to like me because I have very unusual interests and I don't have very good hygiene due to my depression. I shower every night before work so it's never an issue of being smelly, but I've gotten lazy with brushing my hair, I don't wear very nice clothes and I've never worn makeup. 

I'm not sure what I'm suppose to do. I can't even imagine myself in a job that requires actual training or doing something I like. I'm basically a jack of all trades, but master of none, meaning I can do almost anything decently ( writing fiction, html, fixing computers, Photoshop, video editing with Sony Vegas ) but I don't know if I could ever be good enough at one thing to be able to make a living off it, OR I don't know what I could do. Sometimes I just want my grandmother to pick something for me, and I'd have no choice in the matter so I'd just have to do it, because the whole idea of choice is what's holding me back.

201,"Little bit of a backstory: Her (20F) and I (24M) dated for about a year and a half. She broke up with me about 3 months ago. She didn't feel the same love for me anymore and she wanted to work on herself. Shit. It was the first time I've ever been heartbroken. I was a complete wreck for the first month and a half. I tried to get her back, tried to remain friends, tried to go to parties that I knew she was gonna be at even though I knew it would hurt, etc. Went through all the phases of grief since then and as of a few weeks ago I've finally reached a point of no contact. I've accepted the fact that although she wants to remain friends, it just hurts too much right now for me to even try. 

Now I understand the phrase ""Don't shit where you eat.""

I work alongside her in a relatively small restaurant. I've had my schedules swapped around so that I don't work alongside her often but I still have to see her almost every time I work. Every time I see her, it just tears at my heart. I think about her enough as it is but working alongside her just feels like torture. We hardly speak nowadays but she'll still initiate conversation to say ""hi"" or ""whats up"" but I always just give short responses and try not to delve deeper. I thought it would get easier but it's still a pain to even see her, regardless of if we talk or not.

I have the option to transfer to another location about 20-30 minutes away, where-as my current location is just down the street. I would have to drive further to get to the other store but I would also be able to add distance to this painful breakup. 

I can't make a decision, I'm not sure if I'm just making a judgement based on emotional impulse or if this is truly a logical, rational decision. I know that if I go there, I won't have to torture myself by working alongside her or hearing about any potential things through the grapevine. I'll finally have distance.
What should I do? Stay and just tough it out? Or transfer?",19Aug2017,2
203,"recently ive been losing or pushing my friends away.

then i cut off my cousin after i had a miscarriage. she was super rude and mean after it had happened and told me to get over it and basically told me since i did get pregnant i did it to myself.

205,"I recently found out that someone who I thought was my best friend considers me a toxic person in his life and that he needs to cut me out. His reasoning was that I treat him like a child--and that's all the explanation he gave.

When you look up any article on the internet or on Reddit about dealing with ""toxic people,"" that term is tossed around vaguely and always with the same conclusion: just cut that person out of your life.

But at what point is someone toxic? Are they toxic for unknowingly treating you in a way that you didn't like? I had no idea that I came across as condescending to him--I reached out to him to apologize for what it was I was doing and asked if he could let me know what it was so that I could try and fix that behavior. If my friends have an issue with the way I treat them, I'm more than willing to try and fix my behavior for them--I just need to know how. However instead of telling me how it was I mistreated him, he got angry and said some hurtful stuff to me (words that specifically targeted what he knows I'm self-conscious about from personal conversations we've had.) I chose to not respond to that, and we haven't talked in a week.

And this all came out of nowhere for me. My friend and I have been close for awhile, we share interests and have a similar sense of humor and (I thought) just generally enjoyed spending time together, even if we were just sitting around wasting time.

I'd like to think that I could work things out with this friend. When we were on good terms, it was always such a fun and energizing friendship. I don't doubt that something about the way I acted came across wrong to him, and I won't put myself on a pedestal and claim all innocence and perfection, but I honestly can't believe that I was a ""toxic"" enough person to warrant being cut out--but I think maybe too many pop-psych articles convinced him otherwise.

I mostly needed to vent, but if anyone has any advice I would love to hear it.",19Aug2017,2

207,"**Edit: got the clap. yay.**

Precursor: slightly NSFW. Sorry.

Also, this isn't a thread asking for medical advice. The following paragraph is for backstory.

I'm an 18 year old sexually active male, and as of today have had some pretty shit symptoms. This morning, after dropped a quick number 2, I noticed that there was a strange white liquid (not semen) coming from the tip of my dick. Upon further analysis, I deduced that it was probably pre-cum. This was strange, as I'm not into butt stuff and the fact that it was triggered upon me taking a shit was pretty alarming, as nothing like that has ever happened. I decided that was probably a sign that I needed to masturbate to solve the issue (which was odd as I had sex yesterday, so I didn't exactly have a high sex-drive at the moment). This didn't solve the problem, and actually caused a great deal of pain on ejaculation. And, even after that, the liquid kept coming out. It's since then stopped, but I just went to the restroom to piss and it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. As-in, on the ground yelling for help pain (no parents at the house (un?)fortunately) No kidney stone or anything like that was visible. On top of this, my sexual partner has *not* had any other partners aside from me, so I don't think this is STD related.

Anyway, this isn't really a medical advice thread - I want to know if I can go to an urgent care without notifying my parents. I'm 18 years old and am under my dad's health insurance. The co-pay is $20 or so to go. **If I go, will my parents be notified of this visit?**

Tl;dr: my dick is causing me a great deal of trauma, can I use an urgent care facility under my parents insurance to avoid a shitty conversation **without notifying my parents**?",19Aug2017,0

Ever since I was little I've been infatuated with exploring and seeing new places. Before I had been admitted into the college I'm in now, my plan after graduating had been to just get a hiking pack together and just leave. I know it's considered irresponsible and lazy but I want nothing more than to just wander and see the world, even if it means just starting here in the states. It's now three years later and that feeling of unrest is still here. If I find myself looking at hiking gear and just wondering how easy it could be to walk away. It's not the fact of avoiding responsibilities, I don't mind working and contributing, it's just that my end goal, my dream, is to visit beautiful places and take gorgeous photos. I want so desperately to leave all of this behind and I don't think I can, I now have college debt, and two steady jobs; but even then I could just leave it all behind, it wouldn't take much. I don't want my friends and family to worry about me, wonder whether or not I'm safe and warm or even alive, but that would be a risk I'm okay with. I know how much of a disappointment I would be, and it stings but that's another factor I'm okay with should push come to shove.

I don't know why I'm so fascinated by them, but I think it's just the thought that someone who seems way more interesting and smarter than me would have any sort of interest in me.

He wanted my dad to take him and his brother to the hospital and he was going to pay him $30 for it. My mum basically started saying, why do you always do things to people bla bla, and it turned into an argument. I went down and asked what the problem was, and my mum was going on and on. I said to my mum ""how does it affect you? you don' have to go"" and she said in a demanding tone he's always taking people places. Her argument comes down to ""no one ever pays"" which even if it was the case, he is on this occasion and a lot more than he would use in gas. She just kept going on, and I and my dad lost our temper and told her to shit up, it's not affecting you,it's not your car, you don't have to go. But she was still making little jabs. Then suddenly she starts acting like she's the victim, and how it's all to spite her while still going on. Finally she stops, and goes up to bed. But she is like this about everything. If she want's to go somewhere and my dad can't take her she moans that he's just being spiteful, she's two faced like fuck and will talk about people behind their back and then when say visit or she sees them she's nice to them.

Strange in the way that I say all the stupid thoughts that come to mind -- not strange in an inappropriate way or anything. Anyway, there's a really cute boy that I work with who makes fun of me all the time. I can take a joke, but it turned from being playful to being straight up rude and tactless. I let him get away with it bc I thought he was good looking, but after feeling like shit after going to work the last few times, I decided I needed my power back. I decided to keep to myself for the next couple shifts and be civil and give him as little a chance to tear me apart as possible. I'm really nice and I even offered to spot him on a loan he owes this month so that he doesn't end up getting in a financial rabbit hole. 

Well yesterday he asked one of the girls I work with if she was a virgin and she said no and then he blocked my path and asked me the same thing. I told him it was none of his business and then he said ""oh wait. Of course you've had sex because you were dating a fucking gangster before"" and given his tone and the context of him hating me, it came off as if he was calling me a whore. The girl was like ""that's fucked up."" And then I lost it. I said ""one sec"" and I ran around the corner to shed a few quick tears out of frustration and anger bc idk why he thinks it's okay to treat me as if I am not a person. 

Then he followed me back and said sorry and I said that I was fine and not to worry about it. Then later I heard him talking to the girl and he was like ""today sucks. First I owe my debt, then I made ______ cry, now what. I hope my day goes better tomorrow."" So like -- he was bummed bc I ruined his day...?? And he's complaining about his debt even though I told him I'd spot him and he accepted?? Wtf!? After I heard him say this I told him that my offer still stands for the debt thing and he said okay. He sulked for the rest of the day even though I was back to normal and then today we could barely look each other in the eye. I tried to ease the tension and was like ""ah no don't tell me you're gonna cry too!"" And then he just stared at me deadpan and was like ""I won't because I'm not a little bitch"" 

What do I do because he is basically my store's golden boy bc he is funny and also pretty much the only boy who works with us. Everyone thinks I'm a bitch now for making him feel uncomfortable. No one will really talk to me that much and I feel like o ruined the whole dynamic of the store. I didn't mean to cry I was just pushed over the limit. I don't know what to do I am trying to be nice but it's also hard to talk to him at all because I don't know where he's at.

I'm unable to find a job either due to my strict and long hours at my university and due to that the system here entails losing scholarships if the student works but I have a semester left. 

My parents have been fighting since I was a child and it affected me mentally to great degrees where I can't tolerate loud noises and weep when someone shouts at me for no apparent reason and in ways difficult to control 

Both parents work , we live in a house with a mortgage paid fully by my mom. My mom is a generous woman financially but stubborn , hard headed and has OCD from dust so must keep everything extra clean , my father is very stingy , careless, stubborn and not with good hygiene. and in times of need for money he would not really ask about any of us. Happened through my tutoring classes and my college admission fees when I asked for some help he just left me saying he's not responsible.

They keep throwing words at each other constantly fighting so they recently had an intense fight following a period of a month and a half not talking among many , where he wore ""dirty"" shoes so my mother demanded that he washes his feet or otherwise leave her house he refused and called her sick and she lashed out on him , on abandoning responsibility and walking on her always in front of the kids praying that she gets harmed or insulting her 24/7 for a reason or none. 

She was shouting so loud and so madly and they almost were close to fighting physically if not for our interference. She controls his other car and he all his keys and if he comes from somewhere she's not sure of he has to shower , it has always been like that for years I'm tired of this. 

She demanded he divorce her and that she no longer wants to see his face and wishes he dies and he replied the same also saying that he's only stayed for the kids. 

Im numb now for the most part but I'm scared for my 5 siblings . I don't know how to protect them or make them understand it will be okay

I tried to tell them after the fight , it's not their fault or their responsibility to solve between our parents and no matter what happens we have each other 

Should I interfere ? Or try to just distance myself and find my peace of mind! ",19Aug2017,1
237,"Last year, we had an exchange student from Germany come to study at my school. At the time I had the usual thoughts of ""oh, she's cute"" but nothing any more serious than that. We spoke a few times in class (I'm a German major) and we always got along quite well, and as time went on I began to develop more feelings for her. I never felt like I should make an effort to act on them seeing as how, by that point, she'd be going back in just a few months. 

We sort of fell out of contact when she left for home. But recently I found out I'll have the chance to study at a German university that happens to be nearby where she lives. I decided I'd try and talk to her again, seeing as how we had something to talk about. I messaged her and since then we've been talking a lot, at least as much as the time difference allows. 

At one point she asked me what I wanted to study, I told her I hoped to become a German teacher back in the states. After I said that she replied ""Yeah? Maybe you should just be an English teacher in Germany👀"". Which I thought was odd, to say the least. But I figured why not just go for it. I asked her if she'd like to meet while I'm there and that perhaps she could show me around, to which she said she'd love to. 

At this point I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into things or what. I do have feelings for her, I know that much. Should I tell her before I actually go there? ",19Aug2017,15

241,"I'm (finally) starting my PhD, so my girlfriend and I moved across the country to the university, into an apartment complex within walking distance of the campus. The person in leasing office mentioned that they have a ""lot of international students"", and kept giving me furtive glances, but I didn't think anything of it at the time, as the location is less than a block away from the international student center.

We moved in, and almost immediately, we noticed our neighbors on both sides are constantly standing out on the balcony that provides access to our apartments, on the phone. That would be fine, except they constantly come stand in front of our apartment (and our large, floor to ceiling windows), and peer in while they're on the phone. Not even like, trying to be non-chalant about it, blatantly staring through the blinds, craning their heads to get a look. It's even worse when my girlfriend's service dog is at the window, as she noses the blinds open, leaving a huge gap that they all seem to cluster around to stare. 

My girlfriend was incredibly uncomfortable with this (waking up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and finding someone staring at you through your window will do that), so I tried to say something to them. Immediately all four of them (2 in each apartment) started accusing me of being racist, that it was ""their culture"" (they are Indian), and if we didn't have anything to hide we shouldn't worry. 

My girlfriend is out buying drapes for the windows right now, but I'm worried that they'll still attempt to stare in when her service dog goes to the windows. (She's a big dog, so she'll probably still push the blinds and curtains open enough for people to see in when she does).

I don't understand how it's being racist to say, ""Could you please respect our privacy and not stare in our windows?"" But if it is, please tell me how you would suggest I deal with this situation? 

TLDR: Neighbors stare in our windows, told me I was racist when I asked them to stop.",19Aug2017,88
242,"Hi /r/advice! I am a 19-year old that recently graduated high school in May. I graduated a bit late, but I stuck through with it and received my diploma. At the moment, I am just living at home, working, and saving money.

I am not interested in attending college, mostly due to the fact that I have a math disability and I would not be able to handle all of the core classes associated with receiving a degree. I heard from a friend that doing suicide/crime scene cleanup requires no degree and little to no formal training, and also pays surprisingly well. It is somewhat difficult to find information about this online, so here I am. Could anyone here provide me with any information on obtaining department of health certifications, or possibly to another subreddit that could give me more information? How would you guys suggest I go about pursuing this? Thanks",19Aug2017,1
243,so i have a group of friends i love to hang out with at school and on weekends. but recently a couple of them have started to get into smoking and doing drugs. (my friends and i are around the age of 14/15). i haven't and don't want to start doing what they're doing but it's hard for me. i don't want to surround myself around those sorts of things but they're my friends and i hang out with them daily. i don't want to loose them as friends but at the same time i don't want to be around drugs and smoking. i don't don't know what to do... ,19Aug2017,1
244,"I'm in college and work part time. I have 3 siblings two of which are in high/middle school. One is also an adult (they attend college classes) but they are a total shut in - doesn't leave the house, barely leaves his room, and no job. (most of the family has these autistic tendencies, even in my younger siblings, they don't leave the house or do anything) My little sister has spent the entire summer indoors on her phone more or less.

My mom used to live with us but she literally left abruptly months ago to live with a significant other, essentially no contact with us. She does not come over here and only sees the younger kids on the rare occasion (at most 3-5 times a month). 

My dad visits on almost a daily basis which is great for my siblings but he is insanely cheap and stubborn. These guys barely have any food here let alone other necessities (healthy food..paper towels, toilet paper - everything is scarce here), he has no clue how to be a father esp to my brother who is clearly struggling to say the least (there's no food for him either). 

Basically I'm at a point where living on my own with roommates would be a much better situation for me. I don't know what else to do. I never asked for this disaster to take place. I grew up alone but through that I learned a lot that most people my age would never understand. Unfortunately my parents abusive codependent relationship set our whole family up for failure from a really young age.

I can give more details only if desired. I'm just looking for advice on what to do and simply how to process a situation like this. I'm gonna try to talk to my brother and motivate him there's still a lot of help needed here.",19Aug2017,1

250,"I've realized that, as a white, middle-class male, I will be treated as the background noise of history. Anything I achieve in the future will be something that I snatched away from someone less fortunate. Being born to a liberal family in San Francisco, I've noticed this everywhere. Even in my school (I'm a teenager) when my teacher asked if anyone wanted to go into the sciences, I raised my hand. She said that she wasn't looking for white males (a literal quote). At a motivational speech at the same school, they decided that it was okay to say, to the masses of students, that ""whites, men, and Christians are at the top, keeping us down [our school was vastly Asian and Mexican] but you can still be great if you try."" I realize that there are less fortunate people than me, but I would appreciate it if people would stop saying that people like me are oppressors based on what we look like, especially to our faces. I would appreciate it if I were treated as more than just a backdrop to the real stars who opposed the vicious reign of people like me and eventually, myself, once I actually venture into the real world. I don't want to be seen as one of the people who steal opportunity from those who they don't deem fit. I want to send the message that I am not part of a grand conspiracy because of my race and gender, and I am not trying to hurt people just by trying my best. I am a unique individual with unique experiences who just wants to make people proud. Why can't we just view people that way? For some reason, we have to group people together and assign traits to them, mine being ""default."" It has just made me feel terrible, and I've talked to my parents but my mother straight up agrees with this and my father is pretty close to full-on white guilt. I begin to radicalize myself, more and more every day. And before anyone writes ""white male tears"" or something like this: I don't look for sympathy. I don't know how to handle it. Everyone at my school or home tells me how terrible it is to be a white heterosexual guy. ",19Aug2017,1
251,"This is my first reddit post, apologies in advance if I am posting in the wrong place or doing something against the rules. Tell me if it's the case and I'll gladly fix it.

There is someone in my apartment building who frequently steals packages from the package area inside the building. Packages have been stolen from all the residents in the building, and it seems to only have started happening in the last two months. The apartment's management company has made it very clear (notices posted in common areas, emails, etc) that they can't (won't) do anything about it.

I normally don't get packages delivered to my building, but I forgot to do that last week when I ordered a pair of shoes. Of course, they were stolen from within the building.

I would like to get an empty amazon box and put a simple RFID(?) sticker in it somewhere and leave it for the thief to pick up. Ideally, once they've taken the box, I could use my phone to locate it, and their apartment. At that point, I'm not entirely sure what I would do, but it would be a step closer to finding my shoes if they haven't been sold already. Also maybe it could help put an end to all of the theft in the building.

What I need advice on is the actual device I would need to get in order to track the fake package. I've seen some things on amazon like the Pixie tags [(pixie amazon page)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071CWD6Q7?aaxitk=855vBo0BEK28AwyLB66F.A) for finding your keys or wallet. I was hoping to find some kind of cheap sticker version of this that does the same thing, but doesn't cost much. Also if anyone has any experience with any products like these, I'd very much appreciate any thoughts.

TLDR I want to use a cheap tracking device to find the apartment of a thief in my building, but I need help figuring out what device will work for this application.

252,"So I'm taking a semester off of school to work and decide what I want to study. I've changed my major nearly every year of college and just haven't found my calling. I've tried French, sociology, math, music. Thought about linguistics. Nothing is exciting me. 

I enjoy foreign languages but am getting incredibly bored of French classes. The main reason I was studying French for a little bit was to study abroad, but my university just recently cancelled the France trip. I'm fascinated by human civilization and social interactions but sociology was too depressing. I love playing musical instruments but I don't think I possess the talent to be accepted into my university's music school. 

I have the hardest time passing any science class so I want to avoid that. However I love nature, wildlife, and anything outdoorsy. But biology though.... ugh. 

So I have all these credits from all these different areas of study but like I can't stick with any of them. I've wasted so much money and time in college so far feeling lackluster about everything I study. 

What should I do? I'm considering setting up an appointment with a counselor. Is university not for me?",19Aug2017,1
254,"So pretty much I fucked up hard and I know I deserve what I get for doing something so reckless. At the same time I'm a student and I really don't want this to affect me in the future

Pretty much I keep getting really bad anxiety thinking that I'm pretty much fucked my whole life and I keep worrying thinking theres no point in living. Like what's the point if I'm pretty much a criminal in everyone's eyes? I can't get a job I'll have a criminal record, and I'll never get to drive again...

But sometimes I just don't care, I see the DUI as nothing. It's just something that happened and I fucked up and it's gonna take me some time and money but it shouldn't be something that stops me from living life. I can do everything I still want its just that I feel super worried that even trying to continue to live my life, I still would be prohibited...

258,"I'm a single young dude that's finally thinking about getting into a committed relationship. However, I'm also thinking of moving out of the state in a few months. To where I'm not really sure, to be honest I'm just kind of sick of my hometown and want better job opportunities and lower cost of living elsewhere.

Should I date any of the girls here, or should I pretty much hold off until I've moved and settled into my new area?

I've given this some thought and figured maybe I could date, but bring up how I'm going to move soon and find out if that's a dealbreaker in the relationship. Though, I can't think of any situation where a girl's willing to move in with me across the country after just a few months, and to be honest, I'm kind of a long-run type of person... That, and I'm trying to save up as much money as I can so I can afford the moving expenses.

I don't know for sure though, just kind of seeing if there's any advice anyone can give me, or if it's just a ""who cares, go for it!"" kind of situation.

Thank you! Even if you don't have any advice thanks for reading my post and have a great day.",19Aug2017,1
