0,"The Story: Last semester, I was a TA for an intermediate class in my major. There was one other TA for the class (let's call him Tyler) and we became very close friends as a result of spending 15-20 hours a week together grading and prepping for the class. Tyler is graduating in May and is planning his future around his girlfriend of about 1 year; he definitely wants to get a good entry level position but won't leave the area for a job because she still has two more years of school left. 


This semester, I had to change professors for my TA job because of my class schedule, and I work with four other TAs now. I'm especially close with one of them, let's call him John. Me, John, and one of the other TAs were hanging out on Friday and after a couple drinks John confesses that he'd slept with Tyler's girlfriend multiple times. He says he isn't going to do it again but frankly I'm not convinced. He knows I'm good friends with Tyler and begged me not to tell him, but I really feel like I should. It's getting late to get spots in the good training programs in our field, and Tyler has a killer resume and personality that could get him one of those spots if he'd be willing to relocate. I know he would be if they broke up (he doesn't like the area around our school) and there's pretty much zero chance he would forgive her for cheating.


But if I tell, John is obviously going to know it was me since I'm the only mutual friend. I think it's terrible that he slept with a girl that he knew was in a relationship with someone else in our same major, but he's been a good friend to me and I don't want to throw that away. Plus we still have to work together, and I'd rather not make an enemy of my coworker.


TLDR: current coworker/friend slept with former coworker/other friend's girlfriend. If I don't tell him he's jeopardizing his (potentially very bright) future for a girl that doesn't love him, but if I do tell then my current coworker will hate me. So do I tell?",14Feb2017,1

2,I do this thing where when I am attracted to someone I get really insecure that they don't like me back or think I'm ugly etc. so I go out of my way to make sure they think I don't care about them and I start acting like a bitch towards them. It's like I'm so scared of rejection or making the first move that I want to pass off as uninterested but obviously I am. Does anyone do the same thing or knows how I can deal with it?

9,"I'm currently in the second semester of my junior year and I'm not sure if I want to keep doing this anymore. I'm not failing or anything, but I'm not doing spectacular either. I never really had a passion for engineering and just went with it because I was decent enough at math and physics in highschool and personally felt indifferent towards the subjects. Now though I find myself pretty bored and unsatisfied.

My true passion has always been history, but I've never given it the time of day due to believing that I'd never find a job in the field. However, whenever I go off talking about history to people (including my parents) they will constantly tell me that I would make a great history teacher or professor. There's no doubt in my mind that I'd start enjoying myself and my life far more if I switched to history, but I'm still not convinced that taking the risk is worth it.

So, should I try and go for majoring in history, or should I stick with ME just to get my bachelor's and then decide whether I should just bite the bullet and be an engineer or still try and pursue history in grad school?",14Feb2017,0
11,"Hey guys! 
I recently quit playing a video game that was consuming my life. Probably 3-5 hours of playing daily. It got to the point that is was affecting my career and I stopped playing. I actually got a lot of money from selling some of the wealth I had on my account so it was a nice bonus. 

However: My crazy 24/7 schedule is starting to slow down and I'm finding myself with a lot of free time. Its usually later in the day so all I do is browse the internet and inevitably end up wanting to play the game again. I've made a lot of progress and spend some of the extra time working out and have picked up a few hobbies but I still am in this position.

Basically I'm just hoping anyone has had a similar experience and could share how they dealt with it. I don't want it consuming my life again.",14Feb2017,6
12,"I always said I wanted to be single, at least for the next like 5 years. (I'm 23 now) I haven't had the chance to be a bachelor yet since I'm not yet done with college.

But I had this insight that A LOT of people meet their partner through mutual friends or perhaps grown up in the same town. I have been rejecting (or at least not putting in any effort) to the girls in my town, the girls I hang out with, the girls my friends hang out with.

14,"Hey guys,

I have had what I believe is low self esteem my entire life.

Essentially, I've always wanted to be loved, do something I love for good money, be fit, and have solid relationships

Ultimately, I am 26 with nothing to show. I got into a great university but was plagued with depression and anxiety (I think its genetic my dad was the same way and ended up leaving our family when I was 10)

I dropped out of school, never went back and have essentially been grinding paychecks to get by.

I have a decent job now, I make ok money (35k/yr) but I spend most of my life in a cubicle with an emotionally abusive boss who legitimately makes me want to kill myself every day

I keep doing drugs to pass the little free time that I have... rinse and repeat (Spinning my wheels and damaging my brain)

I feel like I have been living the same day over and over for 5-6 years

Most of my friends say I'm a great funny guy but I am dying inside of loneliness and disappointment

How can I break out of this bullshit? I have gotten to a point where I can not stop thinking about killing myself because I have visions of me 10-20 years from now still broke and lonely with no friends that aren't using me

I don't have health insurance and I can not afford therapy or medication

I hope you guys can help me

Thanks ahead of time",14Feb2017,8
15,"So my car was broken into earlier today and a police officer apprehended the person trying to steal stuff from me. I filed a statement at the station and retrieved my items, but now I need to figure out how to get the glass replaced in the rear passenger door. I drive a 2016 WRX and I'm not sure if the tinting on the glass is from the factory or aftermarket. It also sounds like the person breaking into my car has no assets to speak of, so I'm counting out pursuing them for damages.

Should I go to the dealership and get Subaru labeled glass installed?
I live in a state where glass is subject to my deductible, which is $500. Should I even inform my insurance company that my car was broken into?

Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",14Feb2017,1
16,"I'm a teenager. I still live with my mom and it's really bad. Every teenager goes the problems with her parents, I know that. But the things that I go through with my mom are things that aren't normal. all my mom does every day is scream at me. She is an alcoholic, a severe alcoholic. No, she's not drunk every day but even if she isnt she still screaming at me for nothing. When my brothers act up or when someone makes her mad she automatically takes everything out on me. Today I told her that I have A huge amount of homework and instead of doing dishes I asked if I could forward some of the clothes that you washed instead. Her first response was screaming, as always. And I didn't even do anything wrong. she told me that she's going to turn off my phone and take away everything because of asking that question. that she doesn't want me here and she hates me and calls me a bitch. no this doesn't seem like biggest thing in the world. But it's every day I'm constantly being brought down by her and her problems and if she's in a bad mood she has to make me in a bad mood too. I'm at that age where I could leave if I wanted to but I have to have a job. I'm trying my hardest but it's so hard to be motivated and be eager to do things in my life when I know that every day that I come on I have to do with her and her issues and her alcohol. my mom isn't a good person. at first I thought this is just what moms and daughters argue about but what I've told you wasn't even the half of it. I just don't know what to do. I don't know if it's the right thing to be posting this or not. Please give advice. Thanks. ",14Feb2017,1
18,"My boyfriend has a hard time discussing things before he reaches his boiling point.

Like last week we were doing something together and he was annoyed, so I got a little annoyed back in response but I was trying to keep the mood light, I didn't understand why he was annoyed. I was asking because he was acting quietly aggressive and pissed so he yelled at me that I had been a demanding brat the entire night. Then something else he was doing started going wrong and he got pissed and started cursing and threw something hard on a prized family possession of mine. I told him quietly not to do it, that I cared about that object (relative who passed away gave it to me) and he yelled at me to shut my mouth. I stood my ground and said I didn't want him to damage this family heirloom again and he told me to shut it. I had tears rolling down my face at this point, mostly because he'd said I was a demanding brat with such disgust that I felt I'd done something, that he didn't like me as a person. Then he slammed one of my belongings on the floor and threw a couple others across the room and said he was leaving. I asked where and he said anywhere, that he couldn't be in our house anymore. He then saw I was quietly crying and despite being very angry decided to stay, and apologized and hugged me. I had no idea what was going on. I thought I'd done something for days, we have different schedules so we didn't talk. Then I asked him about it and he apologized and said he was angry about things unrelated to me and said he'd try to work on it. This happens occasionally and I""d like to help him work on it, but I don't know how, when he's mad he's mad and doesn't really listen to reason. I don't know the difference between when I do something wrong and when it's just his emotions, and it's uncomfortable. Sometimes I don't know for days, sometimes I think our relationship is over, that he has lost his appreciation for me because I've done something wrong. Is this a normal part of communication? I know I should just wait until he cools down but if there is anything else I""d love to hear it. What can either of us do to address this?",14Feb2017,4

24,"I'm a 25 year old guy with little to no skill set and a huge amount of anxiety built up inside. All of this makes it really hard for me to go out there and look for work or go to school. In fact I stopped going to my college classes a few years ago because It was too much for me to keep contained. 

A few years later and I'm sitting in my parents basement, it's 9:30pm and my Dad and two younger sisters are jumping around singing Eye of the Tiger at max volume. I'm 100% sure they know It's bothering me because they keep pounding on the floor during the drum beat and it gets harder and louder every time. I kept quiet and almost had a stroke just listening to all of this.

My littlest sister pops open the door and starts singing ""SHAKE YO BOOTAY"" down the stairs, walks past me and grabs my drumsticks and goes ""Don't you hear us up there?"" which caused me to snap for some reason and I ended up getting mad at her. She put my drumsticks back and I said ""No. Just take them. It's fine, here take them"" and I sort of chucked them at her. I didn't hit her face or anything, more like the back of her legs, and I didn't throw them hard. She's definitely not injured and probably not even feeling it in the slightest, so don't worry about her. Now granted that's probably an overreaction and I could've taken a bit more noise before snapping.. or probably could've not snapped at all.

Even as I write this they're still playing their music loud enough to seep through the walls, but I can still hear their conversation. My sister is angry that I threw the drumsticks at her (I guess?) and they're now talking about how I should move out if I don't like it. 

Obviously I can't do that, so I have to keep quiet. I have no money, no place to go, nothing. I'm the idiot for letting myself get into this situation but I don't know what to do. I don't want to be a little bitch about everything but man it really sucks here. I just want to have a job that I'm good at making money I can spend on a place I can live in.

Can anyone help me figure out my next step? In anything, really. Family, future, anxiety control.. potentially even anger management If I really did cross the line. Anything you can tell me to give me something to hold on to because at this point I feel like I'm going to break and do something really stupid.

This a throwaway for reasons. I typically dont go asking for life advice from complete strangers but this is Reddit. I think that says enough. Anyways. My was at one point close [f]riend was in a relationship with a rather controlling douchebag. Lets call her A and him B. I guess ill be C. So A and B were together for 3 years and we all hangout intermittently not like me and A did beforehand I guess. After a while we drifted apart as life happens and ya know ya lose time. But A and B broke up a few months ago and A got a hold of me a month a go to make plans but I was sick. Fast forward a month I decide to make plans with her. We've hangout the past few weekends now and we get like real close and all but nothing really progresses. Mainly because she is fucking her boss who is 7 years older. Occasionally she will bring up how shitty her ex was and blah blah. Should I just leave and come back at a better time? SHOULD I JUST LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK?! I dont know. That's why im asking you strangers. Tbh I think I answered my own question and just needed to type it out.",14Feb2017,1
26,"Hello, At the end of last month I purchased a 2010 Hyundai Elantra from a highly regarded dealership. Earlier in the day I test drove a car from another dealership to my trusted mechanic for an inspection and he found a lot of problems with it and I ended walking away from that car and the dealership after some negotiation.

I admit I rushed into the car I did purchase due to being distraught with the kind of pricing and interests rates I was being quoted at first dealer and I was thinking no one would give me a reasonable rate and certainly not the one I was asking for. It was later in the day so my mechanic had left shop and all I did was a very short test drive a couple of blocks with the salesman in back.
I'm not car savvy at all so I didn't notice any problems right there and admittedly was a bit nervous with the salesman in back instead of just being able to test drive it alone. So I go through with the deal, sign all the paperwork even when I found out the interest rate was very high. I'm a first time car buyer with the only credit history being one credit car that I've had for a year and a half. I planned to pay it off early anyways so I wasn't to concerned with it. The next day I take it to my mechanic to find out what needs work at some point. He test drives it and says there is something wrong with the transmission.

It hard up-shifts and and down-shifts, it's a very noticeable feeling but only really happens once the car has been warmed up for a bit first, which is why I didn't feel anything when I test drove it the day before. he also found that the front tires were nearly bald and I would have to replace those soon and that the oil was dark and a bit burnt smelling.

He says the car could very well need a new transmission. I've looked up common issues for that model year and there were numerous complaints about consumers having transmission problems and needing them replaced pretty early on(my car has 76,000 on it). I talk to my salesman about this and he tells me I have a 90/3000 mile warranty that would cover a new transmission if it comes to that.

But first he schedules an appointment with their service station to have them look it over and confirm any transmission issues and the next day they call and the tech says that there definitely is an issue with it but they're not a Hyundai dealership so it would have to be sent to one for a final diagnosis. However he tells me that since I'd only had it for a week and the paperwork was still being finalized that I should drive it a few more weeks as is and then they would send it over and I would probably be without the car for a week.

I'm getting discouraged because I wasn't expecting all these issues right off the start when I purchased the vehicle, but I do take full responsibility because I signed the paperwork and was just hoping it was a perfectly good car. I have the car back in my possession currently in it's faulty condition and the dealer still wants me to drive it a few more weeks before anything gets done. At the start of the week I got a call through the bank I got financed through and they just wanted to confirm some things with me which I did. However their last question was ""do you currently have the vehicle and is it in sound running condition?"". It was in service at that time and I told them I did not and that there was a transmission problem. And they told me that until I'm able to tell them I have the car and it's running well, the financing was on hold. and after a lot of back and forth the rest of the week until today the dealer said they were going to go ahead with the financing after I get the car repaired and that the only other option I have is for them to find me a vehicle in the same price range to move into instead.

I was hoping for there to be some way to pull out of the deal because I'm really uncomfortable with this whole situation at this point. Today I called the bank again to see why when the last time I talked to them they were saying they weren't going to finance it due to the car trouble and it not scheduled to be repaired for a few more weeks, to now the dealer saying it was a done deal and I had my 2 options.

However, their saying it's still on hold but not due to the transmission but because my pay is coming up short. I was honest about my pay and never changed my answer. I provided pay stubs but on one of them I had worked a 6th day so my pay was inflated compared to a normal week and I think that's where the problem stems from. Regardless, I was told that the deal would most likely have to be restructured due to this.

I was in there again today to talk to my salesman and he reiterated my options but because the dealerships finance guy that worked on my deal wasn't in today, he scheduled an appointment between the 3 of us in a couple of days where I will once again ask about unwinding the whole deal since the bank still has the deal pending until I can prove my income further.

Since I would like to get out of this deal if there is any possible way, **my question is, if the contract has to be redone, would they just do that and tell me the updated terms, or would I have to agree and sign something else?**

**TL;DR: Rushed into car purchase, found out there are multiple problems, the biggest being the transmission, told it wouldn't be fixed for a few weeks and to drive it during the meantime, financing bank saying my monthly pay not adding up and deal might be redone, trying to see if there is any way out of the deal**",14Feb2017,1

We talk to each other a good amount but we also I guess roast each a lot. Like he says I'm the ugliest person he's ever met in his life and that my cane takes up my entire face type shit. So basically one night about a year ago me and my other friends decided to call him on an unknown number and call him a faggot (because he's gay and I know it makes him mad). Well apparently he got really upset about it and ended up crying about it. Fast forward to the present he finds out that it was me and my friends that made that call and somehow his grandmother found out about this. His grandmother is apparently super pissed and wants us to be in prison for what we did. I'm probably gonna be pulled in the principals office for this. I have no idea what to do I've never been in serious trouble for anything. My friends are telling me that there's a good chance we'll get expelled. What do I do. I don't want my life ruined just for saying one word which I thought he could take. I had no idea that it would upset him that much. I always thought that if he can call me really ugly I thought I could call him a faggot because we're just joking around and not serious.

29,"I'm 30 years old going back to college for a second bachelor's in something I always wanted to do.

However my mental health hasn't been the best. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and hospitalized voluntarily once. I opted to get ECT to help me deal with depression. 

The ECT helped and I currently take two anti depression medications.

However recently to go to this college required moving six hours from my parents. I have worked jobs before, take care of my chores etc. but never lived on my own. I've been here for 30 days and I haven't seen my parents for three weeks.

I find myself feeling very very sad here in this new place. Despite having made a few friends already what I need is the hug of my mom or dad or brother.

I was recently also broken up with, we dated for one year and we both made mistakes and we were very close. Losing her made me feel very alone especially. She lives back in my old town six hours away.

I find myself very depressed without daily interaction with people I'm very close with. I need day to day interaction with my mom or dad or brother or up to recently my ex. 

Now here I am all alone in this apartment six hours away and though I have met people. It does nothing to cure the sadness inside me. It only goes away when people I love are in my life day to day.

Because of how sad I am, I can no longer focus on my school work and I've lost motivation to study and exert myself.

I want to go home, go back to my parents get a job and perhaps date and move out once I've found somebody to do that with.

My sadness is getting to breakdown levels and random crying and talking to myself.

Should I go home or push myself to adapt and try and cope for at least six months? It's just I feel so sad day to day don't know what to do. Don't want to give up my dream either.

I have had bad and good interviews in the past so I can tell that it was one of my best interview, even the interviewer at the end said that ‘I have a very good impression of you and I will give a positive response to my manager about this interview’. I was happy and then looking forward for their email for the second interview. I sent them a thank you email few days after as well.

36,"I'm a 20-year-old college student in India, and I'm a semester away from graduating college with an English Literature degree. I just got my marks for this past semester and.....they are atrocious. I just about scraped by on every subject, but it's so far from what I expected that I feel a bit suicidal, to be honest. I'm honestly considering submitting my papers for revaluation (I can't retake them because I passed, regardless of how narrowly I got by. My university states that retakes are only for people who failed in their first attempt). I feel terrible because I love my major and honestly want to do better. 
But that's not the only thing that's wrong with my life - I honestly have regressed over the past 3 years, ever since I began college. My GPA was strictly average in my first two years, but I made up for it by having 2-3 excellent subjects which I could always point out. This semester, I don't even have that, except an A on one paper. I haven't had much going on outside of college that would be relevant to employers either - I take keyboard classes and learn Indian classical singing, and recently joined Spanish classes, but I have absolutely no experience in the fields I want to join (advertising or copywriting, anything creative). I know my attitude could do with some major adjustment; I barely attended college this semester and paid for it dearly, and I am a massive procrastinator. But I am completely committed to fixing this attitude right now. 

This got a bit too rambly, so I'll summarize the advice I want:

- I have one semester to raise my GPA to about 
average levels. Could I still pull it off or is it too late?

 - How do I cut back on my procrastination?
 
- What skills should I learn that will be useful in digital/media fields? And how do I provide proof of this on my résumé? Will a website or something of that nature do?

- I graduate in May this year. If I work this year and apply to graduate school in say, 2018, will my GPA affect my application? 

I wasn't sure where to post this, I'm fairly new to Reddit. Thanks in advance.",14Feb2017,3
37,"[21/F] I've lived with my grandpa my entirelife. And I'm not gonna lie, he's spoiled me. He pays for my schooling, for one. While I do work for everything I can, he's persistent in making sure he's buying me something. I appreciate everything he's done for me of course, I just feel like he's trying to keep me here with him by buying my love basically. And on top of that he has plans for starting up a company under my name with him involved and if that happens then I definitely won't be able to move away. The only reason I haven't told him no on that is because the money would be amazing. 

I have a good friend who's taking brewery classes at the moment. Once he gets his degree they're going to send him to where-ever a brewey needs someone. He's currently looking at moving to Colorado around May and we've talked on many occasions how amazing it'd be to live there and how badly I want to finally do my own thing. He brought up the idea that if he moves then I should come with, that way he gets a roommate that he knows and we both get to finally move out of Texas. 

Now that the potential is there, I'm terrified for two reasons: literally all of my friends and family are here in Texas and my grandpa won't take it well at all. He's always talked about giving me his house, he wants me to be in his company, and I'm sure he never wants me to move out even if it would be down the road. 

Also, I don't exactly have the money necessary for a down-payment and all that. I've never had my own place, I have no idea what all it entails. But again, this won't happen for another 3 months. 

What do you think would be good for me?

40,"I am currently working on an idea for an app and having been working on it for a long period of time, due to its size and scope.

One of my old school friends that I have known from year 3 is also a programmer as well. 
But we both came from a private school and an ultra-competitive environment.
We have worked on smaller projects together and he has his own software company as well. Thus having access to the capital and resources, to complete the task.

I was hesitant to elaborate the idea with him but he felt like someone who I can trust as a partner.
Recently I decided to open a line of communication with him as I really needed his help as he can help with the backend, web and network stuff whilst I can focus on building out the mobile app.

I have already spoken to him on Skype and shared nearly all of the design and idea documents and so far he hasn't responded at all.

I am worried that he has done a Zuckerberg (google the Facebook story between Mark and the Winlevosses )on me and leaving me with nothing in the end.

What can I do?

 I later called and told her I made a mistake. I needed to take care of something that shift(I know, it was a shitty thing to do), and couldn't make it. She said it was fine, but I'm sure it was obviously annoying.

I'm a teenage guy, medium height and build. I am looking to get a hat.

I need something that can obscure my face a bit. Its really only for specific circumstances, not an always thing.

Now I'm not a fedora-tipping neckbeard, but I'm trying to find some sort of a hat and I'm not sure if there is a way to wear that sort of a hat and have it not be cringey.


If I need to go in public and not be recognized, I usually wear this black snapback and aviators, but its a bit tilted towards the fuckboy side, and while I'm not a neckbeard, I'm not a fuckboy either.


This would mainly be for playing cards with friends, for helping keep a poker face, etc.

I was thinking of a stetson, although I'm not sure if this can be worn without getting dirty looks like a fedora (or trilby) would. I'm really just looking for something chill, but slightly noir, but not in a ""i can b yuor angle or yuor devel"" sort of way.

I don't party, I get A's, I save money, I feel my future is bright. Not much more they could want. I have the opportunity to take a job that's about $10.50/hr, but it is in the mountains at a camp, far away from home. It seems so surreal to me, I am very excited. It is for two months during my summer break. The other month I will have a job that pays $11.50/hr. The problem is my dad wants me to stay at home, in a country bumpkin town of 1,000 and work for $15.00. I like the idea of more money, but not missing out on the experience of working at the camp or living in that town again. My girlfriend is going to work at the camp too, but she is only going if I go, so she would have to quickly find another job and stay in her cruddy town. It is important to mention that I had an opportunity with a nice internship set up, but my parents did not let me do that either. Specifically, they keep mentioning getting a job as someone who holds the signs during construction which I guess pays really well where I am at. I would do it, but I don't like the idea of inhaling all those new tar fumes all summer long. I want to say forget them, I'm a responsible young adult, but I don't want tensions. If it happens so that I can't live with them during that one month where I work the other job, I would have no place to stay and therefore miss out on that job with $11.50. So I can't say whateva whateva do what I want. This may be the only opportunity I get to do this. Also, the job would look good towards my major.

49,"Hi everyone, 

I explain the situation : I am a french graduate student in Canada, I started my study project in January.
Everything is fine for the first two weeks. Then, my thesis supervisor requires me to apply for a grant, two weeks before the deadline (which is in two days now). It takes time, the form require me to writte a lot of stuff about my study, which I don't know well yet. At almost the same moment my thesis supervisor requires me to register for a poster presentation which occures in early March. For this, I need to submit a damn ABSTRACT of my few results so far, with a three days deadline. Fortunately it was finally done yesterday, with heavy help from my supervisor, since I am shit at writting stuff in english, and writting in general.
But now I have just two days to submit this stupide grant application form. I just sent a completed version of the form (which took me 5 hours straight) for revision to my supervisor : apparently almost everything I wrote is worthless and need to be rethinked, modified etc. I only have two days to do that, whithout counting my courses, TA job, assignments. I really don't think can do this, unless my supervisor helps me a lot (but I think he is becoming annoyed by this situation).
Furthermore, I still need to produce a maximum of datas, run a ton of analysis and make a poster in almost two weeks.

In summary :

- I started one month ago
- I have very short deadlines
- I need to write a lot of things quickly
- My english is still not good enough for all of that, my supervisor has to constantly correct a lot of sentences, words etc
- I need to produce a lot of data quickly, and I am afraid quality will suffer
- I am very afraid that my supervisor is annoyed by the fact I need a lot of supervision.
- I am absolutely not used to such bear with heavy work in short amount of time
- I know graduate study are hard, but man this is too much for me in only one month.",14Feb2017,1

Around 7th grade I was friends with this guy, let's name him Alex. Alex was usually a perverted kid, and loved to watch anime. We started talking about of anime, and became best friends for that whole year. During the end of 7th grade year, he had cuts all over his arms and face. I didn't know what exactly happened, but I didn't want things to seem awkward so I didn't ask him about it. When we went into 8th grade, He kind of only attended for about a month, and then suddenly vanished. Half-way through the year, I saw he had a facebook. So I wanted to talk to him and wanted to share moments with him. So we talked, about a day later. He sent me a suicide note, then shortly after he showed me a gun. I felt scared. So I asked him if he was alright and stuff. I asked my friends, they were contacting teachers, and police officers. Thank god for them. The only thing was preventing from killing himself, was hanging out with him. So I skipped school, and wanted to talk to him and ask if he was alright. Apparently, he got sent to a mental daycare. We skipped for about 2 hours, until the cops finally came. He refused to go, and he got cuffed. They said he was going into a hospital, and I got put back into school. 3 days later, he messaged me stuff like, ""Who fucking snitched on me."", I completely tried to avoid the question. Then he started saying ""Watch your fucking back, I'm coming there and I'm gonna kill you."" I acted like a dumbass and tried to taunt him. I got scared immediately, so I told him it was a bunch of friends, not telling him. I just tried to keep everything anonymous. I told him it was a group chat, and he asked me to show it to him. I sent him a fake group, which my friends are playing along with. I need advice, help. Please

59,"Hey r/advice.  I hope you can help me out with this one.

A little background: He's around 33, and his relationship with his girlfriend just fell apart. They lived together and ran a small business together.  What I understand comes secondhand from other family members: After they broke up, he went on a drinking bender.  He tried to cut his wrists, though I am still foggy on how serious everything was (I found this out via my folks, over the phone about an hour ago)  He is apparently ""okay,"" and has promised to stop drinking.

I just got off the phone with him, and he sounded in high spirits, but my family is pretty good about not being expressive.  I didn't want to bring up the attempt, but it feels like there's a big elephant in the room.

Since the attempt, he has gone back to his old job, in the city we grew up in, and is currently apartment hunting.  It's definitely stressful.

Another point to maybe mention is: a lot of his romantic relationships have been very codependent.  He's very independent in pursuing his interests, but I think deep down he's not comfortable being alone, and feels like he has too be in a relationship.

Basically, not enough self love.  I don't know what I can do to help.  Are there places online I can look for therapy research?  I just need some direction I can try and give him.  Right now all I can do is try and maintain a good over-the-phone relationship, and hope that that's enough.",14Feb2017,12

78,"So, I live in a small state on the east coast, one of which was hit with a snow storm called ""Winter Storm Chris"" last Wednesday. 
I work third shift at a petroleum station, and have Wednesday's, Thursday's and Friday's off from work. Wednesday night the snow stopped around 5:45-6pm, and my street didn't get plowed until about 11:30pm the same night. All over the state there was highways that were one lane, and towns that also didn't have roads plowed yet even by midday on Thursday. Around 10:05am I get a phone call from my boss ""Mrs. Prissy just called out, (She uses 'unique' nicknames for people when something inconveniences her.) and I was wondering if I had (for name sake and anonymity let's say Gerald.) Gerald come in and work second shift today, I want to have you come in and work third tonight."" 
""I'm sorry boss, I can't. All over my town has roads that are still covered in a foot and a half of snow, and main roads that are only one lane. I cannot come in."" 
""Well I'm not going to stay here until FUCKING 10 o'clock again tonight, they can FUCKING figure something out for themselves tonight then."" And I told her I was going to hang up the phone, and she said ""bye."" And maybe possibly thinking she pushed end call on her personal cellphone, sat the phone down and proceeded to yell and get pissy with whoever was in the office with her for what I can only imagine was badmouthing me for not coming in on my day off when road hazards prevented me from doing so, safely. I don't make enough to buy a vehicle, my truck is a rear wheeled drive, and doesn't handle in bad weather. So Thursday and Friday ended and finally on Saturday night I went in to work. Roads were fine during the trip in, so all was kosher. Then Sunday morning around 6:30am, my relief came in to take over the store, and shortly after, the shift lead and her fiancé (and what do you know, her fiancé is my bosses son.) came in and were joking around together, and I had mentioned ""if my roads don't get plowed again tonight, I don't know if I'll be able to make it to work tonight, if that's the case, I will let you know."" To which her son replied ""oh you mean like Thursday when we called you (he doesn't work at this store. He works at a store nearby where the district manager is his aunt, my bosses sister. A lot of family and conflict of interest, yes?) and you said the roads weren't plowed? But according to the town, all roads were plowed, and school was in session."" To which I said nothing, because I was so dumbfounded that they called my towns public works department to see if I was telling the truth or not, about the reason I gave for not coming in to work, on my day off. 

My question is, how should I handle this information, and if I should take it to the HR department and claim harassment for said actions? I'm being harassed for not coming in to work on my day off, when conditions prevented me from doing so. Both of my parents are CDL drivers (I live with them), and they've had the licenses for over 25 years, and both told me ""I don't want you going anywhere today, the roads are horrendous, they aren't properly plowed if at all."" I shouldn't be coming to work and be treated the way I'm being treated. It's not right, by any means. 
Also, according to company policy, if a shift cannot be covered, the person who must cover it is the shift lead. If the shift lead cannot cover it, then the assistant manager must cover. Again, if the assistant manager cannot cover, the manager who is on salary pay, must cover the shift. My shift lead never covers any shift but first ""because I get all the creepy people if I work second or third shift"" (quote directly from her mouth.) My assistant manager does the best she can to cover when able (she also lives about as far from my store as I do, which is about 18-20 miles.) my manager, shift lead, and all other employees other than the assistant manager live within 5 miles of this store, so there is usually coverage when the conditions aren't horrendous like they were. 

Please, pm me or comment with any advice you may have on how I should handle this (other than quitting. I'm not quitting a third job due to harassment, it's not happening.) it would really help me out. 

Edit (adding information.) ;;;
I never call out, ever. Never have in the 7 months I've been working at this job, not once have I called out. I make sure someone can cover my shift (usually just trade days with the other third shifter) so there is never an inconvenience. I could understand calling the town if I was a repeat call out, if it was my day to be working, but not on my day off.

79,"So I need some advice. However before I can ask it you need to know the circumstances that led up to this. I changed some details to stay anonymous. This is long....very long.

Four years ago I met Henry on the train. 
The train was full so he sat with me. We exchanged the usual pleasantries. I eventually asked him what he was doing for day. He told me he was going to the aquarium.  

""Oh wow nice I love the Aquarium!""

""Yes as do I. I met my wife Johanna there over 60 years ago.""

""Wow you've been married awhile!""

""Yes we were in our twenties when we first met. I was there with my sister, Estelle, and her baby boy. Johanna was there with some girlfriends. It happened to be her birthday.""

I then asked how they met. 

""Well it is quite a funny story. Dock, my sister's child was only just a toddler. Estelle was in the women's room and I was waiting outside with Dock when he started yanking at my hand saying he needed to go. He was too young to go by himself so I went to go along with him to the men's room but he would not have it. He would only go with his mother. At this point he was started to cause quite a ruckus so I did what I had to. I slowly opened the women's room door, eyes closed and called for Estelle. She luckily was just about to walk about so she quickly grabbed Dock. I went to turn around and before I could I felt a tap on my shoulders.""

'Excuse me Sir...but I believe you are not a woman.'

""It was Johanna. Boy I remember it like it was yesterday. Her cute little smirk, eyebrows up. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I was worried she was offended so I quickly apologized and tried to explain myself. Luckily she had seen the whole thing with Dock and Estelle and was just joshin with me.""

""After that we went out separate ways until about an hour later we met up again while in the same exhibit. This is when we started to talk. Our respective parties began to walk in the same direction so we were able to chat even longer. Well long story short I married her 6 months later. She was my best friend.""

When he said ""was"" I knew she had passed. I expressed my condolences and he told me she had passed 7 months ago.

""So that is why you are going to the aquarium today? For the memory of your wife?""

""Not exactly. You remember how I told you we met at the aquarium on her birthday? Well from then on every year on her birthday we went to the aquarium. I haven't gone to the aquarium alone in 64 years. But today is her birthday...so I hopped on the train.""

""Oh kid I don't know if I can make it. I want to for her but I haven't gone alone in so long. I don't know if I can go through with it.""

I thought he was going to cry at that point. I didn't know how to help him and I knew saying sorry would do nothing.

""Well Henry I was actually planning on going to the aquarium today to take pictures. If you wouldn't mind I would love to have a little company.""

He enthusiastically accepted. He said he'd love to.

So we went to the aquarium together. He showed me all the spots he went with his wife. He showed me where they first met, where he proposed. It was actually quite a wonderful day. As the day was coming to an end I could tell he didn't want it to. I don't think he wanted to leave the aquarium itself. But we had to eventually. As we were walking back to the train I said to him

""Henry I had a wonderful time today. Next year on Johannas birthday I will be here, sitting over there at the same time we came today. If you end up being alone then it's a date. If not, just say hello!""

We went our separate ways. He took the train home and I ended up meeting up with a friend. I honestly assumed he would forget. I was just trying to end the day as positively as possible for him. I didn't even think about it much until the following year my mom said to me hey don't you have to meet that older gentleman tomorrow? I had completely forgotten. It was Johannas birthday. Turns out my mom wrote it down after I had told what had happened the year before (what would the world do without Moms) I assumed he wouldn't be there but I went anyway. 

He was there.

And he would be there for the next 4 years. 

This year however, he was not there. I waited for about an hour when a woman, probably in her 50s approached me.

""Excuse me are you OP?""

Yes I am. 

""Hi I am Henry's daughter  Lucy.""

I knew who she was because Henry had told me all about his children and grandchildren and great grandchildren. He didn't have a smart phone so I never saw any pictures. But her name I instantly recognized.

""Oh Lucy yes hi""

She then proceeded to say she needed to talk to me and we went to a little cafe nearby.

""You may be wondering how I even know who you are and where to find you. Four years ago Henry came home happy. As you know my mother had passed away only 7 months before. He told us all about you and your time together and all about your date for the next year. When moms birthday came again we offered to go with him just in case you weren't there. He wouldn't have it. He knew you would be. So he went and you were there.  He would come home and the entire family would get together for dinner for my moms birthday and he was always in such a good mood. This is because of you. I can't imagine what that day would have been like for him had he not met you.""

""Op I am so sorry Henry passed away a few months ago. He knew it was coming as he had been sick. Before he passed he made sure that one of us would contact you. He told us you always wear a baseball cap and that you would have big nice camera so it was easy to find you today.""

I was and am still heartbroken. I did not know Henry that well. I only had seen him 4 times in my life. But he made an impact like no other. He was a good man.

Now after that novel comes to the reason why I am here. Advice.

After Lucy and I spoke she actually asked me for my phone number. I was numb at the time and so sad about Henry that I didn't think to ask why when I gave it to her.

A few days ago she called me. She asked if I would please come to such and such address because there was a matter that needed to be dealt with.

I got there and I saw Lucy as well as 3 other people who I assumed were Henry's other children. Lucy introduced me to them and told me to sit down with them. We were all sitting when another man walked in.

It was Henry's lawyer. Apparently Henry was quite wealthy. Quite...quite wealthy.  I never knew this because Henry and I never talked about that kind of stuff. I didn't care at all and was still confused as to why I was there in the first place. Then they dropped the bomb.

Henry left me some money in his will. After our third ""date"" he apparently went to his lawyer and changed his will. At this point I was so shocked I couldn't speak. Along with the money there was also a letter in the will to be given to be at the time of Henry's death. 

His letter was one of the most beautiful and meaningful things I have ever received. 

 This is where I need the advice. Henry was apparently even richer than I thought. He left me 5 million dollars.

Lucy and his other children do not plan on contesting the will because they think I deserve it and because one of them was a witness to the will addition. Also because 5 million is not a huge amount for them like it is for me.

Anyways I need advice on what to do....I am 21 years old going to school living at home. I am from a middle class family. This kind of money is unfathomable. 50 grand would have been unfathomable....

I haven't even spoken to my parents yet since they are out of town. They will be home in a few days. 

I don't have the money yet because apparently this stuff can take awhile. Lucy said it shouldn't be too long though.

What do I do when I receive it? Are there legal things I need to do? Also should I invest it? 

Also how do I even begin to tell my family? I mean just my immediate family (mom dad  2 siblings) also both my siblings are married. Do I have to tell their spouses? 

Also I am worried that if it gets out too much people will start heckling me like they do when you win the lottery....

There are some second/third cousins of mine who are terrible people who I know 100% if they found out about the money they would ask, demand, then probably sue me. I don't want them to know. But does that make me a bad person?

How do I find a trustworthy banker? How do I trust anyone?? 

So I need advice on the technical aspect of this all but I also need advice on the emotional.... I want to really do good with this money. I can absolutely use it for school and other bills and helping my family but even after that I will still have an absurd amount of money. I want to do something good with it.

I want to do this right for him. I want this money to be more than just money. I don't plan on buying crazy cars or houses or anything like that. I want to be smart about it. This money will change my life and my families life and maybe even some people less fortunate. But I also want it to last. I want this money to turn into something that my eventual children will benefit from. 

Any advice is appreciated. I am home alone dumbfounded that my ""dates"" with this cute little old man turned into this. ",14Feb2017,8
80,"My mother passed away a few months ago, and I've acquired her art along with other items. Of the pieces split between my blood siblings I've received an original oil based painting that was previously purchased by my step-father. My two other siblings chose to take certain pieces that meant a lot to them and I ended up with this one. Today my step sibling contacted me stating that she wants the painting. I currently have it hanging up and really enjoy having it in my room. My mother/step-father had the painting while they were together for 20+ years and there is sentimental value to me as well. I don't have a particularly good relationship with my step sibling. She offered to buy it from me, but it's not about money.

81,"I'm the jealous type. My girlfriend is the flirtatious type. We've heard this all before. I ruminate really badly, and everything that happens becomes a clue in this mystery that I'm trying to solve as to whether she's cheating on me. I'm aware that it's a thing I'm doing to myself, but I think I'm psychologically attached to the torture I bring myself. 

I've recently tried meditation, as I feel that I can learn to better maintain myself that way, though I think I haven't been able to build any mental resilience to my thought patterns because ""automatic negative thoughts"" keep ""hijacking"" my amygdala to make me panic constantly, then put me into a mopey depressive state for hours and sometimes days. 

I've been to therapy before about this very issue and I've learned how to identify thoughts and feelings, as well as other cognitive-behavioral things that I put into practice everyday, and some of the practices really do help.

The problem, however, remains. Yes, I could move on from the relationship I'm in (we just moved across the country together, smart move), but I know I'm bound to repeat this forever and ever if I just bail out now. 

The thing that's happening is that my values are being violated, but I want to be able to consciously shift my personal values because I don't necessarily agree with the way that I've been imprinted. 

I want to not care about this, I want to not get depressed thinking about it, I want to not be the jealous type, and I want to be able to communicate my thoughts when I have them. I'm such a mess and this is a constant problem in my life. What should my next step be?",14Feb2017,1
82,"Hi all. I'm using a throwaway because I'm embarrassed about the circumstances of my life that I'm about to reveal. This is really, **really** long, so I apologize in advance.


I don't want to go too far info it, but I'm fucked. Me, my brother and a roommate are sharing an apartment right now, it won't be much longer because we've had major life events happen recently and haven't been able to pay rent. Me and the roommate work (part time each) my brother hasn't for a long time due to depression.


So we have been surviving (barely) by selling off all our things/some money from work. The circumstances as they are have killed my motivation and left me very depressed, so I haven't been looking much for a second job, plus my ID is expired, and I haven't been able to renew it and I'm about to mention why.


My brother has been coping with his depression with drugs, the last year has robbed me of all my joy, that coupled with me having IBS (Undiagnosed) I use too. Granted, I don't use nearly as much, and I try to use it more in a therapeutic manner than to get high/take a chemical vacation. I don't personally believe drugs = bad, if you can remain functional then more power to you.


That's the issue though, he makes it a priority, to such a degree that nothing else matters. Could have paid our internet/tv bill - nope, need drugs, pay electric, nope, drugs, our car insurance, nope, drugs. Thankfully, he gets hungry too so we get some food.


He got angry with me when I was wary of giving him my debit card, insulted and told me not to doubt him, but he keeps fucking up. He's lost hundreds of dollars because he just lets the people walk off with the money, so not only do we now have all these bills, but he doesn't get his drugs so he's next to useless!


I have been doing my best to get myself into a better mentality, applying for food stamps, (kinda) looking for a job. I know I screwed up, but fuck, I was hurting physically every day and had something that helped, but I didn't want it at the cost of everything else.


I've had to sell the few things that meant something to me, like my late mothers wedding bands from her grandmother, or just cool things like my first tablet I won, soundbar that was a birthday gift, Bluetooth keyboard etc, but every chance he gets, he tells me how I'm fucking up, how I don't do anything, how this or that. He insists he does everything.


I mean, he lives like a fucking pig, the second I clean up after him and he needs something, he wrecks the whole room then gets on me for not cleaning it up. He's become so overbearing, that even though I love him, I'm starting to hate him because he's acting like our father did.


Granted, he's had to sell many more of his possessions,but I never asked him to, it was his choice, yet he keeps insisting that I'm purposely holding out on him, and that if he had to sell all his things, so do I. I mean, I have a small tax refund this year, and He's made sure that half of it is gone because we had to pawn things we want back, including my computer that, without it, I have literally nothing to do recreationally, and makes my job more difficult, but yeah, I don't do anything. /s


I try to talk to him, but he refuses to listen, just insinuates I don't like being told anything, that he has to stand over me to make sure I do things, and basically I have to help him to make sure he doesn't screw up (when he screws up, it's partly my fault for not warning him or saying anything)


I mean, I'll get a thank you here and there, but he doesn't truly appreciate what I do, that I'm trying to fight my own demons and keep things together, and that I'm doing all I can. I was/am trying to meet up with a stranger on craigslist who had a foot fetish just to help bring in money. :( plus I, you know, work... When he feels like driving me (always bitches about it, but won't let me save money so I can ride a bus...)


Imo, he puts more than half of the day to day tasks on me, why? Because he resents me bc I don't have a license yet, so He's punishing me. 


I'm fed up, I'm hurting emotionally, mentally and physically half the time, I love my brother dearly, he's all I have left, and I hate myself for not appreciating him more, but I don't know what to do. I want to fix my problems, I want another job, I want a man, I want a life so badly. I'm so lonely

I know I have a part in this too, I don't want to omit anything, but I'd appreciate not being chastised, believe me, I know I fucked up, but I'm in an environment that doesn't allow me to fix it, either. I can't live like this anymore. I'm pretty much ready to sell out my virtue (not literally) like, see about meeting a lonely man who could help me out of this, because I can't do this alone. I just want some advice/ideas about well, anything. If you made it this far, congratulations, and thank you, I hope your life is going better than mine.


TL;DR  brother and sister fucked up their lives, sister wants to fix lives, brother hinders all progress and is moderately abusive.

91,"Can a robot get a hug?

I'm a 17 year old male with a lack of sexual motivation, and a surplus of romantic need.  As far as I can tell, I have no mental disorders beyond what is now considered standard-issue, the depression/anxiety package.  My seemingly contradictory feelings wear on me daily.  I find women attractive, and certainly more appealing than men, but never in *that* way.  I don't think this issue can be chalked-up to antidepressants or a lack of sexuality altogether.  

I clearly remember my 'awakening,' the nights spent in front of my computer learning the wonders that lay on the other side of the fence.  Over the course of a year, I thoroughly, *ahem*, tested my renovated equipment, and the tests yielded impressive results.  However, this quickly became boring, and I gradually backed off.  I went from daily sessions with visual aides, to a few times per month with only erotic text.  For this reason, I don't think induction into the NoFap cult would be an appropriate remedy for my problem.  Effects of desensitization would have worn off by this time, I should think.  Additionally, my lack of libido arose before I began anti-depressants, so blaming drugs would seem unproductive.  Quite simply, I appear incapable of finding anyone particularly attractive in mind or body.

It might appear that I should be happy not to deal with the urges experienced by others my age, however, I can't seem to get rid of the idea of romance.  I feel physically and emotionally isolated.  I want someone I can share my feelings with, someone with whom I can converse without limitation.  I want to hug that person when they feel down, and I want her to treat me the same way.  If this makes any sense, I want to share my individuality.  My ideal relationship would be one in which the two of us were practically voices in each others' minds.  Perhaps, with technology, we could one day achieve this literally.  I quite enjoy the Ancient Greek interpretation of the 'soul mate.'  I find that the way I evaluate physical attractiveness in those of the opposite gender is based on whether I, myself, would enjoy looking in the mirror through their eyes.  It's almost as if I'm thinking *oh, yeah, I could do a lot with that look*.  For this reason, I find women who would be traditionally considered 'tomboyish' in appearance (less exaggerated curves, shorter hair, smaller frame, avoiding dresses, etc.) to be most attractive.  Still, despite preferring these girls, I've never met anyone I would consider a romantic interest.  I can't even create a fantasy partner in my mind that I would consider 'the ideal girlfriend.'

I've never been on a date, much less had a girlfriend, because I feel it would be unfair to do so when I have no special feelings towards the woman in question.  I do have female friends, possibly more of them than male friends (I've never counted).  I'm relatively thin, shower often, dress well, and can make girls laugh easily, so I feel that I can fulfill the basic standards of male attractiveness, so I believe that I would have no difficulty in finding a willing partner, if I were to go to the effort.  The problem is that I've never been inspired to go to the effort.

At the end of the day, what I'm left with is a bunch of desires and no object for them, and so they just stew around in my head.  They constantly remind me of how lonely I am.  Water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink.  My current plan is just to deal with these feelings, and stay alone until I do run into someone.  Is waiting my only option?",14Feb2017,2

95,"Hey guys,

One of my really close friends recently admitted to me that she self-harms sometimes. She used a lighter to burn her arms because it made her feel in control when she felt like she wasn't. 

Cutting a lot of the story out, let's jump to last night. She comes into my room (we're flatmates) and asks if she can stay here for a bit because she feels like she's going to hurt herself if she's on her own. Of course I agree and we stay up and talk for a bit. I tell her to stay in my room overnight and we both go to bed. Then about 30 mins later she wakes me up in an absolute state. She'd brought a razor to my room and was cutting herself. I take away the razor from her and sit with her for a few hours, well into the morning. 

At one point she's there shaking and crying repeating over and over ""I can't stop doing it..."" It absolutely broke my heart to see her like this. 

So what can I do? I've made it clear to her that she can come and speak to me whenever she wants. I've been non-judgemental and tried to talk about it in a matter-of-fact way with her. I'm happy to stay up with her overnight and comfort her if it's going to stop her from hurting herself. 

But I'm not a professional. I'm not equipped to deal with this and I don't know what the best course of action is. Obviously she needs professional help but when she's okay in the light of day she doesn't want to even think about it, never mind talk to a professional. I've offered to go with her to see someone but that didn't help either. I'm so scared for her and I'm completely at a loss for what to do. I just feel like at this point I'm helping her temporarily when it gets bad but not doing anything about the underlying problem.

In the past year or so she's gone from talking to me at least once a week or every other week to not speaking to me at all unless I call or text her first and most of the time she doesn't respond at all...

At first I understood since we're both adults and life tends to get busy yet I started to realize things over a period of time. She doesn't have a job and now she's taken a break from school. All of her time tends to be dedicated to what it's been dedicated to since high school. Staying in her room on her computer or playing video games. Which I definitely don't judge her on the video game part or any of it in general since I get carried away when I game myself. 

Anyhow, when we do finally hang out I'm always the one to propose it and when I come over we have little to no interaction with each other besides showing each other memes or videos. 

I always have to bring my computer or 3ds to keep myself busy due to the lack of interaction since she is always on her computer talking to her other friends when I'm over. 

She will put on some youtube videos and at times she will let me choose one but not usually. 

I'll offer to buy food whenever I have even the slightest amount of funds since she doesn't eat often due to a lack of money. I worry about her a lot of the time because of it and I'm happy to do it but I also get a little iffy on buying her food now since she tends to pick the more expensive options everytime. And being a college student myself doesn't leave you with all of the money in the world.

For years we wrote stories together and they were wonderful and fun until we stopped altogether. I've attempted to see if she's interested in renewing any of them but has yet to answer me. 

The thing that confuses me the most is how she constantly talks to her other friends on a daily basis yet somehow I'm always left out of that equation and over time I've began to feel resentment towards her. 

Now that I think about it she really doesn't hardly talk about anything with me unless it has to do with memes or video games and even that is light conversation. She has claimed me to be her best friend yet she has barely opened up to me at all and when she has and I'm there for her she shuts herself back up. When she talks to her other friends she tells them anything and everything with no problems and it honestly makes me feel like I'm not worthy of being her friend. 

What did I do wrong? Should I talk to her again about it? I tried talking about it once and she apologized to me and said she would try to put more effort into our friendship though she hasn't. 

What should I do in this situation? I'm so frustrated and confused and I don't want to give up but it's so hard when it feels like she just doesn't give a fuck about me anymore you know?..

MIDDLE (53 out of 100) in OPENNESS
            
 VERY LOW (5 out of 100) in CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

 LOW (12 out of 100) in AGREEABLENESS
            
 VERY HIGH (99 out of 100) in NEUROTICISM

I dont want to box myself into these models and use them as excuses or anything like that. But I am a deeply unhappy person, I see nothing in my future, I abuse drugs and have huge anxiety about almost everything. 

Am I just going to struggle like I am my whole life ?

120,"Another inevitably-really-long post where I'm not gonna be able to be sure where to start. Kinda feeling wound up at the moment,

Basically I've had a problem for quite a while now where I sorta have issues with personal space and touching and that... I don't molest people, or stuff like that. Just sorta have a bunch of people who maybe-they're-my-friends-or-maybe-I-don't-know-what-friends-are, and I guess I just sorta... compulsively hug them. Sorta not compulsively. It's more like I think, ""now would be a good time to hug them"", and I am almost always proven wrong.

So it's been going on for a while now that I hug someone, for whatever reason, and get told with varying levels of harshness that I should not have done that. I just never really see the part where people are uncomfortable, and it seems even when someone outright tells me they weren't comfortable and aren't comfortable with hugs in general, I still find myself doing it anyway.

It just happens again and again. Today..... it just got worse. I dunno if the backstory here is important, but it helps me write out my thoughts, so I'm on Discord for a local video game community, as I usually am, someone (the head organizer/lead moderator/etc) mentioned their lunch break at work was for an hour starting at 2pm, and if anyone wanted to join them in the city. So I happened to have a doctor's appointment, so I'm like ""sure alright I can do that"".... my psychologist has said to me that I needed to socialize in ordinary situations with people more. This seemed like the perfect opportunity. Nothing was said that indicated I shouldn't have been coming. As far as I could tell, I was invited, even though I did say that I wouldn't actually be staying for lunch due to the timing of things, but just to say hello to people. Including someone coming down from another state that I hadn't met before....

So I show up there a bit early (because I have nothing else to do while I wait for my appointment), other people start arriving, everything seems to be going fine. I'm out of my element, really, but I was... well, I guess I was enjoying myself? I definitely wasn't used to social interaction and I'm still not. But this was a decent experience. The guy arrived, the new person arrived, we're standing around talking to people, eventually I leave for my doctor's appointment, and they go to get lunch in the meantime.

Everything is fine so far... right?

After I return from my appointment, I go back to the restaurant to see if they're still hanging around (I'm not in a rush to go anywhere in particular myself, so I figured might as well), they're still there other than the organizer guy who had to go back to work, I go past their table and receive what I figured was a signal to tell me to sit down, I do that, ask how it was and would they recommend it, it was apparently nice, they ask me how my appointment went, I tell them I'm doing alright other than mild anemia, it's all good. If they didn't want me to be there, they wouldn't have gone out of their way to make conversation with me, right? The whole time I was making sure I wasn't stepping over some random social boundary like I always do, I was trying to figure out the best way to make eye contact so nobody thinks I'm staring at her. I was kinda sitting weirdly as a result, because I wanted to listen to people so I could particpate in the conversation when necessary, but if I leaned back I couldn't do that because I wouldn't be able to hear them or focus on them. Other than that, it seemed like I was doing everything fine.

And it's when I leave that I make one of the biggest mistakes I've made in my life. I was saying goodbye to this girl who's only going to be down here in this region for this day or something, and... I hugged her.

I guess it was just a normal thing to do? Or it seemed like it? But it wasn't. She walks off and the rest of the group just looks at me and says ""now that was exactly the thing you shouldn't have done"", and I'm just like.... eh? She hugged me back. I didn't quite get it, but I just thought nothing of it for the time being, everyone went on their separate ways, I misinterpreted a stationary hand being used to wave as a request for hi-five, luckily, that was okay.

When I got home and back on Discord it was apparent that things were not okay. Basically word got out to the organizer guy that I hugged people without asking, which given the amount of times he's had to tell me off for doing, he wasn't happy about. And he _really_ wasn't happy this time around. I was, to quote, on ""thin fucking ice"".

All I can say was... I still have no idea why I'm like this. But I just said it's instinct, which gets the reply of ""your instincts are creepy and predatory"". Also, I was apparently standing too close to her when we were standing outside before they went into the restaurant? I had no idea, but now I'm being accused of doing that deliberately because she's female. Or rather, I'm being told to ""make a fucking effort to not stand close to every girl you see"". And I'm feeling on the defensive at this point, so I'm interpreting this with a kinda transhpobic/homophobic ""get the fuck away from cis women you fucking freak"" vibe... I guess I'm overreacting maybe, but I had no fucking clue I was standing too close. I was just standing in a place where I could make conversation optimally. I don't deliberately stand next to women just to be creepy and predatory or whatever, nor do I think it's appropriate to treat them differently in social situations by avoiding standing near them just because. I'm normally the only woman around in our group (even if sometimes I feel they don't see me as one), and I sure as hell wouldn't be comfortable with people deliberately standing away from me.

But it doesn't matter. Every bit of remorse I try to show, every defense I try to make, every effort I make to actually try and defuse the situation, I'm being accused by at least 3 people (2 of who weren't even there) of deliberately derailing the conversation to get out of it scott-free. But that's not what I'm doing at all. That's simply not what I do.

It's a huge clusterfuck from this point onwards and I don't know what detail I should include here, especially as it's hard for me to scroll back up through a difficult conversation where neither person was really thinking rationally.

I've sent her an apology via DM, but she hasn't replied to it. That's fine I guess, I don't know if apologies are supposed to have responses, and even if she just doesn't accept my apology, I guess all I can do is accept the lack of acceptance, and that's the end of my contact with her. I don't see what else I can do.

But anyway, the main problem is, especially as people kept bringing it up, is that I just seem to keep hugging people when told not to. And I... just plain don't know why.

Is there something wrong with me? Did something happen to me? I mean sure you could say it's a conscious choice, but then why would I do it when I know it's wrong and I know people would be massively uncomfortable and I **don't** want to have that happen? Even though it seems nobody believes me on that last part.

But then what is it? Normal people don't just hug people like this, or else nobody would ever be comfortable with anyone ever, since that's apparently what happens. And I just... I dunno. I'm getting really tired and should have gone to bed 2 hours ago but haven't, and I forgot what I was trying to say.

But something must be done. I have to stop this. Quite literally I will get banned from this community if I fuck up one more thing. That's the exact warning I was given. There's a tournament on tomorrow and I don't even know if I should go because I won't be able to handle the organizer if he's still pissed off at me. Even if he doesn't, all I can do is just socially withdraw and not initiate contact of any kind unless someone approaches me. It's not really good to be anti-social like that I'm sure, but it's the safest option. As pathetic as it sounds I really can't afford to lose this community. It's the only hobby I have, and the only avenue for a social life I'll have.

How can I prove to myself that I'll be fine and not hug anyone tomorrow (since I've learned that my judgements on whether it's appropriate to hug someone or not can't be trusted, I'm just going to avoid it entirely) if I don't even know why I do it?

I probably haven't given enough detail here but I'm getting really tired. My heart is racing and has been for the last 5 hours or so. I didn't take my medication until about 12:45am when I'm normally supposed to take it at 10pm or so.

Ironically enough, I need a hug... though, nobody's going to give me one. I know that. But heck, I've needed a hug for a while because everything else in life is just shit for me right now.",14Feb2017,5
123,"When I first got to college, my major was biology. I wanted to get my undergrad and then go to vet school. Well, I realized a few things really fast. One, I'm not that great of a student. I like to balance studies and social life, so getting As isn't probable. Two, I don't know why, but I actually cannot do math. I never learned my times tables, how to do long division, and teachers just kept passing me along. I barely passed my first math class. This is also a problem I have with chemistry, because of the heavy equations and math. My GPA isn't so great right now (rough freshman year, I get better grades now) and I was wanting to switch into Nutrition. Well, Nutrition has a lot of chemistry. I'm currently taking the easiest chemistry I can, and I still failed the first exam (partially my fault for not studying, but I did fine on the homeworks with only a little help). So, now I want to switch into Developmental and Family sciences with a concentration in early childhood. I looked at the plan of study, no science or math, and I work at a childcare and LOVE it. My mom is also an early childhood director. Is switching a good idea, or am I just running from my problems?",14Feb2017,1
124,"I'll try to keep a complicated situation short...

2 years ago I moved to the US to get married, and realized that there were little to no job opportunities in my field (accessory design) where I live. I'm 27yrs old now, and have no children which is somewhat relevant (but want to by 34-ish). After struggling through side jobs and minimum wage service work for a year and a half, I decided to cut my losses and try what I had always wanted to do, but never really thought was possible- illustration.  I put a portfolio together and managed to land a decently paid internship at an awesome agency and have now been there for 4 months. I love it, and can see myself improving consistently, but I have very little stability- I'm still on a 1099 and although they keep dropping hints about making me more permanent, nothing ever materializes.  However, I feel at this point my portfolio is strong enough that if they dropped me I could get by on freelance work until another similar job came along.

Here's the spanner in the works: At the same time as I got this internship, I landed a long term (approx 6 months) part time freelance gig in my original field of accessory design. It's with a fantastic company &amp; lovely people, but I'm not really emotionally invested in the product and the work, quite frankly, is a little dull. They have just offered me a full time position in the design department. I am not that thrilled about going back to accessory design, but the paycheck will be at least twice what I'm earning now with full benefits.

Part of me doesn't want to sell myself out when I'm finally on a path (and an upward trajectory) I feel genuinely passionate about...part of me thinks I'd be a fucking idiot to turn down that amount of money when I'm still quite young and have a wife who is about to go to med school.

130,"So I love my fiance. I mean I really do. He's the kindest, most supportive and loving person I have ever met. We have been together about 4 years. I'm a little bit of a late bloomer sexually. He was my first and only. So sex was pretty exciting at first, but I'm an adventurous person. I like to try things even if it's only once. He really hasn't progressed past what we've been doing for 4 years.

Now, this might be mostly my fault. I do try to initiate new things but I am often embarrassed. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings because for the most part I don't feel like I deserve to be heard. I know that's not healthy. I'm working on it. There's also the fact that I feel like I'm putting his performance down if I tell him I'm not having a good time. He has issues with talking about his feelings similar to mine. I don't want to make him less confident. 

So that's my question. How do I communicate these feelings without making my awesome fiance feel bad about our sex life or his performance?",14Feb2017,6
133,"I need a change. Right now I live in the downstairs of my mom's split level home. I've lived in this town my entire life, out of comfort and necessity--not due to any work requirements though. 

My husband and I were married in November. He is going through the process of gaining citizenship in the US, so he currently cannot work (but should be able to soon). The financial burden for literally everything has been on me. But I feel bad for him. We're having a big disconnect. He basically has nothing to do. He sits at home while I work and then when I get home, he sees it as a time for us to go out and do stuff since he's been cooped up all day, but I see it  as my one time of the day to relax and unwind. I can tell it's causing friction between us. 

Now, another big issue with living at home is my mom's boyfriend. He is legitimately the worst human I have ever met. I've had to call the cops due to their fighting at least 5 times in the last 3-4 months. He breaks things. Throws things. Yells. And drinks incessantly. I'm convinced at this point that my mom will not break up with him. They broke up back in 2008 and then just got back together last year, even though he's just as bad now as he was then. They also had a brief split a few months ago, during which time my husband felt free to roam about the house. He was cooking, socializing with my mom, cleaning up, doing laundry, etc. But with her boyfriend around he feels too uncomfortable to do anything and ends up living in our small one room and living room. He also doesn't want to cook with the boyfriend here, and I **can't** cook so we end up spending a ton of money on food. 

Additionally, there is friction with my mother. She doesn't necessarily ask for ""rent"", but she'll sporadically hit me up for money (typically $300-$400) or ask me to randomly pay a bill before a service is turned off. This is stressful to me because I'm not able to anticipate these payments to her in advance and when I can't give her what she wants she throws a full fit. Her boyfriend then (loudly) yells at her for me free loading. 

Then my good friend's cousins (they are also married) approached me last week with a very appealing opportunity. They live in a 1 bedroom apartment now and are considering moving to a 2-bedroom. It would only cost us $600 per month **and** they're willing to pay for our first month because of my husband's work situation. 

**The Pros:**

- Freedom from my mom and her boyfriend

- Being able to foresee and plan for payments

- A comfortable living space where my husband can feel like his day-to-day life has some value and where I don't feel pressured to provide fun for him when I get done work

- Despite it being **much** further from my job, me and one of the guys have the same work schedule and work close to one another so we can carpool.

**The Cons:**

- My sister. She is pretty much hates my mom lately (because of her taking the boyfriend back) and hasn't actually spent much time home. Instead she's stayed at her dad's house. But when she is home, her room is next to their's and I feel so bad for her when they fight. She's only 17 and I'd hate for her to feel like she has no ally or safe space in the house.

- The money. Despite the payment plan being appealing, it would still be more per month than I pay now. Being able to plan for payments will help, and having a kitchen so my husband can cook will help even more--since we won't spend so much money on food. But I'm just concerned that I'll sign up for this and then end up dropping the ball.

- My cat. This is, silly enough, the biggest drawback to me. I love my cat more than anything. And I **hate** that she goes outside. When I'm home, I don't let her out at all. She had 2 brothers that were hit by cars right across the street. Every morning I wake up to her sitting on the window meowing to get in. So she gets out either late at night when people come home from work or early in the morning when my sister leaves for school. I hate the thought of her being outside meowing for someone to let her in and noone getting her. And also without me being there, she'll be outside much more which puts her at danger much more often and it just really tears me up. But at the same time, she's only 7. With a cat's life expectancy of 12 years I can't reasonably spend another 5+ years at my mom's house. The guys we're moving with already have 2 cats and I feel like they would accept me bringing mine **but** my cat is very territorial. And if she gets out at our new place, she'd be lost and possibly not come back. I also don't know if I'd want to take her from my mom's because my sister does love her too (but not as much as me). 

So that's where I'm at. I'm just completely not sure what to do.",14Feb2017,1

135,"Hi reddit, I am 22yo from england and currently live with my mum, I have been having troubles though. 

All started 2 years ago, I was really I'll with flu and labrynthitis, the labrynthitis taking nearly 2 months to diagnose. After getting over the initial symptoms all seemed well enough until I was getting dizzy spells randomly, I assumed lingering effects from the labrynthitis. Anyway these were not every day, tho that didn't last long, over time it has become nearly every time I have left my house and within seconds of leaving. I get disoriented, feel like I no spacial awareness and like I need to get home.  The reason i am leaning towards anxiety is because i have been to the doctors, i have been told i have postural low blood pressure, a slightly elevated pulse... I have had blood tests with them coming back healthy and even tested for addisons. The only things is, when i am in a good mood and drunk, well i can be out for hours with no worries clubbing and whatnot. No i do not drink to cope, last time i went out the feeling hit me before even managed 3 drinks. This has caused problems seeing as I need to work to pay for living as my mother alone can not pay for everything and we have nearly been evicted a couple times. I am at the point where I literally can't leave cause I just know I am going to collapse.

I'm not taking a lot of classes this semester either, as I will be going on an exchange to Japan in a couple months.

So I have known my boyfriend for about 9 years- we got engaged a year ago in Feb and are getting married in June. My fiance's friend and groomsman (we will call him Z) met a much younger girl at our engagement (it was public) and started dating her right away. 

Z told us that he was going to propose to his gf over x-mas and I asked him not to have his wedding before ours. He didn't really take me seriously and thought I was joking around... so that's my fault... I suppose...

Soon after he was engaged he announced that he was going to marry her 2 weeks before us. He even made a joke about how he ""beat"" us and how he ""won."" I didn't reply but I was secretly pretty pissed. 

Another friend was talking about setting his wedding date and I jokingly said- ""Yeah if you set your date early enough your friends won't schedule theirs right before yours! Oh wait..."" and Z got pissed. All of the people who heard it were like... wtf it's obviously a joke settle down, Z. (He doesn't really understand humor.)

But he was like- that's the only day we could pick and stop commenting on it or I will be offended. (The only times that it was commented on were mentioned above.)
This made me enraged. I know I should just not let it get to me - but it feels like they are taking away from our special day and honestly it makes me a little jealous that they will be getting married first. (I know, I know, it shouldn't.) 

It doesn't bother my fiance - and he is kind of sad that I am so pissed about it. I want to get over it- but I just can't!

152,"Okay, quick-and-dirty life story to this point:

I spent the first 21 or so years of my life as an arrogant asshole. Grew up with my mom in Kentucky. Had one girlfriend in high school I lost my virginity to, then moved to Oregon for college. Didn't date in college.

Spent about a year after that in a sexless relationship with a super-Christian girl I got along really well with, then moved back to Kentucky when we brke up. Spent a couple years working in shitty jobs or bumming off of friends/roommates. Hit bottom unemployed and living with my mother, unable to find work. Decided to go back to college and be serious.

First year back went great. GPA hovered around a 4.0, did a little undergrad research. Had a one-night stand at a party that summer (which was the first and last sex I'd had since the high school girlfriend.) The next day my dad got diagnosed with cancer.

Took care of my dad alongside classes; school kept going well. My dad died in the spring (his health dropped off so rapidly at the end I only actually missed a day of classes.)

Started applying to internships, lucked into a really good one to do alongside my last year of school. Took a quick trip to Istanbul before starting it. Shortly after I started, my mother moved out from Kentucky to live with me, since her health had gotten bad.

During my last year of college her health got a lot worse; she also got diagnosed with cancer, and died shortly afterwards. Managed to keep up with college and internship, graduated with a double major in math and CS, good grades, a little research experience, honor and glory in programming contests, great GRE scores. (Missed grad school apps for that year... they were due right around when my mom died.)

Finished my internship, went to Peru for three months because I could, applied ot grad schools while I was down there. Now I'm back in the states, and kind of spinning out.

All my friends from college have moved elsewhere. I'm not working (don't want to look for a job I'd just leave in a few months), and I don't really have anything occupying my time except reddit, video games and the gym. I've got about $150k to blow through before I need to earn more of sell/mortgage any property (own homes in Oregon and Kentucky. This one might be rentable, and I'm willing to sell if I need to. The one in Kentucky I'm more attached to, but it's to far out in the hills to really rent.) I do want to be pretty careful about money, just because I'll need it for grad school.  Obviously pretty bothered both by loneliness and my lack of sex life.

And a little about me as a person: I respond well to structure, obligations and challenges, but I'm not very self-motivated. If nothings prodding me I kinda just sit there. I can deal with really shitty circumstances without being bothered by them, but I have an ugly habit of not trying to improve things that are okay enough not to bug me. I'm very much an introvert, though trying not to be.

So, that being said: What would a healthy person do in my situation? Looking for something kind of concrete (""Do XYZ"", not ""Here is an analysis of your problems."")

158,"I was think along the lines of insurance, credit, rewards programs, just other things you  usually dont think about on a daily basis. 

Are there any sort of benefits programs I should sign up for to earn points/rewards or just because its really important/good to have? I have already opened two credit cards and been paying them off in full on time to build credit.

Other than car insurance, should I have any sort of additional type of insurance as well? My house flooded a lot growing up and we didnt have flood insurance so you never know when shit can hit the fan.

I can imagine I am going to have my own health insurance and what not.

I guess I am looking for any sort of advice prior to fully entering adulthood.

160,"Well it all started some time ago I guess but I was in denial for a long time.  I have been with my husband for 6 years, we have been married almost 2. Around a year ago we moved into a duplex. The couple next door didn't talk much to us and the guy was hardly ever home due to his job. I had a feeling my husband was cheating but  I wasn't sure if it was her or someone else. It was just little things at first. He stopped sleeping in bed with me and started sleeping on the couch, even when I would ask. Started noticing the back door was always unlocked. Started saying he was working through lunch more and more. One day I am running late for work, who do I see flying around the corner  but my husband? Well this was strange because he always calls or at least tells me he's about to take lunch. I hadn't heard a peep. My 5 year old (at the time) son tells me that my husband left him in the tub in the evening and left the apartment. I confirmed this another time when I called, asked where my son was and my hubby said he was in the tub. I said hey put him on the phone (speaker phone) for just a sec I want to say hi. Well my husband acted very annoyed and I could hear him basically closing several  doors and opening them, which should have only been one door the bathroom door. Another time his truck was outside, but he was nowhere to be found in the yard or in the apartment. He started acting colder to me.He hardly wanted sex. He would pick loud fights in my sons room which is the only room you can hear the other apartment and vice versa.  I had a feeling about what was going on but no solid proof.  These incidences were all very spread apart not in a close time frame and he always had an excuse for everything.He is such a convincing liar. I give him the benefit of the doubt.
   Fast forward a couple months. We buy a house together. We are moving in. A week later I go on a business trip- Right before I leave We pass by the old apartment. Her fiance is home. My husband's face goes white. He pouts the whole night. Obviously I regret setting up a business trip but its too late at this point. About 2 weeks after my trip he's acting strange. Rude AF toward me- doesn't talk to me, is distant, doesn't come in the room to watch tv with me at night like always. He's in the living room phone in hand 24/7.  Not talking to me. I can't ignore my intuition anymore. I go on his google timeline in location history.  It appears my husband has been going over to our old apartment every night after I go to  bed and staying for about an hour. I immediately confront him (yeah I wish I would have played it cool, but I was so in love with him still at this point.) He throws me on the ground, spits in my face, tells me he hates me. I was shocked I really thought he loved me. This is when I start remembering all the small stuff and piecing everything together. I'm heartbroken. My whole life is a lie. I foolishly think I should fight for my marriage. Over the next few months more violence. More breaking stuff. He punched holes in our doors and walls every time I brought up something he didn't want to talk about or didn't have an answer for something.  He broke an $800 window. He broke a flat screen TV.  He slammed me head first into a ditch and left me there.  I finally had enough and could see things were escalating so I called the police and he was arrested. He broke my phone several times. He jumped out of a moving vehicle. He acted like he was going to crash the vehicle with my child and I in it another time. I found out I'm pregnant. I've had huge bruises on my body.His family doesn't care what he's doing. He has done so many cruel and humiliating things to me. I tried so hard to make it work like a fool. It was lost on him. His mother enables him.His main point he keeps making is that I don't have any evidence.He's so fucking sneaky I have tried everything. He swears he is innocent, he's done nothing wrong, etc.Meanwhile I can see on his google activity when his phone is accessing certain processes and apps.  He is in messages, in calls, when there is no record of it on his phone history on his provider's log. Every time I confront him he just deletes the record of it. I stopped confronting him though in order to get more evidence. Normally we always get iphones together but last time he said he wanted to get one that could hold an SD card. So he's been fucking around since at least March of last year maybe even before that. He was a completely different person before this started. We weren't having problems. He was like my best friend we always laughed together and enjoyed each other's company so much. He saw an opportunity and he took it, eventually becoming closer and closer to her and more and more distant and cruel toward me.  I don't think he really wants to leave because he has had several opportunities now and when it comes down to it he never leaves, he told his mom he doesn't want a divorce when she tried to talk him into it.  For some reason he does not want a divorce or to separate even though he clearly gives zero fucks about me, about my son, or this child on the way. *He's still gonna get one though in due time. I'm saving up in order to be able to provide a stable life for my children. I can tell when she's been influencing him because of the things he says, so horrible- my son from a previous marriage, he is the only father he's ever known.Well all of a sudden my husband starts going on about how it's not his child. How can you be so cruel and heartless to a 6 year old?  He calls her and lets her listen when he degrades and humiliates me and breaks me down. I bring him lunch and he threw it on the ground and called me a bitch in front of his job. He has said some stuff that has made me believe he intends to try to take the baby from me. He goes back and forth between what he wants to do I guess. I am now to the point where I am not in love with him anymore. He did some really gross despicable shit recently. I'm not going to elaborate but period blood was on his dick and obviously I'm pregnant. He disgusts me now he's so evil. I'm ready to move on but not financially ready so I'm biding my time until I can. It hurts so much to be trapped in this situation. Somehow I still love him and it's hard to let go of everything we have built together. I invested in him. I got his credit improved, I researched buying homes and did all the work to find one, got us a great rate. I don't want to give up my home. I think he should go. When I met him he lived with his mother and father in his childhood room. I got him to ask his boss for a promotion and set him in line to move up in his company. He would never have done that on his own.  The really fucked up thing is that he knows what I have been through and how long it took me to trust him and he still betrayed me. He has had everything handed to him his whole life, nice middle class family,parents are still together and they totally baby him.  My parents abandoned me, I grew up in foster homes, I was raped and molested. I was homeless as a teen. I worked hard to get past all of it. I can proudly say as someone who did not have an opportunity to go to high school I am now a college graduate. I have dedicated my life to making a difference in the world, working for non profits. I'm using all the experiences I have overcome to help kids who feel like they don't have a place in the world to make things better. I don't have a family.All my life I dreamed of having a family of my own and when I finally got it, I cherished it so much. I feel like such a fool now but I would thank God for him and for my family with tears streaming down my face every time I pray. It will be a long time before I forgive him for that, it's worse than the cheating. He's taken the most precious thing in the world to me and tossed into the garbage like it's nothing. It hurts so much but I'm trying to be strong. Pregnancy is already very hard on my body I've been sick the whole time. Adding to that now is the constant feeling of rejection and depression and uncertainty of my future and my children's future. All I have ever wanted is to be loved, and I have so much love to give. He's losing out because I would have never given up on him, I would have been faithful and loved him forever.If he doesn't want that he's crazy. One day maybe he will understand but it's already too late. I have to protect my heart now or at least what's left of it. I will not let him make me a bitter hardened person I will still love with everything I have. I will still do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. I've been through worse and come out better. I know one day I will look back and say to myself wow I dodged a bullet there but as for today I just feel like my world has been shattered.
Sorry for  the long post I had to  get this all off  my chest. Any advice/encouragement Reddit? I could use some.

161,"Hello fellow redditors, this is extremely difficult for me to write out so please excuse any typos, organizational issues, length.

So I'll start at the beginning, I am 29 years old but for the last 15-20 yrs my dad has been a very minor part of my life. Over the years he's suffered from a variety of addictions from alcoholism, gambling, crack, etc. Of course, our family is the one that's had to pick up slack/""suffer"" because of it. From being on foodstamps to watching my mom stress over bills month in and month out, we were poor and struggling most of my childhood. As soon as we were able, my 2 younger brothers and I started working and we made things manageable. Now in the present, 2 of us are engineers and 1 is a banker. We're not rich, but definitely in the middle class. My point of saying all this is to explain that we've gotten to this point by ourselves without any help from my dad. He cost the family more money than he brought in, never even cared to go out to dinners with us, or even attend our birthdays.

Back to the present, his current state is unbelievably stressful for anyone to be around. My dad is convinced that everyone (brothers, sisters, his mother, his wife, everyone) is conspiring against him. He spouts conspiracy theories at any event or news piece. He does not sleep or leave the house for more than an hour at a time, and is always scheming at how to get back at his brothers and sisters. I'll find handwritten notes on bits of paper all over the house. The real issue though, is the stress he puts on the rest of the family, namely my mom. He has gone from calling her mother theresa in the past to literally blaming her for everything. He is constantly insulting her, talking down to her, demeaning her. Constantly. The last 2 days, she only got 3 hours of sleep combined. He'll just go off on rants about her not supporting him, the different conspiracies, almost anything. It is literally killing me to see my mom, who is the only reason my brothers and I have gotten as far as we have, put through this torture.

What we've done so far: We've tried multiple family and individual interventions to try and get him to see a psych. I'm sure he will not get better without medication which is something his current therapist cannot prescribe. The current therapist is who he has seen in the past for his drug problems. After having spoken to the therapist, he told me that my dad is probably back on crack. I've looked through his drawers and random hiding spot but found no evidence of this. Only thing I have found is weed. Additionally, I had asked the therapist what his thoughts were on what we could do and he responded with, nothing just get him to dry up first. When I asked him how, all he said was to talk to my dad. Point being, we've already tried that, I just dont know where to go from here. I'm afraid the current stressful state combined with all the stresses my mom has already been through, will affect her health. I need to act but have no direction or real power if he refuses to see a psych voluntarily.

The 3 options I know of are dragging him to the ER and hoping that he fails a psych eval and is placed in a ward, calling the police and hoping for the same essentially, or continuing to try and reason with him/present ultimatums in hope that he will give in. The fear with the first 2 options is that he might be able to pretend he is ok and then make the situation even worse when he returns home. With the 3rd option, I just feel it is near impossible to get him to cooperate.

Finally, with the history of our childhood as a backdrop, I find myself with very little empathy for his current situation. It is clear that his mind is a mess, but I feel it is his own doing. His addictions led to a failed business and adverse drug effects undoubtedly have contributed to his mental state. At the same time, I am hesitant to call the cops or completely abandon him because I know he would be homeless within a couple months. 


TL;DR Dad thinks everyone is conspiring against him, constantly berates my mom, almost never sleeps, possibly back to crack addiction. Not sure what steps to take short of calling police or dragging him to ER.

162,"I have to stay instate for my first year of college because my mother is very sick.

163,"Reddit, 

Male, 22. To start I think it's important to provide some background. I recently graduated college and am patiently stacking up till I can move to California to pursue artistic passions. During college I had smoked an immense amount of weed and it wasn't until sophomore year that I began developing symptoms of anxiety and panic - I had no idea what I was experiencing at the time. 

I continued my weed use as well as incorporated other psychedelics including lsd and shrooms. After a horrible second lsd trip, my anxiety took on a new level to which I am no longer to smoke weed without paranoia and self-defeating thoughts / demons. 

I've tripped several times and since practiced a number of mindful techniques including meditation... i was attempting to figure out why I experience the feelings I do, and only recently did sa reason take hold.

When I was 5-7 years old (not exactly sure - memory is hazy), I was molested by my older brother. There was no penetration or anything like that. It was more of fondling to orgasm. I don't remember much of that moment, except that it continued on for a year or two trough sleepovers we'd have in each other's room. 

When I finally acknowledged this to myself, I began to beat myself up. I could only think about how it's my fault even through the notion that he'd say ""it's not gay, it's normal"". 

I must have pushed out these memories so far into my subconscious that it wasn't until experimenting with my psychedelics that the trauma surfaced. I've been constantly flooded with intense anxiety when talking with individuals (sexual thoughts arise - even when I'm no where near aroused). I've questioned my sexuality on a number of occasions - even though I have zero affection towards the same sex. 

This realization has made me connect an immense amount of dots in my life and leads me to believe the trauma has affected almost every problem that I have when dealing with life's experiences (I.e., relationships, speaking up for myself, trust, substance abuse, anxiety, depression). 

Essentially I'm grateful for having acknowledged this problem. But now I'm stuck staring it in the face... I've never told anyone about this, and the idea of opening up to any of my friends or family scares the shit out of me. 

My brother had an traumatic childhood as well going in and out of boarding schools as well as having been raped at an early age. I should add that we would smoke a lot together / dream our musical endeavors and he's actually a large proponent as to why I'm pursuing music in the first place. He hangs around a bit at home and even is familiar with a number of my friends and so to bring this up in any capacity would undoubtedly shift the paradigm of my whole reality. 

I'm relieved that I feel as though THIS issue is the MAIN thing that's held me back for my entire life. I've always felt like I had to ""hide"" something from the world, and never knew what it was - until now. 

If you can provide any insight or advice, I would truly appreciate it. 

TL;DR: I was molested by my older brother (3 years older), and hadn't remembered until experimentation with psychedelics made the trauma surface. He's still a big part of me, my friends and my families life so I see him /  interact with him often. The trauma has me blaming myself and I can't seem to work through it on my own. 

EDIT: I wanted to add that psychedelics have even a huge part of my life and have opened my perspective on many things, especially my spiritual side. Being that I hadn't before acknowledged my own trauma, my ego deaths were so scary because I had no knowledge of where my fear stemmed from. With my new realization, I am actually almost  excited to attempt to dose again - with the intention of cleansing my self of these issues. ",14Feb2017,1
164,"First off, this isn't about relationships, and second, IDK if i'm in the right place but it won't hurt to ask, so...

I basically can't function on my own. I crave social contact, but I'm also socially awkward/a nerd and have time making new friends. I have amazing friends and family right now, but I can't spend 24 hours a day with them of course - they have their own life to live. As a result, I find myself constantly checking every social media/game friends list I have hoping that someone is there that I can hang out with. My friends are all in school right now - I graduated HS two years early - and I'm in community college, about to transfer, but this is probably going to be a real problem if I don't live at home.

***

So my best friend had a really crummy Sunday. She got into an argument with one of her close friends, causing him to storm out and leave and then later that night, her dad texted her and told her that he and her mom are getting divorced.

Now my best friend and her dad have always had a very strained relationship, especially after she came out to him and after she found out that her dad had cheated on her mom. Her mom forgave her dad after some time, but I didn't think that my friend (we'll call her Jenny) was ever going to forgive her dad for what he did. Jenny's dad has recently (within the last six months or so) began putting a lot more effort into improving their father/daughter relationship so now that he and her mom are getting divorced, she's at a loss.

Jenny and her mom have always been incredibly close, so I know that relationship won't change at all, but I'm very worried that she's going to lose the relationship that she and her dad have slowly resurrected over the last several months, and I think she is as well.

I honestly don't know why they are getting a divorce, Jenny's dad didn't really tell her last night when he texted her, and Jenny was on the phone with her mom when I fell asleep last night so I didn't (and won't until this evening) have a chance to talk to her about it.
The last piece of this puzzle is that Jenny struggled with alcoholism the first time her parents went through this, and while it was getting increasingly better, I'm worried that something like this could set her off again, and I really don't want that because she's making huge positive changes in her life right now.

I haven't personally experienced divorce so I don't know how to comfort her or what she may need from me. Basically last night all I could think of saying is ""I'm sorry,"" and ""I wish I knew how to help"", and I gave her a hug. Can anyone please give me some advice on what I can do to help her through this difficult time?

When I was near her age, after 3 fruitless years of college left me without motivation, I sort of went through a shut-in phase as well, where I spent all my time gaming. However during these times I worked a few shitty jobs to make money while she's actively avoiding looking for work, continuously leeching off my parents for EVERYTHING. 

The part that gets me is that her attitude has gotten much nastier, and she's constantly raising her voice and starting arguments over nothing, and snapping at people for anything she sees as criticism. On top of that, she'll do anything to avoid doing chores, EVEN THE SLIGHTEST tasks, except whenever she feels like doing them, which is almost never... She's lied about having done tasks before, she even pulls some extortionist bullshit like ""I said I'd do X first, so you HAVE to do Y"", and just ignore us if we contest which is driving us crazy. She's completely ungrateful to my parents, who bust their ass to try and help her; they get yelled at, insulted, pushed around despite paying for her EVERYTHING... Can I do anything?

This time last year my department got a new supervisor. She's pretty cool and can't really complain, she's just overly chatty. I've been working on my ""relationships"" for a while now and doing what I can to try to further my skills, people skills, and cultivating relationships. 

Well, over the last two or three months our seven person department is down to three people. One person was let go, two others quite, and the last is on HMLA and doesn't look like she'll be back. When this last guy quite, he was my counter part. It takes two people to do the job him and I do (realistically it should be three). Prior to his last day, I approached my supervisor and asked her about my future, and concerns, and financial gains. Not once did I request a raise, or a promotion, or anything of the such. I stated issues regarding the fact that (as she knew both the guy that quite and I and many others think this position is underpaid) this position needs a pay raise, not only to entice people to the job, but help them stay. I told her that I had personal goals, and that I want to be able to financially support a family in the near future. I also shared the fact that title of the position in no way, shape, or form truly conveys the job and should be changed. Even the HR person agrees with this...

I stated a lot of logical concerns, and wanted to know where the future with the company will take me. I even prefaced this conversation with the fact this wasn't a hostage situation where if I didn't receive a raise I'd quite. I simply... wanted... answers...

She retorted with rambling, talking about other people and their situations which were poor examples at best. She talked about her situation, and this took about an hour. I got tired of this and just said thanks and went to leave. 

She said ""I hope I answered your questions""

I replied ""No, you didn't"" and explained that she said the extra work I was taking on didn't come with pay or title change, but paid in opportunity. I didn't see the opportunity myself, and at this point would be grateful if she could point them out. I didn't want to make what I'm making forever, and wanted to know how to move ahead.

Her response was to shrug her shoulders and say ""Well, I guess you have to figure out what you want to do.""

This has infuriated me beyond belief. I was very detailed in my questions, seeking for a way to pursue my personal goals while here at this company. I assumed that not only our professional relationship, but personal relationship was much better than a simple shoulder shrug and a ambiguous answer. I'm obviously upset, and refuse to be her ""go to"" anymore.

202,"Hello everyone, 

I'm currently 22 year's old and on active duty. I am searching for schools to pursue a Degree in Information Assurance and Security Degree and have been consuming as much online information as possible. There are several things I am shaky on though I wanted to seek guidance on. 

The primary one is, what degree should I be pursuing? I have seen multiple degrees that appear to be in the similar vein, the primary one being ""Cyber Security"" This appears to be a broad degree though, not so much as a focus. 

My next point of confusion lies in the what I should be consuming prior to starting school to help me advance. I have a very basic understanding of most things computers. ( I work in data for the Marine Corps, but the level I am at is not very indepth, very basic stuff) That background spurred my interest in this and I am willing to devote free time to learning, I just want to make sure I am focusing on the important things.

Lastly and general information or guidance you can pass to me would be massively appreciated. Its very daunting the idea getting back into school after being separated from this for so long. I am a little worrier cause I have to do school online, and am worried that I wont get a firm grasp on what the degree entails. 

Finally, this one is somewhat subjective, but any school recommendations would be greatly appreciated, I never did the whole college searching thing and unfortunately don't have the luxury of a School guidance councilor to help me. I am petrified of enrolling in a school that appears to be good but is poorly regarded in the field I am interested in. 

Thanks again for any and all help. ",14Feb2017,1
203,"So, I had a pre employment physical and it asked about anxiety and depression and I checked that I had anxiety but the doctor said I didn't show immediate signs of it and noted that it was all good. Also I put that I was claustrophobic but they took that as I can't wear a SCBA which I have taken all my MEDs to sail and did all the training which involves wearing one all day... and so on. so I guess I should have checked no to both and said fuck it. 

I did the counseling and I'd say I'm about 85% better now, but they don't look into it at all

209,"17 years ago I bought a Valentine's Day card for my high school gf. She dumped me before I had a chance to write in it. I thought it was the absolutely perfect card, so I saved it not knowing who I would eventually give it to. 

Today is my first V-day as a married man. I want to give the card to my wife. 

Do I tell my wife the backstory? Will the fact that I didn't already buy it for her be upsetting? Or does the fact that I saved it so long waiting for 'the one' make it especially romantic?

213,"One of our neighbors smokes pot. Normally I wouldn't care, you do you, however, it does stink up our house since they smoke it outside. I don't know how it gets in the house since all of the windows are closed, but it frequently wakes me up since the smell is just so terrible. I'm guessing they smoke outside because they don't want the smell in their own house? but it is really irritating since it just gets into our place!

They used to do it at night, then about a month ago they were smoking around 6 am (still bothersome, then too), and now they have started at 4 am. Almost every day the past two weeks!

I have candles that I light to attempt to negate the smell, but I still have to get up and do that. I know it isn't safe to keep a candle lit all night either.

I don't know what I can do. I don't know which neighbor it is and even if I did I wouldn't be able to ask them to stop. It is a free country after all. I just want to keep the smell out is all.

218,"So UPS just stopped by and dropped off an Amazon package at my house. It has a lithium-ion warning sticker on it, so it's an electronic device (an improperly packaged one which can be heard when shaken around inside). According to the UPS tracking number on UPS' website, this person paid for next day shipping for this item. It's Valentines Day, so I suppose it must be for a loved one. 

Alright so put away your high horses and let's be real. I live in a rather dangerous neighborhood of low income folks. I am a petite young woman with a cold and am really scared of the people who live around here.  

It's 30 degrees outside. I have my coat and shoes on. Nobody is home except me. I'm begging you guys, what should I do? 

**Edit**: My older sister, who works at a local Walgreens pharmacy, just texted me and said she'll give it to them. She said she knows them cause they come by the pharmacy. I feel really bad that someone won't be getting their Valentines Day present. 

**Edit2**: YAY my older brother came home! He said we can deliver it after we go to Wendys. Thank you everyone! I was so nervous.   

**Edit3**: So we stopped by the house and I knocked a few times. The doorbell doesn't work. Nobody answered. I placed the package on the porch in such a way that only people on the porch itself would see it. I hope it doesn't get stolen. I feel really bad I couldn't hand it to the person.

221,"TL;DR
40 y/o non-student, non-working and not looking for a job in my dorm. Doesn't go along with any dormmate. I'm only halfway in my yearcontract. When he and anyone else are in the same room, the whole vibe becomes like a cold war. Talking it over has proven no effect.
What can I do?

---
Small dorm, 5 currently inhabiting. Shared kitchen and sanitaries.
All of us have lived here for 6 months, the man for 2+ years.

When I found the dorm, it was in renovation and I assumed noone was living here yet. 2 days after I moved in, I encountered the 40 y/o man. My landlord didn't tell me of this man, but I didn't ask either. He told me he'd move out in 2 months, so I didn't think it'd be a problem

6 months later, he's had beef with 6 of the 8 students living/ who have lived here. He won't mention any issue, no matter how small, until he starts yelling and throwing insults. He'll start arguments with a student in their own major, dismissing the need of sources, ofcourse frustrating them.
Even if we got to some kind of promise of conduct, the next problem would arise again in days.

He mentioned he has no work and noone in the house has noticed any indication he is searching, even though he claims he has 2 academic degrees in economics. No relationship. 70% of his room is stacked with filled cardboard boxes, almost as if he's hoarding. 

I'm 6 months into my 1-year-contract, so I can't leave yet and I'd rather not as it's really close to my college. I also believe it isn't fair that he's taking a cheap room a college student could be having, just because he won't have to work to stay here.

But this is my home for now, and it is still his home, but I can't head home whilst thinking 'I hope I don't run into a housemate'.

Should I talk with my landlord about finding him a new place to live?
Should I just endure 6 months and move out myself?
Any other possibilities?

225,"Don't ask me why I do, all I know is that I do. We've been apart for a month now and all I can think about is her.

Anyway the situation is that we were together for 3 years, living together for 2. Things were very good almost the whole time. About in October we were no longer connecting as well but still had moments where things would be very good. She ended up meeting someone online playing a video game in December and cheated on me (technically not physically but still cheating) and then left me middle of January and moved to Florida to be with him. She seems like she's madly in love with this guy or at least has been posting stuff on Facebook like she is. Now I angrily texted her for a while then I calmed down and then I went through a depressive episode and ended up reaching out to her about my thoughts, which were not good.

Anyway within a week of breaking up with me they made their relationship Facebook official and both changed their profile pictures to the two of them. She has no job since she recently moved and he is going to school also doesn't have a job so they have all the time to be around each other.  Anyway she's recently been ignoring my texts, which I was just about to stop contact for at least 30 days or so but wanted to say something first. Anyway she's blocked me on most social media and probably phone.

Now it's not like our past relationship wasn't strong. I know it was for a while, she's probably forgotten though. And we were very compatible or at least from my side we were. So my question is, is there any chance I can win her back? I really don't think someone can move on from a relationship that fast to another relationship. I'm going to start focusing on myself for a while but I do still want her in my life, even after what she did. Any advice on how or if I should proceed?",14Feb2017,1
226,"Hello, I'm relatively new to Reddit and mostly a lurker at that but I am really hoping to find some guidance here.

I'm a late 30's male with a decent government job and a comfortable life. I don't drink, smoke or do any drugs of any sort. About two years ago, I met a woman on a dating website and we got along rather well and became an official couple. She comes from quite a different world than me. While I'm not, and have never been rich, I've also never been really poor. But she is and has pretty much always been poor. Her parents have a long history of drugs and were always just scraping by.  To try to make a long story shorter, I ended up helping her wherever I could. Money for bills, doctor, gas, food, cigarettes, etc. I only did it when I could afford it, and limited it to what I felt was a reasonable amount.

When we are together, we don't really fight and seem to get along well. The issues started arising around the actual amount of time we spent together. We don't live together, she lives with a female roommate in a run down shitty house. Time spent together seemed to fluctuate, sometimes I'd see her three times a week, then we'd go a two week stretch where I didn't see her at all. There were always excuses for the absences, car problems, health problems, and knowing the poor quality of her life, the excuses were rather easy to believe. Until it became a constant cycle. I started feeling like she didn't actually want to see me, and that money was the real goal. We've fought about this plenty, and she stresses the fact that she loves me and wants to be with me and it's just the circumstances of her shitty life that get in the way.

For the last six months, I've stopped giving her money. I've bought her cigarettes and food occasionally, but stopped giving any other financial assistance. And while I can see it makes her life rougher, she is still here with me.

Fast forward to last Friday, after almost two years of dating, things broke in a big way. She was in a car with her roommate and got pulled over by the police. She was arrested for an outstanding warrant stemming from some check fraud a year before we had met. She had told me about this earlier, but that it was her one run in with the law and that it was resolved. So after spending a couple nights in jail, she is scheduled to be in court Tuesday morning (today). I talked with the roommate she was driving around with to see if she wanted to go to court with me and was told that my girlfriend would probably not want me there and that I shouldn't go. Of course I insisted that I should go and why would she not want me there for support? My heart hit the floor when I heard her response.

To paraphrase: Aside from not feeling well due to the lack of cigarettes and coffee, she has had an opiate addiction for the last few years. She will be sick and not want me to see her. From pills to currently injecting heroin.

Looking back now, the signs were obvious. Her sleep patterns, her inability to spend the entire night with me, marks on her legs, depression, etc. All plausibly explained away by well crafted lies. While her current incarceration is not for a drug charge, her charges could have significant jail time. She was unable to make court today being sick, so we'll find out the sentence when she is rescheduled in the next few days.

She knows I have been told all her secrets, but I have yet to talk to her myself. She plans on calling me tomorrow.
I've spent a lot of time reading the various heroin related boards here and frankly I'm afraid of whats to come and what I should do. I do love her, I want to be with her. But there are so many things I don't know. Did she really love me or was it just to get drug money? Will she be able to beat the addiction? Will it be a problem for the rest of our lives? Can I handle this? Is it worth it? I'm a dedicated person, I can't imagine just cutting off someone I love because they have a problem, or ditching them when they need help the most. If she doesn't really love me, then I have no choice. If she can't get clean I also feel like I would have no choice (at some point). If it's beatable, I'm willing to fight.

I also have to contend with the possible jail sentence. If she gets locked away for a year, or two years, does that change things? 
When she is released, can I expect her to run straight to the needle first thing? even after a week of being forced clean? a month? I feel if she went back to her house, it's inevitable. If she came directly to mine, maybe not?

I obviously don't expect answers to all (or even any) of these questions. I realize most of it revolves around my feelings and hers. I'll certainly know more when we've had a chance to talk. But any advice on how to best handle the scenario would be great. It's a miserable scenario and I'm a miserable person at the moment. I love her.

227,Hi I am 14 and I am a freshmen in high school. I don't have veery much experience with girls and I am not the most outgoing guy.i am wondering how would I talk to a girl I like that is shy as well? I don't know that's why I came to reddit.,14Feb2017,3
228,"Prepare for a long explanation(I'm also bad at explaining so I'm sorry in advance). I'm a very sensitive guy. The combination of social anxiety (selective mutism), paranoia and just having really bad experiences has caused me to become too attached to the ones I care about. I get to the point where at times I go through every possible scenario in my head and fear that something bad has happened to them if I don't hear from them. That is one example of what's wrong with me.

I don't have any real friends. I wake up, go to class, then go home and sit in teamspeak(Basically Skype) all night with people who I've never met but who are honestly the greatest people I've ever known. In the group of people who I talk to, there's this girl who I only started talking to a few months ago(let's call her L). She was always friends with them longer than I have been, and we only knew of each others existence but never actually formally met. I'd say we became fairly close quickly due to us both being ""socially awkward"" people in real life, but very outgoing and lively online.

Time goes by and I'm not 100% certain that things are mutual between us but it certainly feels like it has. She has this thing though where she never really responds to messages, not just to me but everyone, but I take it very personally and think I've done something wrong. My friend who's been helping me through all this has been always trying to push me further and to take some steps forward to see how things go, but as usual, I am hesitant because I don't want to end up making mistakes by saying/doing something wrong. Lately it's been feeling like things between her and I have become 1 sided, where I'm only trying to make an effort (imagine, me, the socially unacceptable guy actually making an effort) and it's been really putting me down.

The reason why I'm so hesitant about this is because about 5 years ago, I was in the same situation with another girl. We were the best of friends and I guess eventually we had a thing going between us. One day, she just doesn't show up around the usual time, and eventually this happens everyday for a few weeks. I eventually get worried sick about it and do my own digging. I find out that the reason she stopped showing up was because she was struck by a car and was killed. It completely destroyed me. I've only ever told 1 person about it recently, on the anniversary of her death. My family doesn't even know about this. Because of this, I've been hesitant to make moves and pursue relationships because the more I become attached, the more worried I become about getting rejected or losing them because of a stupid mistake or accident.

Now back to my current situation. I have many feelings towards L and as usual, I'm being stubborn because of love. She can be manipulative and sometimes plays with my emotions. She'll pretend to hate me just so she can make me upset. The other day, she made me believe that she's had this girlfriend for the past couple years, and of course only brought it up knowing it will ""trigger"" me, but I did my best not to show it or feel it. I'm not sure if she does this on purpose or she doesn't know how serious my issues are. Lately I've been giving up hope because I think nothing will happen. My friend thinks it's best that I just talk to her, clear things up and see where things are going. But as usual, the fear of rejection will destroy me. Is there an easy way to bring this up to her or should I just move on. Either way, we're still always going to be around each other due to our mutual friends so I don't want to make things uncomfortable between the two of us.

I probably wrote too much, but still ended up being fairly vague. If you need clarification, just ask in the comments, I'll answer as best as I can.
All responses are definitely appreciated. Thanks for your time.",14Feb2017,1
