0,"Ok so about 2-3 years ago I used to talk to this girl online (she lives in the U.S). We got on well. We spoke only for a few months or so but she was really nice. Now for some reason contact between us dropped, but I recently found her again. If I really wanted to, I could just add her on FB but I feel that might be too personal. We had each other's snapchats, but I never saw from her for ages (even though I could re-add her giving her notice that I added her again). But anyway, it might be strange to her that someone from a few years ago is trying to talk to her again, and she'll probably think i'm a creep/weirdo or something. But i don't know. I'd love for us to be friends again. Does anyone have any advice?",09Jan2017,1
2,"I have been at boarding school for about 5 months now, and I cannot stand it. I have no friends. My roommate's side of the room is totally awful, not to mention he stays up until 1 a.m. talking on the phone with other kids. I have anxiety and I think I will fall apart at any second here. I don't have support from anyone, and my mother is 500 miles away. She said if I wanted to I could transfer to public. I don't know how I will survive the rest of the year. Help.",09Jan2017,1
4,"I have recently gotten 2 pairs of white sneakers, neither of them were cheap. There are these people at school that enjoy stepping on them and they find it funny, i don't, i spent $250 on those. How i see it i can go two ways with this, knock one on their ass or talk to the principal. I know that the safest thing is to go to the principal but these are the type of people that would take this and make it worse. On the other hand if i punch one of them there is a high likelihood of the rest backing off after I laid out their friend. I am bigger than most of them which is good and also bad. 
	If you have anyone ideas (besides not wearing those shoes to school, they do it to my other shoes also) please tell me.",09Jan2017,0
5,"Start with a bit of background I suppose:

I'm 19 years old now, I finished our country's equivalent of high school last year. All my life I wanted to make my own video games. It's mostly because ever since I was a child I liked imagining fantasy worlds and playing videogames, so why not express my fantasy into video games? So last year I tried getting into a college that taught game design, but after being rejected I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

A gap year to figure life out sounded like a good idea. The idea was that I would travel a bit and work for the rest of the year. So I did some traveling, first with my brother but he does study and didn't have much time to travel with me. Then I went and traveled alone for a month, it was a great experience but I'm not sure if I'm ready for another trip like that. I guess the money and planning that go into a long trip are kind of intimidating as well.

So after traveling I tried doing work. I tried a few things, but the work available for my level of education is often quite monotonous and left me really unhappy after a few weeks. I think I'm spoiled or picky, but it just simply made me unhappy. From what I hear, people like those job because of who they work with, but I'm not a very social person, I don't dislike people but I don't really *click* with a lot of people, especially in a professional field it's difficult for me to get along with those around me.

So work and travel aren't really working out as well as I had hoped. I've spend a few months at home. I have a disabled mother so being able to help around the house was nice, I did a lot of cooking for instance. But most of my time I spend reading books or playing video games. I enjoyed spending time at home doing generally nothing, but it sounds kinda sad and spoiled. And after a while I'm getting sick of doing nothing.

I figured out what I want to do next school year (go to college and study IT), but that's still 8 months away. I just don't want to do nothing for 8 months, but I don't know what to do either.

My parents want me to get a job, and part of me agrees, but another part of me is really unmotivated and a little scared of the idea of doing those kind of jobs for the next several months. I can't get myself to look for jobs I don't want to. But at the same time I'm sick of being at home doing nothing. 

All of my options look unappealing. I just want to do something with my life these months, I just have no idea how.",09Jan2017,1
6,"I talk very low. I can  certainly project my voice  better than anyone I know-- when I need to. Otherwise, though, most people ask me to repeat myself. 

I guess I'm partly self conscious about overtaking a room. I fear being a loud, boisterous jerk, but now I'm barely heard and I can never tell if it's because I talk low or am being ignored -- fostering further insecurities. It does help me remain relatively inconspicuous, which has its benefits.

I want to sound confident, but calmly confident. I want to speak in a way that while I have volume control, I can make an impression with my voice and draw attention to myself immediately without being obnoxious.",09Jan2017,1
7," My ex best friend and I split recently. They want so desperately to make up . The sheer desperation only makes me RUN. 

I know I should make up bc well they are my only friend and they can be quite helpful . But they bug the shit out of me. And I don't know how to feel. 

I should say he is my brother. Is this normal for siblings to get on each other's nerves ?",09Jan2017,1
8,"I am not a religious person.  However, I strongly am against sucking up to people who continually spit in your face.

My family and Jewish and my sister married an Orthodox Christian.  Clearly, we did not care about this at all because we are not religious. We treated him with respect only for him to spit in our faces and disrespect us with his actions.  I have always been respectful to him, for my sister's sake, as it is clear he is very abusive to her and controlling.  I did not want him to accidentally kill her in a fit of rage because she has told us that he breaks things in anger and completely goes crazy with rage at the smallest incidents.

Here are some examples of how he has disrespected me and my family in the past, excluding the abuse he has committed toward my sister:

- He is very rude to us whenever we interact with him.

- He told my sister that she could have a Jewish wedding in exchange for baptizing the children Orthodox.  She agreed, but he changed the ceremony at the last minute and it was not a traditional Jewish ceremony.  He went back on his word here.

- He stopped Jewish music at the wedding, despite half of the guests being Jewish, and put on Orthodox music instead.  (Originally, it was going to be half Jewish, half Orthodox music).

- He hit me in the head a few months ago for absolutely no reason, unprovoked.  I responded by yelling a trivial curse at him, something you commonly hear on television daily, realizing what I had said, I apologized.  He got very angry that I swore at him and stormed out of our house and yelling at my parents because of what happened, saying it was not ok.  He did not apologize for hitting me, and refuses to do so.  I did not hit him back, because I am intelligent and building a life for myself, and do not want a criminal record.

- My sister said that he was going to apologize for his actions via phone call, but he never did. So we did not invite him over for Hanukkah.  Again, a spit in the face.

- Worst of all, an agreement was made that the middle name of my sister's child would be my father's name if the child is a boy, and my sister's husband's mother's name if the child is a girl.  A few weeks later, the ultrasound confirms the child was a boy, and he breaks the deal saying he is not going to name his child after a dirty Jew.

Now, my family wants me to go to my nephew's baptism, but I have refused.  I also believe that my parents should not go to this baptism until a sincere apology is delivered and behavioral actions changed, which I doubt will happen.

I refuse to go because the baptism is clearly for my piece of shit brother-in-law and not for my nephew, as he is an infant and knows nothing.  I refuse to go and show respect to such a piece of shit by attending his religious ceremony.

If I were an impulsive idiot like my brother-in-law, I would probably kick his ugly face for his actions.  But

What is your take on this? What should I do? Should I go to the baptism? 

Honestly, I am also very angry at my sister.  She brings shame to my family by allowing her degenerate husband to act like this.  I have wanted to cut them out of my life entirely and not even see my sister or nephew, but my parents tell me not to do this.  What do you think?

11,"So there's definitely more to it than that. However, by society's definition... 

[19 F] and pretty hesitant to continue my life the way it is. I just kind of need some practical advice about where to go next from here. 

None of my family has gone to college, much less graduated high school, so it's hard to imagine myself continuing college all the way through. Especially considering how touch-and-go I feel about majoring in computer science (despite having at least SOME passion for this most of my life). 

I'm two years in now, but it's been a rough time already. I dropped out the second week freshman year, took that semester off, went to a community college, and now I'm back at the state university this year. I just completed my fall semester and I did okay - I think I'm sitting at like a 3.45 right now. However, not exactly psyched about the college I'm going to - I've wanted to transfer since I was accepted there. Probably wasn't a smart idea to even go in the first place.. 

Reason I don't like this college: 
-It's far away from all the internships I've held (which pay actual money, $15/hr - pretty good in my book). If I transferred back locally, I could work and do school at the same time.

-The school isn't good for what I want to do, really, and there's no opportunities in the surrounding community.

Options I see for myself: 
-Drop out of college and just stop trying to convince myself it's necessary. 

-Transfer next year, get an internship, continue hating myself for just two or three more years.. end up unsatisfied anyways. 

-Blahwgafjgsdf I don't know, continue making mistakes because I'm anxious and have no idea what to do next?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.. I don't really have any more at this point.

13,"(tl;dr at bottom) i met someone a long while ago, let's call her.. 3. so 3 and I barely talk anymore despite our previous infatuation with eachother. we never dated (and never wanted to,) probably because she was picking up and breaking up with significant others every 1.5 months. i'm not kidding, she got a new love a good 2 weeks after each breakup. 

i should mention she's a.. special snowflake-type person. non-binary (in reality i use different pronouns. i'm using she/her now to hide identity,) pescatarian, and she converted to paganism. she's a white girl, but not a girl, ya dig? i have my opinions and everything regarding snowflakes like her but i wanted to overlook that and be friends. now it's just getting over the top: the other day i mentioned on snapchat how stupid astrology is, using the line ""how can a planet/star have any affect on you? astrology is dumb"" and she dm'ed me about how i ""forgot she was pagan"" and how lucky i was that she didn't block me. SHUT THE FUCK UP. YOU CONVERTED LAST YEAR.

i've been very respectful to her the entire time we've been friends. but she's forced me into situations and conversations i don't want to be in, told me things i don't want to know, etc. she's also been a prick multiple times to me, putting me to tears at one point over a fucking video game (i was new to it, she laughed at me for not knowing controls.)

14,"I did very bad last semester (1.0 GPA). It was my first semester at a rigorous LAC. They took punitive action by suspending me for next semester. The suspension allows for an appeal, however, if I believe the committee on academic standing was missing crucial information in making their decision. Last semester, I came into school unable to sustain a routine of taking my medication. It became so infrequent that I was experiencing nausea, headaches, fatigue, and brain-zaps as withdrawal symptoms in addition to worsened depression symptoms. I have the opportunity to write a letter detailing that there were extenuating circumstances last semester, and asserting that they will not be problems in the spring-- Being off my medication and dealing with depression are the reasons I have in the appeal. I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to read what I've written so far? Or if I could receive some general pointers on appealing academic suspension. Specifically, I'm looking for someone who is part of higher education or has served on academic committees. My school is not providing much help in the process- I'm trying to figure out if my appeal is based on a good, convincing reason- I think it is but would like an answer from someone who knows their shit. Thank you and please help. I have lots at stake beside just academics, including my relationship at school with a girl I love, and my happiness- I will be miserable away from school and I am ready to return and do well. 

Thank You

16,"I'll try to keep this short, but I will expand if necessary. 

TL;DR : Had a falling out with a girl that is a friend I have feelings for after she ignored me for a week, I posted something disrespectful that she ended up seeing from someone else on Snapchat and she won't talk to me. Sent flowers as sorry. Move on or try to reconcile?

So I met this girl whom yes, I have feelings for last August, and at first she liked me - but as she is out of an 8 year relationship in which she was cheated on, the circumstances came down to she wasn't ready, and just wanted to be friends. Cool - maybe this was my mistake in accepting that offer since I liked her. 

So we saw each other maybe like 6 times from beginning of October - End of December 2016, and 4/6 of those times were 1 on 1 hangouts. This killed me cause it didn't get anywhere, but it's my cousin's friend so I didn't wanna make anything weird. 

I ended up asking her if she wanted to go to a broadway show (after asking her out 2 months before and getting put down as a friend...but when I told her I need to stop talking to her, she got upset and didn't want me to so I stuck around) and she declined the offer saying she didn't feel the same way about dating. This was on Christmas Day of 2016. For a week, she didn't text me or call me as she usually texts first sometimes and calls me randomly to talk...I kinda got worried, so I was texting her throughout the week to see what was up. No answer. I kicked myself over this and she made me feel bad. 

I ended up posting something very disrespectful on Snapchat basically cussing her out because I blew up, and my cousin (who said she wouldn't get involved) showed her. I didn't know this until the following Thursday when I found out more about why she wouldn't talk to me...and she got really upset and said she wanted to be left alone. She had already blocked me on all social media so I did the same. 

Now...I've apologized since and said I don't care about it, and also sent her flowers she received yesterday with a card saying I'm sorry, and it was out of character/I've been stressed recently and I don't wanna ruin our friendship. Friends tell me mixed stories of moving on or waiting on her answer a few weeks. What do you think reddit family? 

If I move on, yeah it'll hurt as it does now and I can only think of the good stuff we had and our everyday conversations, but it'll be for the best I believe. I don't even think I should've been her friend if I felt this way and she didn't. 

Thanks for all the support!

Edit: A few of you are saying I was down about being friends. I mean not really...but a relationship in which one person likes the other more than just a friend is going to end in hurt from what I've learned. So I just wanted to distance myself before anything...but that backfired as we talked everyday. ",09Jan2017,0

21,"Let me start this off by saying I’m only 29 years old, but I feel I too old to be feeling this frustrated.

I usually go into office/administrative jobs because I feel like I don’t have many skills. Although I am a very hard worker, I’ve been critized/praised for “going above and beyond” many times.

But every job I’ve had, which after college I’ve had about 5 so far, I find an aspect I hate about a job. It’s either a coworker who likes to intimidate me because I am very timid or likes to bully me into taking on their work. Funny part is that the bosses I’ve had usually like me, its the coworkers who do not like me.

I have anxiety so I think about work constantly. I’m currently in a situation where I am in a toxic work environment. My coworkers gossip, hate one another, and are generally miserable. It is a very tiny office. I’m so nervous because each little move I make can get me reprimanded or scolded. The bosses don’t care and the place has a high turnover rate with people quiting on the spot.

I’ve complained about jobs before to my parents, whom I live with. I don’t want them to see me as a constant job hopper or can’t hold down a job (I’ve only been downsized one and quit a job once). I feel like such a failure in the employment aspect of life. How do I stop making a job my whole focus? I try to distract myself with hobbies but my anxiety keeps the job in focus.

22,"I'm a recent engineering graduate in Canada and found myself having to move to a &lt;1 million prairie city for a job. Honestly, I really love the job, I'm learning a lot and my colleagues are all very nice and accommodating. However, I just don't feel right being here, my ""grand dream"" was to be in Vancouver where most of my friends are. I ****ING HATE WINTER (words cannot express my feels...) and I love hiking (and therefore mountains), so basically I don't belong here.

With that, I'm constantly in a battle between two sides. One, I should be extremely grateful that I have a job that I actually enjoy. Given the shitty economy here in Canada, I am very lucky to be one of the few graduates that have a job right now. The other, I should be doing what I believe would make me most happy and take risks as necessary. I've been doing what I call ""delayed gratification"" starting with engineering school, where I work hard and believe that there's a massive payout in the end.

Now, I think I have a decent plan that is a compromise of the two. I have plenty of embedded programming experience and I've been practicing on my coding skills in hopes that after 1 year, I could decide to just move to Vancouver (without a job, scary!) and hope for the best on getting hired ASAP (with savings built up of course). The company I work for has many other offices around the country, that's another option, but I don't know how to approach internal transfers yet.

23,"I just recently got back in to dating world, and I need a bit of advice on this.

I wasn't out looking for anything, I was at the mall trying to find a gift for my brother-in-law. So I go to gamestop.


Now I walk into the store I begin looking around. I find a game for myself and I continue to look for my brother-in-law. Well I can't find what I was looking for so I decide to buy the game I want and ask if they have that certain product.

Now I this is where I meet here. I walk up and there this girl is  (let's call her Alice).

So Alice is a drop dead gorgeous girl I start talking to her and we hit it off I mean talking about more than just games and her job, so I don't think she was just be friendly for her job. So we talk for a good 15 minutes then I leave. I can't find anything else in the mall so I return to gamestop for one more thing, I'm not going to lie I wanted to see her again too. So I am thinking between games and can't decide. She is stocking games now and I am standing there looking and we are talking again for roughly about 20 minutes again.

Now I wanted to ask her to lunch or something. I also understand people don't want to be hit on at work. So I couldn't get up the nerve to ask her shit.

So I have left the store maybe half an hour to an hour and I decide to make the stupid mistake and call the store here is exactly what was said,

Alice: ""Thank you for calling a Gamestop, Alice speaking.""

Me: ""Hey Alice it's IAmLancaster from earlier.""

Alice:""Oh Yeah, What's up?""

Me: ""I don't do this often but I was wondering if you were single?""

Alice: ""Yeah but why is that current?""

Me: ""I was wondering if you would like to go for lunch one day?""

Me: ""Alright. Sorry about that. Have a good day.""

Alice: ""Have a good day.""

29,"Like many children in middle-class America, I was promised I bright future. Though my future career of choice seemed to vary with the tides, the overarching plan was clear from early on:  Get a good scholarship to a prestigious university, go on to grad school, and eventually become a successful professional or academic in my field of choice.

And thus it largely went—that is, until I started to suffer from severe depression midway through high school. Again, an all-too-familiar story for many of you, I’m sure.  I managed to graduate in the top 20% of my class, but I didn’t have the GPA to get into a top-tier school, despite having an ACT composite of 35/36. It took about 3 years of flunking out of various universities until I finally found a medication combo that worked. I moved back home and enrolled in community college. It was about this time that I got my first IT job; having taught myself the basics of programming from modding video games and an old copy of C++ for Dummies, I managed to land an entry level position with a small, local IT consulting firm.

The next year and a half were some of the better times of my life. I was finally doing well in school, and I advanced quickly in the company that hired me, leading to two promotions in that time. I was living at home and had little in the way of expenses, so everything I made was basically cash to spend. At 21, I felt a little behind my peers who were already finishing their bachelors, but I justified that by citing my valuable work experience.

By this point, I had finished the basic classes offered at the community college, and decided to return to 4-year university to complete my bachelors in computer engineering. I left my job, moved to a nearby city, and enrolled full time. Before long, I met a woman, fell in love, and decided to move with her at the end of the semester to Arizona, where she had a job lined up. I was confident that I could get leverage my two years of work experience into a software job out there.

I was right. It took about six months, during which time my then fiancé supported me, but I ultimately got a job with Vonage. The company was great, the culture was great, and I was making more money than ever before. We got a house and a dog. I was 22, and I was settling down. And that scared the crap out of me.

After about six months of that, my lovely 20-something FOMO won out. I called off the relationship, quit my job, moved back and reenrolled in my previous university. But I quickly found out that things had changed. Firstly, moving across the country twice and bailing out of a serious relationship had left me considerably in debt. Not student loan debt that could be deferred or ignored until I graduated, real, pressing debt. Secondly, I had income, and a sizable tax return, which meant I didn’t qualify for scholarships or aid anymore. I borrowed money for another semester of school, but quickly realized that between the cost of living and the cost of tuition, and not being able to work full time, I was building even more debt fairly rapidly.

At the same time, I became very interested in entrepreneurship. By this point, I was an experienced software developer with a great deal of knowledge and skill on a wide variety of applications. I had seen firsthand how thing were done in small companies, government contractors, all the way up to public properties like Vonage. I became fascinated with the stories of people like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, all who dropped out of school. I began to compare the huge price tag of college with the money that I could be making working full time, and I couldn’t justify the enormous net difference.

I quit school yet again, moved home, and got a job doing software development at a finance company. For a while, things were good again. I was salaried at something like $92,500. I was 24, making a shit ton of money at an easy job, and I discovered that I actually had considerably less debt than many of my peers, many of whom were now adding the cost of grad school on top of their undergrad price tags. I paid off most of my debt, bought a new sports car, and signed an 18 month lease on a nice but reasonable luxury apartment. I would go out with my friend whenever I wanted, often picking up the tab. It was nice restaurants, fancy meals whenever I wanted, first dates and casual sex. If I wanted something, I bought it. I guess you can see where this is headed.

There was a problem. Of all the things I had wanted to be growing up, programmer was never one. I never really went to school for computer science. I never really wanted to be in IT. It just sort of fell onto me. Now, with six years of experience, I was growing increasingly bored and frustrates with my line of work. I hated sitting in front of a computer all day, unable to get any exercise or socialize with other humans. I knew enough about the industry to be disappointed in all the crappy ways my current employer was doing things wrong. I was being paid an enormous amount of money to do work that I could finish in 1/5th the time that was expected, on a crappy, outdated, security-risk riddled application in order to help some big shot insurance CEO eke out a little more profit from his underpaid staff. I began to resent my life, as I looked at my peers who were now doing all sorts of fascinating jobs. I grew increasingly disengaged at work. And not surprisingly, before long, I was fired.

Once I lost my job, I felt immediate and enormous relief. Though I had lived a fairly luxurious lifestyle, I had always been careful with money in relation to my income, and so I had enough savings to continue my lifestyle for six months. Now was my opportunity follow my destiny of becoming an entrepreneur by starting my own business. I made a website and business cards, marketing myself as both an IT consultant and a contract web developer. I reached out through my decent network and before long, I had people contacting me about work. Work that they wanted to pay ME for. I was my own boss. No longer would some suit take the lion’s share of the income; it would all go to me.

Except, nobody wanted to pay. Go online and you’ll find a plethora of stories of software guys and web designers who went out on their own and made a killing doing contract work. I don’t know how they did it, or if times have just changed, but that’s not the reality I encountered. Everybody wants a website, or IT work, but $300 for a custom built website? That’s outrageous! You want $50 an hour to build an MVC web application?? No way! The big fries all go for larger agencies; Everybody else either has no budget or outsources to third-world website-a-day firms. Or they throw something together on a Wordpress builder and call it good. Ultimately, I only got one real worthwhile contract, a website for a local church, whose owner had a background in business and believed in the ethicality of paying a fair price for good work.

That brings me to today. It’s been almost six months since I lost my last job. I’ve long since restarted my job search, but so far nothing has panned out. Furthermore, I’m not crazy about the idea of going back into that life that I hated so much before. Fact of the matter is though, if I don’t get a job by the end of this month, I’m not going to be able to pay rent, and I’ll be evicted. My apartment will sue for $25,000 in damages over the broken lease, and I’ll declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. I’ll lose my home, my car, and move back in with my parents. My debts will be erased, but I’ll have that bankruptcy on my credit for 10 years. I don’t know how I’ll ever get another apartment. I’m under incredible stress, and my thoughts inevitable turn to where I’ll be six months from now.

I just turned 25. It seems that a few things are possible:

•	I may find a job in the next two or three weeks, go back to work, and begin paying off my debts. It’ll be rough for a few months, but assuming I can keep the job, I’ll be back in good shape by autumn.

•	I won’t find a job, I’ll lose everything, and I’ll declare bankruptcy. From there, I have an opportunity to take my life in a new direction.

If the latter happens, I’m not sure what I’ll do next. Continue to look for work as before? Go back to university? Go to trade school? I’m seriously considering becoming a firefighter if it goes that route. I could go through the program in a year and a half while living at home, and it seems like a much more meaningful line of work than IT, even though the pay isn’t as good. At the same time, there’s always been a part of me that longs to finish my bachelor’s degree in something, preferable a different STEM field than computer science.

That’s my story so far. I hope some of you may relate. Maybe some of you who are younger may even learn from some of my mistakes. Those of you with more experience than I, how would you recommend I proceed? Thanks for reading.

34,"Never told this story before. On Reddit, IRL, or anywhere else. Don't even know if this is the proper place to post it, but I really just need to get it off my chest. I might cross-post it, just because I've never put it into words before and would like to hear some responses.



So, for context I'm a guy. And at somewhere between 11-13 years old, I think I was sexually assaulted. I don't know what this classifies as, cause I've never told anyone about it. Here we go. I know Reddit is skeptical of everything, and I really can't provide proof, but I promise this happened.



So I was friends with this really chubby redhead girl who was like a year or 2 older than me. We weren't like extremely close or anything but we hung out probably once or twice a week, sometimes with mutual friends, sometimes just us. Our parents were actually friends as well, hence why we hung out as often as we did. Our biggest shared interest was dumb early YouTube, comedy videos. 



Well, I never really found her attractive. There were other girls I had puppy love crushes on. Because they had nice hair, or played mario kart with me, sang pretty, yadda yadda yadda. But long story ahort, tbis particuar girl im talming about, i didnt like in that way. AT ALL. Physically, or emotionally/personality wise. She had some annoying qualities (drama queen, underachiever, clingy) and always made fun of me, punched me in the arm, hell, she even kicked me in the balls twice and threatened to do it again when I wouldn't get her a drink or whatever. She was definitely a tomboy. She loved skateboards and converse. She always wore fuckin converse. Even in church. But I could generally look past all this. She was kinda just a fair weather friend, I was a pretty shy kid so I appreciated having someone other than my siblings and this one other boy from church. But she ended up telling me once that she really really liked me. And dreamed and fantasized about me. I honestly did my best (about as good as a 13 or 14 year old kid can) to let her down nicely. She surprisingly took it pretty good and life went on. Things were only mildly awkward between us, and I tried to forget about the whole thing.



Then somewhere between a few weeks, to months later, my parents let me know that we'd be going on vacation with her and her family to South Carolina. We go, things are fine, I sleep on an air mattress in the guest room alone. But on the third day her parents and my parents go out to eat to a nice restaurant for dinner, leaving just her and me alone with only our little siblings. Well evening comes and the younger kids go to bed. 



At some point she suggests that we watch a movie in the lounge/game room (which is next to my room) we start watching some dumb Nickelodeon movie. She says the chairs in the lounge are uncomfortable and we should watch on the air mattress instead. I figured there was no harm in that, so I start dragging it out of my room. I don't know how many of you have used air mattresses before, or even if this is universal to all air mattresses but this one was (A) really fucking dense and heavy, and (B) had 2 layers with a small space in between them. I start dragging it into the game room/lounge and notice the space in between the layers. I jokingly half climb in, then realize I am stuck. I call her over to help me. She comes over, and pushes me all the way in (with just my face left sticking out) then knocks the mattress down from standing up vertically, to down on the floor, like how you'd sleep on it. So I'm facing stomach-up toward the ceiling.



She laughs her dumb laugh and talks about how convenient and hilarious this all is. Then she runs to her room and comes back with a huge bra and lip gloss. She puts the bra on my head, starts putting on her pink lip gloss, and then takes the bra off me and starts kissing me. I'm flailing my head as much as I can, but she is holding me pretty strong. Despite everything, I got kinda aroused from it. Then she sits on top of the mattress with her legs hanging down on either side of my head. She squeezes my head from in-between her thighs. My face is getting real red at this point. Then she starts taking off her converse. And sticking them in my face asking if they stink. PS they kinda did. Then she takes her socks off, and shoves them in my mouth. I did spit them out, but doing it facing straight up with a fat chick sitting on your stomach-chest-abdomen area is harder than it sounds. Also, it should be said that I had like, gotten a few boners, and had the sex talk already, but I was a pretty late bloomer. So I was really new and uncomfortable with pretty much all of this.



If the story stopped there I wouldn't have called this sexual assault, just an embarrassing...thing. but it got worse. She proceeded to deflate the top part of the mattress. So now there is nothing between us but a thin layer of latex or vinyl or plastic rubber or whatever the mattress was made of. She's sitting on me in a cowboy type position. If she wasn't sitting on me, I would've been able to move our of the mattress rather easily. But I was a shorty, and she was a fatty. She can now feel my dick through the material, and she starts rubbing it against herself and moaning lightly. I'm really scared at this point, even somewhat close to tears. Again this sounds stupid now, but try to remember I had no idea then what was happening, or if this was natural or what. Then she slides backwards, onto my legs, and rubs my crotch.with her hand, for a long time. Until I came. That was the first time I had ever cum. She leans forward, pins me down one more time and plants a big wet one on my forehead. Then she runs off to her room giggling. I slide out of the mattress and try to think about all this. I looked at the mess in my pants and didn't know what to think. I went to the bathroom to pee, not knowing what would happen. It was like 9:30 pm now and I realized the parents would be home soon. I didn't understand what had happened, but I knew it made me uncomfortable. And if it made me uncomfortable, it must have been bad or wrong. And I felt embarrassed. So I didn't want my parents to know, so I pulled the mattress back to my room, inflated it and went to bed. The girl never mentioned it again for the rest of the trip, or the rest of our friendship. We moved not too long after that. She still texted me from time to time, but never brought it up.



It wasn't until years later that I realized all that really happened. I don't feel guilty, but I do feel kinda used. Obviously being jerked off feels good physically, but not when you are that young, didn't consent, or don't understand what it means. I don't know why I'm posting this. I'm not really looking for pity necessarily (it's Reddit, I doubt I'd get it anyway haha) I guess just thoughts, people with similar experiences, or someone who could classify this.

This is also especially difficult because I can't decide what I want to do in life, career-wise. And I can tell at work, and when I interact with others, I am not confident in what I say or what I think is a good decision.

It's also pretty bad because I'm prone to making bad decisions, even when I think at the time, I've thought it through. It isn't until I talk to someone that I realize that what I'm thinking isn't the most rational thing to do. I've gotten into messes because of this.

61,"On Friday my Mom and I went to the Gap to do some shopping. She chose this cream sweater like poncho that came in only one size and had 'one size' written on the sales/price ticket. As stated in my title, English is not my Mom's first language and she speaks what others would consider 'beginner English.' And, thus, she's adapted to customary size labels being written on sales tickets such as 'Small or S' or 'Medium or M.' 

Anyhow, my Mom asked a female sales associate whom looked to be about 17 or 18 what 'one size' means, and she stared at my Mom blinking and acting confused, stating that it saids 'one size' on the sales ticket, prompting my Mom to ask her again politely ""but what does it mean?"" The sales associate then responds again ""it's one size. Small or large it can fit anyone."" in a flat, agitated and slightly rude tone. My Mom politely saids 'thank you' and departed for the changing room.

I was very dissapointed in how the sales associate handled the situation and felt sorrow for my Mom whom has shared with only me countless times how embarrassed she is of the fact that she can't speak English properly. Because of the level of English that she speaks, my Mom let's everyone belittle her and ask her more than once to repeat herself due to feeling incompetent. I just turned 20 and can't always be by her side and defend her due to other commitments. 

In the big picture, the sales associate was rude but in a somewhat subtle way as she didn't raise her voice or anything. My Mom is extremely sweet and chalked it up to the sales associate being tired and herself not speaking English properly. I always defend her and speak up for her in such circumstances, and feel that I've let her down this time. 

Does this warrant a complaint to the manager or should I leave it? Also if yes, what should I say to the manager? I suffer from anixiety and low self-esteem, but try to project a tough extrovert image.

64,"Note: I was kind of reasoning to myself while writing this so sorry if it seems to go off on tangents but I'm going to keep everything I wrote to give a little extra info

Some background about me, I'm a straight, white male who attends college about 40 min from home, with one sibling. I was home on Christmas vacation and getting ready to drive back to college. My mother, who had hardly communicated with me at all over the time I was at home, was heating up leftovers. She gave the pasta the she heated up to me and I told her it was cold. She screamed ""eat it!"" at me like I had done something wrong. When I explained to her that I couldn't eat it cold, she heated it up and after a couple of minutes literally threw it on the table.

What is weird is that a few minutes later came back into the room and started talking to me my dad and brother like nothing had happened. I spend most of my time at school and am not home that often. Recently I discovered the importance of self esteem and realize that my mother, in her overprotective and over controlling manner, is a huge barrier to me developing any kind of self esteem. I basically have to act like she's way smarter than and better than me all the time and if I don't she gets upset even if we are just sitting down watching tv. She feels like she has the liberty to treat me, a fully grown adult, like a toddler just because she can. She does the same thing to my brother and even though he obviously resents this she continues anyway and will not listen to either of us when we tell her this makes us uncomfortable. 

The outburst from her came after months of me giving her space and working on my own self esteem, which included focusing in my studies and major, making new friends and asking out girls. I thought she would be happy for me now that I'm becoming more confident in myself. But no. She isn't happy for me and could care less about how confident in myself I am. If she sees that I'm carving out my life and she isn't in control, she thinks I will leave or something. I don't know. It's ridiculous. I didnt complain once during the break. Most parents would be happy that their kid gained some self confidence but not her apparently. 

I really see no way out of this but to avoid my mother for the rest of my life. I can't change her. If she won't be happy for me starting to like myself and stop being so possessive over me then I don't know how I can possibly have a relationship with her. I really believe my mother is not doing this maliciously and truly believes that she is helping me, which is why I think it's so hard for her to face reality. It also doesn't help that I went through mental health issues a few years back (delusions, paranoia and emotional breakdown) that truly scared her and sent her even further into her over-mothering, over protective bad habits. I'm not mentally ill now but the idea that something bad could happen to her son really scares her.

I really don't want to live like this for the rest of my life. My mother is hovering over me, basically telling me ""don't you DARE scare me again!"" I think her biggest fear is losing her child and that is why she is so over protective, and my mental health scare a few years ago really pushed her over the edge to where she doesn't trust me anymore. I love my mother and I know that my depression and other mental health problems were not her fault or anyone else's. But the way she acts now, I literally can't be around her and whenever I try to bring up my frustrations to her she delusionally claims that she is just ""being a mother."" And the worst part is that after I spend time with my mother and go back to college I feel completely emotionally drained, like she just suckered the desire to befriend others right out of me. 

I really want to grow up, become independent, and move on with my life. I want a girlfriend. I want to be able to pursue my dreams and my hobbies. But my mother will go to any length necessary to snoop her way into my life and will voice her opinion on any and all choices I make, whether it's dating, my career or school, and make me think that something awful will happen to me if I don't do the thing that she wants, and she is absolutely convinced that if I don't listen to her then something terrible will happen to me. Just keep in mind she's absolutely convinced of that and will not listen to any logic or reason. Someone please just kind of tell me what the hell is happening.",09Jan2017,2

67,"Okay I need to rant about something

So we have three cats, and two of them like to fight. Toby is the smaller ""victim"" cat and Snow is the bully cat so to speak. however, he is sweet to humans. we primarily let him outside so that he doesn't mess with Toby as much, because he gets tired from exercise.

He was a stray that my mom was feeding for a while behind a local church, and he was friendly enough for a while so we caught him, vaccinated him, and adopted him.

So we went on a trip to Orlando this week as a family. We had our neighbor watch our cats for the duration of our vacation, stopping by twice a day to feed them and play with them. Two of my cats, Luke and Toby, stayed inside the entire time because there was a snowstorm in VA while we were gone. Luke is very old, so he needs to be sheltered from the weather. Toby is timid and usually hides from the other cats.

Snow, being a rescue cat, goes outside a lot during the day and usually comes back at night. My neighbor let him out the day before the blizzard hit to let him exercise for a bit, expecting to let him back in later in the night.

This was on Thursday. It's Sunday, and he still hasn't returned home. I'm worried sick about him. I'm afraid that he's dead or something :( I know that being an outdoor cat for a majority of his life, he is better equipped to handle blizzards more than a human would be, but this is the longest he's ever been gone from home.

I tell my parents how I'm worried about him, and immediately they tell me to shut the fuck up, stop complaining/worrying, and that ""he'll be fine"". They've honestly been in a horrible mood the entire vacation, because they're not really travel people. I appreciate them taking us on vacation, but they've really been in a shit mood ever since we left. Everytime I tell them I'm upset about this situation, they've said ""we don't need to hear this shit today"".


Honestly, what I'm mad about is that they were too goddamn cheap to take him to a kennel, especially if they knew that there was going to be a major blizzard. Am I in the wrong for being upset about this? I've already cried twice today (although I'm also PMSing so that may contribute lmao)

73,"For as long as I can remember, I've always been between friends, often idealizing parts of them, and aspiring to be them. 

But it never lasts longer than a week or two, and after that, I'm completely over them. I barely talk to them, and I find them uninteresting. 

Usually, because I've moved onto the next group of friends that I'm now desperately trying hard to fit into, because I think they're cool, and I want to be like them. Often changing my personality entirely in an attempt to fit in.

As a result of this, I've got a large amount of acquaintances, and very, very little actual, close friends. And also zero friend circles I feel comfortable in. I participate in some circles, but I often withdraw myself for weeks, and then come back to be treated almost like a stranger. 


Unfortunately, the same applies to relationships. I tend to grow bored of my partners quite quickly. It really bums me out. 


I don't really know what's wrong with me. I just want to find some proper grounding. My personality keeps shifting, and I truly, genuinely don't understand who or what I am. One day I'm a cocky, obnoxious weirdo, the next day I'm calm, collected and gentle. It just never ends, and I can't make my mind up.

77,"I met someone online about a month ago. He is straight and has a girlfriend, but we hit it off really well and quickly became very flirtatious as friends. During this time we even got pretty hot and heavy while he was drunk. He was there for me, he was very affectionate and caring that on Christmas eve, he really didn't want me to spend Christmas alone. Come Christmas day his demeanor had somewhat changed and a day later I playfully said that he didn't flirt with me anymore which rolled right into a serious conversation about how he doesn't want to lead me on, be this unobtainable person because he is straight and in a relationship. I understood why and we both agreed that while yea, we had taken it pretty far that it can easily be considered cheating, we were going to stop for the good of the friendship. It hit me pretty hard despite understanding perfectly because I have been having emotional issues and along comes this really nice guy that reaches out to take my hand and be there for me and suddenly, he has taken a step back and become ""a bro"" and I couldn't shake off how alienating the sudden change was.

It has been...not that long since the change, we don't talk as often as we did during that period and just the sudden withdrawal hasn't been taken well by me. I went to him yesterday and told him how I felt which clearly frustrated him because he told me my behavior was ridiculous to expect such things from him when we had agreed one thing yet I feel he shouldn't have just stepped back and expected me to adapt to what seems like a completely different thing altogether. When we were flirting, there was a lot more there than the flirting that if you take out the flirting? There's still a friendship where he is at least more caring and such.

So I've asked for a few days after that harsh reply he gave me while the brunt of it eases and I can decide what I am going to do. I don't want to walk away but I am prepared to do it because it isn't like he's really been there for me like he was before plus the pain of all of this...it gives you less reasons to fight for a friendship.

And before anyone mentions it, I do understand on some level perhaps I didn't 100% respect his relationship (post-flirting) but it is just hard to reach out, take someone's hand and then drop them off a cliff all of a sudden and say ""you understand, I'm sorry"". I want to work it out but I do want other opinions. Yes he sounds like a jerk, but this was also a shitty situation and we both tried to stop it before it went too far but on some level, emotionally, it did. 

Basically, get someone to let you in and grow attached and then push them back. ",09Jan2017,1
80,"Hey guys I dont know the rules of this sub so let me know if I mess up.
(Its long but I tried to write it brief, and the part where I ask for advice is at the end) 

Recently one of my old friends hit me up saying I just popped into his head and all that shit and this past week we've been talking again.
Now the thing is me and this guy have know eachother since 5th(3rd but we werent friends yet) grade and he moved after 6th. tbh I liked him in 6th grade but I was a super desperate 12 yr old and in retrospect he might have been using me for free pizza. So untill maybe summer of 7th grade we talked, texted vid chatted it was super fun and cool until oneday mid convo he ghosted on me. Like never responded and even had the audacity to post an instagram pic a few min later. Whatever I got over it.
Maybe a year later we talked for a bit again, I think I initiated, then again ghosted.
Then AGAIN freshmen year, this dude slides into my dms and starts messeging me idk Why i dont ignore him but I keep messeging him, a few months later I move and my current bf breaks up with me, and so ensues a breif stint of us being a ldr couple for a month. Honestly I agreed to that caus I felt bad for the guy, hes always complaining that hes never had a gf no girls like him blah blah blah.
One day we have a convo it ends with me needing to go. Neither ever initiates another convo and a week later I meet my current bf.
Over the summer I saw a concert that had our favorite acts and it remind me of him so I messeges him, it was just casual convo for the summer (same him talking about how hes single and girls treat him like their bff they talk to all their problems about but never date) but when school started it just ended chill same as last time.
That brings us to now, its been about a week since he messeged me again and has started to flirt again, we both plan on going to college in the state we started out in and Idk I get the feeling he'll try for us to meet up and date officially.

The part where I need advice comes in now, what does he want with all this? Should I give him a chance? Or since I'm the only girl thats really liked him you think thats why hes only interested?

Ps. Some thoughts and explanations on why he does this ghosting and reappearing cycle would be appreciated.

81,"Some history:
my family is very close, and for most of my childhood, it was just me (27F) and my mom and dad.

my dad died this year, and my mom seems unable to do..anything. she was a stay at home caregiver to me, then when i went to school, my dad (who got sick).

i know she drinks a lot, and her friends have absolutely no normalcy or ability to really ""be there"" for her. i think she is in a place of ""what do i live for? well, my daughter. let me put everything on her"" and it translates to her mood being incredibly dependent on how much time i spend with her. if i call, 4 out of 5 times, she is on the brink of tears and tells me she is doing ""terribly"".

ive been thinking about leaving this area anyway, since this town isn't where i've wanted to live, but fear that if i leave, she will have no one. my friend recently told me that she doesnt want to see me wake up 20 years from now still propping my mom and having her not change.

we see each other 3-4 times a week, but i am always the one reaching out to her, making plans, and thinking of reasons to be together cause i feel like it help gives her something to do and look forward to. this is starting to make me feel manipulated.

my significant other and i are planning our life, and are ready to make a step to start settling in to our next big adventure.

do i leave? do i stay? do i owe it to my mom to give up my dream? to move sooner or later? ",09Jan2017,1

88,"I know there's nothing I can do, but I have to get this off my chest. My big brother is in the 4th year of marriage to a woman (M) who I am fairly certain is a psychopath. 

She lies and manipulates constantly. She has almost successfully isolated him from every other member of our immediate family, except my other brother who is studying to be a doctor. She has commented, at least twice and in front of her husband, that she married the wrong brother. She verbally abuses him regularly-she's made him cry and then berated him for it. 

I spied the father's day card she got him. It read ""You're an okay dad. I'd say you're great but you work too much! :)"" 

She has a part-time job in sales. He works 40-50 hours, then comes home and has to make dinner and clean the dishes. She doesn't cook or clean. Their house is a wreck, old bits of food and trash everywhere. He's wrecked twice because he was so sleep deprived coming off a 10 hr shift he's literally fallen asleep at the wheel. 

He once came back from the store and told me he'd been TERRIFIED they didn't have the right kind of butter (he eventually found it). What kind of life is that? Being scared to come home because of butter!?

What makes me think she really might be a psychopath rather than just a raging bitch, is the fact she regularly uses her 4 yo daughter as a tool to manipulate others. 

After years of being alone, my mom finally found a great guy (T) who she ended up marrying. With love in her life, mom stopped going to visit my brother and M as frequently (she was going once or twice a month, driving from NY to VA to stay the weekend). M had the daughter say things on FaceTime like, ""Nana, why don't you come visit us anymore?"" (she said it with a big smile cause she was so proud of herself for remembering what to say). They would often text, ""We want the old Nana back!"" 

My mom had been so lonely and unhappy for so long and when she finally found love and happiness, all M cared about was that she wasn't getting the same service out of my mom. 

The big one, though, is using her daughter (2yo at the time) to get rid of T by saying he molested her. For the record, I am 100% sure it was not T. He is the sweetest, dorkiest man who raised 2 daughters himself. The police investigated and there is security footage which verifies that T was never alone with her, never took her to the bathroom. My mother was ALWAYS present.

Now when your 2yo daughter says someone ""stuck their finger up my butt,"" you should investigate! But after the police cleared T, my brother and M never bothered to consider any other suspects. Even though the child psychologist it was possible abuse did actually occur. I suspect it may have been someone in her family (her father has acted perculiar around the 2yo twice now), but who knows because they dropped it!? 

T doesn't go anywhere near their house anymore which I suspect is what M wanted from the beginning because T would stick up for my brother and my mom and call M on her bullshit. 

My heart is aching for my big brother. This woman is destroying his spirit. She's toxic. And he won't leave. Probably for the kids' sakes.

now, i wouldn't say S.Korea is a country where you have no freedom or individual rights, (as it is not North Korea) but they have 1 year and 9 months of compulsory military service and as a S.Korean citizen i do have to serve or i would get a pretty harsh criminal penalty.

my problem is, i was never patriotic of my country and i lack social skills and introverted. on top of this, i'm constantly hearing horror stories inside the military where soldiers get mentally and physically bullied, committing suicide, lack of sleep, harsh working conditions etc. and the thing that affects me the most is the idea of literally having to live in the military barracks 24/7 (except about 30 days of relieve days a year), not able to do anything i desire (personal freedom is extremely limited in the barracks and stations.) and the idea of having to sleep with other soldiers in a same room. (i am a VERY sensitive sleeper and i'm sure it will be painful to even try sleeping everyday in that environment. would i get used to it? i do not know.)

i am 25 now and by the time i get out of the military i'd be 27. i am also afraid that i'm just wasting my prime years in my 20's in a very closed environment not really achieving anything career/financial/relationship wise. this fact itself makes me get depressed as well.

96,"So. This is super weird.

I am friends with these 3 girls. They are all fairly attractive. I work with one of them on a regular basis, and the other two I tend to see once or twice a week. They are all best friends. The one I work with a lot is the oldest and a year older than me, but I was planning on asking her out, I even asked the youngest, who is 5 years younger than me, if it was a good idea and she said yes. So, I went over to ask her out and she said ""sure but let me talk to (the middle one who is 2 years younger than me) real quick"". She came back and told me to meet her at Panera the next day. I went there at the time she suggested and I was greeted by the three of them all sitting together. This is where it gets really weird. 

They, as a collective group, all want to date me. They were aware that I was into the oldest one, but they also knew that the middle one had a super crush on me, and that the youngest was also starting to be interested in me (as well as our parents wanting us to get together). They decided that if I were to date the oldest, I would first have to date the middle girl for 3 months, then the youngest girl for 3 months, then the oldest girl for 3 months. Only after I have done that will they allow me to date any one of them exclusively.

I was dumbfounded by the idea of it. Why in the world would they think this was a good idea. I don't know what to do now. I really want to date the oldest girl, but they won't let me without dating all three of them, and even though it's a weird situation, I wouldn't be against dating any of them (except maybe the youngest because she just turned 18). I said to give me a day or two to think about it and they were fine with that.

97,"Apoligize in advance for spelling or grammer issues, 

Alright, my wife and I have been together nearly 3 years and married for 1. Things were fantastic, my wife and mother got along perfectly. My wife was happy to have a mother that actually got excited when we announced our now, 1 year old son. All the family members got along, everything was perfect.

My mom and sisters can get a bit baby crazy and can go over bored on shopping for babies. My wife has some pretty bad anxiety I found out and towards the end of the pregnancy she kind of broke down and said we have too much stuff and no room. I had to explain to my mother she had to slow down and she did but, ever since then. My wife has had a completely different attitude towards my mother, things got a little better between them for a while but, there was still this awkward tension.

My son was born and I was so happy, he's perfect. We had a lot of plans fall through though. She was going to work less and stay home with our 2 kids (my new son and a step son) but. Unfortunately rent prices skyrocketed and we can't afford it so, we started looking to buy a house and found our we couldn't get any assistance for the down payment due to my employee stock system through work so, that got put on hold until we can save up the down payment.

We are currently cramp in a tiny 2 bedroom apartment and she complains about being overwhelmed and cramped daily. I've tried everything I can to try to help by reorganizing and such but, it don't seem to be getting any better.

The situation between my wife and mother has hit its worse at time recently. My wife seems to find every excuse to be pissed off at every little thing. Examples include putting my son in a different outfit then what we sent him over in, she got mad when I mother pulled my step son aside and told him, he needed to be a little soon respectful to adults after he told my brother in law to shut up and go away. That was probably the worse of the situation, with out going into to much detail, it resulted in my mother saying she just wasn't going to provide the day care any more if she was going to continue to feel like everything she did was pissing my wife off.

Things are a bit better and my mother will watch the kids if we really need it now but, everything involving my mother still sets off my wife and if getting so tired of being in the middle, my mother has done so much for us paying for the baby shower, providing a beautiful $400 crib, doing a nice candy buffet for our reception that cost a couple hundred and she provides us with daycare and anything else we need but, my wife seems so completely ungrateful for everything and pretty passive and rude for daycare drop offs and pick ups, at this point and it's upsetting my mother and I'm hearing it from both sides. I'm switching work schedules and taking extra days off just to avoid it anymore.

It's so emotionally draining, I've always had a strong close relationship ship with my mother but, I'm constantly having to take sides and try and fix issues.

To me it seems like maybe my wife is so anxious and stressed about our plans falling through that Maybe she's just trying to control the things she still can? I don't know, we both work at the same place so it's really hard for me to ask anyone for opinions or vent and get advice. It also doesn't help and her and my mother can be pretty stubborn.

Also, she mentions the anxiety a lot but, doesn't think she needs any console or medication, how do I help her with it if she dont want to get it professionally? She tells me ill never under stand what it's like and get that it's true but, how am I supposed to help?!

Im thinking about going to counseling myself and hoping she'll agree to come with at some point but, because of the day care situation im trying to work oposite shifts and, I really dont have much time to do so.

I also have a physical disability with problems of mobility with my left leg and need to attend this gym because its close proximity and the exercise physiologist who I have been going to for 3 years.  He has averted his membership being revoked because he has not ""touched me"" - apparently, continuously bumping into me around corners, tripping me up on the stairs, pushing into the equipment I am carrying, flicking his towel at me as he walks by doesn't qualify as ""touching"". Additionally, he has not attempted to verbally communicate nor communicate by social media for over a year, so the gym says their hands are tied and they can't do anything.  But, despite having changed gym times he always finds me and follows me, staring and leering at a discreet distance and if I move out of his sight  he will always find me. In the gym, he displays the following behaviors - grunt/snorts as he walks by/  flings a towel over his head as I walk by / flicks water on me after he has a drink / uses aggressive poses facing me eg akimbo stance - he is approx 195cm height and 110kg / stomps by me / pushes in front of me, follows me to shared locker area, follows me out etc. Then there's the behavior outside the gym - watches me from bushes, cuts in front of me with his car, follows me with his car; he's stood in front of my car at traffic lights and just stared at me until the guy in the car behind got out and threatened him; waits for in his parked car along my route home and suddenly pulls out in front of me, no blinker and sometimes if there are no cars blocks my path etc. I have been to the police twice and they have interviewed him and he has stopped all these behaviors for 6 weeks: same with the gym staff, he stops for 6 weeks with him disappearing for 2 weeks and then back at the gym but keeping away from me.

100,"Hey, so I'm more looking for advice than asking a specific question. I don't know if this is the right place, so if not, please point me to the right subreddit. Thanks!

So I was a sophomore at a very nice university. In my major, the median starting rate 100k a year. So like I was going to make bank. However, I have no work ethic, and I fell into very bad depression and had problems with bulimia, so I eventually started using drugs. 

My drug use escalated very quickly, and I was using hard drugs within 6 months of first using. In my sophomore year, I overdosed, and the school encouraged me to take the year off to go to rehab, and so I did. I have the option of going back, but it requires like a lot of treatment and recommendation letters, and to be honest, I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the stress. 

I started reading about being a stripper, and it seems that girls make quick cash and they can pick their own hours. I'm just not sure I'm the stripper type. I have always been really introverted and shy and have had low self-esteem. I posted a few times to r/gonewild and had positive replies saying I had a nice body. I'm like 5'2 and on meth, I weigh 90 lb but right now I'm like 110. I'm not toned at all because I never exercise. I'm very good at listening to problems though and faking genuine compassion. I heard that's a good skill. I look really young, like I pass as 14. I don't know about the industry but my friend says that they like young girls. 

Anyway I figured I'd make a list of pros and cons.

Pros:

- Can make a lot of money quickly. Why would I need money? Although I'm technically ""in recovery"" for drugs, I do want money to spend on drugs. I won't lie here.
- Learn better street/social skills. I grew up a very shy kid with no social skills. Most of my friends are online friends and I spent most of my high school online and on forums
- Confidence. I don't see stripping as degrading. I feel like I'd increase my self esteem by having people call me sexy or say I'm beautiful.

Cons:

- I have bad anxiety/paranoia about being raped and murdered
- I've never had sex and have never done any like sexual activity besides making out with a guy because I'm really shy
- when I'm drunk, I'm all over a guy 
- My parents and counselor would probably be against it.

We live in a traditional Asian family so they were very strict about sexual subjects.

I do watch porn occasionally and it is just a way to express my desire. Now, I'm very confused and scared. I need to talk to her, but it will not be easy at all. I need some advice to how to speak to her about this. Keep in mind that she is very old fashioned and we never discuss about sex in this family.

I have two BoA in social/political areas and a hard time finding any jobs with them.

Now that I am looking for a Master, I'd like to orient myself less after my own interest and more towards the demand on the job market.

118,"I know this seems obvious. I've seen other users post this similar question and have all been told to ""go for it"" and ""achieve your dreams"" but I'm still not so sure. 
I'm a sophomore guy and I am currently applying to go on foreign exchange to Italy for junior year, however there are some conflicting issues. 
First, my parents thought that they would be able to come and visit me on exchange. After realizing that this was discouraged by the program that I am using they think this would be too long of a time period for me to be away from home. 
Secondly, my good friend of several years moved away a year ago and might be moving back when I would be on exchange. When he moved away I could confidently call him my best friend and after he left I fell into a state of depression. Now he might be coming back right as I leave for a year. I do not want to kill that friendship by not being there.
Thirdly, I am afraid of what will entail me going on exchange. I know this is a cliche that many people experience when leaving home but I don't want my previous life to be ruined by me not being there. I don't want my friend group to collapse if I'm not there and I don't want to negatively impact my chances of getting into a good college by missing part of the application process. I also am not fully confident in myself to live with an entirely different family across the globe. 

At the same time I routinely experience the feeling of wanderlust and don't want to continue this monotonous life that I'm living. Then again my life could improve if I stay… Should I just go for half a semester? I heard you don't get nearly as much out of it. So guys… Year or No Year?

123,"Hey Reddit- hopefully you guys can offer some advice. 

My boyfriend and I signed a lease last year with a friend of ours (JUST one other person). A few months into the lease, he met a girl and she promptly ""moved in""- essentially violating the long term guest clause of our lease. Our lease also forbids subleasing, which will become relevant later. Obviously, my boyfriend and I told our roommate this was unacceptable, and that while it WAS ok for her to spend a night or two over a week, the month long ""visits"" would have to end (this may require some explanation: she was ""living"" in a shithole apartment a few miles from our place and our roommate is rather lazy and didn't want to have to drive out and see her; it was easier for her to stay at our place). Our roommate agreed and said that she would stay over two weeks a month, or alternatively three nights a week every week, the maximum allowed by our lease. 


We agreed to this, albeit hesitantly, because we figured she was going to be over anyways. We also stipulated that she would need to kick in a few bucks to each of us for utilities &amp; food she ate while she stayed over, but were very clear that she would NOT be considered a roommate and that she would NOT pay rent- just to safeguard ourselves against any subleasing issues that may crop up. The agreement about utilities was strictly because this girl is WASTEFUL; she will do stupid things such as turn the heat up to 82 and then run three or four fans. Our bill went up a significant amount when she starting coming around. 

Shortly after this agree to was made, our roommate &amp; his lady friend promptly violated it. Attempts to talk to him about it were met largely with hostility or were simply ignored. Whenever we would confront him, they would do shady shit, like sneak her in while partner &amp; I were at work. She would hide up in his bedroom but sneak down to the kitchen &amp; bathroom, eat our food and make a mess in our house while we were out. We wanted to contact the landlord, but were terrified because our name is on the lease as well and didn't want to face eviction or a fine because of stupid choices our roommate made. We had no idea what to do and our attempts to reason with him were totally futile. 

When it came time to re-up the lease, we sat down and told our roommate that the situation had become untenable, that we were unwilling to live with him any longer because of the disrespect he &amp; his girlfriend had shown us. Shockingly, he appeared understanding and offered to only have her over during the day, etc. He stopped short of apologizing, but admitted that he was worried about violating the terms of our lease as well. Because he appeared to understand where we were coming from, and because our rent is cheap &amp; our place is nice (my boyfriend and I are both students who also hold down full time jobs), we STUPIDLY agreed to re-up the lease for another year. 

A month into the new lease, girlfriend was BACK. Our roommate sent us a text that said, on no uncertain terms, that girlfriend would be our ""secret roommate,"" that she would pay him a few hundred dollars for rent each month, and that there was basically nothing we could do about it. We told him about our concerns, said ""no this won't work, fuck you guys,"" but his response was, quite literally ""well I'M good.""  Shortly thereafter, girlfriend really ~*took ownership*~ of the space, began throwing loud get-togethers, destroying our furniture, etc. we told her no, asked her to leave several times, but she countered that she now paid to live there so we had no recourse. Both her and the roommate pointed out that because we signed the lease with him JOINTLY, we wouldn't have a leg to stand on legally if we went to the landlord and complained, that ALL of us would face eviction, and that basically the choice was his to make. To make matters worse, we can't really call the police to get rid of her, because we're afraid of being branded as nuisance tenants. Roommate's father is also a retired cop, which may or may not play into any situation wherein my partner and I opted for police involvement. 

Basically, we're in between a rock and a hard place, and we're terrified and frustrated. Any advice would be helpful.",09Jan2017,0
125,"This happend 3 days ago.
Basicly we are a group of lets say 14 people, we all like eachother, we are all quite popular or atleast known on our gym, but things have begun getting fucked up lately. our group has sup-groups (since we all live in different cities that are around 20 min away from eachother, the sub groups are those that live in the same cities) my group consist of 4 counting me in. one of them is agianst drugs and largly so since he has been affected by dad (who has had a drug abuse leading him to not remembering a lot of his young life). But he likes us all so he can consent to it happening lets call him Blue. now we have the person i will call red, hes a really nice understanding guy and is in a way a leader in our subgroup in that people (not me tho) follow his decisions most of the time we all like him. Then we have Yellow who is known to be a little fucked up, Yellow and red has been best friends since they were young and have affected eachother quite a bit, he a couple of months ago began taking MDMA and cocaine after being encouraged by some of his (kinda gangster in that they sell weed and other stuff) and has been saying its amazing and we all should try it. hes been taking both weekly since and is now begining to sell for one of his friends. they all smoke daily (not me) and we all smoke weed around every second weekend even blue as he doesn't think of weed as drugs.
now a couple of weeks ago yellow put some MDMA in Red's drink while he(yellow) was high and Red could feel it quite a bit, but in the end he said it was okay with him and they still are best friends (not even getting mad) i thought this was fucked up beyond belief but i let it go, Blue was not at that party and i thought it prolly wouldn't happen agian. Now last friday i came a early to a party one of them were hosting, i came in and saw yellow trying to get red to try a line something he ended up taking. i thought to myself that this isn't my life and its okay. i also found the reason to Blue was not invited to the party (we were even told to keep it a secret).
so at the party i asked if i should host a good time in my room (space for about 8 people) they said yes (4 boys now since we have an extra friend who has been taking drugs at parties for the last week) they said, ""hey lets invite some girls for the last 4"" i said fuck yeah and made a event on facebook. the next day i prepare for it they are all saying its going to be awesome, i took a good 4 hours to move a table into my room move my bed and such. but they never come, i write to them they ignore me (i see them being online on facebook multiple times but never seeing nor answering my questions on where they are) i end up finding out they are sniffing coke agian at one of their houses, they end up saying they will come at 12 (something that is already insanely late) i say ok get your shit together, no answer agian i get really annoyed. say fuck this and go to a party i was invited to down the street get terribly drunk and end up writing to blue (who is drunk at a party with his work) that we need to talk, where he replies go ahead. it being a bad time but he ends up getting it out of me and i say that they have begun taking drugs, i say please dont say my name as i would like to be friends with them still. but him being so terribly drunk ends up saying my name wheres i get a message saying why the fuck i snitch. i ignore it next day i get kinda depressed and said fuck this drug thing and end up trying lean (kodeine and sprite) dunno why and end up having an even worse time. what to do, i dont think i can speak to any of them the next couple of days.
TLDR: I snitched of my friends new found drug abuse to one of his friends who is agianst it. me being agianst drugs end up drinking lean and get it even worse now that all my best friends prolly hate me. what to do?",09Jan2017,0

133,"So a friend of mine stayed with a family friend for about 2 months and went back home for a week at Xmas. When he came back he stayed for about another week which he paid rent for. Then he moved out with a friend. 

Now the woman he moved in  with started demanding 130 dollars for the time over the Xmas he didn't pay for when he was away. Then  she added on 300 for bills, electricity, etc. Then he got a final bill for 700+ for the same things. 

He basically blocked them on Facebook, they're numbers, etc. Then she started texting some of his friends including me saying tell him to contact her or she's taking legal action. He never did and she showed up to his work in a new job. She went to reception and asked for him and he went out. She then proceeded to start screaming at him for the money they're 'owned'.

135,"I haven't gone to college for two years. Now, I can actually concentrate and think (used to be hard due to health reasons, which have been better so far). 

The deadline for classes is coming up and....I don't really seem to want to go to college anymore. My sleep schedule is odd, I have trouble falling asleep, and then when i do fall asleep I knock out straight for either 4-10 hours. There have been some days where I've only gotten 3 hours of sleep.

I seem to be going to sleep later, and waking up later. 

I seem to have lost motivation for things. I'm on Reddit almost all day, or Youtube, or playing video games (this one not really). I used to draw and animate, but lately it seems like it's a waste of my time (I know that I'm wasting my time on Reddit, anyways...).

But it's just that it's easier to get lost in your phone. If someone is on the computer all day, then people hassle them more, than if they were on their phone all day, for the same amount of time, and doing the same thing. Even if it is less time on the computer than you waste on your phone, people automatically see the computer as being...more wasting time? It makes the amount of time spent, more noticeable.

I used to be into animating a bit, but then my mom discouraged me, and now drawing doesn't seem to bring any joy...

*Telling her about a Youtube animation project I was thinking of doing (one minute long)

(the conversation was in spanish)

Mom: Oh, and how many hours are you going to waste on that?

me: W-what?

Mom: How many hours are you going to waste? One hour a day? Two? how many hours is it going to take? 

Me:I don't know, I'm not at that level yet, I'm a beginner.

Mom: Well, how many hours are you going to waste on that?

(spanish speakers help, I'm going to do a rough translation)

Mom: Para que te va a servir? (rough: What use would it be?)

Me: *looking at  my feet* .... 

Mom: Do you know if you are definitely going to be an animator? Is someone paying you to do this? Are you making any money?

Mom: 

(Es una gran perdida de tiempo). It is a big waste of time. how many hours are you going to waste on it? How many hours?

Me: I don't know! I wanted to make something nice for me and my siblings, I...I.... *silent all the way home


This has made me spend all my time on the phone, or, at night, on my laptop. Which is basically my phone, for all that it can do. My 'real' computer is downstairs, PC. It has my drawing software and runs better than my laptop.  Plus, it has my drawing tablet, a Wacom Intuos Pro, Medium-sized. 

Around a week prior to the conversation, I had bought it, brand-new, using money I had been saving for *years. And it's just sitting there, unused. 

I'm not that, that good at drawing, haven't drawn in months, and Disney and other animation studios are many hours away from where I live, so it wouldn't have been possible either way.

I'd like a job where I can make enough money to be able to get my family out of debt, and/or be able to get my relatives (who live in a poor country), enough to make sure they're fed and clothed well, a nicer place to live.  

I just don't know what that job would be. Right now accounting seems to be alright, it's stable, but at the same time I've heard that tax season kills, and you have to work very long, stressful hours. So I'm not sure about going that route.

145,"I'll be turning 18 in the next week. My father passed away four years ago so I'll be receiving his social security check directly to my account when I turn 18 until I am out of high school. My mother stopped working 2 years after my father died and has spent all of the money we've received on not just our bills but many luxuries and hasn't saved any money for me in the future. This has really put a strain on our relationship in the last few years. Not just because of the finances but a few personal issues between us as well. 
I have the opportunity to move to an apartment at the beginning of February and while I would be financially able I would still be living very simply. While I'm sure I could stand to live with my mother for 6 more months I would really like to spend some time on my own and figure things out about myself. I've been going through depression for the last couple of years and believe that space between me and my mother would help me out a lot. Not to mention this apartment is the best deal in my town and I'll never get a chance like this again. Here are the numbers. If I moved out I would be able to save around $3000 in these 5 months for the time after high school. If I stayed with my mother I would be able to save more than double that amount but I'm just not sure if it is worth it to me. I fear I may just be acting too radically or that my reasons for leaving may be irresponsible given the money that I could save. It's very tempting to stay at my mom's place and live in luxury with all of this money. I could really use a new car, but I don't know if that extra cash is worth the discomfort I feel at home.
Extra notes:
-I'm employed, so I will have more money than just the check but I don't make much ($250 a month)
-I will have a roommate come May when me and my friend attend college together so rent will go down eventually 
-Thanks to scholarships and FAFSA pell grants, my college is payed for so I don't need to worry about the cost of school

147,"I major in a STEM-related major (I'm NOT from the States and my major is not Engineering lol although it's something equally is ""lucrative"" here). I'm a Year 2 student and I have been performing very poorly since Year 1. Recently, I failed one of my exams.

My parents are naturally angry. Last semester, I got two Ds and they said that if I get anything below a B-, I will have to pay for my tuition fee and then now this happened. My parents are paying for my tuition fee (it's not expensive here compared to the states) and they said that they are wasting their money on me (which is kind of true). I know that I picked the ""safest"" major that I could pick but with such bad grades, I think the degree will be pretty ""useless"" for me.

I am thinking about switching majors. Fine Art seems appealing. I know that many Americans dismiss Fine Art degrees as useless (as you don't have to have a degree to find an art related job) and it is the same case here. I am hence thinking about dropping out of uni. If I change my major, I will have to study for two additional years.

To make things worse, my mom just saw this student magazine I took home half a year ago. It had a class photo from last year and I wasn't in it (the truth is I must have missed the photo event). My mom is furious and she sees it as a sign that I have no friends (the truth is I am kind of reclusive and I only have two friends in my major) and that I don't give a shit about what is going on around me (which is kind of true).

148,"I'm 19. These past months I've been realizing just how pathetic I am. You see, it stared when I googled ""why don't women like nice guys"". Looked at answers on Reddit, Quora, Yahoo Answers etc. The answers I saw really hit me. Most of them said that nice guys are really just weak, pathetic people who's kindness is the only thing they can offer. That most of them are just creepy, boring cowards who think they world owes them because they're nice. It became obvious why women don't like nice guys. It's because they come off as desperate and weak. It made me realize how horrible a person I am. I've hated myself since realizing this. I understand most women go for confident, loud men who can take care of them. Alpha males. I'm anything but. 
I'm not alpha at all. I'm not a leader. I'm not loud or cocky. I have trouble standing up for myself because I am physically weak. I'm very boring and emotionless. I'm pretty sure to most people I come off as creepy and uninteresting. I can see why a women wouldn't be interested in me and I hate myself for it. You say ""why not work on your confidence and become alpha"". Well that's because that's just not me. I hate being loud and cocky. I don't like being a jerk to people. I always treat people nicely (at least, I try too) because I know how it feels to be bullied. When a person makes a lame joke and nobody laughs, I'm the one who at least chuckles because I don't want to make the person feel lame. I've been in that position and it hurts.

I'm siding more with my father on this as I'm not sure at least from the information that I've picked up. I think this started a couple of years ago, when my mother joined this church that I think is a cult, at least from what I've read online, my father disagrees with most if not all of the teachings from this church as do I. She spends a lot of time there, as well as money. With that said, she thinks he's living a secret life outside of when she's not home, and that he's cheating on her and how he doesn't do a lot around the house(untrue). A lot of these accusations stem from her receiving this other people gossiping and telling her this as truth. I think it's bs, and I have no idea what their agenda is.

I really don't want them to get a divorce. They're both in their early 50's. I think I plan on telling my brother and sisters, so we or I could intervene. Many of the things she's saying feels far outlandish, like what a paranoid, crazy girlfriend acts when she thinks any sense when you're not in her view means you're cheating. ",09Jan2017,1
155,"Hi!  I'm a 20 year old male living in the United States.

I started numerous online dating accounts for fun and I'm quite dissapointed to find out that I've had received a hello or wink many times from almost all counties but from the ones I like such as morroco/ Tunisia/Algeria/ Egypt...

I like Arab girls and when I send hellos, virtually all of them don't respond.

Could you know maybe why?


Is it because I'm so young?

I look younger than what my age is?

I'm an American ?

To be honest I'm not ""ugly"" but I guess I don't have the looks they are used to and their families would accept.

And it's not because I'm not a Muslim. They even ignore me without seeing my profile .

158,"Hey, I'm a 13 year old boy and a freshman in high school. I know when thinking about the title and the fact that i'm in high school, i may seem too young, but that is a function of the fact that I skipped a grade and so I am a grade ahead than normal kids of my age. Due to this, I am much smaller than the kids in my grade and as such they see me as a young kid and not as an equal and I am usually called cute and innocent like I am a small child. In my struggle to try and act more like them, I have had trouble making friends. Since the beginning of the year I have bounced around different groups, but none truly feel right to me. The group that I'm currently in is nice and all, but I feel like I don't have much in common with them. Another thing that sets me apart from the other students is my experience with ""romantic things"". I am in high school and I have never kissed or dated a girl before. I know that there are other students who have never done these things before either, but I always feel alone. I feel like if I were able to do one of those things, that I would fit in more. So basically I have liked this girl for a while and we've talked before, but she always sees me as a young kid so nothing ever happens and my ""friends"" always tease me about it. This has been happening since school started and I am becoming increasingly depressed and I have trouble sleeping because I cry about the situation at night.

Sorry about the long story but I was wondering if any of you has any advice on how to feel more accepted amongst the other students.

Thanks

159,"So real quick, I live in Illinois, a few years ago my wife's younger sister was in a bad accident. She is now completely disabled. Can't speak and generally has very little to no motor control. 

During these several years, I have only known the story that they tell for their charity events. During this Christmas my father in law got hammered and started crying as we( my wife and i) were talking about her sister. He went into the true story of what happened. Shocked and appalled my wife begins to cry and became angry. She yelled and grabbed her stuff and left me there. Eventually she came back and picked me up. 

We've spent maybe 2 weeks talking about little coincidences. Like after a charity event the in law parents splerge and buy things for their children and grandfhildren. They also run their own small 12 employee business so I always chocked it up to them having a great week. My wife opens up that she knows about them dipping into the charity to cover the business or expenses they need to help.

Then this one hit me, over the budget problems il is having I am talking with one of the at home nurses who is afraid that the state won't pay her. It puzzled me when the parents brag about running a business and taking care of their disabled child in public at this event. 

So my wife did some recon this weekend and found documents that her mom, her dad and another adult sibling are all being paid by the state of IL as nurse caregivers. All of them working over 40 +hours a week. The other adult is going to school full time and not caregiving. 

So... what do I do? Can I be a whistleblower to the state level revenue service or is this just a game of hearsay ?


TL;DR : drunk in law at Christmas admits to lying about traumatic events to now disabled daughter. Wife and I believe they are defrauding the state out of taxpayer money and general public with a charity. Charity may be used as a personal piggy bank.

Contrary to what you might think, the person in question wasn't exciting. Rather, they said ""She's kind of funny and sarcastic to talk to, but she just doesn't *do* anything. She doesn't do anything outside, she doesn't have any hobbies, etc.""

The whole time, I was listening thinking ""They could literally be describing me"".

I love video-games -- I don't play much anymore, but definitely have had kind of a life-long obsession -- but beyond that, I honestly don't know how someone would even describe me.

Right now, I work, and just try to pay off bills while socking money back. I don't really *enjoy* doing things outside, I feel like I'm lost much of my sense of humor over the past year, and I feel like I'm just too tired or broke to really do anything.

What's more, I can't say I really even *want* to do anything.

I mean, if I had a crystal ball, sure, I wish I had more time off work, was magically in better shape, and knew how to skateboard. But I'm overweight, *don't* know how to skateboard, and not sure I actually *would* skateboard, even if I knew how (plus, I can't imagine many people in their late-20's or early-30's are skateboarding, enough to actually meet anyone).

164,"WARNING: long post, emotional typing, really messed up and in desperate need of advice. Hoping that I'm expressing myself clearly but I doubt it.

I'm in a tough spot and I have absolutely no idea what to do. 

Backstory: my best friend is one of the most interesting and most intriguing people I've met. I love her dearly and there is nothing I wouldn't do for her. If there are soul mates for friends she's definitely mine. My life is better because she's in it. I really love her. She's extremely private and she doesn't show emotions often if at all, except when it's just me and her. I'm one of two people that gets too see her vulnerable side. We are brutally honest with each other. 

Unfortunately Last year we got into a major fight. It was brutal and we didn't talk or hangout for a good portion of last year. We both were hurting and individually going through some tough times. 

In November we started hangout again. Slowly but surely rebuilding our friendship.

She's been acting funny. Kinda hard to explain but she was just acting like something was bothering her and she was trying so hard to ""act normal"". 
Because of our fight and us now working on it I thought she might not have been ready or was having second thoughts and I started taking things personal. Little comments, not hanging out, slide glances and what not. I gave her space and I was trying to be understanding. I started getting irritated and mad cause she wasn't communicating with me. 

Then 2 weeks ago she all of a sudden got super clingy! She had to call and make sure I was going to be wherever we were going to hangout that night. Very out of character for her. I was so confused and frustrated. I finally lost it and vented to my husband about it (our spouses are best friends as well and have been for 30 years). I was yelling and completely losing control.  My husband looked at me and I stopped for a moment and we just stared at each other for a long time without talking. 
He looked defeated and broken. He said he was sworn to secrecy and he never ever breaks a promise but he felt like he had to. He proceeded to tell me that a few weeks ago when him and I decided to stay in and have ""us"" time instead of going to a party at a friends house something happened to my best friend. 

Oh my God...I literally can't breath right now, crying so much my head hurts. 

He told me that everyone was drinking and her husband passed out and she ended up passing out as well. Better to stay then drive drunk. 

In the morning she felt her husband waking up, he was cuddling her from behind, started kissing her and she was naturally responding to it. 

But when she opened her eyes she didn't see her husbands face. She saw our mutual guy friend instead. He was raping her. He's married and his wife is in the next room asleep!!! He crawled next to my friend and started touching and kissing her...then proceeded to rape her. 

Now please understand, she was asleep, she was hungover or whatever and naturally assumed it was her husband. She engaged because she thought it was her husband. When she opened her eyes and realized it wasn't...this MOTHERFUCKING RASPIEST looked her dead in the eyes and then started to sexually assault her. She just shut down. She just laid there realizing what was happening but just checked out mentally which is actually very common in rape situations. So he finishes, gets up and walks out the room and goes back to his bedroom and to his wife. I don't know anything else after that. 

She is obviously traumatized, ashamed, feels like it's her fault because she was responding thinking it was her husband. 

So after telling me this, I'm then instructed not to tell anyone! To act normal! When we see him and his wife I have to act like I know nothing! I can't comfort her, I can't talk to her about it I can't do a god damn thing!! 

Now here's where I need help, WTF do I do? I want to respect her and her husbands wishes on keeping it private and also keep my word to my husband that no one will know that I know because only the three of them know but she doesn't know that  my husband knows. But her husband understandably needed his friend to talk to. So with all of that....WTF! 

Based on the little info that I was told, they decided together to not do anything right now. Being in a similar situation I completely understand! She's still in shock. Her husband is simply respecting her wishes. Trust me if he could he'd react!!!! But she asked him not to. I'm not sure why they are choosing to still ""pretend"" to be friends with him. And I can't ask. I have so many questions with no answers available. 

I want to be there for her because I know what's she's going through. I want to kill that asshole and just physically hurt him to the point of almost being dead then let him heal just to do it again over and over. But I can't, I can't do anything. 
I see the hurt in her eyes, I see her and her husband suffering together. I see him pulling her closer to him now. I see the look of being scared when that asshole is around. I feel her tense up. I'm picking up on everything and I'm still expected to see this and stand next to this piece of shit and have a beer and ""act normal"". 

Not trying to make this about me but I really need help. I need advice on how to get through this. Should I do something? Should I hire a hit man (joke) what should I do!!

Being a rape victim myself this situation has brought back all those emotions I went through while I was dealing/healing through my experience. 

I haven't slept, I cry for her and me a lot, I can't eat because I'm nauseous and I am falling apart. I'm torn! I want to react, protect, fix, heal her, kill him and so many things going through my head. 

I'm an emotional mess and I can't talk to anyone in my life about it. This is so hard and frustrating and just torture. 

Any advice???",09Jan2017,2

The guy started a regiment of 100+ irroneious emails/texts/video chat messages a day. Basically a micro-manager on steroids. The things he'd ride me about where so pointless I'd ask if he just wanted to do the job rather than ask me if I did it everyday, because me revisiting if I had done it or not, literally took just as long as getting it done in the first place. It progressed and progressed and progressed to the point where the people working below us were contacting, not my Dad, but his wife because they knew my Dad wasn't doing anything about the obvious harassment. My Dad had been contacted by me, every couple of weeks saying that I couldn't handle the stress of being ridden for no good reason and that I felt like it had become harassment. I was basically told that he's more valuable to the company than me and that was that. The tension eventually broke and to preserve my already strained relationship with my Dad, I quit.

Eventually something happened, and I questioned my faith to the point at which I decided I had more evidence suggesting there wasn't a God than evidence suggesting there was one. This is when I made the fatal mistake.

I dropped contact.

At first they thought maybe my phone died so I was ignoring their texts and calls, but then I stopped showing up at Church. I go to school with some of them, so they know I'm alive and still in the area.

A few of them have approached me individually, and I hate talking to them. They aren't bad people by any means, I just don't feel like I get along with them, and wanting to leave the friendship is something that I don't have to justify.

But if I don't, then they might think something is wrong with me, or that they've upset me.

198,"**TL;DR** My best friend thinks I told a girl he's seeing that he wouldn't see her if she weren't good in bed. I didn't and he doesn't believe me. What do I do?

My best friend is seeing this girl who really wants to be in a relationship with him, but he doesn't want a relationship because he claims he wants to fuck whoever he wants. His past relationships have ended after years or months because of the arguing, and I was always there at the end.

He's been sleeping with this new girl since October/November and even though they're not in a relationship the arguing has already started. He's been telling me that she's really naggy and annoying, and needs to grow up, and that he's told her hundreds of times that he doesn't want a relationship. She came to me complaining about why he was being so horrible, and I tried to be nice and as impartial as possible and tried to help her see that she should move on and find someone who wants to be with her. They fight every other day, she threatens that he'll never see her again, then they hang out and fuck.

I fell out with her in late December because a couple of months before, I oversaw her and my friend talking on Facebook about how she wanted him to buy her a new phone for Christmas, and he said no. Then she laughed and said that I would buy it for her. When I questioned him what she meant by that, he said it was because he'd told her I thought she was hot, which I'll admit she is. Because of that she thought of me as a pushover and he wouldn't let me confront her because he didn't want the hassle of an argument.

When she called me to complain about him one night, she asked me if I wanted to help her get out of the whole situation and get back on track with her modelling career. She said she knew I was a photographer, and said if I wanted to see her half naked, I could do some lingerie shots to help her with her portfolio. Naïvely, I thought this was a genuine request, but wanted to run it by my friend. I told him it was weird, but asked him whether it was ok, and he kicked off at her. She then told him that she planted it into conversation to trap me because she knew she couldn't trust me. So I told her to go fuck herself. Shame on me right?

Anyway, fast forward to today after having not spoken to her since that phone call. My friend confronts me and says that she told him, that I'd said to her that were she not good in bed, he would've left her. He calls me slimy and says that it goes against the bro code, and it's a dick move. I agree that it is all of those things, but I never said that, and no matter how many times I try to tell him, he won't believe me. The only times I've spoken to this girl privately are all on Facebook messenger, and the one phone call where she offered the photo shoot. All other times, he's been present.

The annoying part is that he has said that to me, when I've asked him why he continues to see this girl who winds him up endlessly, he responds with ""she's good in bed"". So he thinks I've told her because he told me. I don't know what to do, or say to make him see that I'm not lying.

P.s. my family is more on the side of me living in england with them

I have a neighbor (upstairs apartment) who is a severe alcoholic, getting blackout drunk sometimes by noon. Two days ago he did so in the bathtub while the water was running, at quarter past midnight. It leaked down into our kitchen, ruining the ceiling and the floor below has begun to warp. We raised our concerns with the landlord, and he excused the neighbor by saying he works very hard to pay his rent. The landlord is always making excuses for this neighbor, to the point where he seems more concerned about keeping him around than the problems he's been causing. We aren't sure what to do, as we're worried he may blackout again while cooking or smoking, and we know that he and the other neighbor upstairs have taken down all the smoke detectors.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I can't afford to move right now, so whatever I can do to safeguard my family and I would be greatly appreciated.

225,"tl;dr: My new roommate is wants to be my friend but I'm really not interested in that kind of relationship, and he has already used my things and eaten my food.

A bit of backstory: my apartment complex is responsible for assigning a roommate to the other bedroom in my apartment. Last semester, the apartment complex was unable to place me with a roommate so I lived alone for those few months and loved it. I really prefer my privacy and peace &amp; quiet, and don't want to be buddies with my roommate or really interact much at all besides friendly hello's when coming and going.

After I left in December for the holidays, I got a call from my apartment complex saying that I had been assigned a new roommate that was moving in that day. I had left a bit of a mess in the kitchen with dirty dishes and things like that, and promptly texted my new roommate to let them know that I was sorry for any mess and would have cleaned it up had I known beforehand that he would be moving in. He said it was no problem and we wished each other happy holidays - all good.

So yesterday I came back to the apartment and finally met him. He's an older guy in his late 40's going through a divorce and going back to school to get his degree. He was nice and very talkative, which is fine, but I'm not a very social person with strangers. We chatted for a few minutes and he expressed that he wanted me to meet his son who also plays guitar and could teach me some things. While I appreciated the sentiment, I'm really not interested in getting to know him/his family or taking guitar lessons from him; I just want to chill out in my room when I'm not at school or hanging out with my friends. He told me he likes to cook and asked me what kind of foods I like. I told him I'm a very picky eater and generally will just do my own thing for meals. He said he understood but still wanted to know if there was anything I particularly liked/disliked in case he made it. I told him a few things, at this point just trying to be done. I politely excused myself to take a shower and rest since I had just arrived back from a trip to NJ, and I didn't get a good look of the apartment at that time. He knocked on my door a few times to ask me random questions about computers, what kind of food I like, how to let people through the car gate, etc. I was friendly but was getting annoyed with the constant interruptions. I was just ready to go to sleep and ended up doing so around 6. He knocked on my door again around 8 or 9 to ask if I wanted a snack because he had cooked some food; I was exhausted so I ignored him because I just wanted to be alone and didn't want to deal with it right then.

This morning I woke up and went into the kitchen/living room area to find it a mess. Coffee grounds on the counter, beer stains in the refrigerator, and one of my butter knives stuck to the counter. He also used a bunch of my dishes/utensils, used my laundry detergent, and ate some of my food. Additionally, when I first walked in the apartment the day before, it smelled heavily of cigarette smoke. I know that I left the apartment in a mess when I left, but I would never have done that if I had known he was moving in. I gave him a heads up that I was coming but he I guess he didn't bother cleaning up anything (or if he did, he did an abysmal job).

I can sympathize with what he's going through with his divorce and he's a nice guy, but I didn't sign up to be his friend and I have no interest in doing so. That may sound heartless or mean, but it's simply the truth. He's told me a few times now that he made food last night that's in the refrigerator and may cook for us tonight. I appreciate what he's doing, but I really don't want his food and don't want him to bother cooking for me or continue offering me his food. I just want to have my own things, eat my own food, and peacefully coexist in the same apartment. I know that I'm not entitled to have the apartment exactly how I like it since we both pay for it (separate leases), but I do have some basic requests:

1. I don't want him using any of my belongings (dishes/utensils, laundry detergent, etc.) without asking me
2. I don't want him smoking in the apartment
3. I don't want him to leave the common area messy after using it
4. I don't want him eating/drinking any of my food/drinks

I wrote out a letter for him and printed it out but I've been hesitant about giving it to him. I don't want to start off on the wrong foot, but I also don't want things to continue in this direction. Is this letter appropriate and/or reasonable? Am I being a baby here or are my feelings justified? I'm feeling lost because I've never been in a situation like this so I would appreciate any advice you guys could give.

I am looking to attend graduate school, and if accepted, will be moving out of the place my gf and I both currently live at for the next two years. Ideally, for a lot of reasons, my gf and I want to maintain living together during this time as I may end up having to move across the country.
We have talked about this extensively and the only way we can keep living together is if her job allows her to take on a remote position for (at the least) the next two years. She is a graphic design artist for a major clothing company, has worked at her company for over five years now, consistently receives positive reviews, raises and promotions, regularly works from home one day a week every week (so it is possible she can do her entire job remotely), and has recently made herself more instrumental by taking on extra work at her job after a coworker switched departments. All in all, a great and skilled employee.
She has a performance review scheduled a month from now which is near the time I should start hearing back from grad school programs. We were discussing the best way she could broach the topic of working remotely for the next two years with her boss at this time. I do not have a whole lot of professional experience in this matter so I was hoping that more seasoned redditors could share some advice and insight.
I was thinking that instead of asking for a raise and promotion at this review, she could ask for a remote position (while also explaining the personal importance for her to stay with a long term bf so it's not seen as asking for a remote position just because it'd be nicer to work from home. I think her employer may take her request more seriously and reasonably if it is under the idea that this would be an accommodation for a major event in her [our] lives). She wants to ask for a remote position as well as a raise, which I think could be useful as it gives her a chip to concede in the conversation (and potentially, she may end up getting both things) but I wonder if this may be perceived negatively as over reaching.
Thanks in advance for any advice or personal accounts of having asked for and received remote positions.",09Jan2017,1

I'm a 21 year old male and I finally have a job where I can afford to move out. I found the perfect studio, and applied. Unfortunately, I was denied. I've looked into other places, and the landlords Ive talked to told me to not bother applying. When I was 18, I made a horrible mistake. I was incredibly intoxicated and I walked to the local gas station to purchase cigarettes. It was 3am, and the store was closed. Instead of returning home empty handed, I threw a conviently placed brick through the glass door and took the two packs of cigarettes I had intended to purchase. Inevitably, I was caught, arrested, and charged with burglary. I had never had any legal trouble before, and this was a nonviolent crime. So I was eligible for my county's drug court program. I completed the treatment court, payed my restitution, and thus the charge against me was dropped. Officially, I was never convicted and I never took a plea. I've been clean and sober for over 18 months, I work full time, and I'm taking night classes at the local community college. I am happy with the direction my life is headed, and Im completely different person than the kid who committed the terrible crime. My family is happy with me as well, but I'm the youngest child and my parents want to finally live alone.

So my question is... how do I find housing that isn't terrible when I committed a felony crime relatively recently? I don't really know what else I can do.

A man has been approaching my fence with a stick and banging it against my fence trying to get a rise out of the two dogs.  One of the dogs is especially large and is pretty scary when it is in a full bark.  

I found out after the first incident that the man was from a dog training outfit somewhere near town.  I could not track down what company though.

Today he showed up with a video camera and was trying to provoke the dogs again.  Banging and waving his stick at and over my fence. My neighbor watched the ordeal and told me the man was speaking to the video camera saying that these dogs were killers and that someone was going to be seriously hurt.  

My GF saw this guy and ran to get me.  I ran outside and yelled at him.  He left without even looking at me or acknowledging me.

I ran back in and threw on some pants under my housecoat and ran down the street to catch up with him.  When I got to him he acted like I was some kind of terrorist.  I tried to stay calm and ask him why he was provoking my dogs.  He kept telling me to show him my hands and make no sudden movements kind of thing.   He seemed very certain that I was going to do him some kind of harm.  All the while being nice and loud for his video camera.

I ended up yelling some  curse words at him and leaving him be.   but I am still quite rattled by the whole thing.

What should I do if this guy comes back.  I can't beat the guy, he's twice my age.  I wasn't able to reason with him either.

I feel like this guy is either trying to get some B-reel footage for his dog training business or he maybe tries to dupe people into false assault charges.

259,"Hi dear people,

I apologise in advance for a (very) long post, but I want to frame the story well in case you can help me out. For the last 7 years, I have been traveling for work and pleasure quite a bit, at least once a month. Earlier in 2016 (April, to be precise), my travels brought me to a country in Eastern Europe for a month, and I met a wonderful girl whom I've been building a relationship ever since. Cheerful, smart, funny, and beautiful, she really hit home. At the time, I was coming out of a rocky relationship that cost me a lot of headaches, so it was hard for me to even think of getting into a long-distance thing with Maria (let's call her that); she stood by me and grew in me to a point that she's my first thought every morning and my last every night. We've been seeing each other every month, Skyping, chatting, and I've been able to spend 2 months in July-August in her country. We're a happy couple, with the difficulties of distance.

Luckily, I've just been able to come to her country for 2 months again. Imagine, two months together, full of adventures. My arrival coincided with Maria's return from a month-long trip alone to Australia. It was a beautiful experience for her; empowering, and as she puts it, life-changing. She arrived on 5 January; I arrived on 7 January.

Along her travels in Australia, she had voiced to me how much her trip had allowed her to think and take time to re-assess her life. See, Maria has been living with her father her whole life. Her mom passed away a few years ago. She's 28, and she's never really been on her own, so a month away all by herself must have been an incredible experience (tough at first, but eventually enlightening.) Since I've travelled so much, I've been able to reassure her when she's felt bad, and to give her courage when she felt weak. Through Skype, we'd spend hours talking and going through each challenge she found. And thus the time came when she felt empowered; with a few days left in Australia, she began falling in love with the country.

Coming back home was rough for her. It's an extremely, with long hours of darkness. Thankfully, I thought, she's got great friends who love her dearly, and I'd be here too. But the longing for Australia is hitting her particularly hard; she's been talking about moving there, she's absent-minded, and with me, she's not the cheerful girl I've known.

People close to me say it's a case of post-travel blues, and surely I understand that; I've suffered it myself. But my instinct tells me she's having a rougher time than I ever have after travelling. She questions her life, her living with her father, her job, her future... she questions herself. As her boyfriend, I've tried to give her as much support as possible, without invading her space. I respect her need for intimacy, while trying to remind her that sadness is normal and acceptable, and that she should honor the thoughts she's having. And yet I can clearly see the idea brewing in her mind is eating her brains out, chewing her from the inside.

For those of you who have been in this situation: has anyone been able to help you overcome this feeling? If so, what were things they did well? What did they do that was not useful? 

Any advice would be wonderful. I've never asked for advice on Reddit, but I'm lost, confused, and frankly slightly worried. I guess I'm asking for advice for Maria, but deep down I'm asking you to help me out too.",09Jan2017,1

264,"Hey everyone. 

It's kind of a long story but I'll keep it short as much as I can. 2 years ago I followed this young lady on Twitter. There was no name of her on profile. She always tweed somethings about art movies and other intellectual stuff -I know, it's too much superficial- Anyways we talked through Direct Messages on Twitter. After 1-2 months she deleted her profile on Twitter. After this happened I was looking for some people to have conversation with just like I did with her. Last May she came into my mind. I found an old account of her on anonymous chat site which I visited before. I googled her profile picture on that anon-chat website. Found another account of her in a web-site which sells accessories for pets. I created an account and send message to her. ""We haven't spoken much but I really enjoyed our conversation. How are you? What are you upto ?"" I said. One month later she replied. She said she uses Facebook. She added me. Said that she was surprised and appreciated my effort. Since than she often likes my photos and the post I share. Sometimes I send a message but her respond is always late. 

I thought she is busy and didn't do anything. The thing is I started to think about her lately. Not something like ""Oh how beautiful she is"". It's like ""What's she is busy with?"" kind of thoughts. I want to talk with her but I have deep concerns about she might not wanna talk. What will I say ? Something like ""Literally we don't know each other and I don't have any romantic feelings about you but I always thinking about you because I'm hell of obsessive maniac"" ? I don't even know her name -_-

I feel disturbed about this. Am I overthinking about this issue? Please advice me.

268,"**Wall of text incoming. TL;DR at the bottom. Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me.**

I've been working at my current company for well over two years. I'm in marketing, a career path followed out of desperation in an attempt to purge myself of the curse of college loans and credit card debt. Far from a dream job, but it pays the bills (plus, I'm now debt-free).

Before I dive into my issue, I want to preface it with this: the company I work for is actually pretty great. The owners are *incredible*. The benefits are quite good, the pay is better, and the culture is excellent. For most people, this would be a top-shelf place for a long-term career, especially if you thrive in a small-company environment.

My problem is with my boss. The owners of my company hired my him to expand their suite of services. I was among those hired by my boss to help him grow the new division. At first, it was exciting -- I couldn't wait to be part of a team, to learn so many new things, to actually help build something out of nothing. That feeling quickly faded.

Over the last two years and four months, I've lost nearly every ounce of respect I have for my boss, as well as any desire I ever had to continue a career in marketing.

He often arrives late, leaves early, and takes extra PTO days *far beyond* what the company offers.

On multiple occasions, he's intentionally deleted important emails I've sent him without reading them, despite my need for clarification or guidance.

Typos in emails to clients are the norm (including misspellings of the company name).

During work hours, he'll dedicate his time to his own personal freelance projects, even when the rest of the team could use his help.

When we come to him with questions, we frequently get non-answers (""Uh... I'd have to Google it.""). 

When we were at our smallest, he actually refused to work on one of the accounts because he didn't like the way the client talked to him, basically leaving me alone to manage all aspects of a relatively large (and high-maintenance) account.

It never feels like he wants to help, and when I've expressed the strain I'm under -- how thinly stretched I am -- he does nothing to help me find a solution other than assess whether we can afford to hire more people. But all I really need is for him to actually, you know, do something. Because of this, I'm frequently scoped with work outside my paygrade.

He's admitted himself that he's bad at HR and management. The fact that he's said this to his employees absolutely astounds me. 

On more than one occasion, he's missed incredibly important client calls. His ""sell first, learn it later"" attitude has left me in many less-than-desirable scenarios over the years.

I could honestly keep going on and on and on, listing specific examples for all of the above, but I think you get the idea.

I feel I'm at a breaking point. Because I feel I can't directly confront him with problems I have, I'm left to bottle up my feelings -- something I'm bad at. This makes me seem grumpy, frustrated, and annoyed at work, which I am, but it's something I don't like having to deal with, nor do I like coming off that way.

I don't like feeling this way, and working here literally has me feeling depressed. I'm overeating and overspending because of it.

My co-workers and subordinates see his negligent, unprofessional habits. I just wonder if the owners see it as well, because they recently promoted him.

So... how do I approach this? Do I confront him? Do I go over his head? Do I quit? If I find another job, I don't think I want to work in marketing again... it feels like what I'm doing isn't really making a positive difference. But won't being unemployed for a while hurt my chances at finding another gig?

**TL;DR** - Work for a great company, but my boss is the antithesis of what a good boss should be. Makes my work life miserable and I can't respect him. What do I do?",09Jan2017,3
269,"So a little background, my IRL friends met this guy and started talking to him online about a year before I started talking to them as a group online. They met him in an online game or something. He's a pretty decent guy when he's not being toxic but that's just the problem. This guy is hateful to everyone but our one friend half of the time he's around. He's openly said that our one friend is the only one of us he truly likes and regardless of how nice we are to him he wants to go out of his way to be rude and a general dickhead to us. What makes this even worse is he mostly dislikes me for some reason. I am nothing but nice to the guy but he goes out of his way to try to not include me in things or make things worse for me or just generally be an asshole to me. I want to be friends with the guy considering there's no getting rid of him but he's such a dick for no reason to me. What do I do?",09Jan2017,1

275,"I'm in a situation that's unique, to say the least. I've discovered, with definitive proof, that my dad is cheating on my mom. I found the lady's name, number, work, husband, children, house, times that they usually meet, and an established timeline of how long they've been together (very infrequently, over 2 football seasons).

Here's where the situation gets weird. I'm a 22-year-old dependent, living at my parents' house. My business, which is just starting to become successful, makes a about a third of its money from dealings with my dad's company. On top of that, my mom's birthday is coming up on the 15th. 

I don't know what to do with this information without pulling on a thread that will surely unravel all of our lives. I also don't want to ruin my mom's birthday with this. 

My company has employees and contractors that are dependent on their income from me, to varying degrees. If I handle this incorrectly, I could cost good people a lot of money.

My parents are both flawed, but good people. My dad has done nothing but good for me and the whole family, as well as my and my sister's friends. My mom is just as good as him. They are both incredibly nice and giving. It almost seems out of character for him to do this, but the proof is nigh-undeniable.

I don't really know what you guys could say to help me with this. I guess I just need to talk to someone before all of this inevitably goes down.

276,"Hi there,

I've been on a student exchange in Japan for the past 5 months, and still have another 5 months ahead. Lately I've just been feeling extremely homesick. I used to have so much fun with my friends in my home country, and I miss those times dearly. I do feel I've already grown a fair bit in these 5 months, as a person and in terms of personality growth. In addition, my Japanese has improved a ridiciulous amount since I came here (I can comfortably manage conversation, just not things too in-depth like philosophy, and also lectures at school I don't understand yet).

Overall I just feel like I'm not enjoying myself here. I have friends but I don't feel close to them at all, I dread waking up for school every morning, often cry and just feel terrible, and as if I have no energy all the time. In addition, the class I'm in at school is just terrible. Nobody talks to me or is interested, everyday feels dull and mundane. If I went back to my home country early, I would still be able to study Japanese as I can attend Saturday Japanese school there, and I have lots of Japanese friends there aswell. If I stayed the remaining 5 months, I could grow more as a person, and improve my Japanese much more. I'm also unsure if I would regret it if I actually went home, but right now I just want to be home more than anything in the world.

I'm just at my wit's end here and don't know what to do. I feel like I fall further down the emotional pit the longer I stay here.

What should I do?",09Jan2017,32
278,"So I've been working very carefully on detoxing from clonazepam that I was put on around age 7, I'm now 27 so it's been hellish. I'm being overseen by my psychiatric nurse that is over my meds, she couldn't believe a kid was put on something like that.

So I've had high anxiety while already having anxiety disorder, the reason I was on clonazepam but I have clonidine helping me. I don't sleep well either and it effects my memory a little as well as worsening my dyslexia. There are so many typos, I keep fixing them though.

I'm angry. My narcissistic mom allowed this then tried to tell me I needed to be on it for life,she tried to halt and worry me over coming off it. Fuck her.

That's not fully why I'm here though. I'm just, I've been so overwhelmed and in almost constant stress. My wonderful fiancee is with me and she's just been so helpful and supportive I couldn't do it alone. 

I just had a camel back break moment, actually I've been having those in the form of severe attacks that have me crying and whimpering. This one just now though small still hurt. I'd been stressed over finances because paying bills and while we are fine and I plan to start something small online as in a simple job, I got so scared and depressed.

Anxiety and depression have been high for weeks now randomly so this time at least the trigger was a bit more rational while still being a bit irrational cause we're going to be fine. I'm babbling I'm sorry.

She cut me off saying she couldn't do this now, which is fine. It's best to walk away to chill. I was trying not to cry because that's just how I am right now, not in any way her fault and she asks me. Why are you so depressive?

I kind of went quiet and we're chilling now. I feel stupid but I'm really sad, like wanting to cry. I don't mean to be depressive, I'm at way right now because I'm depressed. It's nobody's fault. I feel so dumb, I hate this medicine and it's another reason I'm going low contact with my nmom among other horrid things.

Word salad, I'm sorry. My mind is everywhere right now and I didn't know where to post but I needed to just convey this. I'm sad. Just, really damn sad and it sucks.",09Jan2017,1
