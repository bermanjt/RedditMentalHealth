3,"I was bored, so I googled ""voat"". I remember some fuss about it a while ago so I thought I'd check it out.

On the google search results, it showed two sublinks under the main result for voat.com. These where v/all and v/youngladies. I clicked the second one, not thinking that anything illegal would be a top Google search result. I clicked on a few images, and thought ""these girls look younger than 18"", and it was only when I got to a post titled ""[name], 14, [location]"" that it struck me that these girls weren't 18. I wasn't really thinking, and curiosity got the better of me and I clicked it. I was just curious to see if this was real. I have a kind of morbid curiosity about crime. The picture was a girl in either a swimsuit or underwear, I clicked off it straight away when it was confirmed that it is real.


What should I do now? Do I report this to someone? This just doesn't sit with me well that I know that this exists and I'm doing nothing about it.",11Jan2017,0
6,"    Hey reddit this is my first post and i came seeking some answers on something that ive really been wondering about through my life. I appreciate all insight.
    So ever since middle school i got the vibe that people were scared of me, like in a respect way. The thing is tho, i was quiet yet very immature back then. And the people who gave off this repect vibe towards me, were the kids i thought were mature and cool back then, they had girl friends, they got in fights, and hung out on the streets with their friends at night.
        Continuing on with my point, whenever i was near the presence of these kids, they would stop talking fast and excited, if the convo was exciting, and i could feel there eyes look at me. For some reason i got the feeling that they thought of me as a great fighter who doesnt take shit.
       To give an example, we were all in PE class in 8th grade,and there was this one boy ,everyone was scares of him, he was one of them ""cool"" kids, everyone was scared of him for his reputation of fighting , he was more physically developed than the other boy, and he was considered badass because his dad was locked up in jail. Anyways he was talking to this other boy in that PE class, i was sitting right in front of them on the gym floor, and they were talking about who the best fighter in the class was, the other boy said that ""badass"" kid was, the ""badass kid"" said nah, and i swear from the corner of my eye he motioned his head towards me, motioning so i wouldnt notice.
       If thats not enough, i had this one mexican  friend, i guess another group of mexican boys didnt like him, so after school my friend and i were walking, and we passed by them, and they said something in spanish, i didnt understand but when my friend and i turned the corner and went down a little further, he said oh thank god u were here, they were about to beat me up ...  i was so confused, but i just brushed it off. 
       Now i connect all this, and i feel this awkward vibe whenever i walk next too these same guys, im not close to any of them or any like them. Theres this awkward silence, like theyve just been talking about me and stopped now that they saw me. 
       The thing is im a total softie at heart, i never got in a fight, im nice to everyone, get along with everyone and never tried to act tough and i dont have a reputation that would cause middle schoolers to be afraid of me.
         Is there some encoded culture / code i dont know about? Or have any of u felt the same way?  I need to know, thanks if u made it this far, if u have any ideas feel free to reply, thanks.",11Jan2017,2
7,"So before winter break, I met a girl at a party and we've been talking ever since.

8,"Hey, before we get into this I want to say thanks for any time you invest in helping a random stranger on the internet :P

So basically long story short, we live out in rural Canada. We have pretty harsh winters here, some harsher than others.

Because of intense wind where I live, we get pretty nuts snow drifts- like they can grow as tall as a jeep or a truck, and they can stretch for a kilometer or more.. So sometimes things can get pretty intense and it's not unlikely for us to get stuck out here.

Of course because there are few others on this road, it isn't regarded as a high priority road for the road plowers, even if we call them and explain the situation, its very unlikely we'll have their aid for several days.

So, that itself isn't too bad, and it can be kinda fun at times. Unfortunately, we're drowning in mortgage and have to go into town everyday to work (or at least my parents do- I've recently become unemployed and my vehicle broke down, so I'm also in a bit of a rut.) I should say I'm only 19, so I'm not really a full-fledged adult that has any idea how to even go about this situation.

Basically, the situation is that this puts way too much pressure on my mom. She works in the Operating Room at the local hospital. This winter alone she's had several day shifts, with night shifts on the same day. It is insanely stressful for her, and she can't stand her job anymore as she's been a nurse for like 30 years or something now. The hospital is understaffed, and there's a lot of shit she has to see, not to mention the life-or-death road trip situations that can occur. We've had many situations where we've had to walk 10+km home in waist high snow with barely any sunlight left.

To get closer to the point, things need to change. I'm worried for the mental health of my family if things continue like this, there's just way too much stress involved to make the money to pay the crippling mortgage and general living expenses.

The house is for sale, but it seems like it will never sell. Don't get me wrong, I love living here, and if we didn't have to get into town each day and could just be snowed in, it'd be great.

The summers here are magical, we're outside the light pollution zone, nature, stars, privacy, it's realistically an amazing place to live, the winters are just very harsh and isolated.

I feel like my mom is going through too much stress to be able to consider what the best course of action is. She's always overthinking about what to do. My dad is always relaxing and doesn't let the stress get to him, but when he does he gets very irrational, stressed, angry, etc.

I'm kind of the mediator and peace keeper of the family, because I always remain calm and help out in various ways- and I'm not sure what the best course of action would be in this situation.. My mom listens to my advice and I'd like to try and really help her.

I've said lets list the house for cheaper, lets just get out of here- but even then, I don't know if our house would sell. It's nice, but it's naturally quite pricey as it's large and on 80 acres. I mean it's a horse/nature/etc. lovers dream but there aren't many people out there who fit that category and want to spend that kind of money.

I've also mentioned trying to go on a stress leave, but it's like she's too prideful to do that- because so many people do apparently at this hospital and she doesn't want to be one of them. I told her to reconsider the path of the hero sometimes, because she always seems to take that but I think she needs to just have a long period of time to relax and recollect from all the stress she's been going through on a day to day basis.

That's really all I can think of. If you're still here, thank you very much and if you can think of anything I'd greatly appreciate some suggestions as to what on earth my family can do to get out of this stress rut.

TL;DR Please read- but if you insist- we live in rural canada and get insane winters and a crippling mortgage, getting into town can get crazy difficult and often becomes a survival situation. House if for sale but won't sell, and my mom is undergoing serious stress. As I said, it's hard to sum things up so please read if you have the time &lt;3

But yes, thanks for your time everyone. Really hoping things can miraculously get better :(",11Jan2017,2
9,"When I was in high school, i was a really happy teen. Good friends, good grades, know what path to take from college to onwards, etc. I was optimistic about the world, and couldn't wait for what was in store for me...... Then after HS graduation, everything changed.


All of the 300+ who made a mutal promise with me to stay in contact after graduation when silent afterwards, and only 20 or so still talk to me. I was accepted to one of state university, but my grades were low and had to drop out and attend local community college. I could not find a stable job, and when i did it had a shit scheduling. The college AA(which took me three years to complete because advisor wasn't being specific) i worked on so hard on did not transfer anywhere (again, advisor did not tell me) The AA did land me a full-time job, and i thought my time as a nightly dishwasher at local convention center was finally over. Hell, i even got myself a car. I really believed my struggle was over.... It wasn't. Because of my parents insistence of getting proper 4-year degree, I had to start a new one FROM sratch (none of the credits transfer). I needed to attend college full time, which meant i had to quit the full-time job.


Recently, my college had a job opening at the enrollment office. I got the job, but I received an email today stating the funding was too short to employ me. I had accepted the fact that i am CURSED to not have a stable job, and this just proved my point.


So there's my life story. A piece of shit 23-years old virgin with no dating experience(yeah, another thing to add on the list), who is jobless, running out of money to pay the car, college debt around $3000, and being miserable all the time. My family and the few friends i am still in contacts with are the only threads that anchors me from insanity.


TL;DR I am jobless, running out of money, depressed all the time.

12,"Hi folks,

I am in a real quandary about my job situation I left my job as a full time temporary housing support worker to go to a new job working at a local university as an part time permanent accommodation assistant. I left my old job as I was 'over it' but when I started my new job I was really unsure about it. My old job came up as permanent and I was offered it again, the reason I applied in the first place was I was unsure about the switch. My mental health was poor at the time and that's the reason I was looking for something less intense and it being part time 24 hours a week suited. The question is do I go back to the old job I left with more money and jepodise my mental health or stay where I am. I don't have any commitments and money isn't everything to me.

21,So I'm a freshman in college and my whole first semester I hung out with my roommate and my friend Kelly. Kelly and I are starting to get annoyed with my roommate because all she wants to do on the weekends is hang out with these guys Kelly and I don't like. My roommate is one of those girls who has had only guy friends until now and generally likes hanging out with guys better. Kelly has other friends and she wants me to go out with her and her other friends on the weekends. Our problem is that my roommate is so use to us 3 doing everything together thats she just assumes that we'll do everything together but we don't really want her to come out with us because we know she'll hate it just being the girls. So how to we make an excuse to not go out with her?

22,"So, here's my problem:

I recently read a post of a refugee on facebook who asked if someone could help him to learn German. I always wanted to do something in this direction so I replied to him and offered help. We met two times so far and on the second time he even cooked for me and I could feel that he kinda wanted more than just learning German. Apart from that he is constantly texting me and I was already hugely annoyed by that and only replied to him in very short sentences. (But he was really not sensitive in noticing that...)
Today he texted that he wanted to watch a movie and asked me for a recommendation. In the end he texted me this:

""Okay, am gonna try that movie.
Or, would you like to watch it with me?
Oh, silly, that's not a way to invite a girl....Would you like to come and watch a movie with me sometime?""

So far I didn't reply to that. I don't even like him that much personally and I was already thinking about quitting this whole teaching thing, it was like my idealism fell on the hard bottom of reality. And now I definitely don't want to go on with it since I imagine it to be super awkward in the future. 

First of all: ""Invite a girl"" and ""watching a movie"" - I am not wrong in thinking that this is quite obviously an invitation to a date, right? I mean, watching a movie together is like a universal code, an open secret, no?

Second: How do I tell him now in a nice way, that I don't want to ""watch a movie"" with him and that I don't want to go on with teaching him? 

I feel super bad somehow but at the same time this is just not working for me.

Please, Reddit, be as awesome as always and give me some inspiration on how to do that.



edit: Case solved I would say. So I texted him that I am not interested in a date and that I feel uncomfortable. He replied that it hasn't been his intention to give me that feeling and that he asked as a friend. Then I said, alright, but ""inviting a girl"" and ""watch a movie together"" sounds a lot like this and he just replied ""yup, indeed.""

So, women are supposed to be complicated? pff!
Anyways, it was good to be honest and have this thing done.

42,"Sequence of events:

Recently my wife and I had our landlord get our bedroom heater fixed. He called a guy and got it on and working so we had been using it for a few days. 

One night, I think that our room is warm enough so I turn the heater off before I go to sleep around 11pm. It had been on for a few hours prior to my turning it off. 

Carbon monoxide alarm goes off at 5am saying ""carbon monoxide warning"" and repeats a handful of times. My wife and I wake up and get some ventilation going so it stops beeping and talking. She is a big worrier so we head over to her parents to sleep the next couple hours. 

I tell my landlord what happened and he says it's probably just dust buildup since the heater hadn't been used in many months. 

My wife urges me to call gas company to test things out as a precaution. When the gas co guy comes, he runs a check and finds that the heater is putting out 50ppm. He turns it off and says not to use it until it's been serviced, saying that it was weird that our alarm went off without the heat even being activated (remember I had turned it off prior to bed). 

I inform my landlord of this, so he has it maintenanced the next morning. We slept at my in-laws because wife was worried. 

Next day I purchase a CO detector with a display that shows the ppm reading on it to test out the heater. I put batteries in it and test it on my car exhaust to make sure it works. It reads 90ppm so I figure it works, however it didn't beep or anything. I take it inside and put it right up against my in wall heater vent for about 20 minutes and leave it there. 

I return to have the display say 51ppm, but it hadn't beeped or anything. Neither had my other alarm further away.  

Should I call the gas co to have them check it again since it was recently maintenanced even though I just did a check myself? Is my test probably not professional enough?

Im technically a teacher's assistant, but my teacher abandoned ship six months ago, and since then I have been teaching the class.  After several months of badgering, administration put in the paperwork for me to be a statutory long term sub.  About a month after the paperwork was put in, I have just been told that they have hired another teacher.  So my title (and pay) has not even gone through yet, and they're replacing me.  My credentials are not for special ed, so part of me doesn't blame them.  However, they strung me along for MONTHS and straight up used me as a teacher for several months without compensating me for it.

My question is:  should I just bail and try to find work elsewhere in a community college or something?  It would pay more and would align with my original career goals.

Well 5 months later and my boyfriend has now decided to join the Air Force. Of course I support him and want the very best for him. Except one small thing. We plan on getting married and he believes we could move anytime soon. So here I am, about to miss yet another semester of school. I am 22 and all my friends are graduating and I'm here stagnant with a part time job at my boyfriends parents house. I should mention the nearest college to me is an hour and ten minutes away. So the plan is now that hopefully we will be stationed somewhere by fall 2017 so that I can get back on my path to becoming a nurse. Tonight I am all anxious because I feel like a loser with nothing to be proud of. I caught myself looking at lvn programs (not that there is anything wrong with being an lvn, it's just not what I wanted for myself and now feel like I have to settle) I just need advice or words of encouragement. I know that as soon as we are stable again I will be back in school and finish my degree. I just feel like my support for my boyfriend makes me push my own wants aside. It doesn't help that his family only sees me as lazy and baggage for doing so. If only they knew how badly I want to graduate for myself. I just feel like I can't given my current circumstances. Any advice or opinions on if I'm doing this thing right. Also I know the Air Force will be a great thing for my boyfriend and I. When he sets his sights on something he always goes above and beyond. I just wonder is it okay to push my dreams aside so that he can achieve his dreams first? Am I naive to think that this plan will work out so that as a couple and eventual family this is the best path for us? Or am I stupid to help him achieve his goals while slowly but surely losing track of my own? ",11Jan2017,1

67,"So quick background. This happened today. I live accross the street from a Middle School to which my Nephew attends. But I live ""behind"" it, as the main entrance and school faces the complete other side. I was waiting for my wife and my sister in law to enter my vehicle in the drive way of my home. We were going to go pick up both my nephews from school (older one middle school, younger one elementary down the street). There was 3 school busses lined up on my street filled with kids about to depart. They have the busses at the back of the school on my street to decrease traffic on the entrance side. So a CSO (Campus security officer) is at an exit gate and watches the kids leave. Anyways, as I'm listening to the radio, I notice a group of 5 kids getting kind of rambunctious. Eh whatever they're kids. Then I see two of them throw their back packs down (Universal sign of a fight about to ensue), and I begin watching from my driveway. The two juveniles start punching eachother, pushing each other against the chaon link fence of the school and to the ground on the side walk of the (outside) school. This is literally less than a 1 min walk from the exit gate where the CSO is stationed. This goes on for like a minute before I walk to the CSO and yell at him. I wrote this down in an incident report style so I'll just post it here. 


Approx. 2:30 PM 1-10-17 5 male juveniles. 2 fighting. Back packs thrown on ground. Behind a line of 3 busses in front. CSO (name) at entrance of gate. 2 male juveniles began to fight, pushing, punching, push into gate of fence. I watch for one minute to see if perhaps the CSO would do anything. He did not. I approached CSO (name) and said ""Hey! Are you going to do anything?"" To which he responded ""what?"" i said ""There's two students fighting over there and hurting each other."" He yelled at the kids ""Hey guys knock it off, there's neighbors complaining"" he said with a sarcastic tone and gestured to me. The kids stare at me. I replied to him ""Really? That's why you're going to stop them? Because I'm complaining, not because they're physically hurting eachother?"" He said ""Ahh I know them they're just horsing around"" I replied"" Horsing around? They're literally punching each other and pushing each other into the fence and into the ground. So if I punch you in the face as these kids were doing, that would be horsing around?"" He responded ""Well, they're off campus anyways, I cant do anything."" i said ""wow so if you see your students being hurt you cant help even though theyre on your side walk and youre one minute away? Whats your name?"" He said ""It's (name) and you can go to the front to complain"" to which he turned his back on me.



I called the school and Explained what happened and would like to speak to someone in administration. She puts me on hold for 20 minutes and finally tells me ""well all of our administration is in a meeting. But our VP would be happy to take your complaint tomorrow if you come in at x time."" I really can only assume that this is a tactic to make me say no as most people are really too lazy to come in, but I agree. So now I have a meeting with the VP to make a formal complaint. Am I wrong here? Am I taking it too far? I'm just concerned for my nephew's and other kids safety. As to this CSO's thought process and rationality. Advice?

Tldr; Going to complain to VP in a meeting about a CSO that just watched two kids fighting and didn't do anything because ""relax bruh I know them. And they're not even on campus noob"" ya fuck that.",11Jan2017,0

73,"Hey /r/Advice.  Apologies for the relative pettiness of my problem, but my feeling is that if I can articulate what's going on in writing plus maybe actually receive some good advice, this post will have been worth it.  

Story in brief is this: Graduated in 2014 with BAs in English and Poli Sci. I know, the joke's on me.  Retained retail job that I held during college after graduation ""until I could find something else"" or until grad school.  Become full time at retail job, under a boss I really like and alongside coworkers that I basically get along with and respect.  Job is fine, not particularly stimulating, but I enjoy working full time - more on this in a second.  Receive several small pay bumps and promotions which indicate that the company at least somewhat values my efforts (it's not at all a difficult job, but retail can attract...less than motivated employees, which I try not to be).

Early 2015, apply to and get accepted by grad school.  Do a few credits in the fall while still working full time.  Take a class in spring of '16...and it's just not working for me.  Sitting in a classroom, which I was able to do more-or-less diligently for four years, doesn't appeal at all anymore.  I think it's the working full time part - it's difficult for me to reconcile having to pay money to do work when I could be getting paid to do the same.  I understand, logically, that the whole purpose of getting a further education is to improve your work prospects, but it remains difficult to reconcile in the present.

So, I drop the class last spring and haven't gone back since.  Still at same retail place with same great boss, but starting to realize with dawning dismay that ""until I find something else"" may never come.  I've made some efforts to look for work that may be more fulfilling, but 1) I obviously don't have the most employable degrees, 2) It's somewhat difficult to look for a new job when you work full time, and 3) Half the time I'm not even sure I want a new job when this one is so familiar and, well, ""safe"".  I obviously can't just quit and be without a job while I look for something else, even though I have savings enough for a bit of dead time.  And the idea of going back to school still sits on the fringes of my imagination as well.

Today, big news.  My boss is being asked (/told, it's somewhat unclear to us how much of a say he actually has, but he'll have to decide soon) to take over a problem store in our district, since he's competent and has whipped stores into shape before.  Since he's being asked to move to an objectively worse place, he had the bargaining power to basically set his own raise, but his second request was that I go with him.  His boss said yes, and told him what he could promise me if I choose to go: +~$3.50/hr.  I'm not sure about other retailers, but in this company, that's crazy big (while I'd like to think it's entirely due to my merits, it's at least mostly because they really need competent people at the problem store).  I'll also say, without sharing how much I make, that if I took that raise I'd at least be getting near the point where the job would be viable in the long-term. 

Now, the new store is a bit further away from where I live and in an area that is probably just shy of being not-very-safe, but those aren't my concerns (besides which, the raise and the new store's reduced weekend hours would cancel those out).  My concern is that if I move stores and take this raise, it'll really start to feel like I'm choosing this as a career.  In a literal sense, that's not true at all: I can still quit at any time, though of course I'd give plenty of notice. For that reason, I'm almost certain I'm taking the raise, because it would be dumb and neurotic not to.  But I'm starting to feel really down about my future.  Not because I hate my life or job, but because I'm becoming continually more embarrassed about *this* being what I do.  I know that probably sounds arrogant or elitist or whatever, but...that's the feeling I'm having, and it's been eating at me for a while.  It feels like more was expected of me.

So the advice I'm looking to get is two-fold.  If anyone has been in a situation remotely like this how did you either make peace with it or get out of it?  For the former, the best advice I've been given is to try to become fulfilled in other aspects of life: foster a strong social life when not working, get in better shape, do things that you're passionate about in your free time, etc.  Even that has proven somewhat difficult for me (I'm naturally inert), but I'm making efforts, and I think without them I'd be outright depressed.  For the latter, how *does* someone with a Bachelor's extricate himself from years of retail?  Is grad school the only option?  People say choose a different degree, but I really have difficulty imaging what I'd be genuinely happy to go back to school for.  I've been out for long enough that I'd have to start the whole process again and...you see how it goes.  I've considered teaching, but the plague of self-doubt continues.

Sorry if this was rant-y.  This is cliched, but it feels good to just put it out there.  Thanks for any and all advice that I can get, and thanks for reading.

75,"Day after Christmas I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. I didn't tell really anyone outside family until I got it removed via total thyroidectomy a week ago. So far, I've told my hometown friends, and two of my closer college friends. I go back to school Saturday, and I was originally going to just wait until I got to school to tell the rest, but I kind of feel like a dick keeping it to myself..especially in the case of my close guy friend, who is the only person I  normally open up to but haven't told.

I just don't want to make a big deal out of it. Ya, it's screwing up my life big time for a while, but I'm not dying or anything. Advice on when/how to tell them (lately I've just been jokingly casual about it 'oh by the way had cancer, better now') would be appreciated. Thanks! ",11Jan2017,5
78,"I know it might sound silly, but I have somehow developed a tendency to experience extreme difficulty communicating through devices that require remote interaction. I only want to communicate with someone in person and I, for the life of me, can not find anyone to contact that doesn't involve communicating through remote resources, as in email, telephone, text messages, etc. The thing is I am currently incapable of using these to accurately express what I am trying to communicate. It has gotten to the point where it is too unnatural and renders me unable to respond in a way that someone normally would. The only way I can accurately communicate is by making eye contact, definitely not through only voice tones or digital text characters that form words that supposedly someone is supposed to use to interpret what I'm trying to convey. It isn't working out. But I don't know where to go to find someone in person since all this communication technology has infiltrated everyone's lives and made it nearly impossible to communicate or ""reach out"" in any other way. Please if you could, provide any advice that could assist me before it's too late. I understand this might be an abnormal problem and I'm not sure if anyone could relate to this, but you are the only person I can talk to about this. I can't find any doctors to help me because I can't communicate with them remotely. I've tried to call countless countless times and I can never produce any speech no matter how hard I try, rendering my reach out attempt as pretty much useless.
It took me a lot of cognitive effort and willpower just to write this whole post in one piece and attempt to express my form of existence in a way I hope others can accurately interpret, I still worry these letters/words/sentences you are perceiving are not a viable means to convey my self. I hope to god they can be enough in the meantime to attempt to transcribe my honest intentions.

80,"First thing's first, I fortunately did not lose any money. 

What happened was I received a check in the mail for $2300 to review a Wal-Mart and buy $2000 worth of gift cards (I would get to keep $300), which I was to send to an email. Based off what I read online, what is supposed to happen is the check is supposed to clear, the scammer will receive the gift cards from me, but then the check will be rejected and I'll be out $2000. What happened, though, is that the bank immediately declined the check and closed my account. I have my money, but I believe there is now a blemish on my bank credit history and I am unable to open a new account at just about any bank. 

What are my options? If I explained the situation to the risk management agency (earlywarning.com), would they clear it? Is there a timeframe from when banks will begin accepting me?

87,"I'm not sure the best place to post this, I'd really like feedback. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly a year. For context, we live together; she's 21, I am 27. She has a kind heart, the kind of heart that men can prey on. I empower her when she feels insecure, trust her to be her own woman, and support her during troubling times. 

Over the past few months, we've made tremendous progress together as a couple. Her confidence is much higher, my patience is better, and I've learned to truly love and care.

Here's the scenario. 

She recently took a new job at a busy coffee shop; say two months back. While I'm in my hometown, she's in a new town and we both agree that meeting new people or couples could open new friendships.

She becomes friends with a gal who turns out is the older sister of one of her high school friends. This gal is engaged and in a serious relationship for the past 4 years.

They become friends and begin chatting about doing double dates and things. The two girls and the male fiance go to the company Christmas party together, where I couldn't attend (only spouses, marriage invited). I volunteer to be the designated driver and encourage them to have a nice time.

When I show up, they are all hammered, as expected.  I get bad vibes from the male fiance, but he is desperately trying to be buddy-buddy with me and thinks it's great the girls know each other. I pass it off.

A few weeks go by, and we go to another event. The male fiance is again trying to be buddy-buddy, inviting us to couples dinners etc. We let him know that I will be on a company trip the following week, but we can get together soon. (I am currently on that trip, 7000 miles from home.)

A few days after I flew out, this guy invites my girlfriend over, yet mentions other people will be there. She sends me a message running the situation by me, and I have bad feelings again, but trust her judgement. (To clarify I don't it feels like she is asking for permission. I don't think she needs too, but I think she feels obligated to—although I have never expected, wanted to, or otherwise suggested that I needed to be involved at that level.)

A few hours later I begin getting scary texts. ""He's trying to sleep with me, grabbing, won't let me leave etc.""

The story is, the other people didn't show up and he invited her to have a glass of wine because he was drinking hard liquor. They chatted for an hour or two about the upcoming wedding and such, but as he got drunker, he became handsy and flirty. Saying things like, ""Damn you're such a cute girl."" Then ask if her and I would like to go on a trip next week. My gal says that I'll again be out of town for a few days, and he says, ""Well, you and I could go.""

WHAT.

She awkwardly tries to appease the situation. This guy is approximately 6'4"" and she is 5'6"". I can empathize with her panic. 

She mentions that she would like to leave, but he grabs her ass and says, ""Are you sure you want to leave?"" She insists—but he says, ""But you've been drinking, you can't drive.""

She then says she ran off to the bathroom and texted her friend to pick her up. The guy starts throwing up outside and heads upstairs to his room. 

She asks if he is alright and says that she is going to wait in the car until her friend gets there to pick her up. He returns without a shirt on and says she has to stay, but doesn't make any further advances. 

Meanwhile I just start getting the scary texts. I'm several time zones away. She got home safe.

She calls me and tells me everything that happened. 

I get the man's phone number and his fiance and calmly talk it out. His story is about rambling that he was too drunk and that he felt horrible and wrote a novel through text, longer than this post. ""We can still be friends."" ""I'm sorry bro, I'm getting married and I love my girl."" Etc.

He also texts my girlfriend apologizing a ton and even playfully tries to change the subject. 

He also says that he told his fiance everything. (I get the feeling he didn't because she says, ""He feels bad for being rude..."") Um rude? Borderline predatory and rapey is more like it. 

Anyway, I'm 7000 miles away and angry-not at my girlfriend to clarify. She feels violated and that it was her fault. Sure, she could have been more careful going to their house,especially with the way that men can be, but I don't think that should be a woman's problem. (and why didn't other people show up?) 

She should feel comfortable going to an engaged man's house without being objectified. Period.

She doesn't want to ruin their relationship and her female friend is in denial (either she doesn't know what happened or doesn't want to know -- but can you blame her? What would she say to her family if the wedding was off?)

Poor gal. 

This man acted manipulative and predatory. 

You can't use alcohol as an excuse. Now, my girlfriend feels like she has this effect on men, that sex is her true worth to men, that she is an object, that it is her fault. 

I want to do everything in my power to protect her while still giving her the freedom to make her own mistakes. I believe that she and the female fiance should have a strong back bone here and, while it may not warrant for ending an engagement, serious actions should be taken or this man will have barely scathe with a slap on the wrist.

90,"this started, as I explained in this post from the beginning of it basically started with me with me finding out that Reddit sees talking about certain subjects that I am generally interested in as a way to sound smart developing into me wondering if I was just arrogant and brought on the mistreatment and bullying I've received because I had the stereotypical background of these ""deep"" people.
today as I am home sick and thus spent the entire day on the internet I somehow ended up reading about creepy PMs but instead the usual sexually aggressive/insulting/sending threats kind but people who (as far as I understood) didn't actually do anything outwardly harmful but seemed threatening because they came across as desperate by constantly writing hello despite getting no replies,etc and there was one guy who made it clear he never did anything aggressive/overtly sexual but still got acknowledged as a creep, . this made me terrified that i might have come of like this in my past desperate attempts to make friends but tried to consolemyself with the fact i never meant any harm and always tried to be kind. because of that ive been walking around with this feeling of dread for hours.
I realized that I generally seem to get hurt on the behalf of the awkward person/accidental creep/whatever when reading about people fucking up, not in a sympathetic way but like I'm back to my childhood and hearing others shit talk ""my kind"".

""im reading about strangers, people who know me irl say im fine and they know the context and me better and say im not like thoose""
if i get negative answers (wich i haven't yet) ""maybe i worded it wrong, I get confusing a lot""
""i didnt include enough information""

92,"After high school I lost contact with all my friends for different reasons. First I was busy with work, then some of my friends moved away or got jobs with longer or stranger hours and we couldn't hang out that often anymore. I resolved to just put my head down and get to work, which had a great effect on my grades. 

However, the last of my friends is ""gone"" in the sense that he never texts me first and is always busy with work. Meanwhile, I'm on break from school, and while I was supposed to be getting extra hours at work it turned out they didn't need extra help for the winter like usual and now I have nothing going on. 
I'm introverted and this kind of thing normally doesn't bother me, except I have no real plan for the future and don't see how it will ever be better... It seems like my friends don't really prioritize me at all, as they still find time to go to concerts and hang with there other friends, leaving me in the lurch. 

There was a girl I was talking to on and off at school, but I genuinely can't tell if I should make a move, and its been so long now that I don't even know what move I'd make. Before the break it had been awhile since I talked to her, and while she is really responsive to my messages and extends the conversation, she takes a long time to respond. Likewise, in the halls at school sometimes she says ""hey"" and other times she sort of pretends not to see me... 

This has kind of resulted in me not having a very good outlook of myself. I know its weird to realize that while its happening but I do and I don't have the tools to fix it. And I really don't see how I can be asking any girls out while I hate myself, which cuts of one solution right away.

Also I looked up ways to cope with depression (I've been battling it for years) and they primarily say to spend time with people who value you or make you feel good, but I don't have those people in my life anymore.

She's from a very conservative culture, and her mother had been needling her to break up with me for an age. I'm white, I have student debt, and I still have to graduate university while she's done and earning $60,000 per year - problems which I don't think are insurmountable, but proved to be too much. She didn't want to risk getting caught behind life or disappointing mom and dad. 

What really hurt is how her mom apparently told her to find somebody ""on her level."" I know she struggled a lot when deciding to break-up, but her parents took priority over me. 

We're still close and she still hasn't dated anybody else, though I have. I spent half a year in India and had a fairly steady ""something"" with a woman for three or four months before I returned home. 

Now that I'm back, I'm starting to face some of the post-breakup feelings I'd dodged in stepping overseas. I'm 23, won't have my degree until next May, am introverted, and am just-okay looks wise (some women will think I'm cute, others won't). Women who get to know me tend to like me, and I've hooked up probably more than I'd care to admit. However, everything that happened with my last relationship has made me feel insecure about my ability to provide for myself and seem attractive to a potential partner. Having to work at low-paying jobs until I graduate makes me think there's no use pursuing girls with real degrees or who are in medical school or going after masters or PhDs. 

Frankly, I just feel useless. I had a lot of confidence before, because I feel I've accomplished a fair deal for being a late graduate. I've managed two trucking companies, can read and write Arabic, Hindi, and Serbian, lived in India by myself for two years, hitchhiked across Europe, and traveled to 30 countries since 2013 on money I earned. None of that seems to matter to me mentally, though. Now I'm ashamed of the sixty hours per week I worked to save to travel the world one summer, because I could have been paying down my debt instead. Even if I've done some cool stuff, I just feel like women are gonna look at my position and be like, ""oh, here's a fuck up - didn't care enough about his career to do the right things at the right time."" 

I'm very committed to finishing school, but I feel like a non-commodity on the dating market. A big part of me wants to get out and meet new people, but I'm having a hard time finding the enthusiasm to get into Tinder. All of my friends have graduated university and are now in medical school or the Peace Corps - I don't even have a crew to attempt going to bars with. 

tl;dr - 23/male. ex broke up with me in June because I haven't finished my degree and might ""hold her back."" I'll get my degree next year. Zero confidence in re-approaching the dating market because I'm poor and not yet a graduate. ",11Jan2017,4
97,"so I will to keep this short as talking about this problem always to result in a wall of text-


ive been feeling like an asshole, as far as i know it started months ago with wondering if my interests made me pretentious (as they were stereotypically things people talked about to sound smart).


ive always had trouble making friends, (so far blamed on akwardness and being weird) and lately ive been trying to reconcile if am just a terrible person who brought this on myself.


i keep finding articles online about negative behavior that reminds me of me and thinking for days if im like that. one that haunts me in particular is [this](https://markmanson.net/are-you-an-emotional-vampire)

i have trouble relaxing because i dont know if i deserve it or should punish myself, i keep asking myself if was an asshole on accident could i still allow self love.



at the same time i keep hoping for someone to proove that im not, that perfect comment, I'm bombarding my friend with links asking if they sound like me and i feel guilty for not titling this something less sympathetic sounding.",11Jan2017,1

100,"My father died 4 years ago and I am just now going through his boxes of things. There are some obvious stuff that I know I must keep. The question I have is regarding old family documents and papers and photographs for which I do no know the story behind, did not know existed, and am unsure of what I would do with them if I kept them.

For example, letters to and from people that I do not know. some written in German, some letters in English from the 1910s. My grandparents are dead, my dad's sisters are all dead, I'm an only child, my mom has no idea about them. There is no one to ask why my father saved them.

What do I do with my Grandfather's Birth Certificate? I have it in a box now, and for the last 4 years never knew it existed. I will never use it, I don't have any emotional connection to his birth certificate. It seems rather callous to not want something like that, but on the same hand what practical purpose is there to save it?

What do I do with photographs of people that I cannot identify?

102,"I have a YT channel with 82K subs, I used to make a series where a protagonist ""rages"" over his everyday life, the series turned out very well, but I recently ended it, because I could not continue doing those types of videos anymore.

103,"So my friend of 3 years has been acting pretty weird lately. Let's call him F. 
So I'm really good friends with F as well as his GF. Recently she's been coming to me for advice with him because I ""know him better"". But that's not even the case. We're just brothers. Now, I've known F for a while, and I can easily say he dosent show his emotion. He's almost robotic. He'll be ""cool"" and ""fun"", but barely has any skills to cope with prosecution. He literally laughs everything serious off. When me as well as F's GF confront him about it, he just runs away by smiling and acting like there was no problem in the first place.
This guy hates adversity. 
Because we're mates and i want to see him grow into a FUCKING BEAST of a man (both 19) im trying to do everything in my power to help him face his problems through elevated conversation and discussion. 
He grew up really poor. His dad, an established engineer, quit his job early into his career to look after the family, his mother fighting head on with serious depression. I think that as a child he was remorseful towards his parents and remains bitter and robotic to this day.
Since then the parent-son relationship had barely been cultured whatsoever.
He has no relationship with his parents so much so that he refuses to tell them anything about his life, including his GF, which is what sparked this post.
I had it pretty easy growing up and he often makes bitter comments about how I'm so rich and spoiled, sounding genuinely angry.
I would have thought his rough childhood would make him more emotionally attached and developed towards his caretaker. 
If he has any emotional connection it's buried deep. 

I'm just scared he'll run from the same problems and won't be able to face them when he has a family and a wife. 
Better to deal with it now haha.

Anyway if you read this far I would really appreciate feedback or something me and his gf are pretty worried about him. 

Thanks.

104,"College roommates, first year living together, close ish friends who I've known for a few years. I'm the only one who really ever cooks or makes anything other than a frozen meal and today one of them made a joking comment about me cleaning up the night of rather than two nights later and they all laughed and it felt like shit. I know it sounds so stupid trust me I recognize that, but they all acted like it was such a truth and that it happens all the time. That wouldn't bother me if I really didn't make an effort, but a lot of the time I feel like the only one who makes an effort. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who's ever wiped down the counters, every night I pick up all the cups they leave out, trash from their frozen meals is left on the table for days before I finally get fed up with it and clean it up. Some mornings I'll wake up early and just do a deep clean for an hour and I don't think any of them have done or would ever do that. I'm not saying I deserve praise for that or anything. I like having things clean. If I really wanted them to clean more I would tell them, but it doesn't bother me for now. So I'm not saying I do extra. It's when they say that I do a less than normal amount that really hits hard

Again, disclaimer, I know how bat shit crazy I sound. Bare with me.

I've always had trouble handling things maturely, especially this year after living with them. After putting off university for about a year due to caring for my mental health and a recently diagnosed (mild) anxiety disorder, living with friends was a nice change, but it also made me realize how fucking sensitive I am and I hate it so much. Anything they say I might take badly. And it doesn't get me mad at them it gets me just sad that that's what they think. I'm really trying to figure out how to explain this correctly.. for example if one of them makes a joke about how my voice is soft, and they all laugh about it, it doesn't make me mad that they did that. They're my friends, joking around is natural. But it makes me sad that they all three realize something about my voice that I thought I had changed after years of getting bullied for it. Does that make sense at all? Sorry for doing such a shit job at explaining this.

So basically towards the end of last semester i learned that sometimes they feel they need to tip toe around my feelings which of course sucks bc they're my friends and they shouldn't have to do that. I essentially explained a little bit of my side to give offer sort of reason why and promised I would try to be more conscious of it.

But then something like this happens and it makes me want to passively aggressively point out every dish they leave out for the next month even though I recognize how stupid and dumb and immature and cunt-ish that is.

I don't want to be that crazy bitchy roommate. I want more than anything to be calm but jesus I'm still so angry about this. I want to handle this situation, and every other one that might come up, maturely but I don't know how without being labeled as 'freaking out'. I know the dishes situation sounds so stupid but hopefully I've explained well how this problem manifests itself in other areas as well. Help?",11Jan2017,2
105,"Growing up with my brother was always awful. It’s hard to explain but in every single way he would find ways to manipulate or humiliate me for his own enjoyment. Without going in to too much detail he was a horrible person to grow up with, and a source for so much of my own self-hatred.

We’re both adults now (I’m 31 and he’s 36), and it has been well recognized in my family that he has deep seated personality disorder, mental illness, and addiction issues. There was a moment though, a few years ago when he sort of hit rock bottom in his life and was able to turn a new leaf. He became sober and I guess was on the right meds and going through treatment. My family was beginning to really like the thoughtful person he was becoming. He even wrote me a handwritten letter apologizing for being such an awful brother. I couldn’t really just forgive a lifetime of emotional torture over a single letter, but it was a start and I appreciated it.

Well after a few years of that, he started drinking again and I guess got off his meds or whatever and has made it a regular habit of ruining family gatherings. The way he speaks to me is one thing, but the way he speaks to my Mother and his own girlfriend infuriates me beyond belief. He’ll get drunk and blow up over the tiniest most mundane bullshit and when he gets the slightest bit of pushback just starts playing victim and wining about how everybody mistreats him. My Mother actually entertains this nonsense out of genuine concern for his wellbeing. When I confront her about it, she just says that she’s worried he’s going to kill himself. I can’t even begin to know what that must feel like for her, but it still drives me nuts that she’s allowing him to manipulate her like that. My Dad is a bit more blunt about his behavior and this has caused a divide in my family.

I don’t think I’m being unfair. I also have two sisters who are both truly, amazing people. But with him there are just  enough emotional scars from his presence in my life that I’m ready to be done with him. But at the same time, I am concerned that anything I say might be the thing that pushes him over the edge.

My plan was to photocopy the letter he wrote me a few years ago and tell him how I had genuine compassion for the person writing that letter, but the person that he has since become is someone that I don’t want in my life, or that of my family (wife and expecting a son in March), and that until he gets treatment and becomes sober again, I never want to speak or be in the same room as him again. But again… I’m scared… like maybe that will be the feather that breaks the camel’s back… or sets of a chain reaction of events that causes him to do something brash. I truly truly truly cannot stand the guy, but I don’t want that. 

My parents love him and want to help him. They spent tens of thousands of dollars of their own money getting him into treatment, and it seemed to work for a little while. …But now he’s just a fuckin’ drunk asshole again and I’m just so done with him. 

If I sever ties officially it’ll likely cause some family drama. Also there is genuine concern that anything I say might send him spiraling down into an even darker place where he might hurt himself. I don’t want either of these things. But right now his life is on a path towards total self-destruction and I can’t help but hope he is the only casualty of his own behavior.

Should I tell him how I feel and that I until he gets treatment and becomes sober again that I don’t want him in my life? Or should I work with my somewhat divided family right now to figure out a way to deal with him together?",11Jan2017,4
106,"I'm twenty years old and I've just moved back in with my mother. I was away at college for two years and I've now had to leave because of (among other things) severe depression and anxiety. My college was willing to let me try again and keep studying but my mom wanted me to come back home. She has told me that I should not study for the year because u made a mess of the first time and I should instead work for her (without pay) as her PA. She asked me to turn down other job offers before telling me that she wanted me to work for free and so I don't have any other ways of making money right now. In addition to this, I need to contribute by paying half of her expenses. Also, my mom and I fight all the time. She resents me for wasting her money (as she says) and refuses to believe that I actually have depression and anxiety. According to her, I just need to try harder.

And co-worker 3 is ""Kim"" and she is a black girl.

We are all within ear shot of eachother as we are closing up shop. Lauren, the sweet girl she is, asks Cheryl nicely to go to clean something for her. I hear this and decide to jeer in with a joke and say: ""better do it quick or she'll lynch ya""
To clarify that was me (a Latino male) said that to a white female and the aggressor would be a tiny sweet philippino woman (she cried when she swatted a fly).
Now then Kim chimes in and says that she is offended that I would use that word (lynch). And continued to claim that I don't know what that word ment. To save time I'll assume that all of you know what it means and its history (that being all races have had people die to lynching). Now I'm being unjustly marked and accused of being racist.

In these nights I've wet the bed I also had bad dreams.  
I've always been a bit peculiar about peeing at night. Pretty much always go to the toilet after 30 minutes laying in bed.  
Throughout the years it has happened a few times drunk, or on the rare occasion when I tried to break my night ritual.
As far as I remember I didn't have problems with this as a kid.

A few months back I confronted my parents for the first time after a youth of suppression and metal abuse.  
That didn't go well, when the conversation started to turn on them the just hung up the phone.
Of course that's been on my mind a lot and the bad dreams are also about confronting them again.

If anyone gets the chance to respond it's greatly appreciated,so here I go. 

I was molested from the time I was 11 until now (im18yr) multiple times too many to count and I have never told anyone.I haven't told anyone mainly because it was my uncle who molested me and I fear if I were to come out and say something the legal costs will be too great for me and my mother(father not in the picture,we had disagreements and we haven't speaked in about 4 years)because at the time right now my mother maintains a family of 5 including myself with the help of my older brother(24r) with the combine income of at least 2k month and because of that(not the main reason but one of the reasons)i choose not to speak out because I have a strong feeling it'll be even harder times for us.Also another reason for being quite and not coming out is that my uncle has 2 kids(one 14yr other 16yr)and a wife with whom I have no hate towards will also suffer because it's my uncle who support them financially and my aunt can't because she recently had surgery and can't get a job because of recovery for the next couple months(4-6,the surgery makes it so she can't be jumping around or anything that takes up a lot of energy) and I'm worried if I were to come out and he's properly being punished what will happen to my aunt and her kids,how will they get by? We have no room in the house we're renting with 3 rooms(might I add rooms small enough that a king size mattress will take up about 70-80% of the room) so they won't fit with us.its also hard to come out because everyone thinks he a good guy even my mom and it pisses me off because I know how twisted he is and the worst part is everytime he comes over I have to act as if nothing ever happen and play along with my everyone and act like he's a great guy.also whenever my mom wants to go visit my aunt(where my uncle lives) where they live an hour drive from where we are I always have to make excuses on why I don't want to go,then because of that my siblings blame me for not letting everyone else enjoy themselves and visiting my aunt all because I don't want to go so everyone stays home and this irritates me to a point where I want to give them the reason why but I can't.also I don't want people feeling sorry for me for being molested I feel as if once my family and friends find out they'll start treating me different and I wouldn't want that. He is also the reason why I've never tried to pursue getting a girlfriend because of what he did to me,i haven't even kissed a girl and I'm about to be 19 in a few months. Also because of him I get uncomfortable when people lay hands on me doesn't have to be near my privates just people touching me makes me uncomfortable and skirmish a bit, I want to say the main reason for me not speaking out is purely a finical reason but I feel like that's not entirely true but I don't know what I should do in my situation.

127,"Hi guys, it's my first post here so hopefully I didn't violate any of the sidebar rules :) And sorry if my post is badly worded as English is not my native language so I'll try my best to be coherent.

First of all, by the title, you may have assumed I'm a old guy who has many regrets because he didn't make use of his time when he was younger. But I'm 17, going on 18 6 months from now. Please don't downvote me first and hear me out. I know that I'm young, but I already have these feelings of regret even when I know it is not rational as there are many years ahead of me. 

To elaborate, I've spent the better part of the last 5 years of school lazing around, doing the bare minimum. I've always gotten good grades but there are many areas in which I feel like I could have achieved so much more. Mainly in physical fitness, and my confidence/social skills.

After this year which is my senior year of high school, I will be going for mandatory service in the army, thereafter which I will probably go uni for 3-4 years. Thinking about it, the regret I feel is probably caused by the fact that I will have increasingly limited opportunities to socialise and make friends (only males serve in the army, and in uni the faculties are not that big and there are way less opportunities to interact with others than in high school). Even now in my senior year, I'm taking major exams at the end of the year so I already have significantly less time to work out and hang out/have fun with friends than a few years ago when I had all the time in the world (literally free most of the time) and didn't cherish and make use of it properly.

This cycle of regret, and self-pity is holding me back and I really, really have no idea how to combat it. I've went on good streaks of 2-3 days where I temporarily forget about it but every single time, usually when working out, I will suddenly remember the wasted time as I feel that I could have been way fitter if I started earlier, and what I'm doing now is futile as I don't have much time left. There are so many things that I know I have to do before I graduate. There's a girl from another class who I have a crush on but we have nothing in common and I have no idea how to approach her, there are people I were close to that I have drifted apart from as we are no longer in the same classes and I really want to reconnect with them, and there are so many things that I want to do yet they require much more confidence and self-esteem than I currently have. 

There are many kind words that my peers have said to me, such as the simple truth that I cannot get the time back, and so I should look forward and try not be stuck in the trap of living in the past. However, I'm finding it hard to internalise these words of advice even though they make so much sense and sound logical.


A piece of advice I received was to set a goal for the future and once I achieve it, I will feel better and forget about the woeful past where I wasted so much time. I'm going to try this out through setting some fitness goals but is this a good method to deal with my regrets? Somewhat unrelated to my question, but I've set a few fitness goals for 2 months' time which are to get my pull-ups from 5 to 15 and bulk from 154 pounds to 165. Realistically, I only have 6 months of school left as from early July onwards, it's just non stop studying till the end of my examinations in late November, thereafter I graduate and no longer see the friends, classmates and strangers that I spent the last few years with.

Reading what I wrote, I probably sound pretty overdramatic to you guys, especially those older ones who have gone through much more of life than me, but I can't help think that I fucked up really badly. I had so much potential but didn't do anything to build myself. I feel like a shell of what I could have been, and as my time in school draws to an end, the regret I feel from all the wasted time just grows exponentially. I really at am a loss as to why I am feeling this way and how to combat my feelings, so any advice would to push me back onto the right track would really be appreciated :) My exams are really important and I want to get into the right mindset and not be the current 'lost' and clueless person that I am now, and I would also really like to close this chapter of my life with a high, yet I never seem to be able to forgive myself for all those years wasted..

I am a male Canadian student who is in their last year of a 5 year concurrent program where I recieve both an honours BSc in chemistry and a BEd (Bachelor of Education). Our final year is often referred to as teachers college. 

In this year, I am questioning my decision to chase down a teaching position. I know that teaching is what I want to do, but the prospect of a job seems slim. 

I am here to look for possible alternative careers that I would be able to apply for and enjoy with my current credentials. Teaching is my passion, so jobs that have some degree of this would be ideal. 

Thank you in advance, I have been going through a really rough time admitting to myself that teaching might not be a realistic career at the moment.

So I help out with the bills, cleaning, cooking, pretty much anything I can do to relieve the stress off of my mom. Before he left the house, it was way more poisonous, I went days without eating because I would stay in my room hoping he didn't notice I was home. It has been better since he has left. My brother lives at home as well, I have felt very frustrated with him because he works more than I do, he doesn't pay my mom anything, him and his girlfriend (who thinks she lives here too) eat my food so I have to hide any food I buy if I want to see it at the end of the day. I am constantly cleaning up after him and his girlfriend, she makes a huge mess of the bathroom after I clean it and she even goes as far to leave blood all over the toilet. My brother has occasional freak outs that scare and upset me. He gets destructive and there have been instances where I thought he was going to hit me. I am working 2 part time jobs and I am in college, in my third year of Graphic Design, last semester I failed one of my courses and I am worried now I won't graduate on time. I have been told I have situational depression. Which I can see being possible. What I would like to know is if there are people out there who have resolved their depression naturally, I don't want to take pills. My boyfriend and I plan on leaving and getting our own place as soon as I am done school. I can't wait to come home to a person who is gentle, caring, and generally happy to see me. I know everyone is different, which was my reasoning for getting a little personal, maybe someone has dealt with the same situation as me and can offer some advice to one helpless student. I am also waking up in the middle of the night and unable to get back to sleep and that is when anxiety kicks in, everything comes rushing into my brain at once and I feel overwhelmed.

I'm 19, I don't have this kind of experience so everything is extremely new to me. 

At first it was rough because I would have panic attacks that I couldn't do it, as trying to change them was nearly impossible for me. I'm starting to get over that aspect and it's getting easier for me physically. However there is still a million things for me to remember every night, one of the individuals I have to change can walk, and she constantly fights me when I try to change her and it's very hard for me.

When I left this morning I walked right into a conversation between the day staff about me not doing something and it wasn't a nice conversation.

I'm trying. I'm fucking trying. I don't know everything yet and I was trained wrong by someone who is lazy and does not do her job correctly. And I'm getting blamed for it.

I'm at a point in my life where I need to decide what I need to do, and I got a couple paths I can take.
------------

Backstory:
21m on ssdi (840ish per month) I'm currently in a reduced rent place paying about 320ish/mo for rent up north of seattle.
I can work, and do odd jobs from time to time, but I definitely want something more, I really want to own my own business is manufacturing.

Honestly, that'll probably be 5-10 years down the road, and currently I'm looking at what to do in the next year or two.
In about 6-7 months my place is gonna be torn down and replaced with an apartment complex (with higher rent as well)
I'm currently applying to job corps, but am also thinking about joing the army, the coast guard, or trying to figure out the whole college thing.

That said...my question is are there any other alternatives out there? Anything I'm missing that can help me get a step ahead towards my dreams? I'm probably going to be joining job corps so I can save up some money. (Free rent and food, Hurrah)

158,"I'll try and line this up as simply as possible. I'm a 24yr old male. I work in automation engineering. I was unable to finish school because the loan company wouldn't give me loans to finish after insurance dropped my mom and her credit fell. I somehow managed to remain employed at my current job, moving from support to commissioning, and now landing in research and development. I am underpaid by about 20-50k. I absolutely despise my boss, and I know him and the company are using me.


I live alone in a tiny one bedroom apartment with my cat. My family is 2 hrs away, and I rarely have time to visit. My friends are distant at best. I rely on marijuana to keep me off the suicide watch list. I am in debt because of my accrued student loans, and because I purchased a car. The car is the only time I smile during a normal workday, unless my coworker tells a joke. We share an office, and he is one of the few people at the company who listens to me. Actually listens, not just takes my work, throws out a blatant and empty complement and then ignores me like I am just a machine designed to solve their problems.


I have always lusted for adventure and to see the world, exclusively old Europe, and the far east (Asia). I dreamed of working in green energy in the Netherlands and living a simplistic life, helping the world however I can. These dreams slip further every day, and my debt does not seem to reduce (besides my car loan).


I am struggling, really really trying to tell my self I have it better than a majority of people. I exclusively avoid social media so that seeing others so happy doesn't make me lose what little control I have. 


So my seeking advice comes down to essentially: What happens if I just get on a plane, and go? Leave it all behind, just me, a bag with the most important things, and an open destination. I'll eat pizza from a dumpster, look for under-table jobs, and see the world through the eyes of adventure, not the eyes of a managers meeting request.


I feel betrayed, like the world is forcing me down a path I was never sure about. Am I just mentally ill? Should I just go?

First, excuse me for my weak english as it's not my first language. 
I'am 40 and a single parent of a 16yo, he's a good kid, gets great grades, very polite and never disrespectful. He's shy, never asks for things. A couple of months ago he said that all of his friends have PS4s, they all play together and talk about games all the time and that of course made him want one. I promised to get him one very soon but a week later i lost my job because of ''company budget issues"", and then suffered the loss of my dear mother and had to spend a lot for her funeral.

160,"Background: I work for a company that hired me on as part of a team that used to be composed of 16 people in years past but in the last few years they've decreased it to the point where when I got hired they had 1 full time and 4 part time positions available. I had the most availability out of anyone part time because everyone else is a student and I'm not so I got the most hours. Now that the new semester is beginning one of the employees left for an internship and we all knew it was going to happen. I'm currently on the schedule for 12-5 M-F while the other 2 people left are working 9 hours and 11 hours a week.  I found another job that pays better but is an all day Tuesday-Thursday job....I just want to know the best way to ask if I can just work on mondays and fridays at the current job (I don't technically even need to work anymore because the other job will pay enough so that I don't need a second job but I don't want to be bored on those 2 days with nothing to do and also fridays are the most busy days at the current job so I still want to help out). 

I like the company I work at now but my direct supervisor is CRAZY. One day she'll passively aggressively reprimand me for doing nothing wrong but just not in the order that she wanted. The next she'll be sugar sweet and bake treats for me and the other people which make me really on edge because of her treatment the day before. Next day rinse and repeat. The other 2 coworkers don't seem to have this issue with her but they've been there longer than I have. Also I don't particularly like them either because they'll be nice to me sometimes but then make fun of me for other stuff any chance they get (like when we talk about plans or things that we like outside of work they'll make fun of me for what I like to do or make fun of things that I say and laugh with each other because they're friends outside of work) 

Another thing is that the other 2 coworkers don't drive and I do so I'm made to drive and run errands up to 10 miles a day with no reimbursement or compensation and IM TOO SCARED OF THIS LADY to ask her for some reimbursement! 

So anyways I'm between wanting to ask her to reduce my hours but then she's going to give me so much shit in a sugar sweet voice about how it's inappropriate because I already told her I was available those days. So then my only option is to quit. Which again I can handle financially but I do want to help out on busy fridays and don't want to be bored mondays and fridays. 

The old job is supposed to start up on the 16th and the new job is supposed to start on the 30th so my question is do I tell her/ask her via email now or wait until the 16th when I go in and do it in person? Email seems cowardly but I dont have anything in the office that I need to go back to get and lots of our communication is over email anyways. In person will be a lot more uncomfortable but seems like a better option. But if I wait until then that it doesn't give them a lot of time to replace me (and do a weeklong orientation). They'll probably either have to hire a new person or assign more hours to the other 2. I also need help on what to say and how to phrase things so I don't burn any bridges!!

Back ground: I met my boyfriend over two years ago. There is a large age gap between us. We moved in together and were on out our own. My Boyfriend has had some problems with mental health and has been suicidal a few times since I've known him. I kind of help him through this. He was going to school when I first met him and wasn't in the correct mind set to keep going with it. So, I got him a job in retail. He ended up hating it and wanted to go back to school. At this time his parents offered to have his move in with them so he could back to school with out worrying about rent and bills. We accepted. They built us an apartment above their garage and everything. Right before we move I got pregnant. They were not supportive during the pregnancy and have never really been overly friendly towards me, which is fine I mean they are giving me a roof over head my head and food, I'm grateful for that or was anyways. My boyfriends dad has been especially creepy after the baby was born. Our room was across from his while the renovation upstairs was going on, and after the baby was born he left his door open at night and I noticed him trying to sneak into our room.

My bf's dad disappears during to check on pants as they are doing Laundry before their trip to Florida. My bf's dad is gone for 10-15 minutes. The next day I give my baby her infant vitamin D drops, she seems fussy afterwards. A few days later she is making a face every time I give her the drops, and has a few hour melt down afterwards. My bf and I taste the drops, to see what's going on. It burns our throat and and tongue and gives us a head ache afterwards and bloating. We stop use of the vitamin drops and call the company that makes it. They say this not a side effect of the drops and they have never heard of this reaction before.

173,"Hi r/Advice!

I have a couple questions about vacations. 

My mom is turning 65 this year and hasn’t been on any sort of vacation or trip in at least the last 20 years – we never had the money. Now that my sister and I are on our own, we would like to treat our mom to a nice, memorable, but modest vacation (we’re still in our 20s, by no means rich, but we can afford to split the cost to take her somewhere). 

My mom has a variety of health issues – lost most of a lung to cancer, had heart surgery, generally in less than stellar health, so we want the vacation to be something easygoing and relaxing. 

My first idea was to take her on a cruise of some sort – medical staff would be available 24/7, it would be warm (so, good for her health), there would be activities available if she was up for trying them, but she would also be able to nap whenever she needed. Not a lot of walking, which is good since she has trouble with long distances. I also think it would be memorable for her since she’s never been outside the US and I don’t believe she’s ever vacationed anywhere outside of trips to the south to visit family (think AL, TN – beautiful states but no FL or SC beaches or anything). 

My sister and I typically would not be interested in a cruise for ourselves, we live more active lifestyles and would usually choose a hiking trip or something similar, so my sister is a little reluctant to that idea, but I think she would get on board (pun intended hehe). 

My questions for you all are… Have you taken any enjoyable cruises in the past? If so, what kind and to where? What was pricing like? What destinations would you recommend or not recommend?

I’m also open to non-cruises if anyone has suggestions. I’ve been googling around and looking at things but have realized I don’t know Jamaica from the Bahamas from Hawaii from Alaska and I don’t even know where to start, so I am hoping some anecdotal feedback can at least give me an idea.

I told her this was okay, as I begin work again in the summer, and can save up as well, so we both are paying for it. And at this point, she starts to cry.

I ask  what happened, and she says he had finished a hard day at work, was getting out of his truck at home, and just fell. He was there for about 10 minutes before our stepmom noticed he was still out, and wandered down their driveway. She helped him up and in the house. Evidently, half his face was numb for two days, and he couldn't use his left arm. Of course, he never went to the hospital, but seems to have recovered. My step mom told my sister, who was obviously worried, which upset him enough that he made them both promise to not tell anyone. 

And I don't know what to do. I'm very worried and frustrated, and the distance is really getting to me. I don't have the finances to fund a trip, and a go fund me would need to be shared on Facebook, which would leak his secret. I also don't know whether or not to confront him about it.

188,"Been a stay-at-home dad for our 2 and 4 year old. Our 4yo has been in preschool since she was 2 and our 2yo will be starting preschool soon so I will have about 6 hours of free time a day. I want to make good use of that time. Looking for advice on what I should do.

A little background, I have an Associate's Degree in Legal Assisting. I had been working as a paralegal. I was making around $45k a year. My wife is a registered nurse and makes just north of $100k. Our mortgage payment is about $900 a month and our cars are paid off. We live comfortably. There is no pressure for me to make $. But part of me feels obligated to do so now that I will have some free time.

If I want to continue to earn $, I have to find something where I can make my own hours. I've considered becoming a real estate agent but I am terribly introverted and I feel that that may prevent me from being successful. It costs about $1,200 between tuition and fees to get your license here in California and about $2000 a year in various fees to gain access the MLS and equipment. Thoughts?

I've also looked into driving for uber/Lyft. My 2006 Honda Civic qualifies and I get about 30 mpgs. After doing some research on my market (Sacramento) I guesstimate that I could make between $12-$15 an hour. It's not lucrative, but it's something. I'm probably going to do this no matter what else I do.

Lastly, I've considered going back to college and completing my bachelor's degree. The problem is, I have no idea what to major in. I'm reluctant to get a STEM degree because I'd basically be starting over. I'd need to complete between 63-90 units of STEM related classes. All of my general ED will transfer, but I still need 3 G.E. classes before I can apply to C.U. or 5 if I want to transfer to a U.C. because of the forigen language requirement for U.C. I could complete these courses at the local J.C. fairly cheap. Cost for my bachelor's really isn't an issue and I know it will be a worthwhile investment. I would be able to pay off any loans fairly quickly. In-state tuiton for C.U. is about $7k a year and U.C. is about $14k and theoretically, I'd only need to go for 2 years.

Right now I'm leaning towards driving for uber/Lyft and completing my G.E. courses. During that time I can talk to counslers and other students and try to figure out a major that may be right for me. If I decide to try real estate, I could earn the $ for the fees by driving so the costs won't impact us.

I know I have a great opportunity here and I want to make the most of it. What would you do? Know of any jobs where I could be my own boss and make some $?

191,"

I'll try to keep this concise because I really need your help. I keep my horse at a couples farm, I bought him from the wife who is the horse lady whom, after a fall, sold him to me and hasn't ridden since. She got her husband into horses and his horse is the other on the farm. Since the wife works a lot the husband comes and rides with me whenever he can. These are two impeccably sweet people who mean a lot to me in the short time I've known them. 


Late last night he called me and left a long message asking me to go to scotch night with him in the city. He mentioned scotch club one night when I told them I really like a fine scotch, all three of us were drinking around the fire, but I sort of fluffed off the idea of going with him by changing subjects. 


I'm especially nervous because I'm a friendly, outgoing conversationalist. I don't consider  myself a flirt honestly. But then I've been in awkward situations before by just being friendly and showing interest in a guy's life, not nessisarily personal details!!!. I had a boss ask me to sleep with him and he's married and had children my age. It really hurts my feelings because I NEVER discuss inappropriate things, I'm just friendly. I guess it's my fault. I just have a hard time being reserved and giving people the cold shoulder.   


So anyway, this guy is a really nice guy, but they are both much older (60) and I'm a 25 year old female. We have lots of fun together with the horses or later around the fire all together, and I consider him a great friend and all, but I think it would just be awkward and slightly inappropriate to go without his wife there, honestly. 


Also he's never even begun to come onto me or be inappropriate, but he has told me things in conversation, the topics of which I find kind of odd. In the back of my mind I think a person doesn't tell you something for no reason. He's told me about his ex wife and dates they went on, dancing polka with a lady whilst down south on a long haul (he's a trucker) all sorts of little things. I've told him about the guy I've been seeing to relate to him a bit. Maybe I gave him the wrong idea, or maybe I was ""too friendly"", but I've never said anything personal. 


I stay over from time to time. The farm is a ways from my house and we all go out for dinner when I do. These are two great people who are very welcoming and lots of fun. Also sometimes we haul our two horses to our hunt club and the husband does all the work driving the trailer so I buy him lunch in return of course (after he refuses to take my money!)  


Anyway to sum it up, I don't want to go because I think it would be a little inappropriate. I don't know what he means by inviting me to his scotch club. Maybe he just finds me good company and would be proud to roll up with a younger gal who likes scotch. Maybe not.  


I just need to know how to turn him down without being awkward or assuming his intentions.",11Jan2017,1

I'm kinda humming and hawing about it since it is a GOOD chunk of change, but if I just have to park it away to cover my bills in the event that I don't get a contract extension, then I would rather just stay where I am",11Jan2017,1
194,"Hi, everyone. I'll try to keep this short.

My parents are physically and emotionally abusive (though the physical abuse has decreased with the years), and all my life they've emphasized on the importance of close family relations. They're expecting me to not leave home until I get married, and they'd even prefer if my future husband and I moved in with them when that time comes around. I was initially thinking of putting up with the abuse until I graduate college and financially support them for a few years (which they're expecting) before moving out. I know they'd put up a fight about me moving out even after that, but I'd feel less guilty due to having supported them for a while. But recently, my mom has been alluding to it being better if I just left and didn't come back. I overheard her talk on the phone to our neighbor, saying that ""(...)she'll never leave home, [hinting to me being annoyingly dependent on her, a nuisance]"". These are comments that have motivated me to leave immediately, but then again she's the one who repeatedly tells me I should stay and financially support my siblings' college education. I feel torn.

The other side to this is that my mental health is hugely affected by my parent's behavior throughout the years. My dad started hitting me when I was 5-6 years old (several of the incidents severely traumatizing), and my mom started her emotional blackmail and abuse around puberty. I gained a little weight and have been subject to her criticism of my body ever since. I've since lost much of that weight (after falling prey to anorexia she inspired, which I'm still dealing with), and now she's picking on me about my grades, who are much worse lately because of the stress she's putting me through. She has called me stupid, ugly and unattractive for as long as I can remember, which has impacted my self-esteem. When I think about all they've done to me, I wanna pack my bags and leave (I've got the means to take care of myself) but there's another layer to this that makes it even harder.

I come from a traditional background where a woman isn't supposed to leave home before she's married, and if she runs away, she's dubbed a whore/slut. This can harm my parent's reputation in our community to a point of no return, especially because they're considered to have bought up their kids well and my mother continuously brags about it to everyone. Her excessive bragging has caused people to dislike her and actively look for faults in our family. If anyone in the community finds out that I've run away (I'm of age, so it's really just moving out), they'll never let her or my father rest. They'll shame them forever. I'm not happy with my parents but I don't think they deserve to have their reputations tarnished like this.

With all this in mind, what should I do? If I stay, I'll have to deal with abuse I can no longer handle, which has pushed me at the brink of suicide, but if I leave (which I have all the means to do) my parents and family will have to struggle financially and my parents can never show their faces in public again.


Thank you for your time.

202,"Hey Reddit-

I'm  looking for advice on how (or if) I should respond to a text message from a student's mom who fired me suddenly last night after years of teaching her son.

Some backstory: I'm a professional musician who teaches guitar on the side doing in-home lessons. I love it. Teaching is probably my biggest passion and I've always loved working with kids. For four years I've had a student 'John'. He's been a hard student. He makes it clear he doesn't have any interest in guitar, and his mom makes him take lessons for his future college resume. She's one of those VERY overbearing parents..she sits in on every lesson. After a few months of lessons she told me she wanted John to audition and make honors band. I explained to her that was very likely not to happen since John was a new student and the music director was very picky about who he chose, but she was insitiant that he *had* to make honors band. So, I showed up at their house almost every day for two months working with him, and sure enough, he made one of the two spots!

Lessons have continued weekly for now 4 years, and John's enthusiasm hasn't changed. It's  difficult because he won't practice, has never been engaging, but I try to do everything in my power to alter lessons to make sure we're playing songs he's into, etc. It's been tough.

We had our usual lesson yesterday, and his mom asked me if I could start coming two days instead of just one, and we scheduled upcoming dates. As I went to exit their house yesterday night out the front door, she didn't turn on the light and I didn't notice until too late that she had no shoveled any snow off the front stairs (I had entered the lesson through the side door), and it had turned to ice. I went flying off the top stair down onto the walkway, almost  landing on my head. I somehow was able to shift the guitar case I was holding and fell onto that as a cushion instead, which broke my guitar.

The mother was at the door the whole time when I fell, as she usually sees my out. She laughed and said ""Oopps!"". I was  still in that weird state of shock and said ""Lisa, you have to throw some salt on those stairs!"" and she said ""I didn't realize they hadn't been shoveled, I only go in the side door, but I will. Sorry about that."" 

Five minutes later I get a text from her saying ""We're not going to be taking lessons anymore. Thanks"".  This obviously came as a total surprise. As I said I've taught her son for years. No explanation, no call, just a text. This has to be because I fell down the stairs. 

So I want to get an opinion on how I should reply back. Do I just acknowledge it with an 'Okay', do more, or just not reply back? It definitely hurts a little because I put my heart and soul into my lessons with this kid. I remember my mom making me take piano as a child and hating it, so I know how he feels taking an instrument he's not into and I try to do everything to alter it around things that he is interested in. I've taught lessons for 20 years and have  never been in a situation like this, so I'd appreciate an opinion on the best way to reply. Thanks!

tl;dr- Taught a student  guitar for 4 years. Mom didn't  shovel snow off stairs which turned into ice. No lights on, and I fell down the stairs. Fired me immediately after via text, despite the fact we had just scheduled lessons at her request before I walked out the door. Wanted to know if I should respond to her text or not. Thank you!",11Jan2017,1

207,"29 male. UK. I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's 35.
My girlfriend and I have loads of shared interests, similar views on most things, and we're very good together. We went traveling together for a couple of months last year, have had a lot of experiences and support each other well.

I have a lovely house which we have a mortgage on together. It's in a great area. We have 2 cats. I'm generally very happy with life. But I'm about to split up with my girlfriend and throw it all away and I feel completely devastated.

Earlier in our relationship, and before we got a mortgage together, we discussed children. My girlfriend said she would have children. I was happy with this and was looking forward to starting a family with her later down the line.

After we'd been together a while, I wanted to make sure we were still heading in the same direction together. I asked whether she thought having kids together was still the right thing to do. She broke down in tears almost, and said I was the only person she'd ever wanted kids with and she would be really upset if we didn't have one. OK, so she still wants children.

She said she wanted to do some traveling before we had a child. I agreed that would be a good idea, took unpaid leave, and spent all of my savings touring around Asia for a couple of months.

A month or two after we got back, she tells me she doesn't want kids at all. She tells me she's never wanted kids, not since she was a teenager. I bring up the conversations we've had in the past about them. She said she cried when I said I might not want children because she didn't want the choice to be taken from her. The content of the other conversations she has completely different recollections of.

Her 2 closest friends have both had children recently. I don't know if they've put her off, or if she's just changed her mind or what. But she puts it to me now that I either love her enough to stay with her without children, or we break up.

I'd always just assumed kids would be part of my life, but when the position is put in front of me like this it really troubled me. I'm an only child and I don't really have any experience with kids. Do I actually want children? Would my life be happier with a family? Would I be happier leaving, and gambling on finding someone I love as much as I do my current girlfriend? There's nothing wrong with my life, why am I considering this?

I've spoken to friends, gotten advice from everyone I can, looked all over the internet at other people's scenarios. All for some clue as to what to do. I've reached the conclusion that there is no 'answer'. Everyone is different, everyone's situation is different, everyone's children are different.

The majority of friends I've spoken to are happy with their families and say they don't regret having kids. They say it's tough. Very tough. And it changes your life. But I just can't see my life feeling very fulfilled without a family. So I'm 99% certain I'm going to give it all up.

I feel some anger towards my girlfriend for saying she did want kids in the past. But I've told her I just want us both to be happy and to get what we want from life. I still love her and it really hurts and feels wrong doing this. But I worry I will resent her in future when the chance to have a family is gone.

So, there's my situation. I'm sure I'm not the first, or the last person to go through something like this, but I feel utterly gutted and nothing is making me happy at the moment. I welcome any advice, anecdotes, stories from people in similar scenarios, etc",11Jan2017,1

223,"Hello everyone, hopefully someone can give me some advice on how to navigate this situation.

My mother is 61 (62 in September) and is living with my brother currently. She ran a house cleaning business for the past few decades and that is the majority of her income. She was diagnosed with stage 5 breast cancer a few years ago and is (thankfully) now in remission. But due to this, she can't do physical work very easily. She is an artist and worked in grouphomes for the mentally ill, but that work experience is from at least ten years ago. She is on SSDI right now and receives 813.00 monthly. 

Right now, she lives in a very dilapidated trailer home. The trailer park is raising rent again and the home is becoming unfit to live in. There are major problems with the roof and ventilation system, all things that would be worthless to repair in a unit so old. There has also been gun violence and robberies in the area recently. Because of these factors, I feel the need to find a better place for her to live ASAP. The park will most likely allow her to sell the lot space back to them and then bulldoze the trailer. 

My brother works cleaning houses for her and is paying the bills. In the fall, he will be moving away to college in Wisconsin and will not be able to work for the family business anymore. Because of her low income (consisting solely of SSDI once he leaves), how can I find a place that she can qualify for? I would gladly co-sign for her but I'm 23 and my credit isn't stellar enough for that. 

Another note is that she has decided to put her cleaning business down as a subsidiary of my uncle's landscaping business, and I'm not sure if I can count that as her income in that case. She will not be working, but do I count his business as her business?

I know that Section 8 is not open at the moment, but I was thinking about Public Housing. Not sure about the wait lists for that program. 

In a nutshell, I need to find safe and cheap housing for my disabled mother (and hopefully her cat). I don't know how she will qualify with her SSDI as her sole income, and I don't know of anyone who can cosign for her. I would like to keep her close due to her illness, but she can't live with me (I'm in a small apartment with another student). She needs to move before fall of 2017. 

Any advice, resources, or help is appreciated. ",11Jan2017,1

I have long hours and therefore very little time for anything else. I'm just frustrated when I get home and don't want to do anything.

Their car had absolutely no signs of any damage; I was looking for about three minutes intensely at their bumper while they drove.  I didn't feel a thing when I slammed on the brakes, like, no end collision.  I must have been mere inches from their bumper, then.  Did I do anything wrong in this situation?

I am in a bit of pickle.  I was working a seasonal job and have a new job lined up plus a few other opportunities (including acting) that might put me in my best financial shape ever.  But I haven't worked in two weeks so I am low on funds.  All my money is coming in towards the end of the month and early next month.

I signed up for an acting class at a great school.  I just like to stay sharp.  After one week I dig it.  But I need some money.

I told them my situation and they usually don't do refunds after taking one class.  But they made an exception and offered me this: They can only give me half of what I got and use the other half for when I would want to come back.  And I could come back as early as next month.  

I did the math and the amount would be enough for me to complete my rent and have a little extra to eat until the paychecks start rolling in.  But it would take at least a week, at most 10 days to show up in my account.  I asked my mom to give me a loan as well.

240,"I just decided to tell you all how my last few years have passed in life,maybe i missed the topic but i want to tell this to someone ,to relief myself so I hope someone would understand me.I am 18 now I live in Croatia.

I  pretty much play basketball  all my life and when I was 11 or 12 I went to play for my local youth team.It was all going well.I had fun ,made some friends , I improved and played good. I was always one of the better players in team if not the best.And when I was 15 the main coach was changed. And right from the start he didn’t like.The reason for that is because my father and him didn’t like each other. (they were in a fight).So he was getting his revenge by psychological abusing me.I tried to somehow fix our relationship  by talking with my coach and it just could be solved,we argued and yelled at each other and I decided to QUIT the team.

So pretty much ,my life from that day  until now Is playing pickup games on outdoor courts all day.I became really good.That good that everyone that sees me for the first time asks me for what team I play and my answer is NONE.And my lifechanging day happened last year when my teacher asked me if I want to play basketball tournament(Its organized by all highschools in the town every year for FUN).       I said yes and we played just one game and the team we played against was against  the players that play for the local team juniors I quit few years ago.And I scored 30 + points against them.When I realise how good I am or how bad they are I decided that I want to become basketball player, after all it is my passion my whole life.And few weeks ago my friend asked me If I want to play on a 3v3 tournoment,I said yes.Our first game was against the team that won the tournament later.My teammates were very bad and we end up loosing 15 12 and I scored all 12 points.The opponents later said that I am very good,that they never seen a 6feet player that is so dominant.That tournament just rememnered me what I want to do in my life.

But the problem is I cant find a team to play in so now I am practicing whenever I can for no reason(I hope not).My every day life is now based on practice,weightlifting and watching basketball games and analyzing them to improve my game.I tried talking to some guy that is somehow involved in our local basketball Club but he didn’t take me seriously.He thinks I am a kid that is not good enough and he thinks I am lazy,but players that play for that team are really bad they cant even average 10 points and the league they play in is really bad.

Not even my parents understand me,they think I am wasting time playing it all the time.Basketball is only thing I want to do in my life.

244,"I'm 28 with a fairly low paying job ($100 in the bank and no savings right now) and I moved in with my Dad three years ago because he divorced my mother, his wife of 30 years.  I am a private investigator and caught her in an eleven year affair, which lead to the divorce.

My father was due to retire in two months from a lifelong career working for the Air Force (first joined as enlisted, fought in Vietnam, went to college, joined an an officer, was honorably discharged, and then worked as a civilian for the DOD for the rest of his life).  He was the most selfless and kindhearted person I've ever met and the thought of being 10% of the person he was almost seems like an impossibility.

He was driving to work this morning, hit some ice (because the county we live in has two working snow plows), and apparently had a heart attack.  Somebody found him much later.  I was woken up this morning by the coroner knocking on my door to break this to me.

Last night I said goodnight and we talked about how we were planning on going to the shooting range this weekend.  Today he's gone.  I can't even fathom how this is possible; he was seemingly in peak health, didn't smoke, didn't drink, ate right, exercised, all of it.  And there's a heart attack as he drives two blocks up the street.  The place he died is literally two blocks from the house.  He turned 67 last month.

I've called the funeral home, which has his body, and I need to see them tomorrow.  I've called his three family members on the other end of the country, who are flying out tonight and tomorrow.  I've retrieved his pickup from the place that towed it after he died (and charged me $150 for the 'service').  I've performed a password recovery on his email but since he regularly deletes his email there's nothing useful.

I am trying to find the attorney he filed his will with, which I am supposedly the sole beneficiary.  I've dug through thousands of documents today and see statements for bank accounts and credit cards and all kinds of things I have no idea where to begin with.  I see the power bill sitting on the counter and see it's due in a few days.  The personnel manager at the base called me to offer her condolences and let me know that they'd be in touch regarding benefits or something.  I know I need to contact a probate attorney too and reached out to a lawyer friend to give me a referral.

And I'm sad.  I am so sad.  He was my best friend.

From my earliest memory he was there for me, always encouraging me to push myself to my limits and be a good person.  Everything he did was for me.

Some of the the Christmas presents I got him are still in the living room.  We saw Rogue One together on Christmas and he was so excited for the next one.  And now he'll never get to see it.

I have literally nobody in my immediate life.  I am alone.  My girlfriend had to move to California for a job and we've been long distance.  His three siblings are flying out right now but live on the east coast and I'm in Idaho.

I am also the first to admit that I have zero friends.  I don't use Facebook or Twitter, have virtually nobody that I spend time with outside of work.  Prior to today my contact list in my phone (a flip phone at that) was my girlfriend, my dad, and my boss.  That's it.  Now it's tripled with all the people I've had to update on the horrible, horrible news.

He was the only piece of stability I had in my life.  I loved my dad with all my heart and I've fought with some pretty major depression for most of my life - especially in the years since I discovered my mother's affair.  He was always there for me, through anything, as I tried to be for him.  I am not processing this well.

So I guess my questions:

* How should I find his will?  I've found a lot of other documentation but not the will.  I know he has one (he specifically got it updated after the incident with my mother) but I can't find the attorney.  I have found his divorce attorney's paperwork but they aren't picking up.

* What do I need to do next?  Contact the probate attorney?  How will I pay for that?

* How do I determine his debts and assets?  I know his vehicle was paid off but he ended up going into debt paying off the thousands of dollars in BoTox my mother racked up before she left him.

* How do I determine exactly what bills he had been paying?  Power, cable, what?  I've only rented once before briefly and am totally lost.

* How can I deal with this crushing pain in my soul?  I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and recognize the stages of grief, but being IN them is another matter.

Thank you all.

Sincerely,
Dylan

**Edit 1:**  I promised you all I'd respond today but I am sorry to say I will have to put it off another day.  I had to spend my day with family, fighting to stay composed and making decisions at the funeral home, writing my father's obituary, trying to contact the attorney who might have his will who is MIA, and preparing for a service on Monday.  Last Monday Dad and I were talking about politics and Star Wars and what to have for dinner.  It's all so surreal and feels like a sick, terrible joke.

All of these thoughts were so painful.  We used to play golf and tennis all the time and were planning on doing it again.  He used to yell at the Minnesota Vikings every time football was on and I'd help him find the right streams.  I'll never hear that yelling again.  I'll never taste his cooking again.  All his family flew out and were helping out all day and I was expecting him to walk out of the other room the whole time, because he rarely got to see them all in the same room and I can't even imagine that picture without him.  I wish it was me and not him.  I honestly thought that I would go before him.

I was not ready for this gaping wound in my soul.  I have kept it together for the sake of family, for someone taking charge during the faux-sympathetic funeral home meeting with a money-grubbing casket merchant.  I have kept my tears to myself and pretended to laugh along with the family as we reminisced, while inside I see so much as a certain coffee cup or a DVD he never got to watch or one of the many gifts he bought for me throughout my life and I feel like taking an industrial drill to my forehead.

251,"Here are some examples of how my mind works sometimes.

About 15 or so years ago, when the Internet started becoming big, there was a shopping website called Cyberian Outpost.

""Cyber"" was a word, that, at that time (at least in my opinion), meant - more or less - ""internet or computer related"".

For all these years, I kept assuming that the word ""Cyberian"" in Cyberian Outpost was supposed to be a play on words between ""cyber"" and the Roman emperor Tiberius (things related to Tiberius' reign would have been called ""Tiberian"").

It was not until I was in the shower earlier this week that I realized, that Cyberian was actually (probably) just a play on words between ""cyber"" and ""Siberia"". What do you think? Was I thinking too much on this one?

Here is another example. About 10 years ago, when Kanye West started to appear in the media, I was not familiar with his name. I did not pay much attention to news articles about him, so just reading his name quickly, assumed his name was ""Kayne West"" (pronouced like ""Kane"").

One time a co-worker made some joke about Kanye West. I corrected the co-worker and said ""uh - I am pretty sure his name is pronounced 'Kayne' (sounds like 'Kane').""

This co-worker was like ""no, it's pronounced 'Kahn-yay'.""

I was pretty adamant and was like ""no, dummy - it's a play on words you moron! His name is a reference to Batman, duh!""

This co-worker looked at me like I had three heads.

I explained ""What was the name of the main character in Batman? Bruce WAYNE. Yes, WAYNE! Sounds like Kayne - doesn't it? Next, what was the name of the actor that played Bruce Wayne in teh Batman TV show? Adam WEST! Right? Get it now? Kayne (from Bruce Wayne) West (from actor Adam West). DUH!""

The thing is, I really believed that that was the correct answer. Haha.

So, my question is - do you think I overthink things or not?

253,"Hi. I am a 26 years old woman, long time lurker on this web but I have no idea if this is the correct sub for the post.

After finishing my degree, I moved to a new city with my boyfriend.I have no friends in here, so  the only person I can talk with is just my boyfriend. He got a job and I have a part time shitty job while I am looking for a better one. 

The problem is that I feel  my selfconfidence and my energy are pretty low right now; I don´t feel good enough to get a decent job, I feel anxious anytime I have an interview, or even the days that I have to work I will start the day feeling very anxious about the situacion, which is funny because I always end up having a good time  but it doesn´t even  matter because the next day I wil still feel like this. 
I used to be a very selfconfident person with an amazing attitude. 

I remember I had my first interview when I was 17. I wasn´t nervous, I was sure I would do it great and despite I didn´t prepare myself to the interview I got the job.

Now... everything seems to be too big for me. Going to work is like climbing the everest, I feel scared and insecure, but the worst comes when I get an interview for a new job. I feel HORRIBLE, which is stupid because If I send my cv I should be to get a responde.
Sometimes I end up having a big argument with my boyfriend for a very stupid reason that somehow affects me too much. I can explode and have some kind of attack where I can even hit my head against the wall or just hit myself. It´s awfull. And a few hours later I find myself wondering...what the hell just happened?
I don´t take any medication because I´ve never have any problem like this. Sometimes I think everything started in college. I went college because I had basically been brainwashed about it. You know, The "" go college or go poor forever"" mentality. It was very hard and unpleasant for my to finnish my degree, and that could be the reason why my selfconfidence was completly destroyed. 
But that´s not ans excuse, and I can´t explain the negativity that I feel; and the way that my rage explodes at stupid situations. My boyfriend is amazing, he always understand me, he listens to me and is incredibly empathetic . I know my behavior is unfair to him sometimes, he just takes away the importance of the situation but I want to know what´s my problem and solve it ASAP.
