0,"Hey guys, well I've just stopped crying out of anger and I need some help here. There's this guy and for a whole year he hasn't been able to leave me alone.

I won't go into full details because it could take me ages to explain, but this guy has made me hate my school. Humiliate me, embarrass me, made me feel like I was no one. You know the drill. He makes fun of my autism from time to time (last thing he said was at least I have a fucking functioning brain) I am not severely autistic. But it still gets to me because it hurts me a whole lot for obvious reasons.

I've tried to calm down things with this guy. Got the police involved, but he still kept messaging me and wouldn't leave me alone. He's grabbed me by the neck and made me feel like a coward.

He is probably going to confront me tommorow. 

I am a boxer. ex-kick boxer and know bits of wing chun. And he is a brown belt in Judo, He is slightly more muscly then me but I have no doubt I am faster and my reactions are better. So if anyone can help me think of a plan of how I can approach this guy and get least damage possible. It would help me a lot. 

Second thing is, I usually go into flight or fight response and freeze up completely and I don't know what to do. Is there anyway to overcome this so I can think straight? 

This will help me out so much guys, you have no idea.",16Jun2017,19

4,"Hey there, made a throwaway for this.

Was just looking for some general advice or tips on how to get women to respond on subs such as kikpals and alike?

I have a very low response rate, maybe 1 in 10. Im not horrible looking, by no means extremely hot but in good shape and have had a handful of women on there find me very attractive. I dont think im very good at selling myself though. Usually just give the ol ASL and username. But have found ones where I appear to have the exact same interests as someone and still no response.

I assume it could be a shear influx of messages most women would get, or a lot of them might just want top tier looks. But any advice for making your message standout?

11,"I am a freshman honors student at a University. I have a strong record of academic success as well as a highly regarded reputation for being a hard worker with good leadership and communication skills. I applied and was admitted into a summer research program for freshman at my university. I knew I was in since I started in the fall. 

All students who are part of the program are responsible for identifying a mentor by the start of May. The entire faculty is open to us, and everyone knows about it so it is well embedded in the university. We are then responsible for submitting a thorough project proposal outlining all we will do during the paid summer research job.

A mixture of depression/suicidal thoughts/lack of motivation/stress and, while I don't want to admit it, lazy procrastination, led me to push it off until the last minute. I kept getting warning emails about threats to have my spot revoked and I would then get an extension after explaining that I was working on it and I was going through personal issues. It is a week before the research term starts, and I just secured a mentor and am about to start drafting my proposal. I missed the deadline by a month for something I had 9 month to do. If I had any respect for myself left, I lost that too.

The person in charge of this program is aware of where I currently stand, and is allowing me to keep my position as long as I complete my paperwork as soon as possible. However, I feel embarrassed and ashamed. I have given her a terrible impression of myself. I was just so stressed that I pushed any thought of work out of my mind. I have identified what I can do to better in the future, but I still don't know how to fix this mistake.

Any advice on how to get off someone's bad side in a professional environment?",16Jun2017,1

13,"Hello reddit, I'm at loss here so I'm asking for advice. I'll try to keep it short: there are two entwined issues.

Me and a girl are friends with benefits (I'll call her Amber from now on). We have sex when we both feel like it, we have no problems hanging around the same group of friends etc. but we made it clear that this is not exclusive. If she goes out with the girls and likes someone, it's not my business, but we agreed (as every sane person would do) to keep our friends out of it. It woulnd't feel comfortable if I'd try to seduce one of her friends, for example. This has been going on for 2 years without problems.

Fast forward to April this year, my group of friends organizes a dinner at a cool restaurant on the seaside. I can't go that night, but Amber goes. Everything smooth.

Few days ago I accidentally discovered that she kissed a friend of mine at the dinner. I confronted her and she started the usual train of apologies - I was drunk, I don't know why I did that, etc. Pay attention: I'm not angry about loyalty - we are not together. I'm angry that she broke the deal we had and caused a stir in my group - you just don't do that. I asked her how would she feel if I did the same but with her friend. Now she feels bad and asks for forgiveness. She told me she did not tell me before because she was feeling embarrassed and guilty. She can do whatever she likes with other guys, but not a friend of mine who hangs out with us. Come on.

The thing that bothers me the most, however, is not a drunk girl kissing someone - it is the fact that I discovered this by accident. NOONE of my friends told me. I confronted one of the closest ones tonight and he told me that he fucked up. He didn't want to create confusion in the group and he thought that Amber would have told me. This is just bullshit to me - I asked him what would he think if I did the same thing with a girl he is seeing, without anyone telling him.

 This lead to an apology, to a 'I underestimated the situation, I should have told you'. Also: 'the guy who kissed her does not know you are friends with benefits'. So you are telling me that there are 20 'friends' of mine at the dinner and when this guy starts acting bold nobody says anything?  This event gave me the impression that this group is a free for all thing. Everyone is against everyone else and I can't seem to shake this impression - having sex with someone and being able to brag about it is, apparently, sufficient to backstab a friend.

So, I'm at loss. There is a part of me that wants to believe, that just wants to shake this off as a stupid, drunken accident. However, I'm a very rancorous person and I just can't seem to be able to forgive. I know that if I say 'ok, everything's like before' I will not be able to resist tongue in cheek comments and jokes just for the sake of provoking and irritating. My terrible train of thoughts considers the damage to be irreversible - you can't go back in time to undo that action, so I'll just fan the flames. 

Last note, we had another dinner planned on June 29. Amber told me she was anxious because she knew at the dinner the thing would resurface again - what the hell was she thinking? Fortunately I discovered this now...could you imagine a drunk me discovering this with the other guy in front of me? 

So what would you do? ",16Jun2017,1

- My math teacher loves the out doors abd used to work at rei, hes also a fan of tigers since the tiger was his college's mascot. He is also ofc big on math and also comp sci.
- My bio teacher likes foxes. Hes a big fan of Dc sports teams and settlers of Catan and also is really into biology and decorates his room with models of structures and foxs ( his middle name is fox). Hes also a red head and has a sense of humor incase anyone has any idea there.

Bestfriend - Female Age: 22
Me - Female Age: 22
Fiancé - Male Age: 21

So here's the background on what's going on. Last year my fiancé and I bought a house together, I encouraged my bestfriend to move in with us and thought it would be great because my fiancé and I were both deploying overseas for a few months so we agreed on her signing the final paperwork (gave her POA for this transaction) receiving the keys, doing the walk through and living in the home while we are gone. She was living in our for about 3 months by herself. Then my fiancé and I came back from deployment, so it has been the 3 of us for the past year. At first it was great and I enjoyed having another women in the home because she sometimes helped me clean. Now a year later, i feel like I can't have any privacy in my own home or like I have to share EVERYTHING with her. Now, it's got to the point where I feel like she is married into my finances family as well and to me, that's weird and annoying. She's always home and I'm sharing my entire life with her. My family (which I don't mind), my friends and my especially my finances family. I feel like my mother in law sees more of a daughter in law than me. I want her to move out so I can finally get some space but I don't want to loose her as a bestfriend (since 2008). Initially, I did offer for her to move in but now I regret it and I don't know how to tell her. I just feel like I have nothing that I can call ""mine"" because I'm always having to share with her and sometimes I feel like I'm competing with her as well. Oh and now she's in a phase where she's bringing her new boyfriend home and constantly bickering back and fourth with my fiancé. I need advice on how to handle all this!

Plus it's in a major city, which is a huge bonus to me since I grew up in the suburbs. 

A little while after I relocated, I got accepted to a PhD program. This program recently hired some amazing people in my field (both scholars and from industry) who would be great professional connections to have. The PhD is fully funded, I've already made friends with others in my cohort, and the location has great nature/weather. However, it's in a pretty expensive suburb and my stipend is barely above the poverty line. I would be living in low-income housing and would have to deal with driving everywhere, nothing open late, etc. 

Academically, I'm worried I would be forced to spend more time writing/researching than actually creating useful products. Since these new professors just started, there is also a lot of uncertainty about what future research projects and course offerings will look like. The lab I would be working in has no windows.

I already asked and deferring my admission isn't an option. My master's GPA dropped significantly after I applied (cumulative &lt; 3.0), so I am not sure I could get accepted again. However, I also don't want to leave my job after only 6 months.

I'm worried about my son. Lately he hasn't been himself. He sleeps a lot more often than normal, and even when he's not sleeping he just lies in bed for hours, not making a sound, not even on his phone. He used to play a lot of Xbox, and as far as I know had a fair amount of friends on it. Now he's talking about selling it because he says no one talks to him anymore. 

He's also been beating himself up over his weight. Even though I know he's trying to hide it, I'll notice him reading through diet books or articles, but when I offer to help him (buy healthier options, help prep meals) he just says don't worry about it and keeps eating junk food. I know he wants to slim down but he's been trying for two years now and he just can't stay consistent and I think it's broken his will. 

Finally, I know it's an artist curse to overly criticise their own work, but I just don't understand his disappointment at his drawing. He wants to be a concept artist (that's what he calls it) and his art is beautiful  (not just Mom bias talking) but everytime he shows me his art, he's always talking about how terrible it is, how he'll never get a job as an artist, etc. Nothing ever positive. 

I just don't know what to do. I've tried reassuring him, letting him know I'm there for him every step of the way, and have even gone ahead and done things like cooking healthier in general to help him, but he seems so depressed all the time now, so removed from everything.

I am 20 years old and live in California. I have been, and always will be, an entrepreneur at heart. Since elementary school I have always been determined to be financially successful. Somewhere around sophomore or junior year I set for myself, the goal of being a millionaire by the time I'm 30. I have already made significant steps towards this goal and am on track to accomplishing it. I am a highly driven person and am determined to accomplish any goals that I set for myself.

Life has presented me with the opportunity of starting and building a company in the newly legalized medical Marijuana industry here in California. I have 6 years of experience in agriculture (I started doing various labor tasks at an apple orchard in 8th grade such as weed whacking and worked my way up to orchard manager during my senior year of high school.) I have legally grown marijuana for only my own personal use since I moved out  (I am very confident in my knowledge of the industry/plant and the financing of my business is not an issue). Personally, I have very little hesitation towards starting a business in this industry, however, my father has some serious objections.  

My dad was a cop for 30 years and is very conservative on social issues in general (you can probably guess for yourself what he thinks of legal weed lol). When I told him that I was looking into investing in the industry he said that he will always love me no matter what, but he will never approve or support me in that goal and would be ""disappointed if I chose that path"". I accept that his views on marijuana, as factually flawed as they are, will probably never change and certainly wont change through pushing my own views onto him so I don't debate it with him. He also said that most of his side of the family (aunts, cousins, grandma, etc) would never support it either and might ostracize me for it.  I know I have two uncles that would be against it, but to be honest, the rest of my family are wild cards since they never talk about politics (Most of them lean moderate to very liberal, my dad and and uncles are the exception). I also have one of the best relationships with my grandma out of my entire family and I know that she will support me no matter what. I very highly doubt that I would ever be condemned or disowned if I chose to do this, but the possibility of it negatively affecting how my family sees me is defiantly a risk. 

I know that it would be unreasonable for me to expect people not to bat an eye when I tell them I basically grow weed for part of my income, but is the stereotype associated with the industry significant enough to consider avoiding it entirely? (Keep in mind that although I do personally smoke weed in my free time, I am about the furthest from a stereotypical stoner you can get. You would never be able to tell me apart from others in the business world.  Except for my results on a drug test haha).   

I have always had a good relationship with my dad and the rest of my family and I don't want to put that in jeopardy. But at the same time, I know myself well enough to understand that if I don't take advantage of the opportunity to at least try and succeed (or fail) in this nascent and equally lucrative industry, I will be kicking myself for not doing it the rest of my life.

I'm starting to feel that I have arrived at my first ""real-world"" dilemma between making a really big step towards my overall goal of total financial freedom, and the possibility of hurting my relationship with some family members and how they see me. I have very limited life experience in dealing with situations like this so I am asking the wiser and more experienced Redditors out there for their thoughts and advice. Anything helps and is appreciated!

81,"So me and my friend are both 17, his father was killed in a motorcycle accident. He texted our friend group letting everyone know what happened vaguely and that he's gonna need some time. I said that if he needs absolutely anything or if he needs anyone to talk to that we would all be there. His relationship with his dad was kind of a tough one, his dad is a pretty masculine person while my friend did as much as he could to fulfill that role his father wanted him to have. My buddy is also a really rational person but I know all rational people have bad time, and my friend is no exception. Really, my worry is he'll drink a lot and this might turn into an issue.

89,"Hi r/advice,

First time poster here, I really need to figure out how to deal with what's going on.

So a quick back story. I'm a teenager(M15) living at home with both my parents, I have two sisters but they both completed university already. My parents were both born poor and managed to rise to the middle class and have a successful family and life. For both my sisters childhoods, my father worked and my mother was a housewife. Since I'm the last child at home and I can generally take care of myself, my mother has started working again. Along with my father starting to ease into retirement (he's older), and we moved houses not to long ago. What I'm trying to say is there has been a lot of changes around our family, and that's cause some conflict.

I never thought my parents ever fought, I assumed they were generally aligned in there values. But today my mother decide to talk to me about how they've been having lots of fights. Lots of disagreement. She told me how they argue about small things like what car to buy or whether or not to paint the house. However, my mother thinks they have very different values and goals. She thinks they're ""incompatible"". Like she thinks all of my fathers friends are lazy and vice versa. She wants him to focus on his career and not get distracted with hobbies while he wants to work less, lose weight and have more recreation time. 

What I'm trying to say is my parents are thinking about separating. They don't think they can work it out. I personally think that with open communication and maybe seeing a marriage counsellor they can work out their problems. I never thought I would ever see their marriage of 27 years come this close to falling apart. I'm really afraid for the future. I obviously don't want them to split, but I rather them be happy on their own than miserable together.

I guess I want to ask whether anyone's been in a similar situation. What happened? What did you do to affect the situation? What can I do to help them? How can I bring them closer together? How should I go about tackling this issue?",16Jun2017,1

95,"I have a summer job at a place that is basically a bunch of routines in the morning and evening, and sitting around while waiting for people to ask for help.

I wouldn't say I hate it, but I'm getting second thoughts about it. I've only had one of these so far, but there are shifts where I have to work evening until 12 PM (technically people have fallen asleep by this point, but I have to be up in case someone comes down since technically my shift doesn't end). I then have to be awake at 6 AM the next day, doing a bunch of routines. I'm new at the job, so I'm fairly slow and while the minutes aren't crucial, the people I assist do need to get to their respective jobs so I can't be too slow. It takes a really long time for me to fall asleep, so I won't even get five hours of sleep these shifts.

Now, this all sounds absolutely horrible to me while I'm typing this (might not to you), and it's only for the summer. But I'm tired after work. I don't have too many friends that I can hang out with whenever, but I can't make plans with them either because I work some weekends. Now, that doesn't mean the hours are long and that I'll never get off work, because of course I do.

But I have tiny hobbies, hobbies I want to enjoy doing. But when I get home from work, I don't want to do anything but watch Friends and rest. My personal deadlines I have for my hobbies might not be met (these are not crucial, but I'd like to do something I enjoy a lot as well).

The people I work with are absolutely wonderful. I enjoy every single one of them. They're glad to help and are supportive. I don't have anything against any of them. But I'm embarrassed when I fail to do something I have to do. There's a lot of responsibility and while it's not super hard every day, I'm dreading needing to do much.

I'm also embarrassed when assisting someone on this home, because it's very often very difficult to understand them. I'm worried I'll upset them because of this, and just anxious that I'm doing something wrong.

Most shifts have decent starting hours. I don't need to go up super early unless I have to be there for some special reason. I'm also piss poor and I have not even gotten my first salary yet. I don't want to find a new job, but I want money to have a decent summer and some left when I'm studying, even though I will have money while studying.

I just got second thoughts about this job today, but when I doubt something, I can doubt for a long time. I might be immature, but if I get criticised for something it's hard for me not to take it personally and I get embarrassed for doing a bad job.

What do I do? I don't need money to survive the summer, but I don't have an extreme amount of free time either. I definitely would have preferred something else, but this isn't an impossible job either, just drains me a bit.

Edit: When I don't sleep over for the night, there are still things to do during the day. So I either have something to do or sit in front of the t.v.",16Jun2017,1
99,"So this is going to be a little long but still, I'll do my best shortening it.

A little over 3 years ago I was having my 18th birthday and I was so excited to enter school A (which is REALLY good for Computer Science which is the field I like the most) but somehow I got depression which I think it was there and got aggravated by some facts that happened to me, like me moving on from an ex-girlfriend from a long time (it was 6 months since she break up with me but she still talked to me and convinced me to hang out sometimes so I got hurt more) and it wasn't pleasuring as well as dealing with my parents being separated and at the same time knowing my mom wasn't the best after all because I realized some things she did were not good for us despite she tried to make it up and maybe too the fact of dealing with my problems by hiding in League of Legends, all that led me to drop school A after just nine months and doing so bad at the first term. Then I switched to school B which seemed nice because in that moment I thought Software Engineering would be way cooler than Computer Science and imagined it would have harder challenges (which I love), but after two years of getting above-average grades I began to tear apart in this term and it felt so bad, like being torn apart from what I like the most because I felt useless, incapable of doing a simple program in C++ (which is my best language so far despite I'm not that good at it). This feeling hasn't gone yet but I can someway ""control"" it to do some things *I need* to do so I don't get kicked out of this school (it would be ironic since it is way easier than school A but WAY MORE boring, in fact school A was nice not only because of the level of challenges there but because I actually liked them and here the challenges are not really cool or rewarding).

Now that was a little context, I'm about to know if I get kicked or not from school B because of performing so bad, and after being afraid of a real talk with my dad I recurred to him and asked him what could I do. He got me to choose:

 * Stay at school B (located 30 miles away from home)

 * Seek another school C (at a similar distance)

The problem here is, I don't really want to stay at school B but I am *halfway* to get it done. And I don't like the idea of looking for a school C in the same distance because the one I would suggest, despite it would seem similar to school A, it's really expensive. I don't know how to bring up the subject of going to school A again (located about 125 miles away from home). He said this is my **last** chance and I firmly think the problem is me avoiding problems to just create *more* problems by doing so. I'm going to a therapist to solve that and many more problems but a fact is, I don't want school B (despite I made very good friends there) but I do want school A.

Something to consider:

 * School A's program lasts 5 years and I am already 21 years old. I'd have to start again.

 * I'm willing to do my best to shorten that time down to 3 years.

 * I don't know in how much time my problems would be completely under control nor if I would have to make a lot of changes to myself.

 * I don't mind having to study almost all day

 * If I focus onto something, I achieve it (like Mythic WoW raiding)

 * I can learn *really* fast but I am not very proud of some uses I have done with this ability (studying one day or two before and acing tests with it despite not going to school in tons of days)


I need advice to choose whether stay at B and end it in 2 years or 2 years and a half (it's the time left in which I would end the major) OR convince my dad to let me get back in A and end it ASAP, while enjoying it and going to a therapist until I can control my problems. Could you please help me?

100,"I graduated from high school in 2004, and spent the next five years struggling and failing my way through a local community college. I eventually dropped out, and have been steadily working since 2009 in three consecutive dead end jobs (at least I can hold those down). I've reached the end of my rope with the third, and while I've been sending out applications for new jobs, I came to the conclusion that I'm not only ready, but I need to go back to school to move toward a career I'm actually interested in. 

I have only a few credits from community college, so I'm effectively starting over again wherever I go. Going back to community college is a possibility, but I would prefer to dive right into a bachelors program, online or otherwise. I'm not sure how my work experience would tie into applying, as I suspect the admissions offices at schools here in Washington state will likely be uninterested in my old high school transcripts, my SAT scores, or my previous college credit. Additionally I will need to work my way through the financial aid system this time around. 

Any suggestions or advice on getting into/going back to school at 32 as well as the nightmare of FAFSA would be appreciated. I have been and will continue to be doing extensive research on my own, it's just been a little stressful and I keep running into dead ends. Thanks. ",16Jun2017,1

112,"Father's day is this Sunday here in France and I'm not sure what to do. Due to my dad generally being an asshole to me these last two years (I could go into more details in an edit if you'd like), I have finally decided to stop forgiving his behavior every time and started downright ignoring him as much as I could, which is relatively easy to do because I only see him on week-ends. Note that I haven't vowed to never talk to him again or anything, I simply expect an honest apology. Problem is, this man is a stubborn old fart and too narcissistic to ever apologize for anything.

The thing is, I've tried not to involve my mom and older brother in this, the former because I'm not confident she'd understand, and the latter because one of the major reasons I'm angry at my dad is because of his blatant favoritism towards my brother, and I don't really want him to notice that. I don't want him to feel guilty or ruin his relationship with my dad.

However on Sunday, as is tradition, I am expected to wish him a happy Father's day, generally be nice to him, and most importantly in this case, sign a card. I have no intention to do any of this because from my point of view he's been a shit dad for a year of two now. So my mom is bound to react, but I'm not sure what she'll do exactly. So I have a few options:

* Suck it up and do it anyway, only to go back to ignoring him for another year.
* Talk to my dad alone and try to have him apologize.
* Talk calmly with both of my parents like normal adults, in the hope that my mom understands.

First option is the easy way out, but I, too, am stubborn, and reeeaaally don't want to pretend, even for a day. Plus this won't solve anything and I'll go back to being cold to him the next day.

Second option is hard because initiating a conversation with him at this point is extremely awkward, and I'm pretty sure I'd fail to make him understand anyway. Plus I might cry because I always do when trying to have a serious conversation with my parents, which completely destroys any credibility I might have. Fucking hormones.

Third option is hard as well because my mom is kind of a wild card. First of all I am floored that she hasn't yet realised how much of a shitty dad, and sometimes shitty person her husband is. She's explicitly said to me she thought favoritism was the worst thing a parent could do, yet doesn't bat an eye at my dad being all over my brother while treating me like I'm not even his daughter. Maybe she's in denial? The good thing about this option is that my mom is usually way more rational and calm than my dad when having an argument, but that's not 100% of the time so I can't predict what she'll do since it depends on a bunch of factors like her mood. And again, even if I try to explain myself calmly, I *will* cry, and it might end in a full-blown yelling contest, at which point my brain completely shuts down and I can't think straight anymore.

So there you have it, unsure of what I should do. I'm more leaning towards the first option because I haven't mentioned this but I'm currently studying for my finals *which will literally decide if my university kicks me out or not*, and I really, really don't have time to be worrying about how to act around this toxic asshole. Just writing out this post already wasted way too much time.

TL;DR: My dad is a dick, I'm ignoring him, but Father's day is coming up and my mom will start asking questions if I don't act like nothing is wrong. Problem is, I can't keep my emotions in check when arguing, and I don't have time for this shit right now. So I'm thinking of pretending to like him for a day even though it won't solve anything.

EDIT: nvm my mom anticipated the problem, came to talk things out with me, made me talk to my dad and now we're mostly cool although he didn't apologize. MVP mom.",16Jun2017,1
113,"Hey guys, 

So on the desperate quest of finding a house to live in, my 2 friends signed a lease for a 4 bedroom house. There are four of us and only two on the lease.

Leading up to this I was hesitant about many things, many personal reasons but also on the idea that the price seemed 'too good to be true'. The first Google result when I typed in the address led me to the bed bug registry-- needless to say, I was extremely alarmed. The two reviews from 2015 were really aggressive, so when I showed them to my friends, they took it with a grain of salt and determined it must have been someone who simply had a bad experience with our landlord. 

My friend asked the realtor who showed us the home if the house ever had bed bugs and she brushed it off, saying 'no', but that it gets treated for preventative measures every year. 

Fast forward, I was the last one to move into the house, 2 weeks into the lease. On my 3rd night, I am struck with the news that we indeed have bed bugs. My two roommates who moved in first had bites on their bodies and spotted several on their sheets. Because I was so new, I don't think they had made it to my room.. yet.

I left immediately, and now I'm living back at my parents home. I grabbed all my clothing and ran it through the dryer.. still currently living out of bags because I'm not sure what my next step is. There have been two fumigations with a bed bug spotting in between (read below)

*Also, the home is a duplex and only our side is being treated currently.

So my question is now two fold--

1.) This was certainly indicative of an existing problem because bed bugs take a bit longer than two weeks to hatch I believe. Because the home was vacant prior to us moving in, they must have been hiding in the walls waiting for a food source to come out (humans). No legal implications since the landlord took action promptly, but still seems extremely dodgy since we were lied to about the home never having bugs. Question here-- it's since been two weeks and there have been two fumigations. The follow up was rushed because a surviving bed bug was spotted in clear daylight. When do you know the problem has subsided? My roommates have finally begun to unpack their stuff, but I fear that it may be premature. I am not sure if that surviving bug was indicative of an infestation much more grave than we imagine. 

 2. I am not on the lease, so I can legally walk away and find someone to take my place. I would have to wait 2 months since I've paid the next + last AND I'm sure no one would move into a home with such a recent bug problem. Is this problem sufficient reason to leave a place? I am nervous that these bed bugs are going to come back, and maybe I would rather cut my losses. I also fear that if I leave, and the bed bugs don't come back, then I'll live with a massive regret. 

Has anyone experienced bed bugs? How long was the timeline for you. If you had the option, would you have moved out?",16Jun2017,1
114,"may I ask your advice on something. 

My mother [in ireland] has a trip booked to USA in July but she doesn't want to go and so she's trying to get a refund from the airline. 

She is saying to the airline she is concerned about my new diagnosis [epilepsy, last week], and that the last time she was away [in Spain] I went to hospital. 

The airline are looking for proof of my diagnosis to grant her the refund, so she's asking me [27/F/NURSE] for a letter or something similar to give to the airline.

1. If she was so concerned the last time she was away would she not have ended her trip early and come home?

I asked HR to sign the forms back in November - ""your main manager will sign the forms once you are assigned a main manager"". I got assigned a main manager a month ago, and asked him twice to sign the forms. No reply.

I then get assigned my line manager, so I ask him to sign the forms too. Yet again, no reply.

137,"Hello Reddit! This is my first time using this site, as my coworker suggested I ask here about my dream, so here's a little backstory.

I'm a 22 year old female in Washington state with a variety of job experiences, and while I have had a lead (supervisor) position, I have never been a manager before. I have some college but never finished, but I plan on going back this fall to get an AA in Business. My credit currently is poor only from maxed out credit cards, but that's an easy enough fix. I live with my family and boyfriend currently, so rent is fairly cheap, and overall my bills are only about $1,000 total.

Ultimately my end goal and dream is to own a fast food franchise because I'm really good at doing fast food myself. However I have absolutely no idea where to begin on owning my own franchise, and I could really use some advice of where to get started. 

Also I have several business and self help books including some by John Maxwell that I will be rereading to get me into a business owner mindset.

So... where and how do I get started?",16Jun2017,1
138,"I'm looking to move permanently to the USA, and I have been reading quite a lot about the subject, however, from what I've been reading, the process to actually get the green card I'd need to make myself a permanent resident seems to be quite harsh for someone who has no connections inside the country itself, and is not a refugee; other than the green card lottery, I haven't found any means of getting it.

As a little backstory, I'm a single 23 year old male who's working and trying to become financially stable and independent, but due to my country's economical state it can become really hard to get your feet off the ground in any respect (in the USA the minimum wage is three times that of Portugal). That would be my main catalyst for moving right now, but if I someday decide to start a family, I really don't want my children to be born here, for fear things will get worst and worst. Even though I have a lot of experience in my area of work (low level programming and engineering), and while I'm working as a programmer at the moment, I don't have a university degree, and as such, I don't think I'd get in through a job offer.

For the past week or so, I've been having some very pretty realistic dreams. Realistic in the sense that I create many situations, dialogues, visuals, and feel many emotions. I don't remember having so many dreams like this for this long.    

In my dreams, a girl from where I was working keeps showing up. From the first time I saw her, I thought she was very pretty and I suppose I've been infatuated ever since. I am very certain she doesn't like me, even as a friend, but I can't seem to stop thinking about her subconsciously. I haven't seen her in a couple of weeks and I most likely won't see her for a long while. I want to stop think about her, but I guess I can't since I don't talk to any other girls.    

I think these dreams stem from not having *anyone* to talk to, and from some stress I've been under. I've been having some trouble with my family at home, and I have nothing to do right now and feel on edge and lost.    ",16Jun2017,1

152,"I'm doing ok right now. I graduated high school and my parents are paying for college

So life itself is good. BUT there's this one friend I CAN'T get rid of no matter what I try.
When I was younger, I was too empathetic. I joined a small private school in 7th grade. Private schools are different in that there's not a lot of people so there are sometimes kids with no school friends because they're too weird/mean/don't fit in with the others. I, not knowing better, befriended the weirdo of our grade. My other friends at that school sorta warned me but I just ignored that, figured if the guy had a friend he'd improve. We became best friends fast. Over the course of our 2 year friendship I began to resent him more and more. He slowly became more controlling, insulting, irritating, self-centered, etc... And I really couldn't handle it anymore

The summer before high school I cut all contact with him. Then, the next school year, I pretended to have no access to my electronics so I wouldn't have to text him outside of school. That was the only way to avoid him. So I did it another year. That meant I couldn't really post on social media :( or go on Facebook. And if I texted friends I had to tell them to pretend we didn't text. Which got tiring. All to avoid the boy.

10th/11th grade he tells me he's suicidal/self harming. Ok?? I ignore. He gets worse, but finds other younger kids to befriend/manipulate. Then he gets a hold of my best friend and I can't let him destroy her life so I got back into contact with him. 

I figured going off to college would save me but... unfortunately he's only a 3 hour drive away and is already planning to visit... he's still mean and manipulative and also a total money leech, never pays for ANYTHING, and I assume he will continue being this way through college. 

So.. what do I do? If I cut off contact with him or tell him I don't want to be his friend he may start hurting himself again or start hurting my younger friends. I don't want that. But I also don't want him dragging me down my whole life. I've been nothing but compassionate to him for the 2 years of our middle school friendship and that didn't change him at all so there's nothing I can do. I'm stuck between my peace of mind and his crazy need to have me in his life. I don't want to be the reason he kills himself but at the same time I'm almost tired of caring.",16Jun2017,3
155,"My wife is an introvert, and generally has a hard time making friends. We just moved to a new city, so I don't have a lot of friends either, but a few months ago my occupational therapist and I hit it off. We get along very well and have hung out a couple of times, and have been at her house three times, where I met her husband. He was there every time.  My wife has not been able to meet them because of her work schedule as a lawyer.

So... OT girl happens to be attractive, and my age. While I do think she's beautiful, I love my wife and am purely interested in a friendship, and I am sure that OT girl feels the same way. 

My wife has an issue with me hanging out with OT girl because she has not met her yet. She says she trusts me but doesn't want me to hang out with her again until she meets her, so she can read the situation and body language. To be fair, my wife has suggested we grab dinner with OT girl and her husband but it hasn't worked out because of bilateral schedule conflicts... We are supposed to get a drink on Thursday but my wife is not feeling it because her mom flies in on Saturday and wants to dedicate her time to the house, and also because she is on a complicated case that keeps her at the office until 8 or so. I said that I could go without her if she was going to be stuck at work so that we don't come across as flaky. She was not happy with that offer...

I don't agree with her attitude, I am happy to have finally made a friend who I enjoy spending time with. Yeah, it's a new thing in our relationship but she knows that growing up I always had female friends, and she knows that she can trust me, it's been 8 years and I've never given her a reason to doubt me. AND her husband will be there.

I say she doesn't get my position, but she argues if we reversed roles I would ask the same of her. I am being defensive because I don't want to lose a friendship, it's been a long time since I've had a meaningful friendship. 

My wife admits it's because OT girl is attractive, which I understand, but I stand by my position of wanting to nurture a friendship, nothing more. 

At this point, I am frustrated with everything that is going on. I don't want to be unfair, I don't want to bring conflict into my marriage, but I am pissed at the way this is playing out.

I'm rambling... 

I don't know if my position is unfair, or if I'm being irrational by thinking it's not a big deal to have a friendship with an attractive woman that I see once a week for occupational therapy... any thoughts?

It's only this friend and when he mentions that guy. If he mentions anyone else, I'm fine but not when he mentions the other guy.

I guess I'm asking why this happens and how can I get over it. It's so stupid and trivial but I can't help thinking about it. I know it probably has to do with my non-existent self-esteem or something similar but I can't tell for sure.

I worked with Vector Marketing for 6 months and I sold a fair amount of product while there.

Now that you know my credentials, I have been looking for a more ""normal"" (for lack of better word) job recently being that I need a reliable source of income with college approaching. AT&amp;T has always been an ideal job for myself being that I have always been very up-to-date with new the new technologies and phones being released annually. Therefore, I walked into my local AT&amp;T store and asked a manager if they were hiring and he very kindly stated ""we sure are at the moment, please apply online"" and I replied ""thank you very much"". To shorten my story up, I applied online for an opening as a part time retail consultant and soon after received an email with a link to take a ""pre-employment test"". I researched the test and was sure to be prepared on how to answer the questions in such a way that is parallel to what the hiring managers are looking for. I was even prepared for the trickiest of questions that any normal human being would answer incorrectly. I then took the test and after about two separate rounds of questions I was told to ""take my hand off of the mouse and relax"" because based on the answers I had so far, it wasn't needed for me to answer any more questions. This made me feel uneasy at first but as I continued reading it explained that I am not required to answer any more questions because I either ""answered appropriately and am now good to go"" or ""did not answer adequately and failed the test"". It then stated to check my emails often because AT&amp;T may try to contact me via email. Based on the information have provided you guys with us there anyone out there that can give me any insight on how likely I am to be hired? Any current or former AT&amp;T employees with insight would be greatly appreciated, however anyone with meaningful insight is more than appreciated as well! Thanks.

170,"I just finished my master's degree and am officially a PhD student (as of today).  We have a break from regular classes from now through the end of October.  

I am fortunate enough to have received a training grant to support my PhD.  This includes health insurance and a small stipend (not a lot of money, but enough to pay rent and groceries and have a little bit extra).  For this training grant, I am required to do ~10 hours of work per week related to my research.  

I do have a couple of projects to work on over the summer, but I am feeling incredibly guilty about how little work I have to do.  I'm thinking it will be about 10-15 hours of work tops.  I feel like a 24 year old should not be relaxing for 4 months of the year.  It especially hits me around rush hour when I see people going to their jobs and I'm just hanging around, or when I'm wandering around town in the middle of the day when everyone is at work.  This probably sounds a bit extreme, but I feel like I'm being a bit of a drain on society.  Furthermore, while my training grant is enough to live on, I think I should be saving some extra money.  I'm just a bit burnt out from school and work and a break would be nice.  It just seems hard to justify.    

Come September, I will have an additional teaching assistant job (extra money and time) and will be starting up classes/dissertation work.

173,"I wasn't too sure what flair to add to this post. My post is kinda personal, about family, and pretty serious. 

As I'm sure most folks know, hoarding is emotional baggage that has manifested in a physical way. Since I can remember, I've never lived in a clean home. There has always been clutter. There's always been excess and with that comes the buildup and filth. I'm tired. My family, I'm sure, is tired. However, what seems to prevent my parents from losing their minds and remain complacent in their unacknowledged hoarding is the constant traveling and trips away. They are never home for too long before the mess becomes realized and disturbing. 

So... where I come in... I'm home for the summer. Every year is the same: we talk about the house and the state of clutter, we talk about how we are going to attack it, we clean for a week or six and then we become tired and overwhelmed. I want to fix this issue. I can't live in the house like this. I have to do something about it. 

Just yesterday, I cleaned the fridge out (wiped down the grime, threw out expired and rotting food, and reorganized everything) and my work went unacknowledged and I thanked by my family. I probably spent 3 hours on just the fridge (I haven't even started in the freezer). 

I guess the point of this post is to ask if there is something that I could tell myself when I feel no one will care ether way if the house is cleaned. I need motivation for continuing this work. It's not a light job and will likely be a summer project. My parents in the past have offered to pay and that very well could be the only tangible motivation I get from them. I'd take any advice, like where to start, how to organize different spaces, how to strategize, etc etc without losing my marbles.

186,"So i got my ""girlfriend"" pregnant about 8 or 9 months ago (getting close). When it first happened it started as a one night stand sort of thing and then she developed feelings for me. I was trying to establish feelings around the time but just wasnt as into it and I broke up with her for a short time then i had 20/20 hindsight about the whole thing and she took me back and as the pregnancy continued she would keep breaking up with me and then changing her mind (we both chalked it up to the pregnancy and the hormones). She decided she doesnt want to be a couple for the expressed reason that she would just keep breaking up with me and didnt want the stress of our relationship (which makes sense particularly because for the most part we still carry on like a couple and the love still seemed to be there). In the last two months or so she has become very distant and cold and seemingly unconcerned about my feelings regarding our relationship. That being said, I understand that she is in the hardest part of this pregnancy and probably doesnt have alot of time or patience to deal with our relationship or my insecurities regarding the future and I've been doing my best to put my feelings to the side and remain supportive but I just have this sneaking suspicion and ever growing feeling that she just plain isnt in love with me anymore but that she's afraid to let me go because of the baby. As much as I love her I dont want to be with someone who isnt in love with me anymore but im terrified to jump the gun and make any selfish decisions, especially if im just reading this whole thing wrong. I cant even bring our relationship up without her avoiding the conversation entirely or trying to put space in between us and I feel like with the baby being so imminent and the recovery time and everything else; my feelings and our relationship is going to continue to be sidelined. Im trying to be strong about this but im losing my mind. I wake up everyday with my heart in my stomach afraid to even bring it up.

As i said in the headline, any advice from mothers in particular but also fathers that have had a similar experience would be very welcome.

187,"Hi, I'm a baccalaureat student in CS who mainly manages his diet by instinct, budget and time needed to cook. As you can imagine I do not eat very well due to there constaints and due to lazyness (or lack of time I guess). Sometimes, I skip many meals (mostly breakfasts) and other times I eat snacks enough to cut the hunger and keep productivity high. I also waste a lot of food and money by eating on campus instead of bringing lunch.

I want to cut the bad food from my diet and stop wasting good food that ends up not being cooked. My idea right now would be to add soylent in my day to day to replace some meals (not all of them, maybe 1 or 2 a day, sometimes none if possible).

The question is: Is there any food professionnals or anyone out there that could convince me if either I should or not start consuming soylent? I would highly appreciate a scientific point of view on the pros and cons of soylent!

189,"For the last couple months my friend and I have been trying to plan a two week backpacking trip abroad. We had discussed it early in the year but have only gotten around to planning it recently. Both busy people, it has been hard to meet up to plan  (we also don't live close to each other) and she has been very unwilling to work with me over the phone or through email. 

The planning process has been beyond frustrating but I was so relieved to FINALLY finish finalizing plans this week - having booked everything but the flight. Two days later she texts and tells me her parents want to come along and she is going to send them our itinerary and google maps plan so they can plan.

The issue is, the planning process had already left me with a bad taste in my mouth that we are probably not compatible travelers and now her parents are coming? I don't even know her parents. I have only known my friend for 9 months, we are grad school friends and I enjoy her company but she has deeply frustrated me lately and now I feel confused and annoyed by this latest development.

My question is, am I being irrational with this frustration at her parents joining us? Beyond that, I had been wanting to not go on this trip for a while but didn't want to bail since it was only supposed to be the two of us. Since her parents are going (and also BECAUSE her parents are going) can I back out? How do I back out. 

Any advice is appreciated.


Update: thank you all! I think honesty is the best route (I just hate the confrontation) and I really appreciate the validation that I received on this.

So my older brother is currently going through some life issues. Him and his wife are currently going through a divorce and they have a 1 year old child.

Because they are separated, i recently came to California for 2 months to help him out through these hard times; taking care of the baby and such while he works, Also to keep him company(He had a really bad/abusive relationship, so hes a little despressed/lonely- However its nothing severe).

I was originally suppose to leave in another month to go back home(VA/DC; to continue college/work. However my family recently contacted me and asked if i could stay till January.
 
I would love to help my brother, but i absolutely hate it over here.
First my brother and i barely get along. We dont fight or anything, but we barely interact with each other. I honestly miss living with my  family in (va/dc), were a huge family and get along great. So staying is insanely depressing and sucks.

I dont want to leave my brother alone for the next six months, however i seriously cant see myself being able to stay.This whole situation is eating at me...............

I checked Whitepages and it was a legit number, but when I asked my dad, he said he didn't know any Stacey, and she was nobody important.

200,"I'm writing this post mostly to get advice, but partially just to type out what's been rattling in my head for so long now. I apologize if it goes long and gets long-winded at times.

Nearly two years ago, I made what I consider to be the worst decision in my life. I had the love of my life and I left her because I was stubborn and thought more highly of myself than I should have. Making that decision and having to live with the repercussions of it have totally crushed my confidence, not only in myself but in my decision-making abilities. I don't trust myself anymore, just like my ex no longer has any trust in me.

I've struggled with so much anxiety, depression, and loneliness over these past two years. I've spoken with therapists and I've taken medications. I've tried moving. I've tried meditation. I've tried CBT. I feel like I've tried it all and yet I just have a hard time feeling satisfied any more. I hardly even sleep any more.

The only steady thing in my life is my current job. As I think about it now, it really is a great job. I just moved away to a new city in an attempt to find a new life, to get some clarity, and to get away from all of the pain I've dealt with in recent years. I am still working at the same place, but I am spending half my time working from home and the other half in the office. I had left it with my boss that I wanted to look for a new job in the city in order to earn a better salary. I've had a really good experience working there and my boss has told me a number of times that if I wanted to commit to them, I could make a good career out of it and lead my department in the near future.

I have been sending out my resume all over the place and have had a number of opportunities spring up. I now feel stuck. I can't tell if I just needed to get away from home for a little while or if I really did want a new job. I am currently feeling like I just need some time away and that I may want to return to work full time in order to continue building a career there. The pay is not as good as it is in the city, but I think that, if I am able to fight some of my demons, I may be happy being there full time. Even though I could make more money here, my salary there is more than reasonable to afford living around there.

As I stated above, I have a total lack of trust in my ability to make decisions any more and my utmost fear is that I go down this further path of destruction, cutting off the people that have supported me and abandoning what I already have. I fear this because that is what I did with my ex: I cut her off and abandoned her because I *thought* that I could do better. I had so many happy times with her and we were great for each other. In the face of some adversity, I quit on her to pursue some crazy, ego-driven ""dream"". Am I doing that all over again?? Am I abandoning my job while things are good because I *think* that I can do better??

The stuff ranges from ""aliens walk among us"" to ""vaccines cause autism"" to ""climate change is a lie"" to ""9/11 was an inside job"" and everything in between. Pretty much all the activity on his page is stupid memes from conspiracy pages called stupid things like ""Free Thinkers United"" (just made that up but it's probably a real page). His latest comment unironically referred to the population as ""sheeple"" on an article about how Vladmir Putin could reveal the truth about aliens on earth...


I really don't want to work with this person, and in this program there's a lot of group work, and we don't get to choose our groups, so I'm dreading being paired up with him. I don't want to be around someone who obviously looks down on me and thinks I'm ""sheeple"" just because I care about climate change and don't think my government is using mind control frequencies (there was a comment about mind control frequencies).


In the past, I have lived next to someone who believed similar delusional and unscientific theories, and over the years he had multiple violent incidents that involved cops being called and jail time. I know this is anecdotal, and I'm not in the business of diagnosing mental stability over Facebook activity, but that definitely adds to my discomfort. But speaking of mental stability, I looked it up, and paranoia of government is classified by the APA as a sign of mental illness.


I'm thinking of sending an email to the administration to say that I'd rather not be paired up with him. Not sure if I should include screenshots of the stuff he's posted, or if I should avoid talking about mental health, or if I should just forget it and hope that he's a nice guy (my gut says this is a bad course of action).

I want to leave my job of 7 years. I'm 30 and have been working retail in a lumber yard and mill for 7 years. I've done a lot more than just pick orders and lift wood. I am a ticketed forklift driver, have worked in the mill, have done some installations, painting, unrelated jobs for my boss (mowed his lawn, built some elliptical bikes, boring normal stuff), an responsible for the dogs.. Over the years I've moved more from general labour and into sales. I now attend our home show booth annually, I handle most new prospects, I train new employees, am essentially assistant manager and I answer all emails, run our social media pages and manage the retail office (though not the entire yard)...

I started 7 years ago at $10. I now make $15.

As you can see I have a wide array of responsibilities and they are ever growing... I am also always there to cover someone else if they need me to close... Of course I am not without my flaws like any other employee.


The problem is not so much the wage. 15 does seem low to me for the amount of responsibilities I have, things I can do properly and questions I can almost always answer. I'm a good salesman and I'm a decent company rep. The entire staff seems to enjoy me and all of them except my manager and GM seem to see my worth...

We have an employee who has been here about a year and a half. She is nice, has a positive attitude and is ""one of the boys"". All she is responsible for is helping pick lists for our installs in the yard. That's it.


She also makes the same wage as me, has managed to snag Saturdays off (resulting in me having to cancel a camping trip with my father and my girlfriend who i see only once a year for a monthish each visit)... 


To cut things short I am sort of tired. My worth goes unrecognized and when I bring it up it is brushed off as me being made to seem like all I do is sit in the office.... yet I have the most etiquette, the most organizational skills, the cleanest cut and the best sense of priority and time management...


All of this is piling up. I can't get weekends off and that is fine.. but I also am not able to book more than 2 days off, ever, as I am always needed for things other people aren't able to properly handle on their own... but I am not recognized for that... and half the time I am ridiculed at work, made fun of and even slandered by my immediate co workers including the inexperienced and unreliable ones who somehow are able to get what they want.

228,"Hi reddit,

Bit of backstory: My best friend Mike has been dating Lily for around 3 months. Mike and I are from the same town, but Lily moved to same place as us to start college. The 3 of us get on really well together and they don't mind me ""third-wheeling"". Mike is clinically depressed and takes anti-depressants.

The other night, the 3 of us went to the pub and and we all went back to Mike's house to keep drinking after the pub closed. After more drinking, Lily told us that back in her hometown a guy at a party had sex with her on the side of a road while she was drunk despite her repeated pleas for him to stop. Mike and I were both shocked and angry. Mike told Lily that she should've reported him but she said she that it took her ages to get over and she doesn't want to bring it all back up again. She soon after went to bed and fell asleep.

As soon as she was asleep, Mike literally flipped shit and begged me to get on a train with him back to where she used to live to go and kill this guy (she told us his name). In my drunken state, I agreed that I would go with him because Lily is such a nice girl and it makes me really mad that someone did that to her. Mike is now on vacation for a few days but when he gets back, he wants to get revenge. Many of you may be unsure of whether he would actually kill someone, but his depression has led to some very erratic behavior in the past so I am unsure. Obviously I am not going to be any part of him killing this guy, but I don't want to just let him go there on his own and get in any trouble. What should I do to talk him down? I also personally believe the guy should be held accountable for what he did, should I persuade Lily to report him or would I undo the years of therapy she went through?

Getting carded is the least of it - I've had teenagers assume I was younger than them, and I've had people ask if they could speak to my parents. I've generally found it easier to just not correct it unless specifically prompted, but it's never something I've lied about or anything.

I just recently found out a guy I've been friendly with is actually just 18, and I'm kind of weirded out now.

My mom basically said I deserved it and that I shouldn't have used her car like that..blah blah.....she hit me as well. It was random, but it happened multiple times. I never hit my parents back BECAUSE THEY ARE MY PARENTS, so I really don't understand why they felt like they could hit me and still be considered good parents. Because honestly, I haven't forgiven either of them because of that. 

I moved out a few months later, and after a lot of threats and such, I had to take out a protection order on my father. I had it thrown out the morning of the court date, but I still filed it because of potential harm.
