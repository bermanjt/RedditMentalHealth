2,"A friend of mine thinks it's a good idea to drive after while completely stoned. I've tried to talk to him about it, he gets really angry and is convinced that he is somehow a better driver than when he is sober. I'm not sure what to do at this point, he has been caught smoking weed by the police and only gotten warnings for it, which makes him think that he can't get in trouble (weed is not yet legalised).
I've thought about reporting him to the police when he decides to drive while high but if he is pulled over he will lose his licence and have to go to court, and probably lose his job as a result. 
I am just worried that he will end up hurting himself or someone else because he is not at 100% when behind the wheel, and I am really out of ideas.",03Nov2017,2
3,"A peer (let's call her ""B"") who I have recently been talking with has been strongly expressing how she hates ""everything"". Here is what she keeps complaining about(I put one sentence on each line as an attempt to make it easier to read):

""B"" is best friends with ""C"".

""A"" is dating ""C"".

""A"" is apparently flirting with ""B"" and keeps telling her that he doesn't want ""C"". 

""A"" keeps trying to hint that he doesn't like ""C"" anymore and that he likes ""B"" more, but that only causes ""C"" to lash out at ""B"". (Seriously, ""C"" cut up ""B""'s belongings today.)

What I think is that they just want their lives to be a romantic and dramatic tv show. The thing is, I personally have no friends so I honestly can't tell what is happening. Can't everything simply end with some communication? I mean, they are ""best friends"" so it shouldn't be hard.

I told her that, and she said, ""No, it doesn't work that way."" If so, then what will work?",03Nov2017,1
4,"For some background I flew (in an airplane) quite often as a child, my moms family lives on one side of the country, and my dads on the other, so I flew at least annually until I was about 14. No problems. Over the next couple of years I felt a little bit nervous during landing and take off but nothing unmanageable. 

Fast forward to last Christmas. My mom now lives on the opposite side of the country and at Christmas my SO and I flew out to visit her, it was Canadian winter so the weather wasn't great, but even before we boarded I felt an overwhelming dread. By the time we took off I was borderline hyperventilating, my heart was pounding, I felt weak, and overall panicked. I couldn't sit up or let go of my SO's arm. He tried to redirect and get me to watch a movie, or talk to him about something but every five minutes I was checking the flight tracker to see how much longer the flight was going to be. Even thinking about flying now makes me incredibly anxious, bordering on panic.

How can I get over this? Or how do I go about getting help to get over it? Any similar stories? ",03Nov2017,3

It’s not an issue about scheduling or anything like that, it’s just what I think will be best suited for my future majors.

I’ll be getting college credits for the class in college as long as I pass the class and that’s definitely something to consider. Anthropology does overlap sorta with those majors, but if I choose Sociology as my major I will definitely need to take an Intro to Sociology class at some point.

Hi, everyone,

I'm writing to get some suggestions and gain a better perspective on my situation. I've been renting a home almost 8 years. Always pay on time and keep house and property maintained beautifully. My landlords have decided they want to sell, but want me to have the home, as I'm a known and trusted tenant. They want to sell by spring next year or as soon as possible. I feel incredibly grateful and would love nothing more than to buy this place.

However, I have been unable to work a steady job outside of the house due to health issues (which I'm tending to). My current source of income is through an online gig as an intuitive advisor. It's tough because the job entails helping others, which I love. But the challenge is that pay isn't solid and I'm still building up a client base. It's also not easy to balance with school (college student working toward Bachelors), as I'm taking online courses. The work is much more intense and time consuming than taking classes in person.

I've known for awhile that they want to sell, but did not realize they want a decision made by spring, before the lease ends. My landlord has asked me on a few different occasions already if I'll but. I was honest, of course and explained that I'd love to but am not financially stable as of now. She said she understands but is still persistent. For ex., she called me earlier to give me info. of a mortgage consultant. I appreciate the help, but it makes no sense to consult someone when I'm not employed. My parents have said they'll co-sign for me, but again, I need steady income.

My question is, why is my landlord pushing me in spite of my honesty? I understand getting prepared in advance, but it feels like I'm being confronted about it nonstop. Im under a tremendous amount of pressure with school, tending to health issues and balancing my schedule with the online gig. This is just adding to the stress. I have almost a year left on the lease. Why such a sense of desperation to sell?",03Nov2017,1
20,"I'm wondering about people's opinion of that subreddit for those who don't go there regularly (if, at all). I've been considering following what they have to say as I somewhat believe that the porn and masturbation that I have been getting into habitually has affected me, but even then, I mostly believe that I should avoid getting into it out of social pressure.

I noticed that this was having an impact on me when I realised I got bored of watching straight and lesbian porn - in the past, they would have aroused me. For several years now I have been watching porn regularly and masturbating, but I have never been able to go back to being instantly aroused by it. It's causing me to be confused greately about my gender and sexuality.

I am also wondering if they are correct on the testosterone part, where I have been doing nothing but gaining weight and stomach fat, in part due to my lack of exercise and eating a lot, but also maybe through this, where my chances of weight loss are reduced.",03Nov2017,1

24,"I'm currently 16 years old and needed a lot of sleep to not feel tired (about 9h). Two days ago I couldn't fall asleep but after some hours of trying i fell asleep just to wake up 3 hours later.

25,"I’m not sure if there’s any advice that can help. I’d appreciate if there is some, other than meaningless “Stay positive!” comments.


I have nobody- I was raised in an extreme sect of religion and I left at 16 to escape being forced into marriage. When you leave you are dead to your family. So no family. 


No friends- my parents moved me abroad as a kid and I moved back to Australia myself and know nobody here. 


No education- I was academically gifted and finished high school with good grades but that’s it. Females in our religion were discouraged.


No job experience. I’m a single mom and having a young kid with health issues has meant I had to stay home to take care of kid.


I’ve tried desperately applying for jobs- ANY jobs no matter how bad. I want to get off government assistance so badly. I loathe myself. I have to find one that pays minimum $3000 a month so I can afford daycare and the bare minimums. No luck.


I’m stuck. I have nobody ever to talk to. No prospects. I’m a wreck. There’s never going to be anyone I can depend on for any help. My academic potential is wasted. There’s no escape at all. I’ve looked into every kind of help available and there’s nothing for me. I’ve tried to make friends by joining a church and playgroups and so many different groups etc. No luck with anything.


I’m just reaching the end of the road. I’ve lived a horrible, miserable life with only the tiniest fleeting moments of happiness amongst the nightmare. Extremely abusive parents, lots of awful things. I hate myself for having brought a kid into this- circumstances were very very different at that time or I wouldn’t have. I do sometimes think this poor kid would be better off without me. But I’m terrified of kid ending up with abusive people. There are no guarantees that wouldn’t happen.

But I don’t want to seem like an anchor and have her drag me around the whole night though obviously she won’t mind at all. 

Plus she’ll be drinking and depending on if we have to drive somewhere after the party, I’ll most likely stay sober which makes me even more awkward and self conscious at events like this. If I don’t have to drive and I can have a couple drinks, I’ll loosen up.

They say that if I go to art school I will have to move out, which will mean I will need to find a full time job and cant study anyway.

She said ""I guess"" then I said ""what would you prefer I do if you send something like that again?

52,"TL;DR - My cat is confined to a 12x13' room because of aggressive pitbull. Pitbull belongs to brother of boyfriend. He is bumming off of us and has lived with us for free for 2 months now (in our one bedroom apartment). I have asked repeatedly to get rid of dog. Gave deadline which has come and gone. Boyfriend is useless. What do I do?

Story: 
Hurricane Harvey destroyed my brother's boyfriend's home. This guy is a deadbeat. Nice dude but is amazingly consistent at making horrible life choices. He has been staying with us since the hurricane (has nowhere else to go). He lives FOR FREE in the living room of our one-bedroom apartment. It has been at least 6 weeks since I have asked my boyfriend (repeatedly) to have his brother move the dog out of our apartment because the dog is aggressive and cannot coexist with my cat. Since his arrival my cat has been confined to the only bedroom and by extension, I too am stuck hanging out in the bedroom. Anytime I am home I am stuck in the bedroom lest I leave my cat alone except when I sleep. I have threatened to take the dog to the shelter because the last thing he needs is a dog to take care of (he's almost never home to even be with the dog). My boyfriend did not react well to the threat. His response was: ""My family loves animals. You'll never understand. I'd move out before you did that."" 

I want this dog out of my home. What do I do? I feel stuck and trapped in my own apartment. I have to live by the terms set by a person who doesn't even pay rent because they refuse to give up their dog and my relationship will be ruined if I take the dog to the shelter myself.

So, there’s this cute German guy in my math class and I have always been attracted to him. We’ve recently started talking and he’s pretty funny! We “bully” each other, it started with me teasing him about him being “short” (he’s 5’11 and I’m like 5’6) and it escalated into offensive humor jokes (which I don’t mind).  The thing is, I genuinely can’t tell if he doesn’t like me or not (he says “We’re not friends” and leaves me on opened and is generally mean, like not even playful teasing anymore). My friend told me “He’s only mean to you because he likes you!” Which is definitely the most immature thing I’ve heard. (I’m a freshman and he’s a sophomore, by the way.)

I tried to ask him “hey are we cool? I can’t tell if you actually don’t like me lmao” and he just didn’t say anything. I know, he’s an asshole and isn’t worth my time. It just sucks because I liked him a lot and he doesn’t treat me like I deserve. Even if we were just friends, the friendly “bullying” stuff is starting to feel less like a joke and more like he flat out doesn’t like me. 

I know I should just ignore him, the whole situation sounds stupid now that I’m writing it out and reading it. Any tips on moving on/coping? He’s kinda become part of my mini friend group in my math class, it doesn’t help I sit literally right in front of him. :(

54,"So I'm a 19 year old guy and I have obnoxiously high standards; not necessarily about looks, but a person has to be someone that I don't really dislike in any way before I talk to them. 

Basically what that means is that I've never had a girlfriend due to my disliking nearly every girl that had gone to my school, or my being too dense to realize that someone liked me bc I'm an idiot. 

And what **that** means for me is that I have literally no idea how to talk to girls. Like, I'm 19 and have 0 experience in dating. I'm out of High School now and have no car or job (there's really nothing around me and I can't get any consistent rides).

Onto the girl, she went to the same school as me, and I talked to her (casually) every once in a while and whatnot, so it's not like she has NO idea who I am. I kinda liked her back then, but I was kinda eh about it. She doesn't go to the same college as me, though (maybe 20 miles or so?). We're friends on Facebook and as she posts things, I end up actually laughing or appreciating things she posts. She's absolutely gorgeous, but isn't stuck up about it at all. Basically the first person that I've genuinely had feelings for. 

A couple years ago (2015) I'd messaged her and ended up getting her number and was quite pleased with myself as I had never expected to be able to do that. However she ended up getting a boyfriend before I did anything with what I had accomplished so I stopped talking to her. 

Fast forward to now-- This morning she posted a couple of adorable pictures of her with a dog and I noticed it said she was single, and I thought ""fuck it"", and made a little joke just to talk with her. Bad move. I thought I was at least somewhat over her, but as it turns out, thinking about her again really ruined that. 

This is somewhat of a problem for me as I'm pretty laid back and don't get stressed or worried by really anything, and this is basically the first time I've felt actually sick to my stomach because of a girl. It's actually pretty crazy, but also mildly sad due to the above circumstances. 


#TL;DR - 19M, I really like this girl but have 0 skills at talking to girls due to my personality. We're friends on facebook (I talked to her a few years ago but she got a boyfriend and I stopped) and live sort of near each other (no car, no job tho). Idk what to do 🙃",03Nov2017,1
55,"I had to miss 2 of my midterms last week since I fell ill, so I was given the chance to write a deferred exam for both classes. There is one problem however; Both exams are at the exact same time and according to the PA's they cannot give me another chance. My plan right now is to show up for the class that is obligatory in my program and drop the other, is there anything else I can do in this situation?",03Nov2017,1
57,"I'm 24, I currently live in a flat share in London and work full-time. I left my parents house at the beginning of the year due to years of hardship between my mother and I. Overall, my mother has sacrificed a lot for me. But she is a narcissist and abusive. A lot of my depression/self hate/suicide is rooted in her treatment towards me. I have sacrificed a lot to be what she needs me to be. Me moving out was the best thing I've ever done for myself, simply because I finally put myself first. However, my mother now needs me.

Situation: 
- since leaving my mother's stress levels have increased. She isn't getting the support she once got from me from my other siblings. My father rarely pays the rent on time and my siblings (aka her golden children) have revealed their true colours. She now knows she took me for granted. She works 7 days a week as a cleaner and it's getting to her due to age etc. I work in the ""city"".

- my dilemma is that my mum is nice for 5 seconds then she's back to her usual abusive ways. I am suffering from depression and fear being back in such an environment could really trigger me. Plus, there is no greater joy then living on your own and getting piece of mind. No money can buy this. 

Pros of moving back in with my mum:

1. I can save money. Half my pay goes to bills and I am living pay cheque to pay cheque. This is no different to when I was living at home. I seem to have poor money management.

2. I can be there for my mum who seems to be going through a very hard time. She is lonely at home and isn't getting support from anyone. She works 7 days a week and feels like she sacrificed her life for nothing since she hasn't benefitted from us in any way. Not emotionally or financially.

3. I can pay my debt. Debt I got myself in after helping my dad. It's not his fault. I overspent and now have £5K to pay in cc bills. 

4. I can finally start driving lessons/buy a car. I can also help change a few things around the house. Mind you I never did this whilst living at home. I suggested it but my mum didn't think it was time.

5. I thought by leaving home I would be living up my youth. I'm not, in fact I'm more lonely. Maybe being at home I won't feel it.


Cons to moving back home:

1. I'd be sharing the room with my very selfish sister. She is unimaginably difficult. We both have so many things and it wouldn't fit in the room anymore but we could make it work. It's just that she would be a nightmare about it.

2. The hygiene standards in my mums house has really slipped since I left. My new flat is clean and doesn't require so much work. My siblings are lazy and I'll end up doing most of the chores and cooking.

3. The commute into work. I work in the city and my parents live just on the outskirts of london. The commute from my mums is 1.5 - 2 hours door to door during peak times. My current flat is 25 mins maximum door to door.

4. My most important reason. Peace of mind. I have never experienced so much freedom. I'm not a rebel or coming home late, but I have peace of mind. No one calling my name excessively or trying to control me. I can come into my flat and mind my own business. 

5. I don't have to deal with my mums constant criticism. She is usually very negative and has so much to say! Which really affects my self esteem.

Conclusion:

- I know no one can decide for me but the thought of going home is giving me insomnia already (I have that anyway but I'm torn). 

- However, some insight would be really useful. 

Thank you.

58,"Over the past year, I've started to realize that I cannot make decisions and be confident with them no matter what. In fact, I've found that even if I don't have a say in the matter, I can convince myself to like a decision and genuinely like the decision. My problem is that I like things too much. An example is I was planning on buying a new computer. I was obsessed. I instantly convinced myself that I wanted a Macbook, but another computer was better suited for my needs, cheaper, had some better aspects. I was able to convince myself that the mac was better even though it clearly was not. I didn't get the mac because it was a better choice not to and that I actually wanted this computer more, but i still want the mac... 

Another example of me not making decisions is with women. I just got out of a relationship because I couldn't stop liking other people. What i had was fine. Actually, it was great. But, this had to end because I couldn't decide what I want. Did I want my relationship or explore other relationships. Well that's where I'm at now, and I'm _still not sure it was the right thing_. I ended the relationship because I was almost positive it was what I needed. But now I'm here questioning if it was the wrong choice.

How do I stop wanting what I don't have and just accept what I have is great? Continuing what I'm doing could really mess something up in the future.",03Nov2017,1
61,"I’ve recently broken up with my boyfriend of five years. We were so perfect for each other and we met in high school. I moved multiple times first three hours away then even farther away to Atlanta and we were still talking and saying we were going to be together even visited me there, We would take turns buying Greyhound tickets so we could visit each other. When he went to college, his freshman year, he cheated on me. In his defense I wasn’t working at the time and couldn’t keep my phone on. I’d text him off of my moms phone but I’d be a week or more before I could. I cried when he told me and we had it out for a while before I decided just to move back to where he was. 

I lived with an aunt that would constantly forget who I was and what I was doing there, she was rather mean and would wake me from my sleep claiming I was faking sleep. I was just grateful that I had moved closer to him and gotten a job there and there was a person willing to let me stay in a house rent free, I was really starting to be an adult at 21. My mom and siblings moved back to where I was so I moved back with them. He didn’t like it but held his tongue and blew me off as ‘running to them always’ because prior I had moved from my aunts with him in a basement for a couple of months. 

He still wanted a friendship with he person he cheated on me with. He had real feelings for her, she had given him what I couldn’t at the time, in the end she had him choose between her and I was what he chose even though he was sad about it. I argued with him about it because I felt insecure and it ended up breaking us up, he gave her just the title of  girlfriend even though I don’t know what when in between them he still was talking to me too. We got back together with promises of something better and it was for a while. Later on down the line she had ended up arguing with him and hit him, it was really the nail in the coffin for him and made him dislike her. The summer he was out of college was great! We’d have fun and do things together. I am an introvert and it made me just talking to his family rather hard in social functions because they seemed to have their own things, their own inside jokes and such, on so I’d grab a seat and try to be more talkative and interesting. I wasn’t. I could only be that with his friends around our age. 

My insecurities got worse as he went back to college for his last year. He’d come to visit on the weekends and we did the same things, I got off work at night or in the early evening, I’d only really be able to hang out with him for a day. He became more busy and didn’t have really much time to give for me. We started to argue more and he became sparse with me on how everything at school was going or just his life in general. Some days were great others were the worst. We argued one more time and it made him leave me stranded at his family’s house, I had to ask his grandma to take me home with bloodshot eyes from crying. We took a break which eventually meant a break up. He had told me he wasn’t thinking of getting back together even though I had confessed it was the only thing on my mind. It hurts. We were still talking earlier into it but I’ve just given up since he really seems like he doesn’t want to talk to me. He tells me he loves me but is not sure if he is in love with me anymore. He says he’s going to be there for me and I can call on him but I don’t know what to do. He really is the best guy in the world and treated me so great and I can’t see myself with another person. He’s done so much for me.

63,"So I'm a resident of NJ currently living in Rochester, NY for college. I live in an apartment complex that is a long walk from school and really a long walk from any forms of public transport. I've been using my car to get around. Well today I was at the grocery store trying to buy pseudoephedrine, I discovered that my license was not in my wallet. I looked up the process for replacing my license and it seems like NJ does mail replacement license out of state, however they do not mail within the Tri-State area. So I called up the MVC in NJ to ask about this and they said that they only way for me to replace my license is to somehow travel to NJ to go to a DMV there and get it replaced. However, I am legally not able to drive to NJ with my physical license, and I do not have the time because of school to take the train or to fly down to NYC and then somehow take public transport to a NJ DMV. My parent's don't have the vacation time to do drive up here, drive me over to the DMV, and then drive me back. The drive back to NJ is long and I'm paranoid about being pulled over.

73,"My sister was diagnosed with a rare malignant tumor in 1994, when she was 1 year old. My dad's father and brother both died from cancer prior to this, and my mom was pregnant with me when my sister was diagnosed. He elected to have no more children because he was sure he was the cause of her cancer. 

Well fast forward to 2014, and my sister developed  another tumor (this time benign). Around the same time my dad also developed two benign tumors and they were removed. 

Fast forward again to 2017, and my sister appears to have a not so common type of cancer that occurs from a genetic mutation passed on by a parent, OR randomly occurring. 

Assuming my dad passed the gene to her, then theoretically I have a 50% chance of having that same mutation, but the likelihood of me developing cancer now (at 22) is low because typically this would have occurred prior to the age of 5. However, the chance is still there and these are rapidly growing, malignant tumors. It appears screenings are recommend yearly of a brain MRI, and an abdominal ultrasound if you have the mutation. 

I don't know that I should have the testing even done, until I myself plan to have kids...or if I should have it done now so I know now that I should not have my own children...or if I should have it done for the sake of knowing if I need screenings, or if I should let fate take it's course and not worry about a gene that can't be ""fixed"".

77,"TL;DR 14 year old brother won't stop abusing prescription drugs and alcohol, parents and I are worried he's going to go out and overdose one day.

I'm 20 years old and live with my parents and five younger siblings. I have 3 younger brothers who were adopted. At the time of the adoption, the youngest was 1, the second youngest was 10, and the oldest was 14. They came from a rough background where the adults that were supposed to take care of them went out to use drugs all day. Eventually they were picked up by CPS when the two older ones were abandoned at a library, during that time the youngest was already with us. 

My parents had planned on only adopting one child, the baby, but ended up adopting all three because they are brothers. Four years have passed since then. The Oldest (we'll call him Isaac because I don't know if I can post real names) is now 17 and living with his girlfriend. The second oldest, who is now 14 (we'll call him Andy) cannot legally live on his own so of course he's still with us. Ever since he was 12 he's been going out with his older brothers (Isaac and my biological brother) and smoking marijuana. The two older brothers also abused prescription drugs which they either stole from my parents or got from other kids at their school. Andy has unfortunately followed in their footsteps. Andy is always getting in trouble for something. Whether it's sneaking out at night, coming home drunk or high, or breaking school property, he consistently causes my parents grief. I admit that my parents, although have good intentions, are somewhat controlling. Initially they would ground my brothers for things that were small like not cleaning their rooms or leaving their towel on the bathroom floor. I think the micro managing is part of what drove them to rebel to be honest, although knowing their background and knowing that they grew up surrounded by drug use also makes their rebellion no surprise.

Andy is currently in rehab for 2 months, although even the people that work at the rehabilitation center told us not to expect any changes. I try to talk to Andy when I can in a way that's not patronizing. When I talk to him I don't try to lecture him because he gets enough of that from my parents. I talk to him about stupid things and try to show interest in what he likes, because I want to be the one friend in his life that's not a bad influence. Of course being the dorky older sister I am he doesn't consider me the same kind of friend as he considers his school buddies to be, which I get. Friends and siblings are two different things. But we have a good relationship. I just wish I had the chance to interact with him more in a way that could help him. I've told him honestly that I worry about him overdosing but when we get on that subject he shuts down. Basically what’s happening now is when he comes back my parents anticipate that he's going to get an MIP (minor in possession) which means legally he can get in more trouble for using drugs which they hope will pressure him to stop, but to me it's sad that this seems like the only way to protect him. What more can I do to help him?

81,"I’ve never liked my stepfather.  I’ve always seen him for the narcissistic coke head piece of shit that he is.  He’s hurt me emotionally over and over and over again.  
But I never thought he would sexually abuse his youngest daughter.  

I’m 23 and my younger sister is 13.  
I received a call from my mother last night, but I fell asleep really early and didn’t get back to her until noon.  
When she told me that he is in jail and that my sister was involved, but wouldn’t tell me over the phone. I  kept dismissing the possibility that he would even do such a thing since he constantly BRAGS about how much of a glorious Christian he is and how he can’t wait to one day “meet Jesus”.  
But it was just sort of there in the back of my mind.  

I finally get to my moms house around 6pm and she tell me that he’s been molesting my sister for the past 2 years.  
At first I heard what she told me, but I didn’t process it for a few minutes.   
I eventually just start crying and crying and crying.  I’m just overwhelmed with all of these emotions, all of these memories of him, what he’s done to me, how much my sister loved him, flashing back to the day my younger sister was brought home.  And I’m just balling. 

But I couldn’t face my sister.  I had/ have no idea what to say to her.  I have no idea how to face her without just crying, and I just didn’t think that’s what she needs at this time.   So I didn’t say anything to her.  
A few hours go by and I come back, she’s sleeping.  
I softly tell her while she’s sleeping, how much I love her, how proud I am of her and how brave I think she is.   And I kiss her on the forehead.  

I don’t know how to proceed with all this information, and on top of that, my oldest sister refuses to believe anything that our youngest is saying.  ",03Nov2017,16
82,"I never seem to do well in school. Its not that I’m stupid, I’m actually decently smart, i just cant seem to pull myself together to actually do well.

I don’t know if this makes me a sociopath or whatever, but i feel much more comfortable with a rifle then a pencil. Im not trying to be edgy or anything, i genuinely feel at ease with this stupid beat up rifle i have. Its gone through shit and i guess its my comfort thing. I don’t think I’m meant to be someone who works normal everyday jobs, but something like a soldier or fighter. 

Ive made a lot of mistakes in a short amount of time, and it fucks with me constantly. I feel like a shit person when i talk to my friends as they have no idea that I’ve done some fucked up shit. I cant say it all because, well, its not exactly the most legal. But to sum it up I’m a hardcore sex addict, although I’ve been improving due to this one girl i feel like i done wanna let down like everyone else. 

I just don’t know if I’m even meant to be around anymore. Im not suicidal, I’m not even thinking about killing myself, but theres still a thought in the back of my head that I’m not meant to be here.

95,"Hi... So from a mixture of bad personal choices, relying to much on a former partner who screwed me over, and indulgent parenting I ended up a 28 year old with next to no employable skills. I've managed to claw my way up from retail, to working in a call center. This job pays the rent, if barely, but is leaving me racked with guilt, as the company I work for prays on people in desperate financial states. Further my social anxiety makes the job extremely stressful, and this has become detrimental to my physical and mental well being. 

I have a bachelor of fine arts (waste of time I know), where I received excellent grades, but taught me no employable skills. 
I know I need to go back to school if I am ever going to make anything of myself. I just don't know for what. 

Basically I am looking for a career that does not require math, works regular 9-5 sort of hours, pays between 35 000 and 40 000 yearly (and within the first couple years of being hired) and does not require that I am able to drive (I could learn but in my province it would take 3 years to be a usable skill, and I cannot wait that long to start making adult money). I'd really like to avoid anything medical as I'm a giant germaphobe, but I'd still consider suggestions in that area if they seemed like my only options. I also didn't take anything beyond the basics in high school science (bio 11) and would prefer not to spend additional time I could be working, upgrading high school level courses. 

On the plus side I'm a reasonable writer, good with people as long as I don't have to sell to them, and generally a reliable, hard worker. My previous jobs were mainly in retail, but I also spent about 6 months working as a digital merchandiser. I am a decent artist, but not stylistically suited to making any real money at it, and if I'm honest with myself probably not quite skilled enough either. I was interested in doing an HR program for awhile, but the math requirements for most programs in my area were too daunting, and it seems to be something where you really need a bachelors degree and not a diploma anyway if you want to make more than 15 dollars an hour. I love making things, I love building things and I LOVE finding and correcting errors. I'm motivated more by teamwork than competition, and am a reliable, personable and friendly coworker... if a little bit shy in the beginning. 

Also I'm living (and plan to continue living) in Canada, I'm guessing that might be a factor in any suggestions. Also If it wasn't at least sorta obvious from the screen name I'm a girl (and a lesbian at that) so I would prefer something where I won't have to deal with extreme sexism or homophobia... It's probably also worth noting I have some pretty major back problems (I occasionally twitch violently for an as yet not medically diagnosed reason, and also deal with some pretty major chronic pain) 

In terms of cost, I have about 5000 savings. I know it's small but considering I went from my ex kicking me out, after telling me she had spent all of our supposedly mutual savings, leaving me with next to no money, to five grand in the bank in a year, it's something I'm ridiculously proud of. I can put this towards my education, but I'll have to take out further loans as I have rent and food to think about as well as educational costs. It might be possible for me to work part time while I study, but I think in the long run it's probably more practical to focus totally on school and getting it done as quickly as possible to maximize my ability to save over time. 

I'm interested in any suggestions for 1-2 year career building programs anyone might have. Also if you've managed to get yourself out of a similar situation, I'd love to hear how you did it!
I probably sound like some obnoxious special snowflake here so I want to make it clear I don't expect pity (I have made some pretty terrible decisions), nor do I think mine is the worst situation out there... But that said I'm no idiot and I know at the rate I'm going I won't have any money for retirement, and a layoff or injury could tip me over the edge into real poverty, so I really could use any advice anyone can offer.",03Nov2017,1
96,"It's been over three months since I spent any time with a person outside of work besides my GF or my Dad. I lost all my social ties in my break up with my former fiancee, and I have absolutely no idea how to make new ones. 

Compounding the problem is my pretty extreme social anxiety... I don't mean like just feeling nervous I mean full on shaking, feeling like I can't breathe and I've been known to just bolt from new people in the past.

My co workers are all in their early 20's, and I'm nearly 30, and there is just so little in common I can't see anything forming at work. In addition the fact that all the girls there seem to talk about is being engaged, and weddings is pretty upsetting as I definitely pictured myself married by now. 

Most of my girlfriends friends are of the online variety, and I've learned my lesson, about sharing all your social ties with your partner anyway so piggybacking on her doesn't seem like a real option either. 

I'm not really looking for anyone too special in a friend. Just some people to go for coffee with, have an intelligent conversation or two, and maybe play some video games once a week. It would be nice maybe to have some queer friends to relate to as well, and maybe ideally some shared interests in art and literature?

I've looked into Meetups in my area interest wise, and there don't seem to be any. I'm Agnostic so church groups aren't an option. I could try volunteering, but my work hours are erratic making it difficult to commit to anything. 

Honestly it feels a little like I'm out of options. Any suggestions aside from getting used to being lonely? ",03Nov2017,1
97,"I am not 100% it was her who read it or if it was her mom, but I feel really offended at the thought of someone violating my privacy. They kindly let me stay in their home for a few months as I was unfortunately unable to live with my family anymore. Long story short I was having horrifying  flashbacks of two different adults, a man and a woman, sexually abusing me throughout the majority of my childhood. I wrote down specific events that occurred during the abuse as well as my fuming rage (which was completely valid in my opinion.) If I'm feeling absolutely infuriated I need a safe place to put my thoughts so they aren't taking up all the space in my mind.  So I wrote in my diary every time I thought to myself ""these people who abused me deserve to die"" and it felt good to put my rage someplace safe, instead of self harming. 
Some of my most personal thoughts and feelings were recorded here and were never intended to be read by another person.

My question is: should I confront my friend about her reading my diary and have a discussion about it? 

Because I don't know if I can trust her if she snoops like that. I don't live with her anymore but she's still my friend.. but I always have this nagging feeling that she and her mom have drawn these extreme conclusions based solely on how awful I was feeling while I was writing. I feel ashamed that someone would read such a personal thing. Especially since they knew what was going on, I thought they would be more respectful. Maybe they thought they would have prevented a suicide but I wasn't going to, and they literally accomplish nothing by reading my diary except finding out how truly angry I was about the abuse, and all the awful things I was wishing upon the people who abused me. 
She and her mom always looked at me like I was some sort of crazy person, like I'm a ticking time bomb waiting to explode and turn on them somehow... but I was only looking for a safe place to vent my rage.. I never intended to harm anyone. I just feel like they crossed a very unnecessary boundary. 

Also, yes I have been seeing a therapist for years now.  They've helped me a lot. ",03Nov2017,1
98,"I'm a female college student currently studying engineering.

I never really openly talked about what happened and I just feel like I need to finally say it.

I was a freshman and so was he. I just met him because he was in my major. He flirted with me a little bit over snapchat, but he was also fairly intelligent and articulate so I'd go to him for help on my math homework sometimes.

One day I was in his dorm room working on homework and he came onto me. I had told him several times that I had a boyfriend and I wasn't interested, and when he started touching me and very firmly said ""dude, fucking stop"". I could have left, but part of me felt like it was unnecessary because I thought if I just said stop he'd chill out and we could just go back to normal and I didn't want to ""freak out"" at him or anything. I also desperately needed help with the material we were working on in calculus at the time and he was the only person I knew who had actually been able to explain things to me clearly and efficiently. 

I cannot stress how direct I was with him. I had been in situations in the past where I was too scared to say no so I let things happen that I greatly regret, and since then I swore I'd never let it happen again. But he just wouldn't stop, no matter how much I pushed him away. He just kept saying ""I just need it"". He didn't try to have ""sex"" with me because he was a virgin and wanted his first time to be ""special"", as he had told me once. So he just took him dick out and kept grabbing my hands and trying to force me to touch him. 

No matter what I said or how much I physically resisted him, he didn't lay off. If I pulled away from him, he'd pick me up and bring me back to him. We were sitting on the couch/futon thing in his room and I'd keep going back to the floor where I had been working, and he kept picking me up by my waist and sitting me back on his lap. I remember hating having a small waist because it felt like it gave him a way to hold on to me. Eventually I just collapsed to the ground and started crying, and said that I just wanted to finish evaluating integrals. So I cried onto my notebook as I tried to finish doing my homework while he rubbed his bare dick all over my body. He eventually put it in between my thighs (I was kind of bent over my notebook and he was behind me at this point), and moved it in and out like he was fucking me. After a few minutes of this he said ""oh I'm gonna cum"" and that disgusted me so much that I kind of came back to reality, flipped a shit and screamed at him and pulled away. He saw my tears on my face and my notebook. I left. 

I didn't have to interact with him at all for the rest of that year. This semester, he's in every single one of my technical classes. Also, this year, I've been doing a lot better in life in general, so I've become incredibly active in projects outside of my classes. I spend about 6 hours a day now at our lab working in the woodshop or our manufacturing studio or in one of the computer labs CADing, and it's been making me feel incredibly fulfilled and joyful. 

But apparently he spends about the same amount of time there as I do, so every day I have to work like 15 feet away from him and hear him fuck around with him friends. He even volunteers at the studio so sometimes I have to talk to him to check out power tools and all that. The people who hangout there have their own sort of community, and, despite it being primarily all men, I've been becoming a member of it. But he's very much at the center of this group of friends so the people I hangout with he hangs out with too. For reference, there are about 1,000 undergraduates within my specific engineering major at my university, so I think it's absurd that I still see him this often.

There's no way in hell I'm giving up my work just so I don't have to be around him, but every time I see him, all I can think about is what happened. I don't feel like I can even tell anyone because they're all lighthearted boys and I just don't feel comfortable confiding in them with things of that nature, especially when I know they've known him longer than they've known me.

It's just so uncomfortable for me and I have no idea what to do or what to even think about it. I just really wish he wasn't there. I wish I had saved some of the snapchat messages from after it happened so I could have reported him with evidence, but there's nothing I can about that now. I just hate him so much and I hate that he still gets to live his life as the smart, popular, active, and accomplished honor student when I know what he did to me. I can't make him go away, so I want closure. But I don't want to forgive him. I don't know what to do.

Also, I want to start volunteering at the studio so I can get 24/7 key card access so I can work whenever I want, but I don't want to have to work the same shifts with him, or even worse, have him be the one who has to train me.

He is a good father and husband - he absolutely does his share of work in the house and with the baby and genuinely loves and cares about our well being.

I don't mind helping out every here and there if I'm needed, but this is consistent now.

Both very high paying jobs) I already live on my own and I just don't see a reason to keep going to school. The way I see it having a GED would be perfectly acceptable at this point. I have the job I want, they'll train me in anything I show proficiency in, which is already everything there, 10 years down the road if I go to find a new company to work for my 10 year stint at this company will speak a lot more highly of me than a piece of paper that says I can read easy books, solve basic math, and that I know a few lies about Columbus. The only way I'll ever end up going into a field other than the one I'm currently in will be as a freelance programmer, in which case it doesn't matter again. And I already have my foot in the door in this field. Within a few years I'll be nearing the 50,000 a year mark doing something I actually enjoy. Why the hell should I waste time going to school instead of just working?

The only reason I'm even still enrolled is my parents and my girlfriend both want me to graduate, for some reason they want me to have a piece of paper that says I'm good at wasting time.

120,"I'm in a really weird position in my life right now and I don't know what to do.

I'm a really shy and introverted person. I have trouble talking to people and I tend to do things by myself a lot. I've got very few friends and I don't like my family very much because they always picked on me and made me feel worthless. They also sheltered me from a lot of things I was interested in too. I've never dated in my life, I've never been interested and I figured nobody would want to be with me anyways so why bother. All relevant to my problem.

There's this person I've worked with for around a year now. She's pretty much the complete opposite of me. She's strong-willed, doesn't care much about what people think of her, and says what's on her mind. It's what I wish I could be like.

Since I started working with her, I've always sort of admired her, not as a crush or anything romantic, I just sort of looked up to her. We were never close friends before but I think we've grown a bit closer. 

Here's the problem. I sometimes think she's flirting with me but it could also just be her trying to be nice. It's fucking with my mind.

 I've found that we share a few common interests, the main one being that we both like rap and hip-hop, specifically Eminem. We discovered this a few weeks ago and it brought us a bit closer. A few days ago us and a few other employees went out into town for Halloween for some food. We drove in her car and she put on some Eminem and said it was for me as a sort of joke. She's done this a few other times too in other ways but this was just the easiest example to write down.

She's gotten me to do things out of my comfort zone before and I feel more confident than I used to because of it.

On one hand, I think she's interested in me because I've noticed she pays attention to my interests and jokes around with me a lot but on the other hand she tends to joke around with everyone and I feel like I'm just over-analyzing all of her actions because I want someone to care about me. I've felt completely alone for a year or two now and she's just someone that seems to care.

I like her but I'm terrified of rejection, not just romantically but when friends and family rejects me. It devastates me when it happens so I feel like I'm in a dilemma. I think that we'd get along well if we ever together but I don't want to create any tension between us by escalating this.

I've been trying to suppress how I feel about her because I don't know how she feels about me and don't her to reject me too. What should I do?",03Nov2017,1

I've become pretty disciplined just for the sake of my dreams, but everyone around me is yakking about how I need to have specific regimented plans. It's funny because I've done a lot of studying on how people become successful, and a lot of them didn't have specific plans in the beginning. All they did was took some calculated risks, stayed incredibly disciplined, and went the extra mile. They used hard work, consistency, and routine. But the rest is up to the Universe, imo. Doors of opportunity will show up and we have to walk through them. I want to travel the world, write books, give speeches, create nonprofit organizations, and build a social media presence. I'm Korean, and I don't want to go to fucking college. It's not in my heart or soul, and I've been lying to myself for the past several years. It's eaten away at me. I'm begging anyone.

124,"So, me and my girlfriend have been together for 7 years now (2 years in long-distance, then i moved to her country to be with her), and have always spoke about having kids eventually.

Recently she found out that she has a condition which gives her a lower chance of having kids past 30 (I can't remember the name), and is adamant about starting to try for children now.

Personally i feel that i'm not ready for children yet. I've always wanted to go back to studying and finishing my degree, which i feel that i won't be able to do if we have children (I'd want to support the family, and would have to work to do that).

Right now, i'm feeling like I either have to give up on my goals, and have children, work a job i'd hate for the next ~15-20 years, or we'd have to break up. I'm also scared that if I do end up going through with having children and didn't enjoy the experience, that i'd just grow to resent her, but be forced to stay together.

Recent times have been pretty tough on me too, so i'm not sure if that is affecting my decisions. I struggled to get a job here in the first place, and just lost my job at the end of September, which doesn't help at all. I've also been quite depressed for the last few months, and personally i'd rather wait until i get things together again before even thinking of trying (which I've told her. but she's adamant that we either start trying to have children, and hope that i get over it / warm up to the decision whilst we're trying)",03Nov2017,3
125,"How does one deal with a pointless life?
I know I would come across as depressed. But I don't know why I should bring myself out of it? Sexless marriage. Godless beliefs. Ambitionless career. Emotionless relationship with my Mom and siblings. No hatred, mind you. And I'm being very honest about it.

- I understand why the marriage is sexless - no time from the kids and a job that requires me to travel three hours each day! So I spend every waking moment in the evening helping out.

- There is no God. 

- There is no point to ambition - we will all be dead in a hundred years, so fanning the ego is a waste of time. If there is something fruitful I better work at that instead.

- My dad's gone and my mom's probably just being mom. Being a dad I can understand why parents have such a special relationship with their children. I'm just sad I can't reciprocate. And my siblings are doing fine in their lives. So I got no logical worries there. I can't find the energy to care about the small things in their lives.


Won't do drugs. 

Cannot bring myself to delude myself.

I can just exist. That itself has its own requirements. I gotta make sure I have good health for my old years. I gotta save enough for my medical and daily expenses. Gotta stay sharp enough to be able to make money throughout my life. Gotta keep relationships reasonably intact to last a lifetime. Gotta help the kids become successful at life(whatever the society's definition for that seems to be). Gotta ensure my wife stays healthy through her life. Gotta ensure she has a roof and income to last her lifetime. Gotta ensure my nieces and nephews are well set in life. Gotta show Mom some love. 


So... where am I in this picture? What's life doing for me here. Yes I will continue to exist. And I will lead an uneventful existence. But ones resolve falters once in a while. Doesn't really falter. I just feel incredibly sad thinking about it all. Maybe it's the reciprocity that's the problem? Not really. Everyone in my life loves me. I am just starting to slip up a bit. Due to the fucking sexless nature of the marriage. Goddamit. That's the fucking problem isn't it. And here I was thinking I didn't find any point in life. Maybe there is one for me.

130,"Hey everyone, I'll try and keep this as short as possible.  

I'm unable to decide what to do regarding 2 jobs. Each job will have different repercussions regarding my current relationship. I'll give some backstory...

I'm a day trader.  I was living at home pursuing day trading full time however I then wanted to move out and get my own place, so I started looking around for 2nd shift jobs.  This would allow me to keep my mornings open to day trade then go to work in the evening to support my rent / finances.  

In July, I ended up taking a 1st shift job with an insurance company. In my mind this was to be short-term until I found something on the 2nd shift.  Well I did really well there and ended up liking it, however I was not being paid that much just yet. 

I eventually went on an interview with a manufacturing company for a 2nd shift Assembly position which paid substantially more.  

I decided to leave the insurance company to go to the manufacturing company, but I did not like the nature of the work.  I contacted the insurance company and they said that I could return to work there.  

In the interim, I have grown to like what I do at the manufacturing company, not as much as I liked working in insurance, but it is much more tolerable and I do get a sense of satisfaction out of what I'm doing.  

Here's where it gets tricky - my gf and I have been dating for 9 months and it's getting serious.  Working on the 2nd shift (3:30-1am) is hard on the relationship.  She is not hard on me for working these hours and she hasn't gotten angry over me working the shift or anything like that, but not seeing each other during the week and only on the weekend is tough and I feel like it's taking a bit of a toll on both of us.    

So ultimately what I'm considering is:

Insurance job - where I will be making $13.65 / hr for the time being until I move up in the company, which is something very real that happens as I've seen it inside the culture.  Employees do not stay at my position for very long at all, usually within 3-6months they move up to the next position where they're paid $16 and change.  There is plenty of overtime available.  This allows me to have a regular schedule to see my girlfriend more.  I was also happier there.  However working these hours will not allow me to pursue day trading, which is my ultimate goal in life.  Also my finances will run tighter here and I feel like I'll be contributing less financially to the relationship, which is a feeling that I struggle with.  My girlfriend makes much more than I do (85k / yr) and said that my finances are not a concern at this time.

Manufacturing job - where I am currently making $19.05 / hr.  There is less room for long-term growth however this will allow me to pursue day trading and I'll also have funds to make some major purchases which I'm going to need in the somewhat near future (car, phone).  Drawback is that I'm not thrilled about working 2nd shift so late because I can't spend as much time with my gf.  

I've talked to my girlfriend and she said that she'd absolutely love to see me more but that overall she wants me to go where I'll be happiest.  She said she can make either situation work, but how long can someone deal with dating someone who is absent during the week? On the flip side, how long can a girl date someone who makes considerably less money than them?  Maybe I'm being a little too conventional / closed-minded here but I grew up thinking the guy should be able to shoulder all / most of the financial burden. 

I have been racking my brain over this for weeks and it's to the point where I'm physically drained and it's affecting my current quality of life.  It's basically like I'm trying to choose between following my dream or having a great relationship.  I just want this to be over.  

So I'm coming here asking for help from anyone.  

Any input is appreciated far more than I can articulate.  ",03Nov2017,4

My friend Josh and I have lived together before and there was never a problem because we kept to our own and both never used the kitchen so we never argued over food or dishes. I was the first person he asked to move in when he decided to buy a house. We were supposed to have another friend move in with us but something happened and he couldn't.  But our other friend needed a new place to stay so... we have nick. 

However, my roommate nick kind of worries me. We've been on and off friends throughout the years because we're both stubborn. Putting that aside we used to share a room at one point because I was having some family issues and he was being a good pal but through that and the years we've known each other, the group knows how nick is.  He used to be really bad with money, he didn't know how to do laundry/ refused to learn because his mom did it for him, didn't clean after himself, and expected you to do things for him, + he could be an asshole sometimes. 

I admit he's changed somewhat like doing his own laundry and actually started being smarter with money. But the thing I'm worried about is we share a restroom. I like a clean restroom and I feel like he's not going to keep up his end/retaliate if I ask him to do it every other week. Plus he likes to ""cook"" and I already have a strong feeling that he might just leave them there and I'll feel pressured to wash them if I cook something as well because it'd be rude if I just washed mine even though there's a sink full of his dishes. I just know nick isnt going to keep up his end. For example if I ask him to help clean the house or after himself he's probably going to say ""why don't you do it?"" Or ""I'll do it later."" Or eat a shit ton of food then buy ""groceries"" like a gallon of milk and eggs. 

On the other hand, I don't want to create a hostile environment for josh because he's a great roommate, but I don't want to pick up nicks slack.

140,"Hi Reddit,

Today has put me at wit's end, I do not think I can continue to put up with my mother in law any longer.

She's an ex heroin addict and is on methadone. For the last 10 years of my partner's life she has taken advantage of her in every way possible. She literally does nothing for her self.

Our son was born 2 months ago and whilst we are coping, my MIL is relying on us to basically take care of her. When my partner and I moved in together we found my MIL a place to live. Within a week of being at the new place she decided to move, three weeks later she was unhappy with where she was. Since then she has been hanging off us trying to stay in our rented two bedroom unit. I finally caved and let her stay a night and we found her yet another place. The day of moving she didn't even go and we found her a hotel to stay at. 


She has been staying at hotels until two nights ago when I let her stay for two nights while we found another place to stay. We have gotten her a week's accommodation. 

Tonight I received a message from her telling me that at the end of the week she is coming to stay and there is nothing i can do about it. I discovered afterwards that my house keys are missing and I have been sitting by my front door since feeling like she is going to come in while I am sleeping.

I just want to protect my son and my partner from her emotionally abusive (not physical for a few years that I know of) mother and I don't know what to do.

Whilst my partner agrees that she is a massive problem and believes we should move and not tell her where we live she is reluctant to involve the police. I have been trying to help my partner be assertive and stand up for herself as I really feel like she is enabling her mother through doing everything for her but it is not really getting through to her. 

I have been actively looking for a new place to rent for the last few weeks but have not been successful in any of my applications. 


Any ideas on what I can do would be very appreciated. ",03Nov2017,9
142,"So about 2 weeks ago I started noticing a couple fruit flies around my apartment. No big deal. I set out some Terro apple traps hoping that would take care of the problem. About 2 or 3 days later, I wake up one morning to HUNDREDS all around my kitchen. I try to find out the source by checking all my food, getting all my dishes washed and out of the sink, and taking out the trash. The next day there's even more. This time I make my own traps with a couple cups of fruit. Wine, and dish soap. They still keep multiplying. I checked the traps and they've caught tons, but I still can't figure out where these guys are coming from. It's been two weeks and it's starting to get extremely ridiculous. I have even put up tons of fly tape.  Today I noticed there's little red dots on ALL of my dishes and I can only imagine it's fruit fly feces and I'm so disgusted. Has anyone had to deal with a similar issue? How can I get rid of them? 

Edit: I've also sprayed everything with bleach and poured it down the sink. I sometimes just get frustrated and try to vaccum up the flies but they seem to be too small to stay in the vaccum. 

Edit 2: I wiped down my cupboards in case there was food somehow splattered on there, and I've lived in this place for 2 years and thought my cupboards were cream/tan colored, but THEY ARE WHITE. I bleached them and they were covered in a layer of something that made them look cream colored. Ew. I hope this helps at least a little. ",03Nov2017,1

146,"This is probably going to sound like a shit ton of im14andthisisdeep stuff, so I'm sorry in advance :(

&amp;nbsp;

I noticed ~2 years ago that I have an obsession with determining the ""correct"" (solid, concrete) answer to questions, tasks, etc., and until I figure that ""answer"" out I will question every aspect of the thing at hand. Obviously, there are rarely any correct answers to any of the questions we have in life, so usually the only thing I can do to stop the erratic thoughts after that is to remind myself that there is no right or wrong, that I just need to be able to deal with the consequences. That probably sounds extremely silly and I realize it's very generic and motivational poster-*ish* but it's been the most helpful coping mechanism for calming myself down when I start questioning everything. 

&amp;nbsp;

**An example** would probably be the best way to actually lay out how I think and why it drives me mad (and this thought ""process"" is by no means exclusive to the topic of the example I'm giving): I recently saw a post about someone relapsing on their sobriety from alcohol. They were obviously bummed out enough to make a post about it, and someone in comments consoled them by including ""...Sobriety is not about addition, it’s about leaving the past in the past, holding yourself accountable one day at a time, and growing up!"" in their reply. --Now before I go on, from what I gather ""Nihilism"" seems to be shunned around the reddit, but that's how I'd identify myself if I was forced to. and from my nihilistic/pessimistic view I would staunchly disagree with the reply and sobriety as a whole. If you want to get drunk you should, if you want to get high you should, it won't matter once you die anyway whenever that may be. But something else inside of me that I *can't identify* completely contradicts my previous thought. There is a part of me that believes sobriety is the only way, because it is the only ""original"" and natural state of one's consciousness. This part of me believes that people shouldn't chemically induce an altered state of mind, because at that point they are no longer their true self. For example, I wouldn't date someone who is constantly drunk/high because we wouldn't be thinking or connecting in the same reality.

**TL;DR:** And that basically sums up how I approached *one* reply to *one* reddit post. That's how I approach many questions throughout the day, and I often strain myself and end up feeling very isolated, confused, and depressed by the end of it, with the added fact that I'm still uncertain about the thoughts anyway because there isn't a correct answer anyway. So I guess what I'm asking is if there is any sort of reading on this subject so I can get a better grasp on it from someone else's point of view and see how they approach handling it?",03Nov2017,3
147,"I woke in a traditional office setting. At my office we have a few operations people that keep the place clean (they’re not janitors they just upkeep and we have a separate cleaning crew that comes in at night).

One of the Ops people is mentally handicap, not sure what he has, he tends to repeat phrases and responds in them. Best way of putting it is he’s a little slow and habitual (not Down syndrome). I’m a rather polite person so I strike up conversations with him whenever I’m free for a second.

He tidies up the bathroom occasionally and so I’ll talk to him while he does that. Sometimes he’ll stand directly behind me while I use a urinal, about a foot to 6 inches away.

Today he stood directly behind me and his groin was up against my butt (he was clothed!). I politely asked him to back up and he did. We had been having a longer concern than usual because he enjoyed the topic.

Keep in mind we’re both males, I am larger than him in size so I didn’t feel intimidated just awkward. 

Is it worth getting him into trouble or should I just be weary of him not understanding personal space and be careful of when and where I have conversations with him. I don’t want to get the kid in trouble and fired but I also don’t want him doing that to someone else.",03Nov2017,1

150,"I just got engaged on Halloween, and we've started discussing guest lists. I want my entire family there... with the exception of one person who sexually assaulted me as a kid. My parents know about the assault, but pretty much swept it under the rug because they didn't know how to deal with it.

That said, I still want my attacker's mother, father, and sister there. I really don't want him there, but I have no idea how to invite the family except him. Or if that's even possible. I keep trying to tell myself that there will be so many people there, I won't have to interact with him at all, but I still think he'll be a nasty stain on an otherwise perfect day.

I slipped thoughtlessly behind him, dragging him close to the platform where the other people helped him get up. A second before people pulled me up I looked into the tunnel and saw the lights of the next train that was approaching.

At that moment I was not afraid at all. And that made me terribly surprised. A few minutes after that, I almost collapsed.

I'm not the kind of risk person. I would never jump into some unknown water, I'd never go too fast with a car. Etc. That's probably why I was so scared right after the incident. I did not think about what I was doing at all. It was so automatic. In my life, I've never experienced anything like this. Almost everything I do, I think reasonably, I decide things with logic.

I still can not get rid of that strange feeling of fear. What if it happens again?

164,"Throwaway. 

I'm looking for advice on how to ask for an open relationship with my husband. We're 27, been married for a little over a year but together for about seven years now. I love him, but I am looking for more. My interest in having an open relationship stems from my desire to have fun while I'm young (before babies) but also becuase I think it's a huge turn on when he flirts with girls and would love for him to hook up and tell me about it. We have a super trusting relationship, as we should. We've never had a single fight about jealousy in all our seven years. 

I'm just going to be honest. I am attractive, nice body, get a lot of male attention. I loooove it. I'm a huge flirt and though I have zero interest in an emotional relationship with anyone else, I really do crave physicality with the opposite gender. I've recently gone off birth control (which is where all this desire started) and have been SO HORNY. I literally eye fuck the shit out of every poor fellow that walks by me. It's turned into this burning desire to hook up with other people. The thing is, it doesn't have to be sex. I'd be fine if my husband and I established a rule of no sex, or just oral, or even just making out! I'm only this young/attractive for so long. I'd hate to be 80 and look back at my sexy years and wish I'd have had more adventures. Little background on me: I never got any male attention in high school. College, I blossomed and was wild and had a lot of fun for about a year and a half then met my husband. So I DEFINITELY didn't get it all out of my system before settling down. I just want to have these wild crazy flings before I'm too old and have kids. I want him to as well, and hell, I'd even love to do some three ways together! (side note, we did have a three way with my best friend once...) I just want to get all this experimenting/fun out of my system before we have a family, not to mention seeing him with a girl has always been a turn on for me. 

I've already brought it up a few times, mostly drunkenly, and he's actually been on board. But when it comes down to actually doing it, he sort of brushes it off and doesn't want to. I'd love for both of us to make a Tinder and just have a bit of fun. I'm going home to visit family for the holidays (out of state) in about a week and a half and I am thinking about asking if he'd be interested in experimenting at this time since we'll be apart for a few weeks. I'm willing to follow whatever rules he wants.

Quick Background: I work in the IT Department of a major airline. My department was recently ""Re-structured"" by upper management, and now the manager spot of my department is open.

I highly doubt I'll be the one they pick, but I applied anyway and got an email back for an interview. I'm completely stunned honestly, and excited at the (slim) chance that I might get picked. I've had leadership positions at other companies in the past, but nothing this intensive.

Any advice from management employees/HR employees on what I should expect in the interview? I have the technical side (IT Jargin) down to a science, but I haven't really been able to find a straight answer on management interview questions.

Also, if I were to be offered a management job, since this is my first REAL opportunity, what should I be aware of going in? Any advice from management to new people starting their first management job?

182,"This might actually be more than one question but they are somewhat interrelated. First, some background.
After high school I was accepted into a good college and am in my junior year. Awesome. Unfortunately, I am almost at the point of being ""kicked out"", so to speak, for my poor academic performance. I am a computer engineering major, and I am sure it's not that I am unable handle the material, but the structure and volume of it all chokes me, especially with the bout of depression that I've had for the past four years. On top of that, I am pretty sure I have ADHD. I might even be diagnosed, as I was on medication for a period of time; I am not really sure what counts as ""official"" in these sorts of things. After doing poorly for the last two semesters, this semester I pushed myself harder than ever to stay on task and learn the required material, but about three weeks ago something hit me. I ran out of steam or burnt out or something of that nature, I couldn't bring myself to go to a large portion of my classes, my attention issues octupled, and I felt so so tired all the time and would sleep through my alarm or not even bother to get up. The grades I had had worked so hard to keep reasonable plummeted, and now I am behind again on two of my classes, which I highly doubt I could fix even if all my issues disappeared overnight and I became a study machine. This was my last semester to fix things. I feel absolutely horrible. My family is helping with a large part of the costs, and I am a disappointment to them and myself and I don't know what to do.

So, here are the main questions I need help with. 
1. How does one prepare for the possibility of being removed from their institution, and how would they be able to get back in, or go to another university of similar status (if possible)?

My issues sucker-punched me. I thought I was just being stupid and a fiery motivation and pushing myself as hard as I could would make them disappear. I failed to address them, in other words. And when I realized these issues were not something I could just power through, I was buried in so many other responsibilities I did not have the space to get them sorted out.
2. How do I start on dealing with various anxiety, depression, uncertainty over my choice of major as a career, lack of social contact, and attention issues so this does not happen again? 

My apologies for the ramble, I am running on no sleep and have been worrying about this stuff for months.

I can say that it's pretty 50/50, with some people praising the drug, while others not so much. I know there's a lot of concern about the side-effects, but have heard that the results are worth it. I want to ask you Reddit, how your experience with the drug was. Was it worth it? Is it really as bad as people make it out to seem? Are the results life-changing?

197,"I am a university student who has a Friday afternoon class that I share with this really socially awkward guy. The first day of class he decides to sit next to me and I guess make me his designated “friend”. Which is totally fine and cool, I’m a friendly girl, but he is starting to bridge the gap from friendly to annoying.
I don’t want to be mean or anything to him, I can tell that he doesn’t have much socialization outside of class (he said he is only taking this class and one other one for mental-health reasons, and spends the rest of the time at home). So when he sees me he gets very excited. When he asked for my FB the first day I gave it to him to be nice, but I haven’t given any indicators that I want to be his lifetime BFF.
The thing is, is he messages me on Facebook like daily. Just constantly, trying to strike up conversation and whatnot. We don’t really have much in common and his social-awkwardness just makes it feel forced on my end.  

I don’t mind the guy, I don’t mind being in-class friends with him, even having the once in a while FB convo. It’s obvious he is starved for some friendship, but I don’t want things to progress further where he takes up more of my time (and he takes up a lot, really he is messaging me *daily*).  
Here’s the kicker: through talking in class he has found out that HE LEGIT LIVEs two streets over from me. This is our final class of the day so that means he is on the same bus as me and this is an hour and a half long bus. Already I have him messaging me every day, in class with me for 3h, and now a bus ride too???
I don’t want to sound mean, but that time on the bus is literally some of my only time to myself before I get home and have to make supper for everyone and do homework before bed. This guy was so excited to find out that I ride with him and now asks to sit next to me every time. I told him once that I have to do some homework on the bus so I need some peace and quiet, but he still tries to talk to me. Realistically I would rather just watch Netflix on the bus and it kills me because then I feel like I am slighting him.  
What do I do? How do I make it more clear I need some space from this guy? I really don’t want to be mean to him, I prefer to not confront him, especially because I feel like he holds our “friendship” up a lot higher than I do. Please don’t consider me as a mean person, I feel like everyone understands that they need space sometimes and I feel like I am losing it.

198,"Long story short, I think I have been scammed with the diversity lottery, because:
- didn’t know there’s specific .gov sites for application
- had to pay 60 bucks
- stupidly didn’t do my research

The thing is, even after paying them, they continue to send me updates, and ‘important information’ which I swear makes them look legit.
If it were a scam, they should have checked out after I paid the money, no?

Why I ask this, is that I want to apply through the proper channels, but the rule says that if you apply more than once in the same term, automatic disqualification. 
This site says that they have already submitted my application, even informed me of issues with the servers and that they re-submitted it.

The site is usadiversitylottery    .com...

Constructive criticism will be appreciated even if not welcome.
Thank you.

I have never experienced working  at an Ad Agency, so this is my first go-around. I believe that people are beginning to treat me differently. My client service co-workers are no longer interested in hanging out with me or even inviting me to lunch...which is frustrating because they ask everyone but me. After a couple of months, I am now more confident than I first started. But, I hate the cliques. I feel like i'm in high school.

201,"So, last week I made a new friend and it was great at first but now I feel like whenever we meet up when we're walking to class or at class, and I'd like to speak to him, it would be an awkward ""how's life"" ""good"" and silence. Also sometimes I'd have trouble encountering him to start a convo (which isn't me at all). 

Oddly when im talking to my friends, I'd walk up to him/her with zero hesitation and say ""how's life"" and start a huge convo about class, and moving to other stuff till we're going to our separate ways.

205,"So I recently started a new job at a Women's Health Clinic. The practice manager has been the practice manager for 19 years. Every policy they have at this job has not been updated in years. The employee hand book has not been updated since 2009! 
When I first came on I wrote up everywhere is saw a lack of compliance for Department of Labor Laws, medical documentation laws relating to waste and abuse. The practice manager took that packet and shredded it in front of me and then berated me. She has since been nonstop derogatory to me.
I have faced a large amount of conflict with this practice manager. She is also our person to go to for Human Resource. 
Most people who have had conflict with her change jobs, currently four others are looking at work elsewhere, as am I. 
However, what can I do? I want this practice to succeed but this manager is just gunning to run it to the ground. The owners say hey we have trusted her for 19 years, there is no way she is doing anything wrong. 
Any help advice or person I can go to would be grand. I would love this place to be audited or something just to push it towards correction. ",03Nov2017,3
207,"Today I was driving into a grocery store to pick up a few items. To get into the grocery store parking lot, you have to merge from two lanes into one and the roadway loops around the parking lot. So basically it's a two lane road that joins into one to form a circle. This always causes confusion because people don't like to merge like they're supposed to and will turn without using their directionals, so it's basically a big cluster fuck.

As I was driving through, a car in the lane next to mine (so the car was to my right) slowed down and I thought they were going to take a right turn into the parking lot. I kept driving straight because that's what I do 99% of the time, but the car next to me sped up so they could get in front of me. Since the lanes were merging into one, he couldn't get in front of me because I kept driving. He ended up blaring his horn and I was like ""k whatever dude"" and flipped them off (yes I know stupid).

I parked my car and got out and started to head for the entrance of the grocery store. Well the guy from car I mentioned found me (he had entered the parking lot at least two lanes before I did so he had to walk a ways to find me, which means he walked at least 100 feet to my direction) and began yelling at me. ""You like to flip people off? Well how about I break your fingers off and break your studpid glasses?"" I was terrified, so I didn't know what to say. I just kept saying ""sir, please stop"" and tried to get around him. He just kept yelling at me that he was going to break my fingers and every time I tried to get around him he kept in toe with me. I pulled out my phone and that's when he walked off into the grocery store.

Once he was out of sight I called my dad and explained the situation. He wasn't very helpful advice wise and told me I was overreacting (I began to cry because I was shaken up). There were quite a few people in the parking lot when this happened, including grocery store workers, but no one did anything. I ended up just going home and didn't go into the store.

I guess my question is, what should I do or have done? My dad said to let it go because I'll never see him again, but my sister told me to go back to the grocery store later once I've calmed down and let security know what happened. There are cameras in the parking lot so they might be able to see what happened. Should I just let it go, or should I go back and let security know?

I don't need a lecture on road rage and how what I did was wrong. I know I was being a dumbass when I flipped him off.

TLDR; dude threatened to rip off my finger and break my glasses in a grocery store parking lot because I flipped him off, what should I do?",03Nov2017,3

215,"Before I begin, I want to note that coworker #1 and I have always gotten along and have had no problems whatsoever in the year I've been here. 

On Saturday night of last week, the store manager and I were closing the store and she told me that my coworker (Who is an Assistant Manager, I'm a Customer Service Representative) and I needed to both work to work on a project together the following day and to make sure it got done since it was really important. The next day when I got to work, I told coworker #1 about working on the project together because that is what the store manager wanted us to do, and she told me there were more important things to do and if we had time before we closed, we could do it. Unfortunately it didn't get done because I was the only one working on it. I could only do very little between helping customers and other daily duties. 

Then on Monday, coworker #2 (Another Assistant Manager) pulled me aside and told me our manager was very mad that the project didn't get done. I told her it because coworker #1 said there were other projects and left me to do it myself. She said she'd talk to our store manager about it and I wouldn't be in trouble since I told coworker #1 what had to be done. 

Then today the store manager told me that when confronted, coworker #1 said I didn't tell her until we were closing, and I must be confused about what happened. We never had any issues and were always kind to one another, so I don't understand why she would lie and put the blame on me. My other coworkers have assured me they know that she's lying and they are surprised she would do something like that. It wouldn't have been an issue if she would have just owned up and admitted her mistake, because it got solved in the end and everythings fine. But lying about what happened made the situation way bigger than it needed to be. It's only a matter of time before we see each other and have to talk about it, so what should I do?",03Nov2017,2
216,"So, seven years ago, I was 17 and pursued by a 33 year old married man. Super friendly, likeable, charismatic guy. We had met in September and became good friends. By the end of October, he told me he was in love with me. Now that I'm older, I realize he was using me as an escape from his loveless marriage. I was young and pretty and full of life and excitement and he wanted something like that. He was shirking his responsibilities and putting a lot of pressure on me. Our relationship was kept secret for basically the duration and turned toxic and emotionally abusive (more gaslighting than name calling). It was a traumatic two and a half years of my life that left me emotionally damaged. 


I will say, for the record, that I waited until he had at least told his wife he wanted a divorce before agreeing to start a physical relationship with him. But I was also 17 and stupid and thought having a popular older man in love with me was super cool. 


Now, one of my very good friends is going through the same thing. Super nice, friendly, guy. She's actually in a band with him. He's also in his late thirties and married, she's 24. He's been really intense (which is similar to what my ex did) and texting her constantly, etc. She told me originally she wasn't going to let him pursue it, but I found her with a suspicious hickey on Halloween. 

The thing is, she's super insecure and has been actively pursuing relationships since I met her over a year ago. In the past year, she's told me she thought she was in love with at least three different men. So, I know for her to have this guy giving her all of this attention and building her up like she's the center of the universe is really appealing, and I don't blame her. 

I guess, the question is, do I tell her I cannot approve, both because I /know/ how unhealthy and toxic these situations are and because she is hurting this dude's wife, or do I keep my mouth shut? I know part of the reason I am so conflicted is because it's still slightly traumatic for me to think about my experience. But, it might ruin our friendship. At the same time, as a feminist, how can I sit back and let her participate in cheating? 

The worst part, is that our mutual good friend doesn't take my position seriously due to my past, and because I had another brief fling with an ex-professor (I had graduated) who had permission from his dying wife to stray a little bit. So, I also understand  that I come off as hypocritical, but that's why my advice is valuable. I'd never do either of those again because I'm sick of middle aged men using young women as escapes from their relationship problems. 

Sorry for the long rant. It's just a frustrating situation. 

tl;dr: I've been in two ambiguous situations with older men that turned out to be traumatic, and now my good friend is in one and I don't know if I should stand my ground that it's wrong, or keep my mouth shut. ",03Nov2017,3
217,"Hi reddit! I’m a 16, turning 17 year old girl, in a tough situation. This is really hard to explain so bear with me. My mom has been very strange her whole life, and apparently got into a lot of bad stuff beginning when she was coming into middle school age. She dropped out in 9th grade.She refuses to believe me when I tell her the truth, and that has been a disaster, particularly when I was younger. She had a divorce to my father claiming that she was brutally abused, but I don’t remember any abuse. When I was 7 she started worshipping Native American gods and did coke. She’s white and seems to believe in black supremacy and believes she is “ethnic and indigenous”. She drank a lot and could have killed us when she was drunk driving if the police didn’t stop her. When I was 11 she started accusing me of using meth and having sex with my classmates, and being raped. Even though I denied, she wouldn’t believe me and told authorities. She transferred me to a private school and same fucking thing happened next year except with marijuana replacing meth. I’m now homeschooled. She threatened me to “confess” because she could “feel it in her bones and her soul”. She thinks everyone is against her and is plotting against her “destiny” of becoming a millionaire. She believes people from elementary school are following her everywhere. She bullies my live in grandmother for money and has gotten thousands of dollars worth in plastic surgery, clothes, trips, and wants a Porsche. She tried to choke my grandmother when I was 13. Also she was doing some sort of burning plastic smelling drug, the cops were called but she persuaded me to return home. One time a neighbor called the cops when she started yelling profanities, breaking my things loudly and spit in my face. She bailed that night and promised to drink less. She also refused food from our neighbors because she disliked them when the trust was cut off so we didn’t have food the whole month of November. I couldn’t study for 6 months because she wanted me to get my teeth fixed with braces from a trust grant  before I started 8th grade. 
In more recent matters, she’s wasted ALL of our money, refuses to get employment because of “them” and refuses to accept reality. The whole trust is going to run out by March, and we have NOTHING left. I live in a rented apartment. I’m not allowed to have a job and she’d call the cops if I tried to get one. She wants me to live with her forever and says I’m just stupid, immature for wanting to live alone when I’m older. She tells me the worst things. She insults me, she degrades me. She gets furious if I have a pimple or leave my stuffed animal on the floor. As I said, she drinks almost every night, a bottle of wine in the trash everyday. My grandmother is elderly, she can’t work full time. I have a boyfriend I met online and we’ve been talking for a few months, he’s 19. He doesn’t drink and seems to be motivated in his life. He’s been through a lot. He wants me to move in when he moves to LA and he seems to be sincere and a good man and it’s my only chance. We’re hoping to rent a studio together and I’ll try to get a job waitressing or something. I’ve been scouted for modeling before so I’m going to look into agencies in the area.  I don’t want to call any authorities because it will show up in phone records and my mom is EXTREMELY paranoid. My mom is controlling and manipulative. I wasn’t allowed to go to other kid’s houses as a kid, no sleep overs, I wasn’t allowed to play with certain kids in front of her because of their “evil parents”.

220,"They say that *never* is *always* too strong a word, but it may be just the slightest overstatement to say that I've *never* finished a day feeling like I've accomplished everything I've wanted to accomplish.  Even on my most productive, dedicated work days I usually take more ""break time"" than intended, and I continue to make procrastination a habit, despite repeatedly committing to stop.  Despite ADHD medication, therapy, hundreds of attempts at new scheduling schemes, and frustration after disappointment after embarrassment after feeling of deep dissatisfaction.  Despite the choice being obvious -- **every** time -- between doing the inevitable with time to spare and doing it in a frenzy in exchange for the chance to hop on whatever bullshit train is in the station *right now*. 

Wasting time poses a more general problem, inclusive of the first: I spend so much time on mindless things that I rob myself not only of time to do the essential (*i.e.*, I procrastinate) but also of constructive leisure time in which to cultivate the talents I have (or feel that I could develop with practice).  I want to learn to program and translate languages, as well as become a more regular and frequent reader and a published writer.  If I used my leisure time wisely I could at least make these goals more plausible; as it is, I almost always choose frivolous activities over intellectual ones.

**For those of you who can relate: how can I teach myself more constructive habits?**
It's not a matter of ""trying harder"" or ""putting my mind to it"": I've tried both and, as I've learned in therapy, human willpower is a lot weaker than a lot of us imagine (how many people are still going to the gym like they ""promised"" on New Year's?).  My therapist has suggested reward systems, but these ultimately fail for me because they rely on self-control -- control which is, of course, lacking in the first place if I need a self-constructed reward system.  A few thoughts I've had are:

* **keeping expectations reasonable**: Still work on the procrastination, but consider that it may just be a human issue; self-set goals are hard to keep (""I, who am currently vomiting in a strange man's toilet with a throbbing headache, hereby swear on this Sunday morning never to drink again -- ever!"") and apparently even 8hr/day office workers are only productive &lt;3hrs/day (!)
* **give being productive a ""trial run""**: For one day, between 8am-8pm (say), given the choice between random Wikipedia surfing and reading/programming/languages, force myself to choose the latter.  If I am absolutely miserable it's just one day and I can stop/adjust; otherwise I have a satisfying experience I can reference

During that time one of my older cousins would make me and a family friend who was my age watch soft core porn and touch one another’s genitalia I thought it was a game that once my mom met my step dad I tried to show one of my step cousins how to play we were both around six and needless to say I got in trouble and my parents never did or said anything about it. I felt as if that was where it really went downhill with me. I was never a smart kid in elementary school. My parents being old school would punish me for doing wrong by hitting me and one day a girl seen the bruises on my body she told my teacher and child services came to my home I always knew my parents would never forgive me for that day and they would never let me forget. I was constantly bullied in school never got good grades and I was an ugly duckling I was bullied for my looked by this one boy until we were forced to date by some friends in the seventh grade. This boy even though he bullied me took a liking towards me. And so it began he now told me I was beautiful and perfect and all these amazing things that he would never think of saying when he bullied me and of course I gave in I felt good then he asked me for pictures of my body because I was so beautiful I did it I gave in to him and so we went on like that for months until I got caught my parents wanted to disown me they were disgusted but never the less me and this boy continued dating until he finally cheated once we made it to high school to which I moved on and moved to a different school.

She wouldn't take a hint to leave me alone, so I ended up outright telling her to give me some space for a while before I can muster up the energy to hang out or hold hours long conversations... which she did for a couple days before telling me more or less ""you don't have to respond, but [something trivial] and youre my only friend so I'm telling you now lol.""  
  
Since then, I feel like she's really been playing that angle, by saying I'm her only friend, she doesn't have anyone else to talk to, and kind of weird stuff that makes me... sort of uncomfortable, as someone reserved and kind of antisocial I guess. Like saying ""I'll tell you something about my life if you tell me about yours"" and ""i think you're  [something] because I just know you that well am I right?"" And kind of just... digging for information about me. As well, she makes a point of pointing out if I've posted on social media but not responded to her text messages (maybe that actually is kind of scummy? It's just Tumblr though and it's not in an effort to be social like texting her would be. I post art there). And then she's done this thing where she tells someone else to message me on her behalf if I don't answer her.  
  
She's just... being exhausting, I don't feel comfortable posting online on accounts she knows anymore, I feel like I can't play video games online (she insists that my online status be public), unless I've spoken to her, I worry about her reaction to anything I decide or do. And our conversations lately make me uncomfortable... am I just too antisocial? Too sensitive? How do I not... overreact this way? I tried to keep this post unbiased/without assumptions about her intent, as like I said, these conversations are mostly through text or phone and not in person, and I can be paranoid... she used to be a great friend, really, but the last few months I feel she's been making me rather unhappy and stressed.",03Nov2017,2

248,"Why do people, particularly married people and in my experience women(not to say men don’t), but why do people bait you into arguments by saying or doing something hateful only to abandon the conversation or flat out ignore you. 

For example why would a woman allow you to know that she’s cheating on you without directly telling you, but purposefully leaving evidence(such as a phone) and then refuse to even acknowledge it when questioned? Or just say something rude in return. 

Another example: saying something hateful with intent to hurt someone’s feelings but then pretend like they’re not interested in talking to you about what they just said and completely go silent.

Example 1 and 2 are of the same woman, however involve different males at different time periods.

249,"I just moved across the country to live with my parents in a small university city where I don't know anyone. New city for them as well. As soon as I got here I thought my discomfort would pass, but it hasn't. I'm just going to pour out details in the next paragraph but here it is:

I'm told that I'm a good looking 5'9, 27 y/o guy. I decided to leave my job in construction management and my condo back in my home city 3000km away to finish my undergraduate liberal arts degree (I'd like to teach but one step at a time). I put up my condo for rent and it brings in a bit of money that I put towards school.  

I moved here because I have credits at this local university but the marks are pretty low (I was a fuck up first time around) I intend to finish it by the time I'm 29. 

My main worries are:

1.  I met a great girl 22 y/o (very good looking / very cool, has a degree and likely to succeed) who actually pursued me but isn't going to wait around for me while I'm gone, I don't expect her to for 2-3 years. I'm convinced she's the best I've had / met. We still keep in contact, basically worried I may regret moving away from her forever.

2.  I'm worried I might not find another girl when I'm 29 and my looks will begin to fade and that all the ""good girls"" will be gone by the time I return to my home city.

3.  I'm worried that If I quit and go home, I'll essentially be seen as a failure by everyone and my not even get my old job back. 

It's hard being in classes with 19-20 y/o students, it's a reminder of how far behind I am. 

I have a choice of going home as a failure / potentially losing the girl because of this / not getting dream job.

 or 

Staying here sticking it out and losing the girl to some other guy. Being a bit older and losing the potential to find a ""good girl"" with age and potentially not getting into teachers college.

I knew this was bad news but my guard was let down and I had found out I was pregnant..... I knew I didn’t want to be with him because of all of his unresolved baggage and how he was not truthful about any of it.... now I have broke up with him and he is packing up and leaving this weekend..... his “wife” has asked him to come stay with her and now I am pregnant and alone with no support system (hence reaching out to reddit) I feel completely stupid and I’m really trying to focus on how to heal from this and build myself back up again.... he literally convinced me to quit my job and that he would take care of me while pregnant so now I have no income and scrambling to find a job even though I was supposed to be going to school....

258,"My sister just got back from a trip from BJU! She has said nothing but good things about it (except for the food lol) and that she has really enjoyed the experience there. Actually, this trip she has just made as been the second time she has been there.

After having been given a book about missionary work by my sister (she bought it from the gift shop) it made me excited to investigate into the school (due to me wanting to become a missionary) well, after looking some things up about it, people have had nothing but BAD things to say about it! 

Yeah, there are some good reviews. Some of these ""bad"" reviews are from non-christian people. Now, it's good to read opinions from all sides...But sometimes, it does make me think about the credibility if it's from  non-believer in a ""Christian"" environment, because of course, they are (most of the time) going to say nothing BUT bad things about it. Such as being ""too strict"" and ""sexist"" and ""racist""....

Aside from that, even some Christians have had bad things to say  about it. Such as the rules being, well, too strict. And how there have been cases in which rape and assault allegations/stories have been covered up. There was a even a review in which this one gal told a story that her friend's diploma had been taken away from her (she was weeks away from graduating) because she arrived at the campus a LITTLE late after having watched a movie with her friends.

So many of these bad reviews seem so crazy, that I can't help but think people are making up lies. I don't ever want to deny, (and certainly not the stories about rape) but I just can't believe some when the review sounds ""overly"" biased. 

Just to note, I am a non-denominational Christian. And from what I have heard so far about BJU, I appreciate that have rules. Because, on one hand, I am quite sick of many of these ""party colleges"" but some of the rules BJU has did kind of...Not sit right with me. I'm all for having good decorum, but not having your rights taken away! I mean, you aren't even allowed to listen to Christian music that has ""electric beats in it ect"" and I like me some good Christian bands. I'll give a link below for the Yelp reviews, and then you guys can tell me if it's they're credible or not.

Anyway, I've been venting my frustrations and emotions at my friends. But today, one of them told me that she never liked me and that she only wanted to date since she wanted to make she liked jealous. I was shocked. She said one of her friends told her, and that my ex told her. 

I was shocked and upset. A few days ago, she admitted that while we were dating, that when we were texting each other, she would say, ""gtg"" When she was watching videos, so I wan't sure if she'd tell me the truth if I asked her. Then, the person who told my friend and the person my ex liked said the same thing, and that they didn't tell me since they didn't want to hurt my feelings. But a few days before, he said that he liked both me and him at the same time and that he didn't tell me so he wouldn't hurt my feelings. Maybe the person who told my friend told him that she never liked me. But she said that she remembered how red my ex's face was when she said she liked me.

When I got home, I texted my ex and said something along the lines of, ""Do you promise to tell the truth, only the truth, and nothing but the truth in response to the questions I'm going to ask?"" I was mad, hence the angry tone. She said yes and said something along the lines of, ""Did you like me *at all* while we were dating?"" She said yes, and then I told her that several people told me otherwise and that someone is lying. She said that they were lying. So I texted my friend and the person my ex likes a screenshot of the conversation. My friend said that my ex was lying and that I should trust her (her being my friend) and that I trusted my ex too much. I told her I wasn't mad and that I was just confused. The person my ex likes was level headed and said that he wasn't sure how it started.

I'm starting to get sick of sitting around,watching netflix,and I thought here was the best place to start to look for advice and encouragment. 
I have certain talents but I just have no idea how to get anywhere with them,or how to start to use them. I just have so little motivation it's unreal. I know I can make a change in the world but as soon as I wake up it's a 'can't be arsed' attitude. I'm getting nowhere with my life apart from fucking around on the internet or getting pissed with friends and it's making my depression and co-existing disorders worse because i'm not putting my time to good use. 
So I need your advice-if anyone has *anything* that they could offer i'd be eternally grateful.
Just a heads up i'm a fifteen year old girl if that helps/doesn't help in any way.
So,my past talents that I seem to lack the motivation to do anymore
-Writing. The only thing i'm way ahead of my years at. Before I lost motivation I was writing articles online,doing public speaking from speeches i've done ect. The thing is-I have major writers block and I need to find a website where I can truly reach an large audience. I have so many things that will catch the readers attention but I have no idea where to start. Wattpad is too childish and mainly full of pre-teens,writing fourms usually don't get a big audience and news websites such as the guardian or buzzfeed can't garuntee your writing is published. Obviously my sole purpose isn't monetary gain,BUT,it would be nice to get a little back from dedicating my time to whatever it is i'm writing. 
-Gym. Another thing i'm not nessecarily 'good at',but something which I did a lot before I lost all motivation. I was training,preparing for bikini fitness ect and all that went out the window. I still am really interested in bikini fitness and have been exploring the possibility of pole fitness? (not stripping-two *very different* things) and gymnastics. 
-Filmmaking &amp; producing. Again-i've been making films,short videos ect for a long,long time but have stopped recently. I usually loose interest too quickly and making films is so much effort.
So these are the main things I was doing before depression hit-hard. I have so much potential (please don't mistake this for bragging. I have potential but I need to learn for it to be used properly and correctly!!) and I literally feel it wasting away.
So if you have any ideas on who I can get in contact with,write for,get my motivation back,anything-just please comment below. Everything helps.

265,"I am living in a commune with 3 other students around the same age. There are two girls who are best friends and knew each other before, another guy and me.

A close friend of the two girls already told me that they think about moving out, I send them a message the next day that I know about their thoughts and that we should meet up to discuss it. Three months pass without a response from them, and since I was in my hometown during springbreak I thought it would be best to not put any pressure on them.

I was the only one with a car, and I always helped the girls with their groceries, invited them to drive with me to the university etc.
We talked about a lot of stuff, their Tinder dates, I was also cool with their friends, and I always tried to start a conversation when we met in the kitchen or hallway. We also went to parties and I tried to initiate other activities like driving to the sea etc. I always made sure to invite my male roommate who always declined. Most of the evenings he sat alone in his room watching tv and drinking booze. 

I could sense from day 1 that he didn't like me. However I always tried to treat him the same like the girls but usually every conversation ended with a few short sentences from him without any interest to talk with me. Our whole Whatsapp conversation in 15 months consisted of 3 messages sent from me asking if he is alright when he vanished from a party, only saying the two girls goodbye, leaving me worried since he was heavily intoxicated. Another one of his strange habits was to sneak through our flat, slowly and without a noise opening the door of my room and looking behind it, when his girlfriend visited him. Like he needed to make sure they could go to the exit without a suicide bomber blowing them up.

During our final group talk when they told me that they actually don't like me he was really aggressive and angry looking. Which surprised me since there was no reason, three weeks before I offered to drive the 2h to the flat to give him my key since he lost his own inside. This was our last indirect interaction in the time before. 

Do you think this is a reasonable reaction? I would have happily changed anything which might have disturbed them, but telling someone out of nowhere that he needs to leave is pretty rude in my opinion.

268,"I'll try to keep things short.

I've been with my current girlfriend, L for almost 10 years. We met in college, and she's worked full time since she graduated college, and supported me emotionally and financially while I pursued my PhD. After I finished, I started work, and now I make significantly more than she does. I don't begrudge her this, she worked hard for years so that I could live my dream, and I'm planning to propose over Christmas.

My mother and I haven't seen eye to eye for a long time. My father passed away when I was a child, and left a significant amount of money to pay for my college education in my mother's control. When I graduated from high school, I learned that she'd spent the money over the years, and there was nothing left to pay for my education.  She insisted that she *needed* that money to ""take care of herself"" after he died, but she didn't dip into either of my sister's education funds.

Throughout our relationship she has refused to meet my girlfriend. I didn't think anything during the first year or so, but after that, it has driven a wedge between myself and my family. I only go see them once a year, and usually on a random weekend, because I'm more than a little upset that she keeps referring to my girlfriend of nearly a decade as a 'fling'. The only reason I haven't married her already is that I wanted to finish my degree first.

Recently, I went home to visit for my youngest sister's birthday, and I had some mail in my travel suitcase that I'd picked up on my way out the door. It was nothing I deemed urgent, the quarterly bank statements for both my GF and I, some spam, I literally grabbed it out of the mailbox and shoved it in my suitcase. While I was taking my younger sister to go see a movie, my mother apparently searched my belongings, found the mail, and opened it. I came home to find my mother with my girlfriend's bank statement, and a bunch of windows open on her computer, angrily confronting me about things I hadn't ""confessed"" about my girlfriend: mainly, that she makes less than me, and has mental illnesses, which she sees a therapist for monthly. My mother saw debits on her account to the clinic the therapist works out of, and decided to google it. She was obsessed with this idea that my girlfriend was a ""psycho"", and apparently also that my girlfriend plays World of Warcraft was a problem?

My mother tried to order me to stop seeing her, to which I just laughed, took my things, and left. I stewed on the way home, then called my mother and informed her that I was going to spend thanksgiving and christmas with GF's family (who have been nothing but welcoming to me: her mother has treated me like a son the entire time I've known her), and that I would prefer not to speak to her again until she apologizes for how she's acting towards my girlfriend, accepts that she's part of my life, and that I'm going to marry her.

My mom tried to call me dozens of times over the next few days, and I started receiving calls and messages from my sisters, aunts, and uncles, all talking about how I'm tearing the family apart by ""risking my life"" living with a ""crazy"" woman. 

I'm at my wits end. I am not leaving my girlfriend, even if it means I never speak to my family again, though I'd like to avoid cutting off ties with my family if at all possible.

276,"Skippable 2 paragraphs of context: My dad was unsatisfied with my performance at my old university (later I learned that my failure rate was still within normal standards). Due to the ever looming possibility that I had to drop out, I (acting by myself) applied for my local university in my hometown. Today, while I still have an active record over at OldU (and if I return to a different carreer, would not be starting from scratch), I have no financial and general support to return.

I did ended up joining LocalU, CompEng. Freshman year is strictly common core, and it *sucks*. Close to no content per class, barely any assignments, no real motivators, it's a shitshow. Everybody thinks ""It's because you've already experienced it so you're just bored by retaking it"" and yet it's not since complaints are pretty widespread from most of my classmates straight out of HS.

---

LocalU has not been fullfilling at all, and currently my family is not really giving me any choce on the matter. Therefore I am considering the possibility for self study on my own. Since before I left HS, I had floated on the possibility of atempting to self create a CS degree on my own. At my old university, I had a couple of classes where we were referred to online courses (Harvard, Berkley ^*RIP*, MIT OCW, Stanford) for reference and support material only for us to figure out that classes were pretty much cloned from those courses.

For them, school is school. Whenever I've mentioned this idea to different close relatives and counselors, the response usually is an implicit / subliminal variation of ""That's an excellent idea! Let's move it off to the side and never talk about it ever again"". The only real support I currently have is for LocalU, which I've decided is not appropriate for me. Any path considering dropping out of University would involve having to look out on my own partially. I can expect temporary support from my mom (divorced, currently sustaining on variations of Alimony) but I'd still be looking for subject related work ASAP.

I've always felt limited by family, unable to do many things my own way simply because they didn't feel like they were appropriate or had different plans in mind, this means finally breaking free with all the freedoms and also responsibilities it involves. This is npt an easy or light decision to make, so I just want to make sure I'm not making a monumentally stupid mistake by doing so.",03Nov2017,2
278,"There's a guy at work who is a lot older than me, say 30 years older. He always makes comments, initially I thought as a joke. 

For example, I asked a group of people (including him) if they were going to our end of year ball, and he said 'only because you'll be there'. This is the sort of comments he always says to me. 

The other day I was signing something on a pinboard that is up on the wall, and he came up behind me. The document in question is something he doesn't need to read as it's nothing to do with him, but he came behind me and pushed his crotch into my butt. I moved to the side and reached over to continue signing off the document, and he moved with me and again, pushed his crotch into my butt. 

He continues to touch me unnecessarily, touching my shoulders and neck when asking me questions. I am senior to him in terms of business level, so this is inappropriate anyway.

I just don't know if this is something I should report. I feel so uncomfortable around him anyway, and this incident reaffirmed it. Part of me wants to just keep an eye on it, but I don't want to expose myself to further harm. 

Is it even something that would be considered harassment? 

Any advice would be appreciated, I am now dreading our end of year ball as I'm scared he is going to do something to me. 


EDIT:

Thank you everyone for encouraging me to report it. I told someone during my shift today, and she came with me to report it to the management team. They are going to start an investigation tomorrow. 

I'll keep you updated. ",03Nov2017,26
280,"Hey guys! I graduate in May with an associate degree in computer technology. I want to make sure I have a variety of options (fall backs) when it comes to job opportunities. A bachelor’s is obviously one route I could take, my only problem there is the cost. Technical college is completely free for me between financial aid and scholarships.

Surprisingly I’m getting a strong mix of reactions on both sides. Some folks think that because I’m not necessarily looking for upward mobility in one field and because technical college is free for me, I should just get a second associate degree. Other people think that I should look ahead to the future/plan for higher up positions and get a bachelor’s. Personally I don’t have any specific career goals. So far I’ve just been interested in programming and working with databases. 

I’m leaning towards the second associate degree mostly because I’m about 10-15 classes away from certain ones vs being about 2-3 years away from a bachelor’s. I’m willing to work towards which ever is better no matter how long it takes though. ",03Nov2017,2
281,"For a few months now me and my fiance have been planning to see a friend we have been talking to on discord for over a year now, and now the day has come, I don't have a car to pick her up (she's 4 hours away btw) to see the friend that is 3 hours from her so she is using her car to see him without me. Me and my fiance got into a little argument last night and she left upset with me, and a thing to know about my fiance is that she is a very faithful, loving, and overall amazing person, but when she's upset she knows how to hurt me. I am DEATHLY afraid of anyone coming between us, and when she's upset she'll make what I know are empty threats, saying things like ""Keep it up and I'll leave the ring at home and find myself a nice college boy"" (She's 21 and I'm 19 btw), or saying something about contacting a guy she slept with on tinder a few years ago for another night, you know, shit that REALLY gets to me emotionally. And since she left a little upset to visit our friend all alone with him in his dorm, is it okay for me to be worried about anything happening between them? btw we were planning on getting drunk and watching movies but since I couldn't make it they're getting drunk and watching movies without me. I know she's very faithful, I'm just scared. Please let me know if I'm overreacting about her staying alone and getting drunk with him. I'm really worried about this.",03Nov2017,2
282,"(First post. Hello!)
I don't know how to get over this guy. We met ONCE about two years ago. How do I let it go?
-Story Time-
A room full of people and he was looking at me. I gesture to him and he repeats. We do this occasionally throughout the night. In the end, I end up having to be next to him. He repeats a gesture we did earlier in the night, signifying he remembers me. I said something cutely, and he smiled and laughed.
-End of Story-
I don't know why this one night is eating away at me. I've dated since then. I always go back to thoughts of that night, and how maybe one day I'll magically see him again. Unrealistic, I know. I've even brought this up in therapy. All I get is how maybe it was fate, and ""congratulations on having an experience that mad you so happy."" It doesn't make me happy to recall it sometimes. It's frustrating. I wish it never happened. I don't know how to make it go away.",03Nov2017,2
283,"I am 29 years old with 4k in debt, zero savings, a crappy 12$ an hour job, weekend father with child support payments, an AA degree in Studio Art, and living with my dad's widow. How did I come to this? Well, I  came from a family of drug addicts, had a son at age 16, lost my dad to liver disease a few years ago, went through a divorce in my early 20's, and dated another woman for 4 years whom ended up getting cancer. After my divorce, I spend a year or so in therapy to get my head straight. When my dad got sick, I was the only person in the family willing to be his caregiver. When my fiance got Lymphoma, I spent months taking care of her needs over my own. Fast forward to today, and I am feeling depressed that I am about to turn 30 and have little to show for my life. I have put everyone else's needs above my own. I plan to go back to school in 9 months in order to get my bachelors degree in Art. It will take 2 years. I intent to go into a multi- subject teaching program afterwards which will take another year and a half. So, I will be 33 at best before I can begin looking for a teaching job. I have friends I grew up with, none of whom are particularly talented or intelligent, that have achieved great things. I am happy for them but their success makes me feel small. I recognize that they haven't had comparable obsticles to overcome. Still, how do I have compassion for myself and continue with my goals without feeling like I wasted my entire life? I want nothing more than to have a teaching career that I can be proud of and to be better off financially. I want the home, the wife, money in the bank, family vacations etc. However, it all seems so far away. My greatest fear in life is failing to achieve my goals before the cold hand of death reaches out and touches me. How do I get over my fears of failure and move into the future while leaving behind the baggage of my past? Thanks for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any advice.",03Nov2017,2
284,"I just got a new job, today was my fourth day working.

About an hour before I got off a customer had a total of $90 and wanted to pay some with cash the rest on her card. So I put her cash amount in and then waited for her to pay with her card, out of no where the register opens and she never paid with her card. At first i was confused and asked if her card went through and she said yes, i grabbed the receipt and saw it paid with cash twice so I was really confused, and she grabbed the receipt and quickly walked out

I got extremely nervous and realized she got away with only paying half her purchase. I told a manager and a girl who works there and they acted like I was stupid and that nothing was wrong. I know it was. I must have pressed cash again by accident and didn't realize it. I'm so scared i'll get fired and I've been reading similar situations and people were arrested, fired, and so on. I'm so scared. What should I do? Just act like nothing happened until someone says something? I really don't want to get fired I just started. ",03Nov2017,5

I am not interested in a career nor am I interested in a trade dominated by males (It makes me uncomfortable to work among mostly men). Any advice?
