0,"A little bit of a background. I'm 17 and graduating from high school this year. I've been in a relationship for a little over a year (my longest relationship). And I'm in this program where you can take college classes and get credit for both your high school diploma and for a college degree.
Me and my boyfriend broke up about a week ago, and a few days ago I started classes for a new quarter. In addition, my high school has given me this big project that I have to do in order to graduate. The project pretty much has me plan my life after high school.

My problem is that everything is different and it's kind of giving me an identity crisis. Me and my boyfriend were so close that I really don't know what to do with my life now that I don't spend time with him. I have hobbies but I get bored of them pretty quickly, so I sit around a lot. I'm not good at talking to my friends either so I don't have any close friends or people I really associate myself with. I don't even know if the degree I'm working towards is what I want to do. And then I'm in a really big pickle with that project, since I have no idea who I even am right now, let alone what I want be in the future.

So what can I do to try and figure out who I am? Also, feel free to say anything else that you think might help.",13Jan2017,1
2,"I have this dilemma. I am trying to move to an apartment and the roommate (Roommate A) I have been living with the past year wants to move with me. I also have a co-worker(Roommate B) at my job who is trying to move out of his house (issues with the mom charging rent on him now). So I was trying to find a 3 bedroom place. I did find one, but they are each fighting over the master bedroom. 

Roommate A wants the master bedroom because he would like the space for his clothing, and other items.

Roommate B wants the room because he has a girlfriend and wants the privacy. 

Each is willing to pay more for the room about the same amount. 
Roommate B is willing to find another person to be the ""third leg"" and has possibly found someone already interested. 

I reached back to Roommate A who basically told me he can't afford a single place and was banking on rooming with me in either a 2-3 bedroom place since he has no family in the area and can't afford a single apartment. 

Roommate A doesn't sympathize with B because he feels he already has a place to live even if the situation is not ideal.

I have been pondering on this all day, and I don't know what exactly to do or how to approach the situation. 

I feel guilty if I just dump Roommate A, but it would be more convenient for me to room with co-workers. As right now I do have a long commute. 

I also threw out the idea that Roommate A could stay in the house we are living in now where each roommate pays rent for his room. But he wasn't keen on the idea. ",13Jan2017,1
3,"Although I have a very common first name, my last name is relatively uncommon. That's why it is so surprising to me- and creepy, really, that not one but TWO men with my name have been busted for Child Pornography. What's worse, both of them have been in the news and thus come to the top of any google search of my name.

I just became an attorney, and my professional reputation is very important to me. Anyone with a brain will figure out that these articles are not referring to me, but the initial jarring reaction of seeing ""CHILD PORNOGRAPHY ARREST"" on a google search next to my LinkedIn page just isn't fun.

What can I do? ",13Jan2017,2
6,"In recent years I've become really self-conscious about the volume of my voice. Sometimes my friends will tell me to tone it down, I find myself getting really loud in exciting conversations and I don't notice when I get that way. Any tips or advice?",13Jan2017,1
8,"Long story short: in Fall term at my university, I had two classes with an incredibly disruptive, but seemingly handicapped girl. I'm now in Winter term, and have found that I have at least one class with her this time around as well. I've since learned that she suffers from both Asperger Syndrome and Tourette's, and the best way I can describe her is as a young woman with the emotional maturity of a small child. Most of it's odd but benign--making animal noises, rocking back and forth in a very over-the-top way, etc. However, a lot of it is outright obnoxious. She's very literal minded, so if a professor makes a joke, she'll loudly ""correct"" them repeatedly. For example, a professor once read a poem that involved the imagery of catching rain on one's tongue...

Professor: ""Of course, no one does that now because of acid rain."" Student: ""I do!"" Professor: ""Haha... okay."" Student: ""I catch rain on my tongue."" Professor: ""Alright."" [five minutes later the student angrily raises her hand] Student: ""You SAID people don't catch rain on their tongues anymore, but I DO!"" Professor: ""I know."" Student: ""BUT YOU SAID THEY DIDN'T!"" Professor: ""It was a joke."" Student: ""... Okay."" [cue noises and bodily spasms]

I've witnessed her yell at someone for sitting too close to her, yell at different hired assistants/note takers for taking too many notes, physically lunge at one of her note takers for contradicting her... If a professor or a GE suggests anything like taking notes in the margins while reading, she'll interrupt in a panic, insist that she has to write on a computer, and repeatedly interrupt the lecture--3, 4, 5 times--after being told to discuss it after class... She once came in late after being unable to find the building and burst into deafening sobs because it was too much to handle... Once bumped her leg and when someone asked, ""Are you okay?"" she took tremendous offense and loudly demanded to know why they would ask if she was okay when it was CLEAR that she was not. She literally could not comprehend why the question was being asked and demanded an explanation for a couple minutes... She has confusion, agitation, and random thoughts throughout class and will either start talking about tangential topics to the instructor, or loudly to her helper (she has poor volume control, so even these side conversations can be heard by everyone)... Topping it off are the aforementioned ""animal"" noises and running everywhere in sight. She nearly knocked over a professor recently after howling like a werewolf in a building's lobby, then stomping/running into class toward her desk.

No one, including myself, says anything because it's all rather awkward, and because (presumably) we all have sympathy for her. I realize that she's... I don't know, disturbed, handicapped, whatever you want to call it... And I've struggled with things like depression and anxiety in the past, so I'm very sympathetic to people who might be struggling. However, I'm not sure this is the appropriate place for her, and I've frankly met autistic folks before who were not anywhere near this annoying. She strikes me as someone who's been indulged for a long time because of her disabilities, and this combination has turned her into a bratty kindergartener in the body of a grown-ass woman.

The thing is... I'm not even sure where to go for this. The professors seem to have a ""look the other way""/put up with it mentality, and I'm not confident in anyone at my university having the willingness to kick her out of class. There are online forms for ""grievances"" and the like, but they all seem to pertain to things like discrimination and sexual harassment. I'm also frankly embarrassed and worried at the prospect of discussing it with administrative staff in person. I previously took a medical leave at this university, and the bureaucracy and number of references and different offices I had to visit were remarkable. I don't relish the thought of going building to building, office to office telling confused people that I'm effectively looking to reprimand a disabled girl for being annoying. I think if anyone were to confront her about these issues in person, or to tell her to be quiet during class time, it would erupt into a Category 5 shitstorm.

tl;dr: A young autistic woman is ruining class with constant disruptions, and I'm looking for a way to have her removed without coming across like a total asshole. What are my options?

-----

EDIT: I really appreciate everybody's feedback. It's been consistently positive and constructive. I think I'm going to take the advice of submitting an anonymous note to one of my instructors (this particular class is a large lecture taught by three professors) and give it a little time. I normally prefer to be direct in my dealings with people, but this is sufficiently uncomfortable that I'll be more indirect. If that doesn't work, I can discuss it with an instructor personally, and if need be, I know a couple people who work in the university's health and counseling center who may be able to assist me further in some way. Worst case scenario, I'll just have to tolerate it, which happens in life sometimes.",13Jan2017,61
9,"So what happened was a month ago, my friend and I went to a barber shop to get a haircut. It was pretty busy in there and I'm not sure if I stood out or not. After I finished my haircut I sat down in a chair and waited for my friend to finish his. While I was waiting, I played a game on my phone to pass the time and I forgot about paying the guy. Now usually when I go to get my haircut at my usual place, I always pay before I leave, not right after it's finished, so I was waiting for someone to say something once my friend finished his haircut. What happened next was the guy who cut my hair had left or went to the back to get something and my friend asked if we can leave. I said ok and was too shy at the time to tell someone about the money. So my friend and I just walked out. My friend payed, but I forgot. 

Now he wants to go back there in a couple of days with me to get haircuts again with the same guy who cut my hair last time. What should I do?",13Jan2017,1
10,"As stated in title.
My roommate is a very distasteful and abhorrent person who steals my food, throws out my groceries in the fridge to make room for beer, and throws parties even when I tell him I have work at 6am the next morning. I have confronted him about all of these issues, but I recently found out he has been charged with rape and sexual assault (he likes to leave important paperwork lying around the kitchen), and that was the last straw. I really, really want to move out, and I feel like this gives me a legitimate reason to. My girlfriend also does not feel comfortable staying over anymore, as she often stays over in my room for a little while longer after I leave if I have work in the early morning hours. I 500% empathize with her. 

I spoke to the property manager about moving out, who told me that because I have signed a lease with them, I cannot move out. The most they can do is relocate me to an available apartment and keep the same rent, but even that I nor my girlfriend are comfortable with as it is a small apartment and we will no doubt run into each other. 

What can I do? Living here is not an option anymore.

11,"I was driving the company delivery car when I hit another van -- a beat up company van (different company). No damage to my vehicle but I knocked out his rear taillight. 

I told him (it was parked) and he wants to get the guy next door -- an actual auto body shop -- to repair it, no insurance. 

I haven't told my employer -- again, no damage to me -- and would rather not because I returned the car then went back to the scene of the accident, so I don't want him to think I was covering it up.

Repair cost is from $100-500. I find out tomorrow. I make $19/hr pretax, so this'll cost between 5 and 25 of pre-tax hours (I live in Canada, so something like 30% goes to tax / employment insurance / cpp... plus have union dues etc). 

The other thing that makes me nervous is I don't own a car (though I can drive... not well apparently...) and one of the owners **hates** that fact and refused to hire me for a few months because of it. I'm a tradesman (apprentice) so driving the delivery truck is an uncommon occurrence to say the least.

13,"I when I was like 18 I quit all social media (wasn't very big into it anyway) when I decided to sober up. To sober up, I had to cut out all my druggy friends. Which, ended up being basically all my friends. Since then, I haven't used any social media. Never even been on snapchat, instagram, twitter, and whatever else is out there now days.

Now, I ended up not getting into the military like I wanted, and ended up going to the trades for work instead. But, now I'm almost 21, and I have no friends my age. Everyone I meet at work is at least 5+ years older, usually 10-20+. I do meetup events often and joined adult sport leagues. I have hobbies and people I hang out with regularily. But they are all much older, so it's hard to have a close friendship with them. 

To help solve this I decided to take some classes at my local community college; a volleyball and kickboxing class. Hopefully I can meet college aged kids and get my ass into the dating scene!

But one of my fears is that my lack of social media will be detrimental. I feel like EVERYONE, especially people my age, is on social media some way or another. Personally, I kind of like having no social media. When I was on it it was just a place for a bunch of drama and self centeredness. It doesn't seem healthy. 

But I also really need to get out and start making friends my age haha. But then again, I'm afraid when I hop on social media, people will see that I basically have no friends built up and might find that weirder than someone who isn't on social media..

14,"Hi! Just wondering if anyone has some advice about needle phobias and how to successfully get over them. I am a med student and I cannot deal with IV's. Right now I am in my pre-clinical years, but I will be getting into the hospitals in August. I'm really worried because I have a horrible fear of IV's. While in school I have been able to go into the OR and have observed multiple surgeries. While in the OR I have never had a problem with the cutting or the blood... but seeing and IV put in gets me woozy and worried about passing out.
If I need to get blood drawn I am the person who gets sweaty, nauseous, and faints, so I think the problem is linked to my personal response to IV's. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with this and knows how to get over the IV fear. I'm worried about placing IV's in patients next year because I don't want to get dizzy and pass out.

26,"I am a chronic heath sufferer. I suspect I have an autoimmune issue, or other related condition. I'm not yet diagnosed, and have been passed off to the mental health side of things, and still battle to have further testing to figure out what's going on. I got sick of being sick/tired/and despair took a toll.  
  
I used methamphetamine, and 15 hours later felt fine, until I didn't. It was like my heart was going to explode, horrible ear/temple pressure, and heart palpations/bp spikes. I'd presented just like this to the ER twice, both times without any use, and explained my use was not the cause, and I needed some help.  
  
The Nurse came in, I told him I'd used meth, and he immediately got really aggressive. I explained it was over 15 hours ago, and wouldn't be causing me acute duress, as I've experienced this before, and felt I needed evaluated thoroughly. My vision was blurred, hearing fucked, and I was scared. I had a pain behind my knees, and elevated risk factors for blood clots (something like 50x). He wouldn't look at the odd fluid that appeared on my foot, or listen when I said above my frontal sinus water pooled under the skin rapidly and the head pressure released some. He refused me when I asked multiple times to look, and said he already wrote them down as psychosis. Aggressively told me I shouldn't wait for the doctor, and am wasting his time. He assured my he already added 'IV DRUG ABUSE' to my record, and started calling me stupid, while really intimidating me. I was scared, and said please look, fuck man I need help. He said he recorded it as meth delusions, and then threatened me when I was discharged with an abnormal ecg that couldn't rule out left atrial infarction. I was sent home with instructions to come back if any of what I was discharged with occurred.  
  
I've never been so belittled. He threatened me when I was leaving saying I better not take the IV Port or I'd be in some real trouble, intimidated me more, and unfortunately no one was in the room. He had me pee in a jug for urine collection, and left it on the table saying he needed to test it. I was already on dexedrine, and disclosed I used meth, and when he catheterized me with the IV port the open jug of piss was on his table he used to open the port. They took blood, said they wouldn't be testing it, and I should leave. No one told me my ECG was abnormal, and I was sent home with no instructions beyond quit smoking cigarettes. When I left they ran the test on my urine for no real reason, and found out I had meth or amphetamine in my system, which wasn't anything that wouldn't be there regardless of recreational use. They ran a basic blood count, but not until I was discharged, and they did nothing with the results of elevated hemoglobin and decreased platelets, and I have no idea why they would be run if I was sent home. Now I have a massive bill, a huge red X on my medical record, and am still in a lot of discomfort/pain in spite of not using any drug, prescription or otherwise.  
  
I feel mistreated, dismissed, hopeless, and farther from any sort of help. My hand is numb, facial parasthesia, and the other symptoms that had occured prior to any drug use. Except now my record says 'the kid who has been in pain for years and not been given any drugs by any of our doctors, is a drug seeker even though he's never seeked drugs actively' My sister works there alongside doctors in her medical school, and will likely come across this. It unfortunately isn't diagnostically relevant, and I'm still fucked paying ER prices for blood tests they ran retroactively and didn't tell me my ECG indicated possible infarction.  
  
Obviously I'm at fault for using meth, but even if I prevented with an overdose a 'fuck you junkie' for someone who has appeared with the same symptoms without drug use, and serious health impairment, is a step backwards. The ER doctor also said he would not add this to my record, but apparently did later. Sorry if I wanted to seek help for serious health risks/self inflicted or otherwise, I didn't need dehumanized.  
  
Should I reach out to someone, or realize the ER nurse will obviously invalidate my experience, since I'm a useless junky who only payed every bill (numerous) I ever had from the hospital in/out patient departments for years.

29,"Hello everyone, 
    I am a 22 year old guy with a Psych B.S. degree and am currently working at my local hospital as a clerk in the patient care units. I am currently attending a local college to finish the pre-reqs for nursing school. However, this is where I find myself facing an issue. Due to a lack of focus at my old school, I ended up graduating with a 2.46 gpa. Not the best I know, and I kick myself daily for making the mistakes I did that caused me to get to that point. I decided upon nursing because, to be honest, I thought it would be the only thing I was qualified to do. All my classes were for some sort of clinical program, so I couldn't see myself doing anything else other than MD/DO, PA, or RN.

Now, I would like to point out that I do not feel limited because I am arrogant (maybe I am, who knows). I felt limited to those fields because I didn't know what else I could pursue without having to redo all 4 years of college. Fast forward to today, and I am sitting here typing to you whilst finding out yesterday that I was not accepted to the only nursing program I applied to so far (I applied to them because they said they would let me start my nursing education in the spring and would only look at my gpa from my new school).  Well, I found out that the reason I didnt make it was because of one bad grade, whch brought my gpa down low enough to not be considered. This is despite the act that I did well enough in Anatomy (B-) and got into the 99th percentile on the NLN entrance exam. The gpa I received was a 2.54

No surprise, this was a huge blow to my confidence because  1) I didn't get accepted into the program and 2) I'm back to square one with my grades. While I recognized the factors that led to my downfall, I am almost certain that, despite how many A's I get in the remaining 5-6 classes I have to take, it will never be enough to push my combined (both colleges) cumulative gpa up to the level of even being considered by a nursing program.

I honestly do not know what to do at this point. Do I keep taking classes and hope to get into a program in the future? Do I stop going to school and just work at my job for the next several years? Do I look for another avenue? This has all been running through my mind constantly.

Personally, I would like to keep pursuing nursing, but I dont want to put all my eggs in one basket. Plus, I realized that I dont have a passionate desire to enter the feild. Sure, I enjoy treating people and would love to receive the advanced training they get, but I can't see myself making a career out of attending to some people's every need (I'm not talking about medical needs. I'm referring to trivial things like intentionally calling you into the room because they are lazy or disregarding your advice because they think they know better/don't care). Problem is, I really don't know what other avenues to consider. 

tl;dr: Didn't get into nursing school because of bad grades, looking for advice and other alternatives ",13Jan2017,1
30,"So I'm a 33 year old female addict. Don't believe my child is not here with me currently which gives me some free time to try to get my head on straight, not because of my drug use but because he's spending time with his father. I was in recovery for 2 years and fell off the wagon due to an immense amount of stress, truth be told like most junkies I enjoy being high and have a hard time dealing with life. Went to my mother to ask for help and explain to her that I had falling back off the wagon again and was using and she told me if I was using drugs again to kill myself. Essentially I have nobody else my sister is also about it and my brother is an alcoholic, I live in a state where I literally don't know anybody other than the people that I use with. The real problem lies in the fact that the guy that I'm dating and have been dating for the last 4 years is also an addict. I turned him on to the worst possible drugs you can use got him addicted to it for my own selfish reasons so that I could use without getting in trouble and he is abusive. He is a complete sociopath who I know allowed me to relapse and start using again because he knew that as long as he was supplying that I wouldn't leave. So so as it stands no job I have no real money to speak of he controls everything that we have and we spend 99.9% of that on heroin. I know that I'm going to die. Either the drugs will kill me or he will. I have shitty state-funded Medicaid insurance that is basically not accepted anywhere for any reason other than the sniffles, I even went as far as to ask my primary care doctor for help, she wrote me a prescription for some blood pressure pills and told me good luck she also referred me to an outpatient program which is essentially classes every single day that teach you how to stay sober once you're sober. The problem is I don't know how to get through the detox portion of getting clean I'm not in a safe environment to begin with and then you add detox into that already toxic situation and I'm afraid of what he will do to me. He is a severe alcoholic on top of our opiate use and is unpredictable has a horrible temper and has hurt me in the past. I honestly don't know what to do because my mom was my best friend and the only person that I know in this state who I felt loved me and when I asked her for help and admitted to her what was going on she told me to kill myself, and at this point it sounds like a really good idea.

33,"So, i have 2 friends, lets refer to them as C and D, after we graduate high school we plan to go on vacation somewhere, preferable somewhere in north america or somewhere near it.

D doesn't want to go any where too hot, because he does not like hot places, but id like to go somewhere where i could tan on a beach or just even relax on a beach, and C really wants to go on a cruise ship.

Does anyone have any good ideas of where to go for a vacation that fills some if not all of the requirements?

34,"I've known this girl for 4 months now since starting university. We're both 18 by the way. She stopped coming to class after the 1st month of the first semester. We both kept talking, and eventually, I started helping her out, telling her anything important that she missed, as well as what she needed to review. I also ended up helping her write two final essays, and gave her some advice on what to study for for a couple exams. It was all out of my good will since we were both friends. But also because I am just a really nice person in general. And ended up going against what all my other friends told me about not helping her and have her deal with everything herself. 

We talked a lot through whatsapp. But, during the holidays, she told me that she got sick. And as the kind person I am, I started telling her alternative ways of dealing with her sickness since she doesn't want to take medication. (I'll admit that I ended up giving too much advice. So that might have been one contributing factor). On December 24th, my mom told me to try and call her to see if she was doing anything the next day. And so I did, and I ended up going overboard. I felt bad, and I sent her a lengthy apology on whatsapp.

I felt really bad so I tried to reach her through messenger. But the problem was she was online but, never bothered to respond. And so I tried reaching her through snap chat as well. Eventually, I felt really terrible, because I never meant to upset her. 

So I ended writing ""____ I know you're online, can we please talk"" on Facebook messenger 

She responds couple hours later ""I'm at my family's focusing on them."" That's when I felt truly terrible. Because I didn't know that she was at her family's. And I evidently must have caused her a lot of trouble. I get worried very easily, and if the person does not give me clarification of the situation, I start to get more worried. And I start to feel a lot worse. 

And so I ended up sending her a long apology yet again.

In total I sent her an apology on the 24th, 25th, 26th. I tried communicating with her again on the 28th. And that was when she opened up whatsapp. I'm pretty sure she read only what I sent her on the 28th, I think. But probably read what I posted on the 26th as well. She read them, but never responded. So I started to panic because I knew right then that something was definitely wrong, and I felt really terrible.

So on December 30th, I ended up trying to talk with her again. The last message I sent was ""Are you still mad?"". 

I check back several hours later, and I immediately knew that I was blocked on whatsapp. So I checked facebook, because I also sent her an apology through facebook messenger on the 27th. I was blocked on facebook too. So I checked snap chat, I was blocked on snap chat as well. 

When that happened, I honestly felt like crying. Because the least she could have done was tell me the situation. I never meant to hurt and annoy her. 

I know, what I did was really bad and turned me into a nuisance and a pest. But I get really worried, easily. Especially when other person doesn't clarify the situation, then I can panic, and just feel really awful. It honestly felt terrible, and I spent my new years with the worst feeling of guilt. Both because of what happened, but also because I ended up annoying, upsetting, and angering her. 

On January 5th, a friend of mine ended up sending her a text saying to talk with me.... Which I had no knowledge of. It was a friend who I ended up talking to after the events since I felt really bad. 

And then just this tuesday (Jan. 10th), I saw her, we ended up in the same tutorial session....When I approached her, she told me that ""she didn't want to talk right now."" And the worst part is that we ended up in the same seats, facing each other. So I had to turn my whole head to the right so that she doesn't feel worse or have to look at me.

She helped me out several times as well. And she is a nice person. But she's told me that I've helped her out a ton during the semester, and that she is grateful.  And even joked a little when I introduced another friend of mine to her. I found out from talking with my other friend about this that whenever this girl talked about me, she would always talk about how nice of a person I was, and how great of a friend I was to her. And she's even told me that we are friends on multiple occasions. 

 I know I made a mistake. It hurts a lot. I can only imagine how she must have felt. And I never meant to annoy her. And I want to keep being friends with her. It feels really terrible.

I don't know what to do.

35,"I've always been a bit socially inept and I'd like to believe that I've been getting better but at 24 I have never had a relationship and among other things in life this looms over me like a black shadow and can often send me into a depressive spiral for a good few days at a time. 

Awhile back I started to develop feelings for a friend of mine my other friends know and believe I should ask her out to get it out the way and stop worrying but I know she will currently almost certainly reject me which worries me on so many levels. I'm worried it would hurt our friendship, I'm worried I'll get humiliated like the last time i asked someone out (Some 8 years ago now) and I'm worried it could send me down a longer than usual spout of depression.

What makes this all the more awkward and one of the reasons i believe she'd reject me is that I believe she's fallen for another freind of mine. He's everything i wish i was extremely talkative and outgoing and no where near introverted. As her freind I'd be fine if she found someone else but in the back of my head i cant help but think anyone but this guy. I know him and all his relationships end in disaster and his eyes never stop wondering if you know what i mean. I don't want to see her get hurt but feel i cant bring this up to her because she might think I'm saying it just because I like her.

How can I/ should I approach these two subjects with her thank you.

36,"I work at a bank near the university I attend and have students from my school come in very frequently. Today this girl came in, and I was blown away. Gorgeous, had an amazing smile and was so very kind. Asked how my day was going, even complemented my watch. Im usually the one trying to make conversation while running people's transactions, but she made it very easy to do my job. I have cute girls come in all the time and really just don't care to talk, at all when I try to make simple conversation about mundane things such as the weather. She was very different to the kind of girls I normally encounter at my work. My question is, if it would be weird if I went out of my way to contact her. As I work at a bank, we come across there full names and I could just as easily go look her up on Facebook and approach her. But as the world goes, just because I can, doesn't mean I should. Side note: Most people I encounter would say Im an attractive, outgoing person. So Im really not your average creep trying to slide into anyone's DM's.

37,"Throwaway because insecurity.

Lately, a lot of things have happened in my life that are causing me to stress out and become in a cloudy, stormy mood. I prefer to carry myself as a pleasant and relatively goofy person.

My girlfriend has noticed especially, that in conversations or situations where I encounter stress, I become snarky and, basically, an ass. After retrospection, I agreed. And I've continued to try and improve, but I always either ""forget"" to or just ignore requests to stop being 'sassy', as she puts it. Which I feel falls squarely on myself. I don't feel like I know where to start to change. That scares me, I've never felt that way before.

I can logically understand my reactions and statements are unpleasant, but I can't pathologically constrain myself and re-center. If anyone has any tips or reading or other places to seek information I will be very grateful. I want to improve this area of my life for those I love, they deserve the best I can give them, and I deserve to be the best I can be.

38,"Hi. New to reddit. Very concerned someone please help. 

I have been dating my boyfriend for over one year. About 4 months into our relationship, he admitted to me that three years ago he found porn of his step mother and thought about her sexually to the point of sending her a nude picture. I accepted it, and moved on. A few weeks ago he was trying to get me into reddit and would let me use his account to check out the interesting feeds and stuff when I accidentally saw one of his posts. It was a long wordy post with very detailed thoughts about his step mother ad included the video link to the video. The comments made me feel sick. But I talked to him about it and he said it was a fetish, that just the idea was what it was, not the woman herself. He said that he was over it and that he no longer felt attracted to her. I asked him to take it down and he did.

However, today after him acting weird about me checking my phone history, he admitted he watched the video more recently.  I was very upset because that felt like betray since he already told me that he deleted it and told me that he didn't have sexual feelings for her anymore. He is angry because he feels like I am betraying him by being upset. 

I'm terrified because I love him dearly and I'm afraid I will lose him because I'm not enough. I guess a step mom fetish is a normal thing but I don't know much about those things. The idea makes me very uncomfortable because I was sexually abused by my father and a different family member. Still, I feel like a fetish would be a concept and not a person. To me, a person feels like emotionally cheating. And the fact that it's his step mother (who he sees regularly ) makes me sick.

My friend kinda put me in this awkward position. 
We went to this movie-dinner place . I'm not sure if there's one in your area. It's basically like a movie theater where you can have a waiter come serve you food. 

I goes there about once a month, I usually just buy a latte but not food since they're expensive. 

I didn't intend order any food and he ordered this dinner thing off of the menu . He ordered a plate for him and separate for me.

So I Just assumed that he bought it for me as a gift since I didn't tell the waiter that I wanted to buy anything. 

He later gave me the check, and I didn't have enough money for the food. I didn't even order it. And he got mad at me and went off on me saying that I had if I had the movie for the ticket then I have money for the food.

Idk, it just sounds bizzard to me and I can't wrap my head around it.

Would you assumed that it was a gift too since he ordered it and NOT me ?

Small things make me worry, especially awkward social interactions. My main problem is that I tend to panic when running into someone out of the blue, and I won't know what to say. For example a girl said hi to me the other day and I accidentally mumbled something unintelligible. This would lead me to worry that that person thinks I'm weird or something. Another example is when I got dropped off to sleep over and my friend's mom said ""Hey Aero_Thunder, how are you?"" and I accidentally said ""Thank you"" or something like that.

It's often difficult for me to pick out something to wear in the morning, because I don't want to appear as a ""nerd"" or whatever.

45,"Hello everyone!! My name is Karissa and I am a junior in high school! I have been friends with a group of about 5 girls including myself since middle school, with little change in the core group adding a friend here or there. There are 2 people in my friend group who have really gotten on my nerves recently, let's call them Joanna and Shelby. Shelby has always been the person to hang out with the wrong guys and get into general trouble, and then come running back to the group complaining about how she always falls in love with the wrong guys, nobody nice likes her, etc. I have also always felt as though she did this to get attention and in general feel as though she was important. She also is constantly using anxiety as an excuse and is constantly bringing up her anxiety. To me (and this is not me shaming mental illnesses or people with actual anxiety) she doesn't really seem to have anxiety, or at least not to the caliber she describes, she also has never been diagnosed with anxiety in the past. She is the kind of person who goes to every school dance and sits on the side and complains about her anxiety flaring up. My friend Joanna has recently been messaging the group chat (With her and Shelby and others) about how she feels as though she fails everything she does and isn't good enough and how nothing's really worth it anymore. Now Joanna is in the school play and the reason she was saying this is because she felt as though she wasn't as good as the other actors in said play. Joanna often leaves school early at least 3 times a week or just doesn't come to school because she's tired or a myriad of other reasons. She has missed 3 practices so far and I am not surprised she feels lesser than considering she is behind in dance and singing practice. This is just one example and I have always been more than supportive and ready to give advice, but recently it has been waring me down to a point where I dread being alone with either of them talking as they both just complain. I don't know if this is caused by recent sleep deprivation and stress on my part or something different. Should I say anything to them? What should I do, just suck it up and pretend to not hate them a little? Thank you for your help in advance, and I'm sorry this is so long.",13Jan2017,1

From May to June, we briefly had a ""thing,"" in her words, or ""kissed several times"" in my own. Shouldn't have happened at all, but I made some drunk mistakes and implied that her feelings for me were mutual (they were not). I let her down clearly but gently several months after that stuff ended. I have reason to believe she still has a crush on me (not sure if this last part is relevant). Basically, she thinks that stuff was far more significant than I do.

I see no reason to bring it up anymore, since it's dead and gone and not especially meaningful in the first place. She, however, seems to go out of her way sometimes to bring it up when there are other people around (who did not previously know of this). 

How do I respond? It really bothers me, because she seems intent on spreading around the idea that we dated or hooked up, and that it may or may not be going on still. I would not be at all surprised if she were to sabotage any future relationships of mine, intentionally or not. However, I can't just sit down and have a talk with her, because she takes any criticism deeply personally, and either cry, shut down, or get angry at me. I can't stop being friends with her, because then I'd just lose all of my closest friends (including her, I do actually like her as a friend despite this). But this thing seriously bothers me.

58,"Story time, but TL DR is, what do you do to help someone who absolutely cannot help themselves?

I got on the BART (public transportation train) and overheard a girl talking to an elderly lady in a wheelchair. The girl was telling the lady that she was going the wrong way and ought to get off at a certain stop so as to get on a Bart going in the opposite direction. I said, ""I'm getting off at that stop. I will help you"" and continued talking to the elderly lady.

Could quickly tell that the lady was in a serious situation. She could not push or get on or off her chair. She would not tell me her name or where she was trying to go to. She told me that she was trying to go to the Embarcadero stop so that she could get food without having to go outside because it was cold and she had pneumonia. She said her wallet had been stolen and that she had no money, had not eaten all day, and she believed it was the morning when it was actually the evening. She had urinated on herself.

At first I was consumed with trying to help her myself. I offered to call the police but she didn't want that. I wheeled her off the train and onto a train on the opposite side. We had to make a connection so I wheeled her off and on again. She complained of pain the entire time and would not tell me where she needed to go. I got her on the correct train and asked passengers nearby to get her off at the Embarcadero stop. I gave her 10 dollars and left.

As soon as I got off the train my mind cleared a bit and I could think more clearly. This woman was in a bad way, didn't know where she was going, possibly even who she was. How could she even have ended up there, if she couldn't push herself?

I looked up BART emergency numbers, called dispatch, and tried to describe the train and the car she was on. I recommended that they look on the security camera for the notable woman. And that was it.

I wish I had called for help while I was still with the woman, to make sure she would be okay. In a critical moment, I could not think of what to do. I know I handled it as best I could think of at the time, but next time I want to be better prepared.

I had to wait awhile, as he had exams, but then we went on our first ""hang out"" (I'm not even going to call them dates at this stage).

We went and played minigolf, two round, he paid for both. Then we went for a walk on the beach, very cute. He is driving me around in the most gorgeous vintage convertible car ever. It was sweet. Then we went out for dinner, and he pays for dinner. Very sweet, very relaxed.

I really wanted to hang out with him again, but he went very silent. I got a bit petty and I felt pretty bad about it. Turns out his grandfather died, and he was upset. He neglected to tell me about this so I was confused, and when I get confused I just lash out (I'm big on details...)

Anyway so I waited like a month and we went and got dinner and saw a movie together... again he paid for both activities. Nothing much happened romantically... still haven't kissed.

Then the new Star Wars movie rolls around, I shout him the movie and we go together. I just pull out all the flirting stop signs and I'm going for it, making it pretty obvious that I'm into him. nothing. After the movie, he buys me lunch.

Then christmas happens, so we were both pretty busy.
After xmas, in the last week or so he comes over and plays Magic the Gathering with me, at my house. He still, makes no moves.
The next day he asks to talk to me, so I suggest we go star gazing together because I find things are a lot easier to talk about when looking at the stars.

Hes going on about how this is all bad timing... and that he is ""sometimes attracted to me"". I think its important to note that I am very outgoing and bubbly, whereas he is pretty reserved. (I'm attracted to reserved types... opposites attract). He is also leaving for the USA in a week from now for a month. (From Australia).
So I just ask him flat out... how much do you like me on a scale of 1-10 (I'm getting NOTHING from him other than ""I don't knows...."") He says **4**. A four! I'm like why am I wasting my time here!

Anyway I enjoy his company so we just looked at stars and pointed out constellations. Just lying there. Next minute, he leans over and kisses me! I was a four ten minutes ago and now hes lying on top of me kissing me!

So I ask him after it got a lil steamy do you want to leave a door open for something after you get back from the USA and he says (again) he doesn't know.... and he also says he doesn't know if he can ""keep up with me"". I'm like fair, but you just kissed a 4/10.

The next day I pass him at work, and he lets me know that he booked flights to another state... to see another girl. And it looks like him and this other girl are friends, but at the same time why wouldn't he tell me this in our long long long conversation the night prior... that he was going to another state to see another girl! Far out.


I think that hes expecting me to pick him up from the airport tomorrow... but I just don't know where I stand with this guy....",13Jan2017,0
76,I've got a new boss and he has a new boss too. I've been at this company for about a year and a half and haven't made much of an impact because my work never gets prioritized.

77,"As the title suggests, I'm scared that my best friend is abandoning me and would like to get some input on this matter. First of all, I'm very insecure and extremely fearful of rejection. These two personality traits, combined with my social anxiety, have resulted in me having only a couple real friends I can rely on. 

One of my very, very, very few friends and the only person I've truly opened up to in my life has recently been ignoring me. (Quick background: We're both seniors in high school and have been friends since sophomore year.) She hasn't been hanging out with me and has in fact eschewed me for other people. To be honest, I feel like I'm second choice now; she used to eat lunch with me a few times a week but now only acknowledges my existence when she doesn't have anyone else to talk to.

I understand that this may seem quite trivial, but, as someone who suffers from social anxiety, I am quite worried. Again, I don't have many friends, so I am frightened of losing yet another one.

My life is already a quarter over, and I basically have no (marketable) skills. I guess I'm smart enough for some jobs, but without money for college no one's gonna take me seriously. I suppose the worst of it is that any time I do start to get interested in a new hobby I quickly lose interest within a week, and I'm back to where I started and end up feeling worse for quitting, but when I try to force myself back into things I just end up resenting them. I don't know what to do anymore. I just really can't see myself doing anything else.

83,"I am Korean, born in 1983,
I have met a Vietnamese girl while I am working in Vietnam (expat), and we got married for 2 years now. (+1 year dating)
We live in Vietnam now.

She is everything I've ever wanted and I thought I totally devoted to her.
I was happy every single day spending time with her.

but maybe it wasn't the case for my wife. We often got fight over small things, usually because she was not pleased from the way I do something.

Let me get to the point.

Every time we had a fight, what she just say is ""let's break up"" or ""let's divorce. we don't fit each other"". 
It comes out from her so easily, and it drives me into deep deep depression.
every time we fight, she goes to her mother's house and stays there and keep me away from there.

I know I'm not up to her standard on some aspect, that makes me even more depressed.
I do make enough money from my job, I don't drink much, I just stays home after work, I think I am normal person, but there is something missing from me to satisfy her, I guess.

she is now staying in her mother's home and telling me let her be free from me. Even divorce. 
I don't know what I should do.
I love her so much and I don't want to lose her. I am so empty without her. I am so scared being alone. I even cried in front of her.  My every plan for my life is standing on her presence.  I can't imagine me being live without her.

But here I am sleeping in empty house with empty mind, dreaming nice way to end my agony.

My wife promised me that she will call me when she is not upset anymore, until then, she said no call, no message, no visit to her mom's home.
I'm going to meet her sooner or later, and I have a hope that we won't actually divorce, but now I am so scared of loosing her. 

I can't think straight now. I can't focus on my work. 

What should I do? I don't know if there is a marriage counseling or something. 
should I let her go? I don't think I can survive from depression. 

yes, I had some break up in the past with my ex girlfriends. It drove me into depression but I finally recovered, but  I could do that only because I had a hope for meeting better woman.
but now I don't see any hope like that.  she is everything I ever wanted and without her,  I can't live with my memory of her, memory of happy moments being together.

Is there any Vietnamese woman who can help me out? any advice?

Thanks.

86,"Back story:

Ok, so I have this close female friend I've known for about 12 years, we shall call her ""Chanel"" (am not going to use her real name in order to protect her identity). So over the years Chanel had really evolved into a very attractive girl, in middle school I noticed her butt began to get substantially bigger although she would retain her small petite frame and cute young face. We always were very close and treated each other like brother and sister for the most part. During high school we did share some moments of romance but nothing past a kiss. She became very popular among the guys in high school while by no means was she an easy girl, she told me she had only slept with 3 guys during high school, but she was a big flirt. Upon graduation (class of 2013) we still kept in contact on a normal friend basis like contacting each other on our birthdays or holidays, hang out if we tweeted something we both wanted to do, and just ask normal favors of each other. So about 4 months ago she calls me out of no where to come to her house because she thinks someone is trying to break in, after she sent me her location I rushed over there. When I get there I notice that she moved out of her parents and got herself into a NICE town house on the lake front. So it turned out some hobo was lurking around her house finding something to steal, I manhandled the hobo until the cops came and arrested him for trespassing. Chanel was still scared so I ended up staying the night to help ease her worries. After the night me and Chanel became a lot closer like we were back to our high school days.

Situation: 2 nights ago, Chanel asked me if I wanted to join her to eat at her favorite taco shop. I couldn't say no to tacos so I went. We had our tacos and had some small conversations about dumb shit. She then decides to drop the ball on me. She tells me that she is a high end escort. I asked her a bunch of questions like ""Since when?"" , ""Is something wrong?"" , and ""How?"". She explains to me that when she traveled down to California to vacation after graduation, she met a man that was part of a high end modeling recruitment agency and he said she was a perfect gorgeous women and he needed her as a model. She did some research and the company seemed legit so she decided to show up at the 5 star hotel they agreed upon over text. From then on the guy explained everything to her how they are actually a high end escort that serviced a lot of rich men in big name companies all over the nation. Chanel was blown away by the pay and amount of benefits she gets from being a escort so she decided to give it a shot, she fell in love with it. The pay, the expensive clothing, the fine dining , and the luxurious transportation she gets just by fucking 30 to 50 year old men. Chanel then told me that she sometimes felt like no one would support her career decision or she wouldn't be accepted by her friends and family, She felt lonely and un loved. She had mustered up the courage to tell me because she felt that she could trust me and that she cared about me deeply. I assured her that I also care about her a lot and that she doesn't need to worry, I just care if she's ok physically and mentally. She then decided to tell me that she wants someone she can come home to and relax with, share her day with, and just be embraced and comforted by a man. She wants me to be that man, she explained how we could live comfortably on her escort salary and I could do whatever I wanted. Like have sex with other women or stay at home all day, she even offered to have sex with me if I wanted. I told her straight up I didn't know what to say, that I would have to think about it and see how I would re adjust my life. I told her give me until Sunday to answer her.

She is fucking LOADED. She has a nice town house that has plenty of room, made $93,000 in 2015, she has a very nice personality, and she is one of the most beautiful women I have ever met in my life. Like an Asian Kylie Jenner (without the whole fake lip thing going on). 

This sounds like a fucking movie but I cannot make this shit up. What do I do?

I left out a bunch of locations details and such to protect the identity of my friend.

Update : I'm 99% percent sure what I am going to say, and my answer is going to be technically a ""yes"". The conversation we will have is either tomorrow or Sunday . I will update the thread or just make a new one.",13Jan2017,135
88,"So, my dad flips out every time you say you've spent a lot of money. So I've gotten into the habit of telling him things I buy are like 1/3 of the price they actually are when it's none of his business.

So I own a business where I put arcade machines in restaurants. When I bought my first 3, I told him they were $500 each when they were really $900. Now he thinks I pay $500 for these machines.

He's about to inherit a ton of money, well into 7 figures. He says he wants to use some to buy me more machines. The problem is, he thinks they're $500. 

I need to let him know what they actually cost as soon as possible because what my machines cost just became his business.

I'm in college. In my poetry class, after distributing copies of a poem,the professor would read it out loud. After he finishes, he asks the class for observations. Everyone, usually, has an observation or two. Everyone, except me. The professor is a nice guy, and he doesn't mind if I say 'I don't know' or 'I don't have anything to say'. The issue is, I want to make observations. But when the poem is read aloud, and I am reading with him, I get anxious. My heart beasts faster. In anticipating his questions, I keep looking for things that would count as 'observations'. Almost always, I am left with nothing except a bad feeling. I feel tensed...and disappointed with myself for not even seeing the obvious at times. It's making me depressed of late, and it sucks to be the one guy in class with nothing solid to say.

102,"I don't admit this to many people, but I have been diagnosed with ptsd, major anxiety, and OCD. My 2 best friends are a couple, and know I have bad anxiety, but don't completely understand. In the past, I abused substances (mostly alcohol) to relieve myself of this deep pain and anxiety. I went to my best friend's formal with his other friend, but got extremely f'ed up and he didn't focus on anything else the first night (out of three, to be fair my date was taking prescription pills the entire time). Αnyways, this was until they got so angry, then they just stopped caring. This was one of the worst times of my life, but I forgave myself first, and he forgave me sooner than she did. 

Tonight I drank/smoked at someone's house, and then they both got extremely upset when a random girl stuck up for the way they were treating me (we were all at the same bar together beforehand for reference). It started with him being upset and threatening to leave, but she stood up for him and told me to get lost (she hasn't acted like this in months but since he got upset, she did too. He accused the other girl of not knowing how much they had put up with me and his gf agreed. Then I tried to apologize to him and he yelled at me farther.

Before the guy got in his car and drove away, he told me he was upset not only because this other girl pointed out things he sounded rude about it, but also how much he had apparently put up with.

112,"A girl I work with today bluntly asked me if I'm gay and I don't know why she would ask me this...

Disclaimer: I have nothing against homosexuals in the least, but I'd rather not be misidentified as something I'm not. I also understand that homosexual men can't be generalised by their behaviour, but the subtext seems pretty suggestive when someone asks if you're gay.

I'm considered to be a really attractive guy (my mother was scouted as a model before I was born) and I take after her. I'm 21 years of age and I get hit on a lot by strangers (especially at my job). I've had women drive by me on the streets and honk their horns and shout out how attractive they think I am, and I often get told by various people that so-and-so has a crush on me. Or I'll just get women straight-up ask me for my number. Most recently, I had this lady approach me to compliment my looks, and by the end of the conversation, she randomly confesses that she'd have sex with me if she was any younger (she looked to be in her early forties). This lady has since reappeared into my life and tried to get me to come home with her to ''drink''. Since I started my job in this supermarket about two years ago I've had a lot of the middle-aged staff approach me out of nowhere to tell me how attractive I am. I've also had quite a few female customers who have even become stalkerish. For some reason, my looks always seem to be the topic of conversation whenever a middle-aged female stranger has a conversation with me, example, *''So what brings you to this city?... You're pretty attractive if you don't mind my saying so''*.

In the back of my mind... I at least know that it isn't my appearance that makes people mistake me for being homosexual.

I work in a supermarket, but due to the nature of my work I'm always working in the same niche department that only has middle-aged mothers — I'm the only guy. So I've always felt like a bit of a black sheep. Until recently that is...

About three months ago we hired a new worker named Louise into our department, and unlike the rest of the women, she's 19 years of age. To address the elephant in the room — I've never ever had any romantic feelings for her. But it's the first woman my age at my workplace that I've had the opportunity to get to know beyond the superficial ''hello'' since she works in my department so it's been a delight to connect with someone around my age for a change.

We ended up getting along famously. She told me she was shy, but she's never come across as shy once. I told her that I'm not from this city and so I don't know many people. Over the course of the next few months, she began really opening up to me and just telling me everything about her life. I'd make jokes and give my opinion on matters. I'd tease her a lot — she'd react playfully.

It was nice... Because I haven't been able to flirt with women much since I've moved here. And although I don't view her romantically, that doesn't mean we can't flirt.

For a while, I even started to suspect that she might have had a bit of a crush on me because she'd randomly ask me pointless-but-personal questions like asking me if my name Leo was short for Leonardo, or when my birthday was. They were never related to the tone of the conversation, they'd always be abrupt questions like she'd been meaning to ask me for a while. And whenever I'd ask why she'd just say *''No reason..''*

Aside from Louise always acting cutesy and couply around me (which I didn't mind) she abruptly asked me if I have a girlfriend. I said no — not currently. Then she says ''good, don't ever get one''. And then she starts telling me how relationships are such a pain and she vaguely hints about someone in her life and how she just doesn't have the motivation to put any effort into seeing them. The next week she asks me if I've ever had a close friend have a crush on me, and I tell her yes (a lot of times), so she asks me for advice because there's a male friend of hers who is trying to get out of the friend zone and she's not interested in him romantically but she also doesn't want to lose him as a friend.

At this point, I completely eliminated any possibility of her having a tiny crush on me since she's asking me for advice on her love life. And this is completely fine, I never liked her romantically myself.

But this week we were getting along amazingly once again, and she starts telling me that she's decided that I'm her ''favourite'' co-worker within the entire store. I remind her that she told me this a month earlier, and she says she just wanted to remind me. Then she tells me that she had a dream about me, which I found really shocking. I think she's a nice person and all but I don't really think of her outside of work in any capacity whatsoever. So for her to have a dream about me means that I tend to wander her mind.

I ask her what the dream is about and she says I was waiting outside of the store we work at (in the carpark) talking to a nondescript person (who she can't remember) but I was telling this stranger about how I have a crush on this girl at work but I was debating whether or not to ask her out because I don't think she likes me. And apparently, I seemed really sad in the dream.

First of all, I was shocked why Louise would share such a personal and ambiguous dream with me (a hopeful guy could get the wrong idea). It also seemed pretty clear to me that she definitely wasn't implying the girl I crushed on was her in any way.

(What's weird is that the girl I crush on in real life is called Emily and she works at this supermarket too, but in a separate department, but I actually suspect that she likes me as well).

I didn't know what to say, but it reminded me of something that happened to me a few months ago in the carpark with a random customer. They approached me and asked me if I have a sister that works at the store. I told them no and asked why. And then they said that there's a girl who looks a lot like me at my store — same body type, same height (I'm six foot).

When I tell this to Louise, she instantly blurts out reflexively *''Emily!!!''* (my crush) which was a huge coincidence. Then she changed her mind, *''But Emily doesn't really look like you...''*

I thought that was completely bizarre because she doesn't even know Emily personally, and I've never discussed my crush with her. So it was weird she would blurt my crush's name out as a guess. But again, perhaps it's just a coincidence.

I tried to drop the subject of dreams the moment she mentioned Emily because I don't want to subconsciously give myself away.

Towards the end of our shift, Louise then asks me if I have many friends in this town. So I told her I have more friends in the neighbouring city about an hour's drive away, so I just go there to socialise.

Finally, five minutes left of our shift, Louise abruptly says my name with a sense of urgency...

Me: Yes?...

Louise: I have a bit of a personal question for you.

(I'm pretty happy and calm in this moment and oblivious to what's about to hit me).

Me: Yeah, shoot. What is it?

Louise: Are you gay?...

Me: No... I'm not.

(Feels like the biggest idiot).

Me: Why do you ask?

(Burning with curiosity to know I turn to her awaiting a response).

Just as she opens her mouth, the co-worker who's about to start the ''graveyard shift'' arrives and Louise quickly closes her mouth.

She then comes up to me and whispers...

Louise: Are you offended?...

Me: No, of course not.

(I secretly am very hurt and feel like the biggest fool).

Louise: It's okay if you are...

(I don't say anything because I'd rather not have prying ears overhear what Louise literally just asked me).

119,"I (17F) have known him (16M) for 3 years now and have been pretty close friends for 2 years. He calls me his best friend but I never really considered him to be one (I'm introverted), but he's been the closest friend I've ever had. 

For the past year or so, on and off, he would be touchy and clingy with me. He'd say I'm hot and just overly compliment me. He'd put his arm around me when we go to the movies, try to touch my inner thigh, or always ask me to come over for ""movies"". In the beginning, I'd let it slide. But after I've realized that he's overdoing it, and people always assumed we were dating, I started to realise he might have feelings for me. He's a good guy, but I would never date him. 

I honestly didn't know what to do; I liked our friendship the way it was and I didn't want it to be awkward or be ruined because of his crush. So from this mix of clingyness and feelings he has for me, I started feeling uncomfortable being around him. I would pull away from his hugs and just be sort of cold to him, and even just straight up ignore him for a whole week because he would bother me. I never truly told him that his actions make me feel discomfort, so that is my fault. 

Well, I guess shutting him off worked well, because I heard from a mutual friend that he ""said he doesn't have feelings for me anymore"", which confirms the fact that he did like me. But we haven't talked for 2 straight weeks, which is so unusual because we would talk everyday. I confronted him about it, asking if he hates me, but he said ""I was stressed with family/school, and I think if I started talking to you I might just like breakdown and just look like a bitch, because I'm most comfortable talking to you"". Which sounds like complete bull to me (he's a terrible liar), but I just accepted it and told him if he needs anything I'll be there. He then continued to not talk to me the rest of the week. 

It's very hard for me to approach him now because I'm socially awkward to begin with so I don't know what to say or do in this situation. He doesn't hang out with the rest of our friend group anymore, so there's really no chance to talk to him. It's my fault for being rude to him and I want to fix this, but I have no idea where to start. 

tl;dr: Best friend got clingy/touchy due to feelings, I felt uncomfortable and didn't know what to do so was a bitch to him, now he won't talk to me",13Jan2017,2

121,"TLDR: I think my manager doesn't like me on a personal level and would like to see me go as he isn't giving me the opportunity to improve myself (at least, not from what I can see).

Sorry for the length, I'm a bit upset. :-(

Hi guys,

I've been working at my current (and first) place of employment for almost nine months now. It's in customer service, so things can be pretty demanding and difficult at times but I'm a fairly level-headed person and keep my cool and try to not let things interfere with me at work.

As a side note, I've only ever once been called aside for doing something wrong. That was, for a whole week, the public transport in my area was really screwed around so busses were replacing trains, which some didn't even show up or they were late. It was a really bad week for transport and I was late by about 30 minutes for about 5 days in a single week, it really sucked. But that was about 6 months ago, so we're well and truly passed that.

Tonight I was asked by my 2IC to come and have a ""quick chat"" with him. Upon entering the conference room, my actual manager is also there waiting. It turns out this is just an occasional informal performance review (which hasn't happened in about 2.5-3 months since the last one). They ask me how I'm going, I tell them the truth - the past month has been really hard for me personally because I've had a lot of angry customers and it took somewhat of an emotional toll on me but things seem to be dying down and I'm feeling a lot more confident and happy in my job (which I love. I love my job. I love my coworkers, I love most of the customers, I love what I do... I'm just really, really happy there). 

Apparently all this confidence and happiness isn't what my managers were seeing. 

According to them, I've seemed ""off the ball"" at work, missing the finer details in things - such as yesterday, where I forgot to ask a customers name when he asked to speak to the manager after he yelled at me and mocked me - and in general just being ""off the ball"" when asking customers questions, when this is not the case at all (and I know it isn't, because I'm very particular with how long I spend with customers and what information I need to know).

They said that our head office had been taking a note of who was doing what in our store, and noticed people in my department lacking so they had been asking questions about what we were doing. He acknowledged that I have had literally zero training but it just isn't good enough and I agreed.

Fair enough. If there's a problem, I'm glad they're letting me know, so that way I can improve. I don't want to be the short straw and let my workplace and my coworkers be looked down on. I thanked them for letting me know, and asked what they (my manager) meant specifically by being ""off the ball."" Was it just missing the name yesterday? Are there other questions I should be asking? Should I have a different approach when a customer wants to see the manager? 

His response: ""You just need to be on the ball. If I don't see an improvement in two weeks, there will be consequences. I'll cut down your hours to 10 hours. I'll send you to another store. Do you want to work in another store? Then you will gain some confidence. But I will give you two weeks and if there's no improvement then I don't have much of a choice. You need people to respect you and then they will listen to you.""

He completely dodged the question and damn, my heart sank. I have been feeling on fire the past few weeks - the same amount of time he said he's noticed me ""off the ball"" - and instead of offering me solutions he just told me I have 2 weeks or my hours will be cut (from ~40 down to 10). 

My 2IC said a lot of these things shouldn't be taken personally and he's going to talk to all of my coworkers about the same issues they're having. My manager replied ""But there needs to be an improvement in you, or there's consequences.""


Goddamn I am so upset. I don't know what to improve and I asked multiple times for specifics and it was just the same reply - ""You need to be on the ball"" - what the hell am I meant to do with that? What's this stuff about me moving stores, getting my hours cut or not getting respected? I have never had a problem with this before so I don't understand why there is a problem now and why they won't tell me how to fix it instead of scaring me into thinking I'm going to have to quit due to lack of hours.

Should I take this personally? Me and my manager aren't best friends by any means but we coexist. I'm a friendly person but we just have different interests and he hasn't given me the opportunity to know him very well, and that's okay with me. I think I should look for another job. I feel no matter if I ""get on the ball"" he honestly just doesn't want me there.",13Jan2017,1

125,"Let me first say that I am asking this because I was recommended by a friend to do this. He explained to me that his college previously informed him that since he interned with a nonprofit organization, he definitely did serve them. The rationale is that interns do the exact same things volunteers do but they do it ""in the name"" of acquiring experience. [My university has two criterion](http://www.fgcu.edu/Connect/are-you-on-target.html) in order to be counted as volunteer experience:


- it is for a nonprofit organization

- you are not getting paid 




This is an unpaid position with a state organization that deals with child welfare and neglected children. I am working with the department of children and families in human resources. Can I use this opportunity as volunteer experience as well? I don't think there is an easy answer to this but I'm curious what other people think. 

Edit: [Wanted to quote a response from Yahoo answers for this discussion](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100908202810AAtQEh2)

129,"I'm a 22 year old law student who's questioning my choice to go to law school. I'm in my second semester and I go back and forth between wanting to be a lawyer and wanting... freedom I suppose. 

Just to clarify, I'm not in law school for the money, I like the idea of being able to help someone through the legal system or to fight for a cause I'm passionate about. If I stayed in the legal field I'd want to be a public defender or work public interest environmental law or civil rights law. As stressful as law school is, I know on a good day I enjoy the challenge of being there, the concepts we're learning, and the ability it could give me to make real change or help someone.  

On the other hand, I feel like becoming a lawyer is the biggest constraint on my freedom. I know I won't be 22 forever, and I know there's certain things I can do now that I may never be able to (realistically) do again. If I want to dye my hair a ridiculous color or get a super noticeable tattoo or piercing I could do that without seriously impacting my ability to get a job. If I wanted to up and move tomorrow across the country because I felt like it I could do that. Not to mention how much more free time I would likely have if I did just about anything besides law school. Even in my best conception of what a law career could be like I don't imagine doing it for the rest of my life.

I know that ultimately I have to make a decision on this that makes me happy but I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to make such a big decision. Maybe someone who took a professional path or not and liked it/ regretted it for whatever reason. Or maybe practicing lawyers. Or just anyone who gives good life advice.",13Jan2017,1

145,"I met both, we'll call them George and Amber, when we lived in the same dorm ""hall"" freshman year. George is my best/only male friend in college and we hang out a few times a week to play video games and stuff. But, I am closer to Amber. Initially, I was attracted to her, but after discussing it with her we mutually agreed that being friends was much better. We've had a good brother/sister relationship since. Amber and I became especially close when I ended up in a ""relationship"" with her best friend. It was pretty toxic as this involved her cheating on her boyfriend in a different school and later admitting that she was just ""using me to replace her boyfriend"". Amber helped me get through this and outcast her friend.   

In Sophomore year, George and Amber became single and started dating each other; coincidentally, this is when I started dating Amber's roommate, Stacy. After losing her other friend (above), Amber and Stacy to become best friends and all 4 of us became really close friends--something helped by the fact that relationships are even similar--where Amber and I, and George and Stacy are extremely similar in terms of personality. Today, both couples have been dating for 26 months and Amber just came back after studying abroad in Indonesia. She hasn't really seen George, Stacy or Me for 6 months and just moved in with Stacy and I. George lives 10 mins away and has hung out with Stacy and I a lot while Amber was gone.   

Amber has dreams of travelling the world and living in lots of different places, while George will likely go to medschool a state over. Amber is also applying to graduate programs in places that don't allow for the relationship to continue.... George, however, can't see this, and while it's obvious he's insecure about the relationship, he believes they can make something work. (imo, it would be a mistake for Amber to follow these dreams, but she'd never believe it.) Either way, the relationship is doomed. Amber doesn't believe in long-distance and her best suggestion involves an open relationship--which to me seems like a cowardly way to avoid the inevitable. There have been other yellow flags foreshadowing this as well--Amber admitting George reminded her of her ex, Amber sharing frustration about George's lack of skill in bed, and questionable comments about grabbing a beer with her ex, ""hanging out"" with a guy that asked for her #, or suggesting to Stacy that they should go downtown and kiss boys.   

But now to the point: to make it worse, Amber recently admitted to Stacy that she cheated on George while she was in Indonesia--a drunken night where Amber and one of European guys on the trip found themselves together in bed. Supposedly, she enjoyed it a lot more than she ever did with George, and so this continued for 2 weeks. THEY EVEN STILL TEXT NOW. I shouldn't know this b/c she told Stacy in private.    

There are a lot of emotions for me. First, I'm angry that I partially consider best friend a horrible person. I almost feel betrayed, especially considering the situation she helped me deal with-- not to mention her mom is even divorced b/c of cheating! I sort of understand her flawed logic but it disgusts me that I can b/c I would never do what she did. I want to yell and shake her and tell her she should be ashamed of her idiocy. With basically anyone else, I'd stop being friends... but I can't for some reason.... She's one of the best friends I've had... Not to mention she lives with us and is best friends with Stacy too. But, I feel reaaaally bad for George. He's not particularly suave and Amber would definitely be considered out of his league, but he loves the hell out of her and is sweet. I imagine him as a puppy and her as some bitch about to kick him when he's playing with something not paying attention. I can't pick a ""side."" Without context I'd say Amber has been the better friend, but given the situation I'm inclined to choose George. I don't want to be dishonest with George and not tell him... but I have no idea what good that would or wouldn't do. Amber and George won't make it through the semester together regardless...Is it just extending his pain? Or is better putting it off for when he can deal with it? Is it better for this naturally happen? Or should I confront her? Or wait for her to come to me? What if she comes to me and doesn't mention this detail, knowing I'd disapprove?

156,"This journey for me began in 2013. I have a degree in journalism and have been writing for several local newspapers since 2009. I decided that while writing is fun there really is not much money to be made in it, unless you are incredibly lucky or know all the right people. I started to become interested in Private Investigation as a career choice.

I purchased a study guide full of different rules and materials that would help me pass the test in New York State. The test is considered one of the hardest PI tests in the country. So I studied it and studied it but life sometimes gets in the way and I never took the test.

Fast forward to late 2014, my 15 yr. old step-daughter who I have known since she was 4 years old, took her own life. This was crushing to my family and needless to say something like that makes you evaluate your own life and mortality. My step daughter was one of those people who literally could have been anything when she grew up. I know we tell every kid that but really there are few people who genuinely could be whatever and she was one of them.

I decided to take a serious run at becoming a PI in New York State. I called the Department of State and asked them if my experience as a reporter would be counted as investigative experience which New York State requires you have 3 years of. The guy said it should. So i took the exam and passed it on the first try. I paid the over $600 in fees and fingerprinting required to apply for the license.

Then came the application itself, it is a lot of work to put together. They need references and references and notarized statements etc. I sent all of this in and after a month they got back to me saying I needed to provide more information on my newspaper reporting and more references. I needed to send them 10 stories per year, hardcopies that I had written for the newspapers. That was over 60 stories I had to find, print, and put together to send out. 

As for references I decided I should go all out. I got a reference from the local Police Chief that I had covered for the newspapers, I got a reference from a Lieutenant of the Sheriffs department and a colleague in the newspaper business.

At this point I had spent about $800 trying to get this license. Worth it though if I got it. After waiting another 3 months they denied me stating my reporting experience did not qualify as investigative experience. So I appealed. When you appeal you have to go before an Administrative Law Judge. They scheduled that hearing another 6 months away. Waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Then they say I can't have the hearing locally which would have been either Syracuse or Binghamton NY. Instead I have to drive to Albany which is a good 3 plus hours away.

When you appeal you can bring an attorney so I decided I was already in this far I wanted to go all the way with it. I found an attorney that had previous experience with Administrative Law Judges. He said my case was good and that he had never lost in front of one of these judges. Finally in March 2015 I have the hearing, I brought more news stories that I had written. I brought letters from the head of the Journalism Department at the College I attended where she explained how Journalism and Investigating go hand in hand. She even gave me a solid recommendation as to my character. I also got a letter from a guy I found online who has a PI firm in Detroit and his background was in investigative reporting. He explained how the two go together and how his journalism experience has been invaluable to him as a PI.

The hearing takes an hour, the judge listens to my case. They say we will send you a letter with the decision. My lawyer said it went great. Said it was one of the best hearings he had been a part of. He told me these judges take months to send their decisions out. He said to expect at least 3 months. So 3 months comes around and nothing. Fast forward to 8 months, and finally after my lawyer made some inquires into how much longer it was going to take they sent me a letter denying my appeal for the same reason as my application was denied. 

After Lawyers fees and driving costs I am now $2,300 into trying to get this license that I've been completely denied of.

That is my story and I guess the advice I'm asking for is what should I do next? Right now I see only one option and that involves selling my house and moving to a state where I can obtain my license easier. Which means either New Hampshire or Washington state which are the two states on a list of about 15 states where I could get my license at this point and where myself and my wife would consider living. 

Sometimes a fresh perspective can be of help so is there any other options that I am overlooking? Working for a PI firm to get the 3 years experience is out because the only thing I could do would be surveillance for $10 an hour and I can't afford to downgrade my job for that.",13Jan2017,3

160,"I'm breaking down more and more lately in my need to make true friends and find a girlfriend.  I ended up losing my interest in school back when I was in college when I realized that the thing I want the most in my life right now is just people who I can connect with and hang out with.  And I tried hard in college, and made great short term friends, but none lasted more than a year and seem to have little interest connecting now, it was all just hanging out with classmates apparently.  

&amp;nbsp;

In the girl department, it's not completely due to lack of trying.  I just don't pursue enough people.  I never ask someone out unless I feel a strong connection or crush with them, but every time that's ever happened in my life, it's ended with rejection, the most common cause being that she already had a boyfriend I didn't know about.  I know I just need to just go to bars or something and ask out strangers, but I don't really get the desire to do that when I'm there, and don't know how either.  

&amp;nbsp;

Professionally, I'm completely off track in my priorities right now.  I've got a great degree.  I was originally going to go to graduate school, but became so upset at my social situation that I couldn't bring myself to commit to being even more busy and alone for a few more years.  

&amp;nbsp;

I actually became so distraught by my whole experience so far that I got up and moved from California to the first other state I got a job offer for, which was Texas, where I've been living the last 4 months.  I've a few friends here, but have the continual worry that they'll be gone within a year like everyone else I've ever tried to get close with and cut off their ties with me, and it's really just messing with my head.  I've also had the same horrible luck with women, and find it's even harder to meet people to ask out now that I'm no longer running across similar people in school.

&amp;nbsp;

The job I came for was fun, but the company laid off a ton of its employees just before Christmas, including myself.  The new job search is going ok so far, but I realized that the biggest factor I'm thinking of in a new job right now is how it's going to affect my social life, which seems completely stupid in my mind.  I just want an office place where I can potentially meet new people who might actually turn out to be good friends, and I don't want something far away that would alienate me from those who are currently friends with me.  

&amp;nbsp;

I really just need help figuring out what to do to seek what I want.  A full time job is necessary, I can't bear the idea of moving back to the west and living with my parents, but need my own income to hold my place out here.  And while that should be my primary goal, I feel like I'm never going to be happy until I've found relationships, friends or more, who I feel like I can actually connect with and won't cut all ties when they decide to move on somewhere new with their life.  And I really feel like if I felt better emotionally, I'd gain back the drive to succeed professionally that left me a few years ago, and maybe even go back to school.  I just don't want to get stuck in a life of working to keep myself living, then go on and die unfulfilled.  

&amp;nbsp;

I know this is all pretty generic, and perhaps not specific enough, but I really just don't know what I should be doing with myself to make me feel good about my life, and would like any insights or ideas into improvement.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: My life is not together.  I feel like I'm always abandoned by friends, have never had a girlfriend, and feel I won't regain my professional ambition until I've got my emotions sorted out.  I never know what I should be doing, and feel like I'm breaking apart more as time goes on.  ",13Jan2017,1

166,"I am a first time dog owner who adopted a 6 year old beagle/basset mix a little over a year ago. The place I adopted him from misled me about him (he is neither crate trained nor housetrained, doesn't seem to have been an indoor dog before, is REALLY hard to train, and has the sense of a moldy potato- for example, two days ago he got into the trash while I wasn't looking and chewed on cans, making his gums bleed). I have taken a pay cut since and might not be able to pay for any medical bills if his past issues come back, which they might. I also can't pay for any obedience training anymore. The basic classes we went to after I got him did very little. I've been trying for a year, and I don't think I can give him the care he needs. This dog really needs easy backyard access for peeing and someone who's got way more experience than me.

At the same time... this is my dog. He was so depressed when I got him, and it took almost the whole year for him to perk up. I don't know if I CAN give him up. And even if I did, the adoption contract dictates that I have to take him back to the place I got him from. I think they'd probably just give him to someone else without telling them what he needs. I also don't think they're a no-kill shelter, and I am NOT giving him up to die. There's a no-kill organization with a very good reputation in town that might let me keep him at home while they try and find someone much better for him. But I don't know how seriously they would take the contract. (The shelter info is on his microchip, so I don't think I can hide it.)

167,"Hi,

I got a bonus from work that's enough to finally do one of the many things I've been wanting to do for almost my whole life.

- I have small boobs that are also kind of asymmetrical. I'm not very sexually active so I don't worry so much about ""being attractive"" (though I do have a concern about ""baiting"" a guy and having him be disappointed my tits aren't as good as the rest of me). I can only wear certain kinds of tops and most swimsuits make me look deformed. There are a handful of bikinis that look good. And I'm trying to go without sounding pompous, the rest of my body is A+. I'm pretty damn fit. My boobs just leave a lot to be desired.

What's funny is that my boobs are almost carbon copies of one another -- nipples are identical and from the front you probably couldn't tell anything's off -- it's just that one has slightly less fat (large a-cup vs medium b-cup). I've already had a consultation with a surgeon and I have exact costs and have seen before/after mock ups that look great.

- I have horrible, horrible vision. I have my entire life. I've been wearing contacts since I was 11 years old. It's really that simple. I've already had a consultation with my eye doctor and I have the exact costs there too. This sort of thing would be so much simpler than an actual surgery, too, and I wouldn't have to use any vacation days probably if I schedule it correctly...

(Fun fact: my breast augmentation and my Lasik costs are only off by a few cents.)

- Nerdy as it is, this year is a huge year for video games and with this kind of money sitting in savings, I could definitely just hang onto it and allow myself to by the Switch, Zelda, Mass Effect, (video games etcetera), go on a trip or two, and generally just not worry about ""treating myself"" and still have plenty of cash just floating in savings. 

- I'm an artist and I would D I E for a Cintiq companion. I could buy that bad boy. I could...

I'm super torn and I need to make a decision ASAP, because a breast augmentation is best during winter in order to be recovered for swimsuit season. What would you do?

170,"So my mums friend is 38, she is really cool and literally lives around the corner from where mine and my cousins college is. We first started going there last year in September and then made it into a thing where we started going every Tuesday.

We all thought it was amazing since she lets us smoke up there and then a few weeks later she let us drink there and soon my cousin started taking advantage of it, I didn't since I knew Tuesday was our thing but now My mums friend is becoming annoyed about it and she's ranting it to me. 

She's told me that 'my cousin and her best friend had messaged her on a Friday asking to come round since she wanted to do her nails..' my mums friend became annoyed and was like no since she has 2 boys and one of them is getting with a girl and she was coming around that day. My cousin knew this which is why she did it but she was still rude and asked. She then said to my mums friend on the Sunday morning 'Are you in? or is your son in?' As soon as my mums friend said no my cousin hung up the phone, my mums friend was so annoyed since my cousin didn't even say hello or bye or any reason as to why she asked if they were in before hanging up.. so my mums friend messaged her like 'what was that about' and it was because my cousins friend had been kicked out of her house... you can imagine my mums friend was then annoyed since my cousin seems to just think this house is like some sort of youth club. 

Then it came to Wednesday and she asked if she could come around to keep me company since i am staying there for the week since I had a work placement and the place was around the corner from hers ( She offered me to stay there so its nothing like what my cousin is doing) My mums friend then said yes for her to come around but then my cousin came round and just messed around at hers and then my mums friends son soon became annoyed because he was annoyed that she is disrespecting the house and that she's being so childish even though she's 17.. like I'm 16 and I know you shouldn't do that... 

Lastly today My cousin had asked to come around today again knowing that my mums friends sons girl is coming around today and wanted the house to himself because he wanted some time with her. My mums friend again said no because of this and then my cousin was like 'ok'... My mums friend is clearly getting annoyed and she always complains to me about it and I don't know what to do since this is my cousin.. I want to say something without starting any mess but how do i tell her to stop asking to come around and to just come on Tuesdays? 

If its not me who will say it then it'll be my mums friend and she's already said that she's going to flip soon since she cant keep on putting up with this, but how should I advise her to say it in a way that my cousin would be offended or feel like she cant come around anymore? its difficult.. please help",13Jan2017,1
171,"This is probably the dumbest question in the world, but I'm very inexperienced when it comes to the dating world, so please bear with me!

I've been sort of seeing a guy for a couple of weeks, nothing too serious and not official (yet?). We met through a common friend who I'll call A.

Now A introduced another friend of hers to the group, and this new guy just moved to this city and is looking for work, so he doesn't know a lot of people yet. According to A, he has a girlfriend, but I've never heard him even mention her.

Anyway, I've only met New Guy two or three times, but he seems all right. Until he asks for my number and starts sending me random messages calling me by a nickname I don't have (short form of my name nobody has ever used). In one of these messages he says he'd like to be friends and asks if I'm free to grab a cup of coffee with him saturday (tomorrow) night.

Now, this made me think maybe he didn't just want to be friends, and after consulting with a friend who is more savvy to the romance scene and doesn't personally know any of the involved parties, I'm more convinced that he is maybe asking me out on a date.

Now I'd usually defuse this by inviting a third wheel, but our mutual friend A will be out of town all weekend, another mutual acquaintance works nights and can't make it, and the-guy-I'm-sort-of-seeing is out of the country and isn't coming back for a few days.

On one hand, I could definitely use one more friend since all of the characters in this story of mine, myself included, are fairly new to this city. If New Guy is genuinely looking for friendship, I'd feel bad if I'd misunderstood his intentions.

On the other hand, dating two people at once, even if casually, is not for me, and I'm not dumping the-guy-I'm-sort-of-seeing for New Guy. I'm also not comfortable with not knowing if he really does have a girlfriend or not.

So I'm down to two options, and I can't figure out what to do. Do I find an excuse not to go out for drinks, or do I go and brace myself for possible awkwardness and friendzoning?

TL;DR: I think a guy is trying to ask me out, but I'm already seeing someone and rumour has it he has a girlfriend. Accept invitation or find excuse and refuse?

He's been talking about it for a while and I wasn't at all for it until my period was late and I began to think that actually - if I were pregnant, it wouldn't be too bad. Turns out I'm not pregnant but I am so unbelievably broody that I can't get the idea of having a baby out of my head but at the same time I need to be sure we can care for a child.
We're both currently at college (UK) doing a HNC course (foundation degree equivalent) which finishes in May. I've just lost my job and he works part time doing about 24 hours a week earning between 600-800 a month depending on contracted hours and we get a pretty large student loan. The government also helps out financially with children somewhat over here. We have about £5000 in savings and we're hoping to save for a mortgage but with me currently out of work and no jobs going it's looking unlikely that that will happen for a while.
We live in his dad's house (although his dad doesn't live there) and pay him £85 a month each and buy our own gas, electric, food, etc. Not an ideal living situation, but it's cheap and ideally we want to buy and not rent a house when we move out (the government helps you out over here).
We would have very little support both monetary and physical from family if I were to get pregnant as I don't really get on with my family and his aren't fond of children (ha) and couldn't afford to support us financially.
I think that yes, we would struggle and have to cut out the finer things in life but I think we could afford. I just want to get some opinions of people who've been in a similar situation, for example, do you have any regrets/advice and what would you have ideally done differently?

189,"My main goal in life is to improve animal welfare and save the lives of shelter animals. It is very bittersweet, exhausting, overwhelming, and expensive, and I feel like I'm in a rut from the sheer scope of it all. I'm only beginning my journey, in my twenties, and I'm worried I might not be the right person for this task. 

However it may just be grief from recently losing a dog who I loved when she was still so young, and with more time to heal I may find the strength to carry on.

I want to help society continue its forward progress in animal welfare, and help the USA reach the point where not just the well being of animals is important, but also their lives. To help create low kill animal shelters and a philosophy of avoiding ending their lives when they are healthy and adoptable. 

I also want to enhance the law. Make it illegal in more states to leave a pet in a hot car, or have a dog loose in the bed of a truck. End discrimination against pit bulls and fight the HOA and insurance agencies responsible for the deaths of many shelter dogs that could not find a home. 

These things could be very expensive, and I'm not even sure what a good approach is to make a big difference for shelter animals while keeping a job and caring for my own pets.

My current plan is to finish college towards a computer sci degree and work from home remotely. This would let me take great care of a dog (since I'm single), and have a regular schedule and some flexibility for traveling. 

Maybe I'm being too ideal and I need to accept reality. Maybe one guy cannot hope to change an entire animal shelter from high kill to low. Maybe the apathy, resistance, and liability I'd face would make it all unfeasible.

Presently I have a kind of local job as a class A truck driver, but winter conditions keep me away from home and exhausted when I get back. I haven't had the energy or motivation to volunteer at the no kill shelter in my town, and I feel awful about not being able to help with the flood emergency since I had to work over the weekend. 

I've been taking steps to try and break the depression, but some days are easier than others. I catch myself with cynical thoughts, outraged about how awful humanity is to animals, how these dogs I love are only considered property, often treated poorly even now, how so many die in shelters. 

It can be hard some days to remember all the good, the people who love animals. Rescue work won't just fall apart without me, there's millions of people working hard to make a difference. The trend of society is positive, always getting better, and entire states are low kill. Even the most unscrupulous US shelters still provide food, vet care, and safety from the elements.

I just don't know where the balance is in what can realistically be achieved, I don't have a lot of direction, and I feel stuck.

197,"Sorry if this is a bit long, but I just wanted to say all of this as it's been in my mind for a while:

So I'm a teenager in highschool and within my friendship group there's another guy who's gradually crept in over the last few years. He is a confident person, and can be very friendly and nice to people when he wants to be, so although he's not a proper 'friend' within the group, everyone gets on well with him. He sounds like a cool guy right? He would be if not for the fact that he can be controlling, 2 faced, and just straight up really nasty to people when he feels like it. He has a habit of being a dick to someone for a few weeks (including me a couple of times) after which then he'll go back to being friendly and normal, like nothing ever happened. And since he has a way with being so friendly and funny, its as though people forget (or want to) that he was ever an asshole. And yeah, that includes me, but I'm really starting to get sick of it now and I want to do something because I think he's a bully.

I genuinely think that this guy enjoys controlling people and making them squirm. I've tried to think of reasons as to why he would act like this, and its not because he has self esteem issues and tries to compensate for it or anything as a lot of other bullies do. Something he has a habit of doing is isolating people from the rest of the group and talking with them in particular, and he's done this with me before aswell. Whenever he did this, sometimes he'd say things like 'i hate x' as if to encourage me to say something about them that he could use against me, and he has even done this before. Once when I said that one of my friends (who I was pissed off with at the time) was my least favorite, he told them, showing that he loves to use information and their weaknesses against people.

One of my good friends, we'll call him 'P',is also one of his friends, though I'd say that P is one of this guy's only 'proper' friend within our group, even though he is friendly to everyone else. The problem is that P always takes his side and laughs along, even though he knows he's being a dick to people. What bothers me most is that P has laughed and mocked me before aswell when the bully starts something, which hurts more as he's someone who I otherwise trust, and I really think that P is a nice person. 

Though the rest of the group doesn't really take part in this, they still do nothing about it when it happens, I think partly because they like the bully since he can be very friendly, partly because they have the mentality of 'if it doesn't involve me I'm not getting involved', and partly because they can't tell sometimes if it's a joke or something mean, even though I can tell. And bear in mind a couple of these people had the exact same treatment from this guy in the past. I admit, when the bully was an asshole to other people in the past I've not done anything much to back the victim up, but more recently I have stuck up for someone who he and P were laughing at.

I suppose what I would like advice about is:
-Why do you think this person acts like this?
-What should I do about it? (I've often tried to retaliate when he acts like this, but since I'm outnumbered against him and P, its  relatively useless)",13Jan2017,1
198,"Posting online because this is deeply personal and not something my friends or family know about, as obviously there is still HIV stigma.

We are a heterosexual couple. I'm grateful for him confiding in me about something so tragic that happened to him three years ago. However, it is a subject he has asked me to never bring up. I can only assume he feels immense shame, disgust, and embarrassment and all of that is understandable. 


But I have this immense, burning hate for what happened. I hate that those men who raped him are out there somewhere, probably doing this to others. I want to bring those men to justice, and I think if we could, it could help give my boyfriend some kind of sense of closure or peace of mind that he may not think he needs.

Here's what I know: he was hanging out with a friend (who sells drugs) when some older men (he thinks in their 50s) came over to make a purchase. Out of nowhere one of them knocked him out, and the next thing he knows is he is being gang raped for a total of 4 hours. After the ordeal was over, his friend took him to the hospital. The rape was never reported. And I'm not sure what this friend was doing while the rape was taking place - I assume he was scared and stood by as he was outnumbered. 


I have a lot of questions. I think he can get the info on who those men were from his friend, so how can we approach his friend for such sensitive info three years later? Can we get the police to do it for us?
Am I wrong for wanting to pursue justice? How can I appropriately and productively approach the topic with him without him shutting down or getting angry? Could he also sue the rapists for giving him HIV?",13Jan2017,2
201,"Hi all, 

I've started a new job 9 months ago in a strategic consultancy firm, think Finsbury or McKinsey and the like. Very stressful environment a lot of the time; some days i work up to 14 hours a day for days or weeks in a row; including working in weekends. 

In parallel, I am also doing studies in music, and have almost 18 months to go before I graduate. I do not see a future for me in the consultancy or business industry, but I do see and want a future for me in music. I know it won't be easy at all, but I am willing to tolerate everything for it - it is my passion. 

My struggle is that I feel uninspired at my job, also don't like the pressure of being client facing. I will try and explore different sectors within the firm; I might find a better offering that inspires me. I don't have a lot of savings so I'm not in a position to think of quitting now. I have thought of pursuing a less demanding job, that could also give me more free time for my studies, but the economy is shitty so I am afraid of taking a risk. 

My mental health is becoming unstable because of all the ups and downs, and not sure how to assess the situation. Any one has any advice for me?

I still really like her.. searching online it says RUN the other way. But I get it, I have a few family members that suffer from mental health issues. Long story short I don't want to give up on her.

205,"Title basically says it all. I'm 24. Have worked multiple random jobs. Have a 2 year degree in comp sci. from a community college. Live with my mom. And I'm completely lost and quite often depressed. I'm only 24 but I feel like I'm too old to do anything meaningful. My family doesn't have a lot of money, so I can't keep mooching of my hardworking mother, and I desperately want to give back to her.

I'm not in bad shape, and relatively intelligent, so I've made 3 plans, but don't know which to follow.

1. I can join the military for 4 years. Get the G.I. bill, and at 28 try to go to a good public college and work on something that interests me like physics, computer science, or engineering. But i feel like going to college at 28 would be awful. Even if i graduated with a bachelors or masters, I'd be 32-34 and up. That sounds like way too late to start a career. IF I somehow managed to get a job, which many don't, id be lucky to be able to retire at 54. Almost 75% dead. Plus the whole thing sounds risky. What if i just end up working fast food because I can't get my degree to work anywhere. Or if I don't have enough money to sustain college life and have to work a shitty job while trying to do college work.

2. I can go career enlisted. Work hard for 20. Get bossed around by the military. Many I read about are miserable, but who knows, I might like it. And if I get high enough up the ranks I can get a moderately decent pension. I'd only be 44. But a military life sounds terrible. No free time. No freedom compared to the average civilian. Owned by the government. Finally free to do anything in my 40s. Plus I could die quicker than usual. Which would suck.

3. Try for an rotc scholarship, or attempt to get my bachelors in the 4 years I'm enlisted, then go officer for 20 years. Better pension. More experience. But I'd still be in my late 40s when I can retire. Officer life sounds very political. Getting an rotc scholarship without tons of extracurriculars is very difficult. And if I failed to get my degree in the 4-6 years active duty, officer would be gone, because OCS won't take you if you've served more than 6 years.

I just want to be able to enjoy life. I want to learn. I want to study and create. But to do that I need a solid career, and a shitload more confidence in myself. Can anyone help me decide between these 3 plans? I already feel like I've missed out so much on life. I can't keep missing more. Even if it all seems hopeless.",13Jan2017,4
206,"I'm 17 and a male junior in high school and It's not that I can't find commonalities with other people, it's just that I have this strange social anxiety, that isn't really social anxiety. I can answer a phone call, bond well with strangers, be reasonably ok at party's and I love public speaking etc. So it's not social anxiety, but I still get horrifically anxious in moments that most people are fine in. 

If I'm with friends blasting music that has some sort of connotation to it, I can't stand it. Even if I love the music. My friend was playing AC/DC, who are great when you're in the mood, but then some high school kinda friends walked by and suddenly I couldn't stop thinking, ""this is so uncool, they're gonna think we're so weird."" Or if my friends are blasting hip hop I'd think ""ugh, this music is so shitty and basic, and we look like such douche bags."" Even though I know that thought process is destructive, I can't stand it.

Telling my parents that I have a girlfriend would be like coming out to them. I love my parents, they're crazy chill, and they wouldn't care one bit if I was dating somebody. Though, there is something about the reality of them knowing that I could ""be in love,"" or depressed about a break up, or be physical with someone that I can't stand. A girl who's just a friend approached me and my mum once and we were literally just friends, but I froze up and was probably crazy red faced, she went for a hug and I high fived her, because I didn't want to hug a girl in front of my liberal-ass mother. Wtf??

I can't walk through the halls with people who could possibly be considered weird, even if I like them because other people might think ew. The thing is I could go down town and yell ""I'm a smooth African lesbian"" and not give a shit. So I have these weird ass double standards. I know I shouldn't care what others think, but the shame these things bring me is overwhelming, and it's for no damn reason.

I have interest in watching the show with him because I've only heard good reviews about it and my stepdad really likes it. His argument is that the art style is weird (he watched the marvel anime, too) and he doesn't like their  ""unrealistic and exaggerated reactions and speech"" (again, Pokémon and Yugio). He usually picks what we watch and makes a face when I suggest a show that I'm interested in. I'm also somewhat interested in One-Punch Man.

213,"He's not very sensitive when it comes to talking to me. I try avoiding confrontation and questions at all times with my family because i know it can get bad very quickly with us. My parents were raised more harshly than i was and adopted my grandparents form of parenting which is outdated and bad, it may work in Mexico but not here in the US.

After trying to avoid answering his questions about what i'm going to do when/if i transfer he confronted me in my room to do so. I have some kind of claustrophobia, and my room is kind of small so i don't like having anyone but myself in it, i feel it's the safest place i can be. I wanted him to leave my room and myself alone, and i automatically cussed which he didn't take lightly. Out of habit he threatened to hit me and i blew up in his face. I ended up yelling and crying a lot talking about all the abusive things he had done over the past 13 years. He completely gets that it was harsh but that he tried his best to raise us the way my grandparents raised him, and i get that my parents have good intentions. My parents don't drink, they have no desire to be abusive at all but it's always been difficult needing to tell them that what they're doing is wrong without raising my own voice. But at the same time i raise my voice because they raise their's and it's been a way to defend myself. I always end up crying even when i'm really pissed off. My dad started crying too. I think i've scared him the past couple of years and that worries the shit out of me. I shouldn't be like this but i don't know how to stop. I started reacting aggressively towards them raising their voices when i was 15, before that all i could ever do was try to run and cry.

I can't stop crying because i'm worried that i've caused my dad a great deal of stress and that it'll hurt him physically. I've caused my mom stress too when i was mad at her and she started having panic attacks because of me. I'm worried that the neighbors heard all of this and will call the police. And i love and worry about my family, i understand where my parents are coming from but they don't understand why i'm this way.

What i do is rubbing off on my older brother. He's more gentle than everyone here but he doesn't know how to control his anger even though it's not as profound as ours. But overall i think his relationship with our dad is far better than my own. I don't want to mess that up because at his age i resented my parents.

I can't stay at home anymore. I've been wanting to go to univ since i was 10 and now i have a really good chance of being accepted at good universities.

216,"Hello so me [29] and my brother [25] fought today over dishes. (Oh no the world is coming to and end) basically this is how it all went down.

Me and my girlfriend have been doing dishes. Where as soon as we use them we wash them let them dry and put them away. Well my brother had cooked for the past few nights for himself and his girlfriend and left the dishes. I didn't wash them. I did have 3 bowls with 3 spoons and two glasses out that I didn't wash and left them out of the sink and off to the side for me to wash. 

I approached my brother about it this morning just kindly asking him, ""Hey do you mind doing some of the dishes today please? "" And I asked him about the Internet as well. 

He says sure. Goes into the kitchen and comes into my room and starts verbally attacking me. He's got a rude tone in his voice and says ""So when are you going to do some dishes? Me and GF have been doing them a lot."" And I got super offended and admidtly pissed off because of his attitude. I explained to him that we have been doing the dishes and cleaning them after each use. And then he asked about the bowls and I said those are mine set them aside I can wash them. But he just keeps saying I don't do any dishes which is pure BS. 

He also says I don't do anything else around the house which is also BS.  I do so much around the house he is never home or around to see it. I work more then him 8am - 6pm and he is at home as a subcontractor. So he hasn't been working for two weeks now. He's always home just playing video games. So it really pisses me off that he thinks I do nothing when I already do what is needed and he has SO much more free time then me and doesn't do shit. Then has the nerve to say I don't do anything? 

Anyways I left telling him to go fuck off and left for work. Now I'm dreading going back home. My brother is a narcissist and always views himself as never in the wrong. He also proceeded to text argue me and I just didn't read anything and said , ""This is petty if you need to have anything to say, say it to my face."" And just kept deleting his messages. 

So now I know as soon as I get home if my brother gets an attitude I'm gunna fire back. So I'm looking for the best solution here and any advice is appreciated.",13Jan2017,1

As much as I like routine, I get the sensation that it hurts me in ways I might not have planned. It’s made parts of my life very routine as a 21yr old. I have a love/hate relationship with routine.
I usually schedule myself based off my work and school schedules, those are the Important tasks that must be done. Anything after that is fair game to do what I want (within monetary reason), but I tend to stay within the same boundaries. I listen to the same or similar sounding music, I eat the same food, routinely watch my online shows, and so on. A typical day is focused on what time I go into work. My schedule is roughly the same week to week, but this is what I plan the most around. I am fortunate enough that my employer works well with giving me the appropriate time off for attending my classes. I smoke weed daily, which has undoubtedly become very routine. I use the excuse that it relieves a weight of anxiety, but at this point it feels very routine and that I’m only doing it is because it’s been a while. Mental. I want to break this weekly routine of doing relatively the same activities, but also keep the structure... I don’t like chaos and not knowing. Which may also hinder why I can’t seem to break routine, as I’m scared of the one outcome I might not have planned and now my schedule may be ruined, altered. I’m not the most organized of people but I try to make sure I take note or am aware of Important tasks that need to be completed.  I could delve more but I mainly want to know in what ways, either adding or removing, you can change your routine and getting the opportunity to explore more (I want to travel a bit more; I’ve had the urge to use my vacation time to take a week and just go somewhere, but the money and fear of the unknown factors also keeps me hesitant) or just liven up your life, not making it the same thing every single week.

I've had suicidal thoughts in the past, but the extent of fear and rage I felt during the attempt was awful, and perhaps indescribable for someone of my writing capabilities. Note, this isn't the first (or last) time this happened to me, so I think it unlikely the weed was laced.  

Anyway, the attempt involves me crashing my car into another car, so that coupled with me running around like a sociopath asking other people to kill me got me in heaps of legal trouble. I was sent to an outpatient program for 5 days, and was hit with 7 tickets.

When I do something or talk about something she always has these little comments that make me feel like shit about myself if not then she will always try and brag about how her life is better than mine.

It's an old 2004 car but it works perfectly fine and I was actually really excited about it then she had to bring up how she's glad her parents gave her a brand new 2016 car and has never had to drive a ""junky"" car.... like what?

227,"I'm a 15-year-old boy and I live with my mom, my sister, and my autistic brother. I'm very lazy and I consider myself a [sponge](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sponge) type of person.  My sister has always been very short-fused and generally an undesirable person.

But ever since i was 13, *something changed in the way she treated me.* She is on my ass every single day, generally being rude and demanding things from me in a threatening voice. This was new to me, because we've never had any problems and never actually talked to each other in a meaningful way. Up to this point, i was mildly annoyed, but it was okay because i had my friends to talk to.

Then, about a two months ago, she really lashed out on me.

I went into her room out of boredom and found a **basket** of candy, as in, a ''literally way too much for one human being to eat alone'' amount of candy. Immediately, i thought she couldn't notice if i took **one**, right? Well, i took the smallest piece of candy there was, a [paçoquita](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rO5mo-o1NKc/maxresdefault.jpg), and left the room. About 15 minutes later, she came back from work and went into her room. After that, she hurriedly went into my room, in which i was *sleeping*, and started screaming out questions in her usual, condescending tone of voice. ''Did you take a paçoquita from my room?!'', she said literally as loud as she possibly could, to which i woke up, startled, and replied ''Yes''. Then she started talking all this bullshit such as ''i cant believe this 15-year-old prick came into my room, did you fucking think i wouldn't notice?'', then she made this fucking [pose](https://d2gg9evh47fn9z.cloudfront.net/thumb_COLOURBOX6437166.jpg) with the smuggest fucking grin i've ever seen. ''You're going to make every single cent of that paçoquita cost me, and you better start looking NOW.'', she said, stomping her foot down. I was lightly shaking by this point, but i tensed up every muscle i could so she wouldn't notice. She actually made me run around the house looking for spare change, while she sat down on my mom's bed and did effectively nothing but belittle me more with insults. Eventually, i found some change and gave it to her, and she walked out telling me ''this better not happen again''.

You that are reading this, do you see something wrong with this? Do you see how this is traumatizing? Just so you know, it has been **two months** and i still remember this. Do you remember anything from two months ago?

This wasn't the last time she did that. After that, about fifteen days later, she lashed out on me *again.*

My mom was going off to work and told me to tell my sister that she could go to the local bakery to eat something if she wanted. My sister was sleeping then and i told myself i would tell her once she woke up, but i *forgot to tell her accidentally.*

About ten minutes after she woke up, she barged into my room and asked me *''why didn't you tell me i could go to the bakery?''*, to which i said *''oh yeah, sorry, i forgot to tell you that you coul-''* but before i could actually end that sentence, she started screaming at me for **five minutes**, which, when you think about it, is way too much time for you to *scream at your younger brother.*

She said i was a lazy asshole that didn't care about anyone other than myself, and that i would *''cry to my little mummy like a little bitch when she gets home''*. What she means by this is, the last time she lashed out on me, i straight up broke down in tears about 4 hours when it was said and done, and my mom happened to be nearby. She asked me what was wrong, and i told her. She told me that *''she couldn't have been that hard on me''* and that *''i'm projecting some other problem on her''*. We talked for a bit, and she told me i'm sad because i'm using the computer way too much and that makes people sad, *i guess*, so she's restraining the time i'm allowed to use it.

I am not really a drinker, or very social in general, and I don't enjoy any of these events. I do have like a glass of wine on special occasions and stuff but I can go months without having a drink and not miss it. So as a result, I kind of avoid these events. 

I used to try to go to them, and just not drink, but everyone would try to get me to, like hey have a beer! And I have tried many excuses, like no I have to drive home and I'm a lightweight, or no I'm not in the mood, but those don't seem to deter my coworkers at all.

It's at the point where I feel like a party pooper because I don't enjoy these events at all so I have just started staying at my desk while they go on.

I'm not really faulting my coworkers for enjoying beer, I just kind of wish we had other types of events or that I could hang out at the beer events without being pressured into drinking.

I'm not really sure what to do at this point, does anyone have any advice? Should I just keep excusing myself from all this?",13Jan2017,1
229,"Basicly my best friend Bruce has been my mate since we were 10/11. We are now both 21 and work together. He had been dating this girl for the past 6months. He knocked her up and they are now separated. Any way I knew she had a history with meth and was on it while they were together. Bruce always said he never touched it. So they haven't been together for about a month now. So I assumed meth was out of Bruce's life. We working and he was in quite an irritable mood, stomping around, starting arguments etc etc. Classic signs of someone coming down from meth. I had to get some tools from the work van and he had a bag in there.. I accidentally knocked the bag off the seat and out rolled a used pipe and a light bulb. Now I thought about confronting him about it he's a bit stubborn and will try bullshit his way out of it. Also been considering talking to his parents to try set up an ultimatum of some sort. Basically I don't lose my mate to meth. This is my first time ever dealing with something like this and any advice/help would be appreciated sooo much ",13Jan2017,1

232,"I struggle to be the center of attention or meet new people. I also feel like I'm always just ""tagging along"" when I'm in a group of people. I feel like I don't belong and I just want to fit in for once. Any tips?",13Jan2017,1
233,"Ok, I'll TRY to keep this as short as possible. My fiancee and I have been renting a house for 2 years now. The lease states we are required to take care of the yard. So since we don't have any equipment we've had landscapers for about a year and a half which the owner was made aware of through the property management company she uses. 


Since we moved in we have had CONSTANT requests for pictures of the yard to ensure we're taking care of it as the owner of the house lives in Sweden. Fine, we did that. Finally it started to become very annoying to say the least that nearly every month we were asked to provide pictures of the yard. I fully understand it's her house and she wants to make sure it's taken care of, but calm down a little. 


Along with this we've had 2 visits. One from the owner herself who brought a neighbor from 2 houses down that the owner flat out told me she asked to spy on tenants and another from the owners daughter. This was supposedly to see if anything needed repairing or updating, like the 20 year old carpet that's fraying or linoleum that's cracked and starting to roll up on itself, but nothing has ever come from these visits. Maybe I'm paranoid, but these visits seemed more of an excuse to check up on us. 

Which is their right, but also annoying as we've never given them any reason to think we haven't been taking care of the house. In fact the owner complimented me on how good the house looked when she came to visit after she was done opening every kitchen and bathroom cabinet of course (Who does that?!).

We've also had the owner request that we remove dead bushes from the yard...Which is valid, but the question is with her in Sweden how did she know about the dead bushes? So NOW I'm paranoid about the neighbor spying on us. Also, note, we live in the desert and I know jack all about landscaping so I didn't know if it was dead or not!

Around the holidays we had to fire our old landscapers for not coming out/not doing a good job and of course during the holidays is not a good time to get someone to come out, so the yard went a little longer than usual without landscaping. This was all in the backyard. We just had the yard done yesterday and oddly enough got a call today from property management that the owner is concerned about the yard.

Is there any way without getting us kicked out to ask property management to maybe tell the owner to back off a little bit? I understand it's her house but am also of the opinion that if she doesn't trust us, she shouldn't have renewed the lease with us and maybe she shouldn't be renting the house period. Unfortunately we can't move out at the end of this years lease and are looking at a 3rd year here due to finances and I really don't want to have to deal with another year of being nagged or spied on. I know this situation may be one of those that I just have to suck it up because renting but would still appreciate any advice.

237,"First off, disclaimer: I know this sounds silly or childish, I'm not a 15 year old or someone *extremely* inexperienced. My dad was an alcoholic, I understand drinking isn't always fun and games. 

As someone who just recently reached the drinking age, how can I ensure that I don't reach a limit of near-death or overdrinking? 

Are there signs to look for? Any type of feeling? Is slurred speech the stopping point? 

I know, I sound like some silly newbie. I've had alcohol before, but I've never attempted to get ""drunk"", which is what I'd like to do. 

Just experimentation.

239,"x-post from r/relationships, just trying to get some more opinions.

Roomie and I have known each other for over three years. We've been living together officially since June, though we spent a lot of our time together even before that. We have a lot in common-cynical sense of humor, (lack of) religious belief, taste in shows/comics/movies, etc. We're also both mentally ill (he doesn't go to doctors often but has been previously diagnosed with depression, and I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder). It's a lot, I know. Because of our similar situations, though, we could empathize with each other, and we're ridiculously close.

Note: There's nothing romantic going on between us AT ALL. I'm an out, proud, flannel-wearing lesbian.

Usually, when he has a problem, I can usually think ""oh, I've been in that situation before"" and come up with the best thing to say to make him feel better. His depression has been getting worse lately, though, and I find that I'm completely out of my element. It's like he's incapable of seeing ANYTHING positively.

- He thinks he's bad at everything, and hates himself for it. We used to play video games together a lot, but I can't even do it any more because he always gets self-loathing and rages out if he dies even once. It's so bad that he's locked himself in his room all day, upset over losing a cute flash game named Sushi Cat.

- He never wants to go anywhere any more. We used to go everywhere together; though I have other friends I can go out with, he was always the best, since we're both introverted/neither of us will make a scene or be too loud in public. He and I are both science majors, so we spent a lot of time at aquariums, zoos, etc. Now, though, it's a struggle to get him out of bed in the mornings. He's been sleeping a lot (another sign of depression that I've also dealt with), going to bed at 9, waking up at 11, and taking a nap every day at around 3.

- He's single. I know it sounds weird, but I've talked to him extensively about it and he says this is the #1 reason for his depression. He says he feels invisible, like girls just look through him, and that nobody will ever love him. It breaks my heart, but I just don't know what to do. He gets angry whenever I suggest going out and meeting girls &amp; he won't talk to anyone but me in class (like I said, total introvert). He's tried Tinder, and had two girls come over for hookups, but he never ended up sleeping with/entering a relationship with either. He says he wasn't attracted to either, which is totally a good reason for not dating someone, but at the same time it irritates me when he says that ""nobody wants him"" because hey, somebody did.

(EDIT: Tinder certainly isn't the only app/site he's tried though, or else I would suggest that. He has a long list of sites that didn't work, and he likes to regurgitate it whenever I encourage him)

I've suggested therapy multiple times, but I can't force him to go. This kind of angers me, too - I don't have health insurance, so I had to stop seeing my old therapist, and I wish to death that I could go back. Not only does he have health insurance, he also has money from his rich family. If I was him, I'd be getting help in a heartbeat.

Outside of that suggestion, what can I do? I love Roomie to death and I want to support him but it's so difficult when there's this dark cloud of negativity that makes having fun with him seem impossible. Even if I wanted to (which I don't), I couldn't cut contact, since we live together and have 3/5 classes together this semester. Any suggestions?

tldr: I don't know how to help my depressed friend, and it's beginning to change how I feel about him.",13Jan2017,1
240,"So I absolutely hate the smell of weed, cause to me it always smells like skunk. I live in a fairly small house with a roommate who smokes the stuff in his room. Thankfully I can't smell it from my room, but sometimes whenever I leave my room I smell it all over the house. I don't usually confront roommates on things that they do in their rooms, and he doesn't smoke it that often, so for a while I just left it. However those times where I do smell it make me feel really disgusted, and I consider talking to him about it.
Anyways, what do you guys think I should do about this? I'm not a very confrontational person, so I personally don't feel like doing so, but maybe I should.",13Jan2017,39
243,"My mom has been living with me for almost 3 years. She moved in with me 8 months after I finished college (I had only lived on my own for 6 months at that point). At first it was because she had no money, and she hated living with her friends. Now, I am not a caretaker, but her health really doesn't allow her to live on her own. Please don't tell me to put her in a home, because that's not the answer I'm looking for.

Since she has moved in with me, my life has been at a little bit of a standstill. I have not had a serious boyfriend yet (I just turned 27) and I'm kind of scared to date. Part of it comes from my situation. I don't have any real hobbies right now, either. My mom likes to offer her advice, and while I appreciate it, I feel bad whenever I do something she doesn't want me to do. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I want to stop feeling insecure about my situation and move on with my life. ",13Jan2017,8

247,"Hey all, need some quick, un-baised advise. 

Back story is that I am a gamer, and I play a lot. Whenever I can actually. It's not only a recreational thing it's my shut-down and my escape from reality. It's a large part of my life and I don't want to change that. 

Recently, I've been playing Overwatch, and I've gotten pretty damn good. I've gotten into the top 1% of all NA players and I've set myself up. A lot of people know me and a lot of friends brag for me. 

Because of my Judaism, I've decided that I'm going to spend 9 months starting in August to go to Israel and learn. It's supposedly a very eye opening experience and will lead me on a path of faith and self help. My brother went and instantly was able to start his life and he's making a good figure and settling himself down similar to how I want to. My sister is there now and is changing herself for the better. 

I will go to Israel, but I also want to game. Now here's the problem, my computer is dying and I am presented two options: 

1.) Spend a portion of my little money saved up ($500) to buy the parts to rejuvenate my PC ($175). Here, the issue lies that both my brother that went and my sister that is there tells me that every drop of money is incredibly important in Israel and I'm also trying to learn how to manage my money in general. Most (I'd say 85%) money that I've gotten has went to gaming whether it'd be for my PC or for family games on the XBox. I'd be working in the summer but I've never been able to find a job that I'd fit into. Camp is willing to pay $500 for 6 weeks I'm there but I *seriously* don't want to work there because of the lack of energy I have at the end of the day. 

2.) Don't spend my money. That means I won't be able to play my games and I won't be able to enjoy myself after school. This also means I will be nearly cutting ties with all my connections and prevent future enjoyment. I'd be spending about 7 months without my games and if I'm honest, I don't know if I can deal with that (especially if I work at camp). 

My friends who promote my gaming skill believe I can take myself to the next level (Pro and semi-pro), so they tell me to spend the money. My family tells me that games aren't so important, and saving is probably the best bet. My brother says it's up to me. My sister says save. I'm torn myself in which direction I should choose. 

Have any advice? ",13Jan2017,1
