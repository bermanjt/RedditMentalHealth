0,"Hey everyone, so I live in an apartment building and there's this cat that's definitely belonged to someone before but is probably lost or was abandoned. Anyway, I've been through many situation's where I had to interact with it and I usually pet it and act generally great to it..so now it's starting to try and block my way when im using the stairs to stay with it or 'hug' my legs -which is really cute btw..and I really like the cat and wanna take it in but my family hates cats so I can't. I feel guilty passing by it and petting it then preventing it from entering the apartment and also simply ignoring it to avoid more attachment isn't really an option at this stage..I don't know what to do, and that's why I'm here..Please help :/",04Sep2017,1

3,"I have an apartment where both myself &amp; my roommate are on the lease, with my mother as the guarantor. I unfortunately did not accurately assess my roommate's responsibility &amp; habits, and rushed into a situation that I've now realized is a mistake.

My boyfriend smokes marijuana at night sometimes to help his anxiety/sleep, but is anal about airing it out efficiently and does not keep it in my apartment. I did not want a roommate who would have issues if he were to smoke inside, so when I was looking for a roommate &amp; a coworker who I knew was ""420 friendly"" approached me, I just went ahead and said yes. I knew she had two jobs so I also thought money would not be an issue. She moved in a month after I did, but there are now aspects of the situation I did not fully realize &amp; I've realized now I've made a mistake. I have no idea how to go about it graciously.

1. She smokes much more often than I thought. This is still the least of my problems, as she's only stayed there a night and I didn't smell it at all. I, however, do not trust her to be so cautious when I'm not around and to not keep it in the apartment.
2. She has a boyfriend who has ""nowhere to go"" due to the fact he was kicked out of his last apartment for dealing weed &amp; other drugs, and was then kicked out of his home and has assault charges against his father. She asked if he could essentially move in over text, and I told her I am only comfortable with him being there if she is there and he cannot deal weed outside the apartment. She told me he doesn't deal anymore, but I don't believe that's true as a coworker told me he got weed from her boyfriend just a few days ago. I have not met him. I am at school from 8-9 on many days and I obviously I have 0 ability to really know what is happening at the apartment when I'm not there.
3. She does not have any sort of savings. At work on Friday night, she told a couple coworkers she was desperate to make money as she did not have the money to pay rent, which was due in two days. Most of her money goes towards weed, cigarettes, or assisting her boyfriend as he does not have any sort of a job. I do not believe she will have enough money next month to pay the money for gas or electric, both of which are in my name.
5. Rent was due today at 5 P.M., and I had to send her the information for the online rent paying system for the 5th time and remind her half an hour before it was due when it was due, despite the fact I have told her the date and time it is due multiple times. This is not a major issue, but is pretty annoying.

My mother, who is the guarantor on the apartment, is now frustrated that I didn't realize her financial or boyfriend situation earlier. She wants to kick her out, but since she is on the lease and not a sublet I do not believe that is possible. Her other suggestion is to be clear about conditions for living in an apartment that rides on her credit. These conditions are putting up a security camera in common areas and that my mom is able to come in as she pleases. 

She has not done anything glaringly wrong yet, but I cannot trust her &amp; I anticipate either legal or financial issues in the future. This month her rent was lower than usual as she did not have to pay any sort of utilities, gas, or electric and I don't believe she will have enough money to cover these in the future. 

I am looking for further advice, either legal or just how to get along with her &amp; make things as civil as possible if further issues arise. I am also wondering if my mother's response is justified--she is, of course, not the landlord but as the guarantor she believes she can give such conditions and, if they are not followed, pursue eviction. My primary concern is not with her smoking weed, but moreso that she has a boyfriend who does not have his own place and has an extensive legal history and deals...naturally I don't want random people in my apartment when I'm not there. I am concerned most importantly for the safety of my dog in the apartment (he's my baby), as well as the condition of the apartment. I am also very concerned about what financial issues will arise in the future that I or my mother will have to cover (she will not put gas or electric in her name either, they're in mine).

TLDR; I did not accurately assess my roommate's financial responsibility and a drug-dealing boyfriend has been brought into the equation, she is on the lease so I cannot evict her myself. My mother is the guarantor and is putting strict restrictions on the apartment in hopes she either will behave or will choose to leave the apartment herself. I am seeking advice on 1. my legal rights in this situation, 2. how to deal with her civilly and minimize conflict while still being firm.",04Sep2017,1

5,"I personally hate it when I have moments of immaturity. Here's the story:

I'm 27. I've always been a strong-willed, passionate person, ever since I was a child. All of my life, however, I was told to ""act my age"" tons of times by my mother. I grew up being told that being a kid at heart is not right, but honestly, life would be miserably boring if you can't have fun and be a kid at heart. I believe in that, and yet I would still feel a bit guilty about it. What also sucks is that my mother still treats me as if I'm ten years younger. I could be rather calm and sometimes polite about something, whereas my mother would act childish and irritated and accuse me for being 16 years old or something. I try to take in responsibilities and be independent whenever I can. One of my beliefs is that I prefer to be told the factual truth, no matter how much it hurts and how much I deny it. I personally hate criticism, yet I do take it into consideration at times to make some self-improvements. I also admit fault when there's blame. I try not to let myself be influenced, especially by my mother, but it's hard at times, and it can lead to me being self-caustic. There's been tons of times where I would express my feelings about a situation, and I would be judged by being told that I'm selfish, an attention-seeker, etc, so I don't talk about my feelings anymore, due to the fear of being judged and denied. There is acknowledgment when I do have my moments of immaturity, especially when my emotions over-bottle. Equanimity is attempted when it comes to frustration and other feelings, but sometimes I slip up.

I think my bouts of immaturity happen the most in relationships. I grew up as the black sheep, and I went through some emotional trauma, so there's a deep longing of feeling wanted, needed, acknowledged, and so on. I'm trying my best to learn that relationships can't always go the way I envision, and that I can't expect people to treat me the way I treat them, as they express differently. It's quite hard for me though, as I always feel alienated, and I have severe social anxiety, so the way I handle relationships sometimes are in a rather immature fashion.

Would this be considered as immaturity? Would you consider that immaturity is inevitable in human nature? What is immaturity to you? It sucks being stuck in a loop of believing that I am immature, and trying to be mature for others when I just can't change the way I am.",04Sep2017,1

13,"This is gonna be a little long but I promise it's worth it lol

My roommate and I have been living together all summer. Things were fine until late June when next month's rent was due. When the time came to pay the rent, she expected it to be in on the 25th. She said this was because if I was ""late"" as in I didn't give her the money exactly then, it would be fine because I'd still have time to turn it in. She also mentioned something about not knowing how long it took to mail in checks or something and wanted to be on the safe side.... idk. 

This didn't last, and eventually we fell out over the rental agreement because I brought up how unfair it was to have a due date so early. I was trying to save up for my trip in August but even then, the 25th is ridiculous. It wasn't a heated exchange, just very terse and intense. She is the type of person to get mad at me for leaving crumbs on the counter, a problem which she brought up in this argument as well as similar small details. She then went on to make it about rent, saying I was ""late"" when the month wasn't even over yet. This is when we agreed on the 28th of the month at the EARLIEST. 

Additionally, I brought up how poorly she's treated me despite me living here the whole summer. It took two months before I was given more space in the bathroom. She had things on every part of the counter, and under the sink. The only reason she moved her stuff is because I asked. I told her it was stuff like this that was making me tired (the ENTIRE apartment is stacks of books and papers and shit, she won't even let me bring in new furniture unless it goes in my room despite it being a shared living space) and I was sick of being treated like a guest in a space I rent. Even then I wasn't forceful - I was stern but I wasn't a dick about it, and I didn't hold it against her because I know she's still getting used to having me as a roommate. 

The next day we talked more in depth. She apologized, but she also suggested I move out because it didn't ""seem to be working."" She said we had nothing in common and we had too many years between us (she's 46, I just turned 19). I said this is stuff that can be worked on, and roommates aren't required to be friends, just cordial. If that's what we needed to be I'd be all for it. She then began to cry, saying she gets depressed in the winter and she knows she isn't easy to live with but it's unlikely to change because she's so old. The conversation ended with us agreeing to work on ourselves in a mutual effort to make things work. 
 
Fast forward next month, as it gets closer to me leaving, we agree I give her rent before I leave. Let me make this clear: I had every intention of paying it in full, and even had the money order with me BUT I wondered if I could talk to her about giving me some sort of break since I'm gonna be gone so long. I knew it was a long shot, but she's been pretty flexible and I figured why not ASK even if the answer is no. 

She flipped her SHIT, assuming I wasn't gonna pay rent at all and tried to confiscate my keys until I gave her my share. We argued for a bit, her lecturing me about my responsibility to pay my rent, and me defending myself with my perfect on time payment history and also wondering why she was so pressed over a hypothetical situation. Guys, all I wanted was to /talk/ about a possible break. I thought the worst thing she'd say is no, but she blew up on me, saying I was an ignorant teenager who doesn't understand how it is to be an adult who pays rent, and making these unfair accusations talking about I ""broke my promise"" to pay her before I left. 

Now, I could understand if I tried every month to not pay my rent, but I am very good about paying her on time and communicating with her. She could've just said ""no dude, that doesn't work"" and that would've been it. It was during this argument that she told me she was ""giving me notice"" to which I completely refused. I said she couldn't kick me out if she had no cause. 

The ultimate kicker is her leaving me a passive aggressive note asking for more toilet paper ""because it's your turn"" right before I'm supposed to leave. So she essentially wanted me to buy her toilet paper since I wouldn't be there to use it. So at the end of the argument I said ""buy your own fucking toilet paper,"" gave her my share of the rent, and shut the door in her face. 

I know that part was childish, but y'all, it was past midnight and I STILL hadn't started packing. I have been very patient with this woman about adjusting to this new roommate situation, having different work schedules, and just in general trying to be a decent human, and she is making it seem like I'm just awful. Am I just awful? What can I do?

I also want to know: can she kick me out? I'm not on the lease, paying month to month, but I do receive mail there, and the landlord accepts my checks as partial payment of the rent. What rights do I have? How much can I fight back on this? 

P.S I'm 19, this my first home away from home or dorms, please don't judge me for how cringey some of this is lmao. I want to learn from this situation, not be made fun of. Thanks!

It's been a week today and it seems neither the cops, nor HR have spoken with him, when by all logic, he should be fired by now, especially since I spoke to another female friend who works in the same place and job title, and she said he does the same things to her in the workplace,and attempted to assault her in his car as well.  I said she should come forward too, and the next day she did. Her story is almost identical to my experience.


I reported to HR that he regularly physically picks us up and puts us on his shoulder, (despite protests and pulling away and shouting) pushes his whole body against our backs (sandwiched between him, and a counter, or wall, and makes graphic sexual remarks to us about the appeal of our bodies, taking our hands, and even more.

20,"I had sex with a very famous celebrity last night. Needless to say, I'm kinda freaking out about it now. 
I work as a bartender in a restaurant in Beverly Hills and this particular patron spent most of last night at my bar, alone, talking to me about her boyfriend. He is also an actor, but he's usually in another city shooting and he is gone all the time. She seemed extremely lonely. As we started closing the restaurant, she said that she was going to leave and wished me a good night. I asked her if she was driving. Said she was fine to drive, but she wasn't even close. I offered to call her an Uber and she said that I was sweet but she was still going to drive cause she lives really close by. Then I offered to drive her home right when she dropped her keys at which point it finally dawned on her that I was right and she shouldn't be driving. She gave me the keys to her car.
I drove her home and on the way home she started kissing me. First on the cheek, then on the neck, then she started licking my ear while rubbing my dick through my pants. I got hard instantly. When we got to her place, I opened her gate and drove up to the house. I cut off her car and broke out my phone to call an Uber. I guess she saw what I was doing cause she took the keys and my phone from me and then ran into her house. 
I followed her inside to get my phone, cause it was a freaking 12 mile walk back to the restaurant, at least. I thought she was just playing with me, like a tiger playing with its food. It never occurred to me that she actually wanted to have sex with me, but once inside she practically raped me. She ripped my shirt open, pulled it down and jumped on me, wrapping her arms and legs around me. She stared kissing me. She scratched the shit out of my back. I put her down, took her clothes off and fucked her really hard on her couch for about 40 minutes. I came on her ass. I definitely made her cum several times. When we were done, she said that it was exactly what she needed thanked me. I ordered an Uber, had a drink with her by the bar near her piano and then bid her a good night when ride arrived. 
But here's the thing. She just called me and told me that my boss gave her my phone number. She said she had a wonderful time with me last night and that since I have tonight off she was wondering if I wanted to chill with her at her place tonight and watch Netflix with her. I told her that I have plans for today and that I would get back to her. I'm really weary about calling her back because she has paparazzi following her around all the freaking time and the last thing I need in my life is for my face to be plastered all over the tabloids.
She's really freaking hot, she's a multimillionaire and way out of my league. There is no chance in hell of Hollywood ever accepting us as a couple and I most likely would be referred to as her boy toy because she's five years older than me.

21,"Am I one of these stereotypical ""nice guys""?

I like being nice and kind to people. I like helping others. I like to take time out of my day to just sit and listen to people and help them with their problems where possible. I like being friendly to other people.

I do all the above to women as well. I don't do it because I've got a sexual or romantic ulterior motive, even if I'm attracted to them, I just simply enjoy being kind and considerate. I respect women and don't try to push their buttons or objectify them. I feel good about myself when I'm nice and helpful to others. Seeing other people smile is delightful.

I'm not a virgin and can pull, but I've never had a girlfriend and the majority of the time I'm rejected because I'm ""too nice"" (granted last time I tried asking someone out was two years ago). I think I'm attractive(?) but I don't know about relationship material.

I wouldn't call myself a pushover. I'm popular, and I can take charge and act confident.

A while back my friends suggested that I should become meaner and more ""bad"" to help improve my game. But I don't know about changing who I am. I like myself. On the other hand I don't want to be alone forever endlessly getting stuck in the friendzone. I'm lonely. I want someone to open my heart to.

Maybe I'm just insecure.

31,"Some background context might be needed. I'm a male, who is interested in my female roommate. Before we moved in together we were coworkers, I had a crush on her then, but figured nothing would happen so I gave up the idea of dating her. When we moved in, I saw the guys she would date, and noticed I don't fit her type. But now I'm starting to get feelings again. She's pretty much my only friend outside of work now, we get drinks at a nearby bar, talk about things. I've told her some stuff that I hide from most people, like still being a virgin. I feel very comfortable around, and I think she feels the same way. 

Now to the current issue. She's been seeing a guy she really likes for a few months now. He will be leaving for a year and a half (military), so she says they'll go with a long distance relationship. Now, he already cheated on her once near the start of their relationship. She came home crying when she found out (so I hate her BF for that but for other reasons too), so I can't help but think that he's just going to cheat on her again; and she must know that, right?

She has said once her BF leaves, she'll have a ton of free time because she doesn't have a ton of friends (more than me, but still not many). And that she wants to hang out with me more often. 

I really like hanging out with her and would like to hang out with outside of getting high together or going to a bar for a few drinks. But, I just know doing that is going to make me like her even more, but I don't know if she will ever return those feelings.

I've always just been a friend, I never try to pursue any female friend I have(I think that might be an issue for a professional to deal with), and that has put me in a position of a 25 year old virgin.  I want to be a friend and hope the best for her, but I'm also tired of being too passive (I think that's the right word) all the time. But at the same time, I don't want to feel like a scumbag by trying to pursue someone who I know is in a relationship.

32,"I'm studying Physics in Germany and am already one year into my Master's. I've finished all mandatory courses and apart from needing some more credits, I am supposed to start my **one-year** thesis in October. I very much fell out of love with Physics in the Bachelor's already and didn't really invest myself fully into my studies, so I'm already at university for 6 years when it should have been 4 by now (I'm 25 at the moment). I've been battling depression and some childhood trauma during most of that time and have been in therapy for that for most of that too. In general I think I'm just not a very good fit for studying at a university. 

I wrote a professor that does stuff that I think is the most bearable, but looking at her recent publications, I realized that this stuff is not something that I can half-ass, like I did with everything else. I guess I'm a clever guy, because I didn't really had to invest myself to get this far, but I am certain that this is not enough for a one-year full-time thesis in theoretical physics (which is the track I chose for the Master's). 

I just feel like Physics is not really stimulating enough for me. Certainly not in the right ways. I'm lacking tangible results (""I made that"") and visible impact in the lives of people. So mostly when I should by investing time in my studies, especially when I feel particularly bad about it, I have some idea for a programming project to work on and go super deep on that. It's mostly game development related things (tools, engines and games of course). I always knew that this is what I wanted to do (I've been doing it as a hobby for about 10 years now), but I chose the Physics degree when I started, because I found both Physics and CS very interesting, but I also thought that it's way easier to learn CS on your own, than it is to learn Physics. But all that also implies that I will barely learn anything that helps me in my future job.

My therapist tells me I should try to get the Master's since I will probably always have this problem of wanting to do something on my own - Something I care about. And a Master's will get me into a position easier where I can make decisions myself or get a job that is interesting and meaningful to me enough to not make me want to spend my time differently. 

I'm afraid that spending all my time on a subject I don't care about really is just too hard and I will not make it. I have a game project going for the last 8 months and I believe I can just quit that and that will most certainly be to the detriment of my thesis.

Also a Master's has a different significance here, since we don't have a Bachelor/Master-system for a long time. Formerly the only university degree you could get was a 5-year degree, so many people do not acknowledge a Bachelor's alone as a real, full university degree.

**kinda tl;dr**: In general I'm bad at university stuff, Physics annoys me, I only need my thesis, but there is no way I can half-ass a one-year full-time thesis in theoretical Physics, like I did everything else. I'm sure I want to make software, most probably games and I'm sure that degree will not teach me much that helps me with my job in the future. I'm 25 years old already and I'm afraid to be almost 30 when I start working full-time. Is that piece of paper with ""Master of Science"" really worth it?",04Sep2017,1

But the other day I was hanging out with her at her house, and she started making moves on me and one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. I was unimaginably excited but really nervous. When I first took my clothes off I kept automatically covering my junk with my hands. I was really awkward. But she knew I was virgin and she was patient with me which I appreciated. I won't go into all the specifics but it ended up going well. I came quick though which I was embarrassed about but she said it was okay. 

Ever since it's happened I've had this really weird feeling of guilt overwhelming me. I've even cried a few times. But I have no idea why I feel this way. Do you guys have any ideas?",04Sep2017,1
36,"Hi Reddit. I'll try to make a long story short. I'm in a position at the moment where I don't need to work, but I still want to do something positive with my life.  

I have been involved in sports as a child.. mostly swimming and running. I also personally struggle with sever major depression and a number of other things.

Exercise has always helped my mental state, so there's quite a few reasons why I want to do this. I started thinking about the struggles I go through and would like to help other people who go through the same thing. 

The things I can think of at the moment is charity work or starting my own foundation so I can raise awareness. If that's not possible, looking for sponsors..? Not entirely sure. 
Would I have to go door to door in the community and tell my story or what? 
How would I approach something like this? 

Please help Reddit. This would be something great for me to work on. Thank you much for your tips, help and suggestions.",04Sep2017,3
38,So I'm a freshman at a university which I just started however I'm miserable not from classes or anything but from living on campus. The whole dorming and living on campus thing just isn't for me. However my father believes this is the only way that I could get a degree. Me and my father have never really been close so any advice on how to sit him down and just talk to him would be much appreciated. Money is not an issue in this situation I would have been able to graduate debt free from universities much more expensive from the one I attend currently which is roughly 28 thousand a year. ,04Sep2017,1
40,"Gonna cut to the chase - last year in tech class, we had a teacher that trusted us to work on our projects independently. One guy and I were in the back of the room, computers  facing away from the rest of the class. I introduced this guy, who seems to be a friend, to.... y'know. Stuff. That was back in February. I assumed nobody found out, since the only eyewitness was just as guilty. I thought I was home free, especially since I used Incognito and a Google Chrome App Store VPN - Betternet, I believe. It no longer works, but I used it when it did. A few months later, one teacher mentioned in passing that the school records keystrokes. Ever since, I have been very paranoid about getting caught. Since then, my off-topic school computer usage has been limited to cheap web games and Reddit. And that's when I'm not doing actual work. But I'm worried - if the school can find out what I do, or if my friend chickens out and trys to bust me, how do I stand under the radar?

43,"I'm an 18 year old university student and I kind of want to try out Tinder, not even for hook ups but just for some laughs and to have interesting conversations.

In highschool I never really flirted with girls, and I figure trying tinder first will help me relate to women on a sexual level.

Thing is I'm not super attractive and I feel like I can never take a good photo of myself. I don't feel like I'm repulsively ugly or anything, but I don't know how I'd react to going on Tinder and the only matches I get are extremely unattractive women and obese women. I understand Tinder is literally just window shopping for sex, but I've worked hard to get into good shape both physically and mentally and am worried that a very negative experience would hurt that progress I've made.

Is it worth a shot anyway?

45,"I have a roommate I've lived with for almost 2 years and he has a bad habit of taking my alcohol and food, despite the fact I share with him a lot. I make it perfectly clear to not drink or eat certain things of mine, and have even had him take liquor out of my room when I was out of town. He will replace it, but usually only after I've found out and confronted him about it. It makes me feel like he values my wishes so little about my own property that I buy with my own money, and he just seems to not care or not understand it. Lately, he is stating it's because I'm a female and ""not a bro"" about things and that's why I'm upset, if I was a dude, it would be no big deal to take beer and food and just replace it later. I just want him to not take my stuff to begin with, and if I'm asleep then it would just be off limits, right? I've made it very clear when I want stuff left alone, and when I share stuff I let him know exactly what and how much. I never take anything of his without asking, ever. And what sucks is everything in the house we rent except what is in his bedroom, is mine. All my furniture, dishes, cookware, etc that I share and he says I have a problem with sharing (what?). He managed to ruin two of my pots and break my cutting board from what he claims was carelessness and that was a huge fight to just get him to replace them. The tough thing is he is my ex from a few years back, we lived together then and I never had these issues. Now he is gay and we stayed basically best friends for 7 years. I don't want to ruin a friendship but he just looks at me like I'm crazy for wanting the stuff I buy to stay mine and not taken to be replaced when he feels like it. Even if he replaced it before I noticed, it just feels wrong of him to take it to begin with especially knowing how I feel about it. I need help and to see if I really am over reacting just because I'm female.",04Sep2017,1
46,"Okay this is a relationship post thingy so if you don’t like that just don’t read this. To start I’m 19 year old male. I’m in the middle of college and I still have yet to have a girlfriend, kiss a girl, or, obviously, have sex. 

There were moments during this year where I didn’t care. I had the mentality of “when it happens it happens.” Recently though, I noticed that all of my friends, coworkers, and other individuals constantly talk about how happy their significant other makes them and just how happy they are. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for them and happy that they are having great success in their relationships. The thing is it makes me feel shitty when I realized I have no experience with that happiness. 

The more I hang out with them, the more they talk about their awesome relationship and the more I pretend to be happy when in reality I’m not. I consider myself a decently social person. I have a great group of friends and I rarely have problems making friends and meeting new people. The problem is that I never felt like I have been flirted with, never been complimented in terms of looks, or even attracted any sort of girl in some way. Sometimes I think I look great. I take good care of myself in terms of looks and hygiene. Other times though I feel like shit and think I’m unattractive. I work out and more often than not have a positive outlook on life, but when I think about how lonely I am, I start feeling down in the dumps. The other day I felt like I was having a panic attack knowing that I may end my teen years without any relationship experience (kids, sex and what not). Am I crazy or stupid or petty to think this way? Should I just focus on more important things? There have been so many awesome things happening to me this year that, frankly, many would love to have and experience, but this thought of being lonely seems to overshadow everything else. I just want to be happy, but I feel like I can’t. 

I don’t know where else to post this, and to be honest, I just want somebody to tell me it’s going to be okay. 

TL;DR: I’m 19 and I have shit worth of relationship experience and I recently had a minor panic attack because I may not even have my first kiss/relationship before I hit 20.  I’m a stupid, crazy, or rational?",04Sep2017,1
47,"I just graduated high school, I want to move out but I have to pay rent and all other expenses for my father. He has no job (hasn't had one in years), he is very overweight which physically limits him, and makes working most jobs impossible. He's already taken advantage of welfare, and since I am now over 18, he doesn't get any more money from the government. 

I am incredibly unhappy here and my girlfriend broke up with me because of my situation. I can't just leave my dad without anything, to be homeless and disabled. I don't want to spend my entire life here with my dad. I can't afford to pay his rent and mine if I were to move out. He's 54, barely has any experience working in the U.S.

Is there anything I can do? If this isn't the right sub for this kind of post, could someone please direct me to another. Thank you so much

This particular college is close to 30k a year probably raking up a 120k in student loans total and a local college would be close to 10k or something similar for the same degree,I also wouldn't qualify for any finical aid and also this college doesn't give much scholarships so that isn't an option.

50,"I have enjoyed living life at my own pace this summer, and being able to better choose who I want to be around. Now that I'm going back, I feel like I'll have less control over my life, and I'll be forced to deal with people I really want to barely see and be thrust back into drama I want nothing to do with anymore. I'm going to be going from high rolling to babysitting again. 

I am neutral on seeing my classmates in my program, they are at least tolerable to be around. But I don't want to see any of my former coworkers at the diversity initiative where I work, but am going to quit very soon. I'm almost 23 years old, I will be working with kids who were in middle school when I was a legal adult, and they still cause drama and play games like they are in middle school. I don't feel on the same page as them anymore; there is always talking behind people's back about who's problematic for what really at the end of the day small behavior, there is poor communication and no one really tells you if there is any serious issues. In my old group there was always infighting since there was never any proper communication, at first I thought it was the people who did wrong things but now I think its just poor communication. They start big commotions over someone doing something exactly not to their liking, if you aren't 100% ""pure"" you are evil and problematic and an alt right nazi. 

I don't want to go back to my student house. Not only is it dilapidated, my one roommate from the diversity organization never cleans up after herself and the house always has roaches and rats because of it. She blames it on being depressed but it affects me and my other roommate from my program, who has no idea how to work a vacuum and has panic attacks when she even sees a tiny mess. I feel like I'm babysitting them both. The only reason anything gets cleaned and the roaches get any taken care of is because I actually give a shit. I tried telling them to do it, but it never got done and I got fed up with living in a roach infested pigsty. 

The diversity one also invites her friends from the initiative to stay in our house , which I have a hard time saying no to because they are honestly in some rough places. But I don't know how compatible I am with them as roommates. Sometimes 4 or 5 people are crammed into a three bedroom flat and I would look like a dick if I said no.

Really, the only people I'm looking forward to seeing are my friends I game and watch anime with, my ex who I'm still really close with and the guy I currently like who I've had feelings for for the last 9 years. Since my best friend and longest friend go to different schools, they're the best I got and the only people I feel I can be myself around, without having to monitor if I'm ""problematic"" or doing a ""microaggression"" or not and split hairs. It's tiring to self monitor all the time, and feel like your always being watched, which is why I'm often cranky at school apart from being essentially forced to live in a pigsty. Everyone in the diversity group is either a fuckwit or a giant baby, at the very least my ex isn't a fuckwit and guy I currently like isn't a giant baby.  At least my ex doesn't chew me out over using the wrong kind of word or using a term that went out of vogue. At least my ex doesn't hold me to a standard of moral perfection, since he's seen every one of my flaws laid bare and I've seen everyone of his. At least I can have an honest relationship with him and not one based on talking behind people's backs and doing things to save face instead of a genuine concern.

In fact, guy I like is kind of why I saw the diversity group is full of dipshits, he's a cishet white man and I realised that the idea that cishet white men are all privileged evil oppressors that can only be wrong and evil that the diversity people all hold to be gospel is full of shit. He made me realize all that drama is full of shit. He's a much more mature, interesting, moral and beautiful person than any of the diversity people can ever hope to be. I'd rather spend a minute with him than an hour with any of them. He's been away during the summer for internship but I really hope he is coming back. 

At the very least this is my final year, but I've had enough of this stupid campus, enough of this dilapidated house and infantile roommates, and most certainly enough of all the drama and deceit. I am never a happy camper when I'm at school, unless I'm with my anime/gaming friends, ex or crush. 

How do I survive my last year? How can I get through this with my dignity, and patience, already worn thin, intact? I don't want to make enemies with the diversity people I just want to quit gracefully and keep my distance while spending as much time at home/with people I actually care about as possible. How do I continue living on my own terms?",04Sep2017,3
52,"Long story short as can be is that I am a 19yo male and my mother resents me not just for the stupid bullshit ive pulled before but mainly because of things like my being born was the reason she HAD TO stay with my abusive biological father even though she kicked him out before i was 2yo. That and she resents me because I look like my biological father. She is usually quite toxic and hateful and aggressive but here lately she has been far worse than she has ever been before. And now my little 10yo brother is literally treating me the exact same way as my birth mother. Same words, accusations, and even insults to a perfect T. I have no job, no car, no friends period and no family who gives a shit about me. I just don't know what to do anymore. All I know is that I can't keep doing this.

53,"When I was younger I was very sociable and outgoing. I had tons of friends, got girls easily and was generally liked by most people I met. Then I abused drugs for an extended period of time, and while I never stole from people, and only lied about my addiction, it ruined all my relationships because I stopped caring. 

I have stopped using drugs for quite a while now, at least the serious ones. I still smoke weed on occasion, although it's fairly rare like once or twice a month. I'll drink at social events though. 

Anyway, since quitting the drugs I slowly but surely became sociable again, but I lost all my confidence. I look pretty much the same as I did when I was 18, and fortunately the drugs didn't effect my looks beyond losing color in my face (which has come back since being clean). I don't make jokes with people anymore like I used to, probably because I lack the confidence of them landing, or when I was younger, I didn't care if they landed because I knew they were funny to me. 

I just find it hard to really care about other people or anything they are saying. I get extremely bored when they are talking. I don't want to feel that way though. I want to be interested in other people so I can form relationships with them again. I want to care about the women I talk to beyond getting between their legs. I just feel like all the years of drug abuse absolutely killed any form of sympathy or empathy I had inside of me, as well as a lot of my other emotions. I generally just don't care about anything. I'm not a psychopath or anything like that, because I *used* to have these emotions. But I just don't have them anymore. I have been on anti-depressants for a few weeks, and it has helped a little bit in terms of being able to actually get up and do things right away when I need to, or doing work around the house, etc. I just don't CARE about any of it. I know it needs to be done so I do it, but I don't care.

So, I have a friend who used to be a really, really close friend. But, as time went on, he sort of... faded. Last time we hung out face to face was roughly a month ago, despite myself trying (and failing) a lot of the time to get each other to hang out. Sure, he tried to connect once or twice when I happened to be busy myself, but the amount of times he asks to hang out pales in comparison to the amount of times I ask him to hang out.

Anyways, he had to transfer back this semester to go to the same college as me, and recently, he called me up and asked if I could give him a ride every day.

I really don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm being crazy and thinking he's a disloyal asshole, but like... I don't know if I should reject him asking for a ride or accept it with open arms. It just seems to me like he's using me for my car.

I've literally had girls dump me because I ""do drugs"" then they go date some alcohol redneck who beats the shit out of them. Like me popping pills and listening to music is worse than me beating the shit out of you?

I've never and never will abuse bitches. I don't hook up. I don't date tons of sluts I'm waiting for the right girl to come along I'm practically abstinent but girls act like I'm the devil because I'd rather pop pills and smoke weed then go to clubs and get drunk and hook up with random sluts every week. 

Why are women so retarded? I mean at this point I get why people beat them. I really do. I really don't do anything bad to anyone nor do I associate with bad people but I've been single for years cause I do drugs but I  would have treated them better than whoever they ghost me for. I mean I don't really want whores talking to multiple dudes anyway but good girls won't even get me a chance because of this but according to statistics my type of lifestyle made me 80% more likely to do drugs but I don't even do anything wrong. I don't have a high number of girls I've fucked, I don't lie and cheat on girls. I just come from a poor area and was forced to do drugs and bitches all say it's wrong.

Rappers can post drugs all day on social media but as soon as I do I get ghosted. I'd rather be single forever doing drugs snd fucking sluts then be sober and have a real relationship at this point.

They told me to expect paying 1/3 of what it costs to be there per day, every day that I stay. Their mortgage is over $2000 so they are probably expecting me to pay ~ $400 dollars per month. They also mentioned contributing to utilities. Is this reasonable to ask of a close friend?

Yet my roommate demands he doesn't sleepover on weeknights. ( I can't sleep over at his place because he shares a room with his roommate )
My boyfriend and I are never in the common room so she virtually never sees him except maybe when he walks out the front door in the morning.
This apparently bothers her. She's known him for a while and just now says that she passed by him on his way out in the morning and this bothers her.
I really wish I would have gotten an apartment entirely by myself at this point...

What should I do now?",04Sep2017,1
81,"Last year I had this gym teacher that would always touch and make inappropriate remarks to me. When I was doing the exercises he would "" position"" me correctly by touching areas like My butt and inner/outer thigh area in a weird creepy way. I've had personal trainers for my sports position me correctly and it was very professional, This was not. 

At first I just thought he didn't know what he was doing but then when we moved to the health portion of gym he touched Me on my thigh and on my  while I was sitting. He also didn't do this to anyone else I would sit there watching and praying that this would be normal yet it wasn't happening to anyone else I could notice. 

One time he told me during class that I didn't need to do squats because I couldn't possibly benefit from them anymore than I already have. At the end of last semester before summer he asked if I could be the last one out of the change rooms because he trusted me to "" lock up"" and I did and as I waited for everyone to leave he came in as I was getting ready to go. He shut the door and asked for the key so he could lock it. I told him I was just leaving. This shithead moved towards me and corners me on the wall and told me ""that won't be necessary"" , like what Thats not even a good line. Anyways I slid out from his ""grip"" or whatever you call it and ran/walked  out of that school as fast as I could, and ditched gym for the rest of the semester, didn't even go the exams. 

Well unfortunately that meant I failed it , which means I have to take it again. I got my schedule yesterday guess who has this damn  teacher again! Jesus Christ only with my luck. I don't really know what to do or how to face him.

83,"21 male working full time in sales for agriculture/hardware/lumber. Looking to change careers into surveying soon because i love the outdoors/geography. Currently live near Edmonton Alberta. Im from near Toronto Ontario. 

**Current home: Alberta**

I love it here so much. The culture, economy, wilderness, people, jobs, government, freedom, affordability, opportunity are amazing. I have friends here, a job, an education, some support, i know the places here better than back home. The outdoors is important to me for hunting/fishing/exploring etc and do they ever have it here! I have no family here except distant cousins 5 hours away and no home base. My older sister used to live here for a few years but just moved back. I move every 1-2 years.

**Original home: Ontario**

I hate almost every aspect, person and thing about where I was raised. I know Im being a bit closed minded but honestly the people arent friendly, they often dont know/dont care about non city life. I hate the government, the insane laws, the terrible economy, high cost of living, few jobs are low paying, competitive/ no opportunity, i feel trapped and unfree there and ive lived for years in a variety of different places there. The only thing i miss about back east are 1. My family and 2. Our family cottage in the woods.

My dad guilts me a bit for leaving and says ive ran away. I feel bad and miss my parents and sisters and want to be with them but i have nothing back home, not a single friend or connection at all. The tolerable part of back east that i miss is the woods of the north which is very nice. But still so expensive for tiny 1 hectre plots, less animals, small fish, so crowded and full of rich cottagers and almost no agricultural or backcountry industry. 

So i feel equally unsatisfied with eitber options. Dont know what to do. The West isnt perfect either. Advice?",04Sep2017,1
84,"Hey guys, first time posting to this subreddit.

Was hoping on some consumer advice on a recent purchase.

I bought a used iphone 6s for $500 CAD and it showed up with a spotty backlight; however it does come with Applecare+ until December 5th. 

I contacted the seller and they offered to exchange it for another, but also said that as the applecare+ was a bonus that was not listed that came from their supplier, I should also consider using the applecare+ to get a new one.

Is it worth the extra $129 CAD to get a reliable replacement from Apple, or do you think I should save my money and exchange it with the seller for another used iphone that may not have the unexpected bonus applecare?

Thanks!

90,"Saturday night around 1am my neighbor was having party alone, and playing some loud music (my windows were shaking). I normally wouldn't care but I had to open the bar for brunch Sunday morning. (Had to be in @ 9) I called the police station to make an anonymous complaint. As I'm new to the neighborhood I don't want to make enemies. They came by and apparently answered the door to him with a gun (which I didn't know until later). Which didn't matter it was registered (i'm guessing). Music stops for an hour or so....THEN STARTS LOUDER THAN BEFORE. I call back make a formal complaint. The music is so LOUD I just stayed by the window to see when the cops would show unlike the first time. Eventually one did, then another and another. They approached the house ay different angles individually and one officer banged on the door until he answered. They said they had several complaints (apparently I'm not the only neighbor who called in). While the police were banging on his door, I came outside and took a video because I did not get but maybe 1 hour of sleep and wanted proof of the situation It's now almost 4am. I thought to myself, I should text my opening manager explaining my situation (because I was probably going to run late to work. So I sent his a quick msg and video proving what was going on. Apparently (even though he did not respond) I woke him up and he didn't get back to sleep. I get a call from the same manager right as I'm leaving @ 9:10am saying that I need to get to work ASAP (I asked if he had received my msgs) and He said there is no excuse and he only got 4 hours of sleeo because of me and he was one time. So I manage to clock in at 9:20. I get everything set up with time to spare. Later on I was telling a regular about the story and we were laughing about it, well at the opposite end of the bar was my GM ( having a few drinks ). I asked the GM if the manager had told him about it. Basically he told me that I shouldn't have done that because I woke up the manager. Now I understand that the thought of calling in late via text that early is weird but incase I overslept I wanted them to know what was going on. Neither of the them cared I was late it was more so that they thought I was wrong texting and warning the manager i may be late so early in the morning (because i woke him up) The manager blamed me for loss of sleep. So I asked the gm what should I have done? He said there was a way to send a text via timer some sort of app i wasn't aware of. I explained to him I just wanted to cover my bases so I wouldn't look irresponsible. (reminder i'm behind the bar and there are guests enjoying themselves) he basically reprimanded me in front of guests and embarrassed me. So my reaction was just back off from him and ask him if he needed more beer. He asked me about a tennis or soccer question and i replied i didnt know the answer. I also was taking tables and breaking down boxes. Now where it gets interesting is I see he has a fourth of a beer left and ask if he wanted another. He was stretching his arm and said jokingly that ""I'm trying to break my arm"" So Jokingly I said back ""Ohh I'll break your arm"" and he responded No you fucking wont. In a serious tone, and things kind of turned real ugly I assured him I was just kidding. Well he disappeared, and my manager approached me and said the GM wants to see you in the office. I go down to the office and he SLAMS the door and says  ""whats your fucking problem"" ""you have a problem with me"" (he had been drinking) I stay calm and say I would never do anything to insult, instigate or put my job at stake. (I've been there 3 years) He and I actually get along. He is in an aggressive state and coming towards me, so I just stick out my hand and offer a hand shake. He says ""we good"" ?
I say yes *even though I don't think so* 
I return to the bar ask my manager if Im fired and he said GM said if you come back to the bar you still have a job. At this point I'm just insanely upset. Yet I keep my cool, I have bills and also am to old to walk out of a job.

Just a few facts to consider, I have been late before (maybe 5 times in 3 years) I have never taken a sick day, Also I have always followed directions.

My advice I'm asking for is how should I handle this in the future ?

98,"Hey there, this is my first time posting. I realize that the question I am asking is rather abstract, but I appreciate any thoughts or advice you can offer.

To start off, I will admit that there is a mental illness in play here. I have a history of depression and anxiety. It is possible that the mental illness is the problem, but it might also be a symptom of something else. I don't mind you including mental illness advice in your comments, but I also don't want to assume that it is my issue.

I am 22 years old, recently finished college and moved out of my parent's house. I know live my several friends of mine in a house. I started a full-time job in my field a few weeks ago and I hope that it ends up being a really good place for me. I have friends, and enough of them. I have been trying to consolidate my friendships because some of them aren't really quality friends, but overall I feel good about my friends. I have a solid and supportive family, but they live in a different state. I have housemates, and they are good as well.

In theory I have everything that I need in life. Family, friends, a job, and a place to live. The house is nice, and I am about to get a better room. Also, my family is visiting this week and I have been spending time with them.

Even with all of this (and I will provide more detail about any of it if asked), I just feel empty. I feel especially empty when I am alone. I have found myself being rather clingy with my friends and housemates, and I can tell they are a little annoyed. 

I'd appreciate any advice you can give.

My gf thinks she heard their side garage open and close about 10m after the crash noise and the sedan they usually park on the side of the road is in the driveway they usually have their SUV in. 

I asked the neighbor about it and he just said it makes no sense because he got home in sedan at 2am the morning before and hasn't moved it sense. And if her car got hit his car would have had to have been hit as well.

109,"We were away on a trip when the sitters called and told us that they sent her to the vet. She was a golden retriever, 10 years old, and had cancer.
We drove 9 hours the day after, cancelling our trip to see her one last time. I wasn't really upset at the time. I didn't cry. I was just numb.

Then we got to the vet, and I saw her laying there alone, covered in blankets and toys. It was so weird seeing her untouched food dish ... as retrievers are usually excellent eaters.

I can't get that image out of my head.
She was always so energetic, sweet, bringing this stupid toy lobster to you so she could play.

The sight of her just laying her, cast on her arm and alone ... it kinda broke me. Those toys just waiting to be played with, food waiting to be eaten. Everything she once was for ten whole years had fallen apart in the span of a couple days. I honestly feel like that image traumatized me. I can't stop thinking about it, and it makes me feel physically ill.

I was with her when they put her to sleep, and I am hurting so, so bad right now. 

I don't know what to do.

I wish she was still here. I miss everything to do with her. I feel so awful. She was such a casual part of my everyday life, and there's going to be so much permanently missing now.

I've lost a dog before, but she was still young. It hurt, but not like this. 

I'm so devastated. I love her so much. Do you guys have any advice? I just want to know that I'm not alone, that people end up OK in the end. 

There's just this huge empty space now where she used to be. When I thought of my home and family, her image always followed ... but now everything is so different.

I have another dog, a younger dutch shepherd. She's been pacing anxiously, waiting for her friend to come home. This is breaking my heart.

She lived her entire life in front of us, and came with us on every adventure. It's so incredibly surreal and dreamlike to know that things will never be the same.

For some reason I'm feeling guilty over her death, how lonely it might be. I hated leaving her there. That was the hardest thing i've ever had to do. I miss her. I just want to hold her and pet her and make things like they were before. I'm hurting so badly right now.

I miss her so much, I don't want her to be hurting but God, I'd do anything.

Yesterday was Father's Day. 

Dad was working and I figured he'd be feeling pretty terrible, not having his baby girl wish him a nice day. I wanted to see him at work on his break. Maybe have a beer. So my girlfriend and I went to visit. For the most part it was great. He loved that he got to see us etc. 

Went for a beer, and after a little while my father made a racist passing comment. The comment was related to my GFs heritage and the country's social economic divide. (""When I get shitty with the guys, I tell them to go back to their favelas"") Talking about his colleagues. 'A joke'. Not directed to her. 
We shortly left. 

I was left to try and diffuse 4 hours of rage. 
The obvious 'well he's your father, you must be the same' came up. And digging a little more she touched on what she felt like saying to him. Something along the lines of 'yeah, go back to our favelas!? Well my whole family is more educated than yours'. 

I don't stand for racism, being mixed heritage. I didn't defend my father and let her have her rage. 
I felt like I'd be hypocritical if I tried to silence her, and be ok with casual racism. 

I get heat of the moment. But was still said, and its obviously something sitting on her mind.

I'm also trying to make an iphone app because I feel it would be beneficial to learn swift (I've learned a lot of html, css, sql, etc) but all of these things are just dead ends and I'm sick of it, I've lost most/all motivation, espcially when something is going good but then just kinda fades out.

I'm most upset at myself though, these past few weeks I was looking forward to, I thought I would have something working by now.  I get up and dick around on the computer and pretty much accomplish a whole lot of ""nothing"".  I'm trying to fix my sleeping schedule right now, so hopefully that helps, however I just feel so stuck and like I'm not going anywhere at all.  

Maybe its my fault for having illogical ""dreams"" and ambitions, but even so much as a simple job in the tech industry seems impossible.  Every job I apply to get snatched up by ""friends of the company"" or imported code monkeys.  I feel half the places aren't actually hiring but just saying they are.

I really am at a loss, these were supposed to be 3 months just to myself to find something profitable or to avoid the military (while I don't dislike the idea, I have some health problems that I'm sure will cause a problem but may be missed during MEPs and I won't have an excuse)

Does anyone have any advice?  I just wish I knew what to do and I would do it.

Thanks!",04Sep2017,1

I hope this is an okay place to post this sort of question because I know this may be an iffy post and I DO NOT want to start a debate, all I am after is advice.
So me and my partner are planning to travel to Seoul later in the month to catch up with a good friend I made back in high school as he was an exchange student. It’s only for a week or so but all this stuff that is happening overseas is kind of getting to us.
We tried to ignore it, out of sight out of mind kind of thing but recently the escalations of what North Korea are planning/doing is just plain scary. 
We have spoken to my friend about it and he has reassured us on coming over because he stated that this sort of thing happens a lot and he has never felt in danger for the 26 years he’s been there but we feel we don’t know enough about what is actually going on and we are hoping for a better insight in case this trip IS a bad idea.
We really don’t want to cancel the trip because nothing may happen and we might not ever get the chance again, plus we might not get the money back (that’s not an issue as health and safety is more important) but what would your advice/opinions be on our trip?
Thank you in advance everyone.",04Sep2017,1

139,"Last semester I developed a bit of a crush on a girl in one of my classes. We talked just about every class and have a lot in common. It's usually hard for me to talk to girls, but she was an exception. Near the end of the semester, one of our classmates found her on Tinder and called her out in front of the whole class. She was pretty embarrassed and admitted she wasn't good when it comes to guys. I wanted to ask her out after hearing that, but I had no idea how she felt about me. So I made myself a Tinder in order to find out. 

Like an hour after our last class of the semester, we matched. Since our class together ended, I figured I may never see her again. So I built up my courage and messaged her asking her out on a date. She never replied...

About a week later I got drunk with some friends and I thought it would be a good idea to text her, chastising her for ignoring my message and for not being good with guys. It was really douchey, and I truly regret sending it. I never sent her anything else 

Fast forward to this semester, and she's in one of my classes again. Just my luck. This semester just started and we haven't said a word to each other yet. I don't know about her, but it's awkward as hell for me. I don't want us to have to feel uncomfortable every time we come to class. 

I have no idea what to say to her now. I feel really bad about the whole situation. What should I say to her? Are my chances of dating her gone?

I talked to a girl all last semester. We matched on Tinder, I asked her out, and she never replied. I got drunk and texted her something mean.

146,"Last night my SO's dad, in a drunken almost rage, punched the door of our bedroom and screamed ""GET OUT!"" and then proceeded to kick our daughters toys that were outside of our door (where him and his wife put them) down the hallway.  Before that, he was yelling, slamming doors and went into his room and started arguing with his wife. My daughter was in there with her but my SO went and got her right before he came in the house. My daughter started sobbing when she heard him start yelling at his wife (her grandma) and I asked her what's wrong and she was scared for her grandma. She was afraid he would hurt her (though he has never physically hurt her) and was just crying in fear that something would happen to her grandma which is the most heartbreaking thing to have to hear from your own child.

My SO, my daughter and I were all in the room when he hit our door. He KNEW our daughter was in there and could hear him and was awake. When he pounded the door and screamed he scared the shit out of her, and she's now terrified of him and doesn't want to be around him at all understandably. He has been drunk before and has just slammed doors and would argue with his wife and would be mindful of our daughter hearing, meaning before last night he didn't want to make a scene in front of her. 

I immediately wanted to confront him but my SO begged me not to, so I packed a bag for my daughter and I and waited until he retreated to his room after a minute and we left. I don't have any money nor does my SO, no Car and no one to help us. Luckily some of my SO's family lives across the street and said it was okay for them to be there but they have a full house already but  said to stay there until her dad goes to bed and so our daughter can sleep for a while since it was around 1am.  

I don't know what to do. I don't want my daughter is this environment because last night it escalated and he no longer cared whether or not my daughter heard or was present like he had before. To me, I feel like this shows that his drunken outbursts are escalating and it's only going to get worse. Though he doesn't drink all the time, I feel like I am knowingly putting my child at risk here for when there is ever a next time.  

My SO's family has been dealing with his outbursts like this for years and no one ever does anything. They all seem to just forget about it and sweep it under the rug the next day or at most in a week. My SO's parents claim to love our daughter and are grandma and grandpa to her and spoil her and are very involved in her life so I feel like this is going to hurt my daughter now because she trusted him and was never afraid of him like she is now. This hurts me so much but it pisses me off even more because it's bullshit. He comes home breaks shit terrorizes his family then acts like nothing's wrong. If he was mad about something he should address it like a damn adult. He obviously can't drink responsibly and he drove home drunk. He drives after he's had a few beers but isn't ""buzzed or drunk"" like it's nothing. His wife doesn't say anything so she doesn't have to hear him
Bitch or argue with him. His children (both adults) don't say anything to avoid confrontation.  But complain about it when he comes home a drunken asshole.   

I don't know if I am overreacting now because everyone is just acting like nothing happened and don't seem too bothered by it. I grew up in a household with 2 parents who were drug addicts and have dealt with the chaos my whole life. I know this shit will just keep escalating and what's next? 

This isn't fair for my daughter. She shouldn't have to hear when he's in a drunken rage or be afraid of him or what he might do. I don't want to be here. I have no where else to go.  

No money for even a hotel for a day or two. No family that can help or have a couch we could crash on. No car to get anywhere. No money for the bus even though I wouldn't have anywhere to go either way. 

I feel so damn trapped here and I feel like a failure not being able to get my kid away from this house. I can explain and reassure her that she will always be safe with her parents but that won't make her any less terrified of him and won't make it better next time he drinks. I already told my SO after last night I no longer trust him in regards to our child. I don't trust either of my kids grandparents now because if her grandma didn't say or do anything after knowing he scared the shit out of her granddaughter then I can't trust she'd keep her out of harms way any other time. That all means my daughter is no longer going to be allowed alone with them or go anywhere with them at any point in time from now on. That's all I can do right now to protect her short of leaving. 

Am I blowing this out of proportion? My daughter and her safety and well being are the most important to me. I don't want her to have to deal with this and to ever be terrified of someone like that ever again.

Fast forward, I'm 22. I find out he's dying and indirectly reach out. Long story short, he's very wealthy now. He's very apologetic, cries, apologies for everything.

He out of the blue says he wants to buy me a safer, better car. We go shopping I pick one out. We decide to put it in my name. The next day, he finalises it and says for tax purposes it's better to have it in his company's name as he can save $16k over the life of the car. He says it's completely mine, it's a gift to me, but it's a smart business decision to have it under the company.

I am EXTREMELY uncomfortable with this. If/when he dies, his new wife will be in control of the company and I am sure she will take it away from me.

155,"Sorry this is long but any advice would be great thanks!

I met a guy on one of those friendship subreddits close to two years ago and he was the best friend I ever had. We were both 20 but he lived all the way in Sweden and I live in New York. We became great friends almost immediately. We both were ""lonewolves"", had a dark sense of humor at times, played similar games like megaman zero and hyperdimension neptunia, had lots of other things in common and I gave him a nickname which is rare (I just gave him a nickname and it just turned out his hair color matched the nickname I gave him) and he was really fun to talk to. He told me later that he had aspergers and I let him know that I had friends with aspergers before and I had no problem with him having it. 

Things were fine for a few weeks until he said he liked me and I told him I liked him back. I really liked the guy to the point I wasn't thinking about how stupid it is to jump into a ""relationship"" with someone you haven't even known for two months. During the relationship I looked up more information about aspergers and discovered a thing called ""Limerance"" and I started to realize that was what was going on but I didn't mention it because I was worried it would ruin our relationship and friendship.

He broke off the relationship about two weeks later and deleted me from skype and I was so desperate and scared about being left alone and forgotten again that I messaged him on reddit and got him to add me back so we could start over as friends. The problem was things weren't the same. I mean of course I didn't expect things to be the same way like when we were in a relationship but things weren't the same way as it were when we were friends as the first time. He didn't really seem interested in talking (which is to be expected when you have someone add you back) but he kinda seemed like an asshole saying stuff like ""I got over you in 3 days."" I started a temporarily job and he started college a few days after he added me back. Shortly I didn't feel like responding to his messages so I stopped responding to him on skype then he deleted me again and I didn't bother adding him back after that.

Since then I've just been in one bland friendship after another. I posted on the same subreddit I met him on but a lot of the people there don't read anything and the few that do can't keep a conversation going at all so I no longer bother posting there. My social life is better though, I talk to one person on discord, got one person's number from work and chat on kik with the guy that sits next to me in the office. I am grateful for them however I still feel unsatisfied because they don't make conversations fun like my ex friend. 

Sometimes I do feel tempted to add the guy back but I've learned to never add anyone back when they delete you first and if things weren't working the 2nd time they're definitely not gonna work the 3rd time. If I did add him back he probably has forgotten about me 100% and even if he somehow does remember me even a tiny bit I don't need him being a bigger asshole than last time. I've long accepted that our friendship needs to stay dead, never to be ventured into again.

I miss my twin even though he was an asshole but I don't miss him as a person I just miss the conversations we used to have, including the platonic ones.

How to cope with the fact he/the conversations are gone, how rare it is to find another twin and how to be okay with conversations not being similar to the ones I had with him?

He deleted his account a long time ago so it's perfectly fine for me to seek advice here.",04Sep2017,8

159,"TL;DR : want to say no to an ex-boss who's proposing lunch and I don't know how to do it ""non violently""


Context : professionnal


In my job, the name of one of my former boss appeared in a mail. We'll call him Ted.


So Ted sees my name in a mail with 2 others people's name who he was the boss too a few years ago. So he sends an email to the 3 of us, saying he's happy to see our names and proposes to have lunch all together after the summer holiday time. It was 4 weeks ago, and I stupidly said ""yes"" even if I didn't feel like it. I was highly stressed to answer ""yes"". I was feeling inauthentic. I was in fear of saying no.


3 weeks later he makes the same request : ""so i'll be there tomorrow, still ok for the lunch ?""


I said : ""I know I did say yes before, but now I realize that those professional lunches are not my cup of tea, so I will not come"".


I don't like my way of saying no.


You got to know that there is a little history with Ted : I quit the company where he was my boss 10 years ago. I called him 3 years later to know if the company would be interested in hiring me back. He said he'll see what he could do, but he never called back. So at this time my need for respect and consideration was not met by him. But I don't hate him for that, nothing personnal, that is just business.


I think the needs behind my ""no"" are :


- not wasting my time : this guy is so boring, he's got nothing interesting to say, all he talks about is himself and how successful he is, so this is just a pain for me to have to sit at the same table


- when I called him 5 years ago to ask if there would be a job for me in the company, he never called back, so I think that doesn't meet my need for consideration, understanding and being polite/respectful


Would you have any suggestion ? I'm feeling tense just thinking about the idea of crossing him at the office where he's coming tomorrow. He's not a bad person, it's just that I'm really not interested and all my body screams ""no i don't want to do it"".

165,"I need to work full time, work on my family business part time, but unsure of where to go or what to aim for.

Backstory: 

I graduated with a 2 year diploma in Computer Networking &amp; Technical Support in 2010. I took a job as a computer disassembler in 2010 for a year, but quit due to distance between work and home. 

I worked from home as a third party CSR to a telecom company. I had been let go because I wasn't meeting sales quote of upselling phones (I didn't like this part), and I started dropping calls due to my fears and difficulty with solving issues with customers.

After that, I got a job as an outbound debt collector for a year. I managed to collect from people without being aggressive, mostly going through the standard procedures, and using all legal attempts to collect debt per call. The hours were good but I started feeling the blues when more of my co-workers were laid off and new ones came in.

My family bought a commercial property (mall unit) because of some family turmoil and thought of the idea of leasing the property. Problem was, we didn't do our due diligence and there's no foot traffic and is a ghost mall so far.

With this problem, we started a custom t-shirt business, which I transitioned from my job to operate; my old job relocated at the exact time I transitioned

After 2 years, I learned somewhat and managed to get customers inquiring online and by phone, with the occasional walk-ins, but am only just now managing to break even with the mortgage placed on the unit.

I took a month vacation to go see family abroad, and am deciding that in order to be more stable with the payments, go full time.

Honestly I'm not sure I'm qualified for jobs needing my college diploma anymore, and that reflects on the interviews I try relating to my diploma. 

Figured that by reducing the hours at the store, while getting full employment, that would be key to my immediate situation.

But, I'm not so sure about the future. Ideally the business should make a profit but at this point, I'm only breaking even and that's with working late hours  every 3-4 days.

All I know is that I've got to do something to improve my situation. Any feedback is food for thought.",04Sep2017,1

169,"Hey. I live in Canada and my dad and I both smoke marijuana illegally. It's easy enough to admit here on reddit because I live in an area where even the cops are potheads and I've never heard of a single case of anyone ever being caught or punished for it locally, (that and it's confirmed to be legal across the country this time next year lol) but next month I am travelling to Florida and California which are down in the States, which if I understand correctly, smoking pot down there is actually a crime you can be arrested for. I have no plan or desire to smoke while I am away from home, but my parents recently got into one of their shouting matches about me and how mom has been watching these american TV shows about border patrol and letting people cross the border and that if I have any weed residue on me at all, they won't let me cross the border... Now, I plan on being as clean as humanly possible when travelling, but things like my passport have come in contact with the desk that I also use for packing my pipe, and I'm sure my clothes probably have some kind of scent left over from being around the smoke. (I smoke outside. Nothing indoors should be touched by smoke other than what I'm wearing at the time) 

The argument is this: 

Mom says I'm going to get busted as being a marijuana user at the border and be out the $3000 I spent on this trip and miss out on my connecting flight later that week to go meet my co workers in San Francisco for a kind of crazy split family/work vacation and if the border asks me if I do any drugs I should be completely honest with every question they ask me.

172,"Throw away for obvious reasons.

I have a great opportunity to work with one of the top groups in my industry in a training position for one year. It's a very new field that is in high demand and doing this training will open lots of doors. The people I'd be working with in Houston have been undisputed leaders and were some of the first to systematically train new people. It's only one year of work, but I'd have to relocate my family. My partner and I watching the news have become nervous about both moving there and if there will be a problem with the training.

So people who went through Katrina or feel that they can offer good advice, I need help! Prior to Harvey doing this training in Houston was one of my top choices but now I'm wondering if it's worth it. Has anyone else had a similar situation? Should I be worried? What should I do?

The cops showed up while he was sleeping shirtless on the floor outside my bedroom and they told me he seemed fine and won't do anything.

177,"I am a third year university student , please read the whole thing so you  can understand why i am thinking about dropping out of the university. 


First of all , my  university is in a whole different city from where i am currently staying  to be more precise  it is 3 hours away from where i live . 
My father and i have our own differences (nothing serious)  , so he only pays for the university fees but thats it . Despite him being really well off financially i would go as far as saying he is rich/loaded he refuses to pay for my accommodation (as i stated before we have our own diffrences)  . So i have to ride a bus atleast 3 hours to get to my university , and another 3 hours to get back home  . So in total i am riding the bus 6 hours per day . 
Now i know some people may say work a part time job but sadly this is not the US , here we cant find a job without  a college/university degree and trust me i have been searching for a job for the past year , but i cant find one that can coverup my fees for accommodation + personal needs , to be honest i wont be surprised if he stop paying for my university fee's if i do such a thing just so he can prove his dominance .
For the past two years my life have been a living hell , and i dont have any choice other than this university .  i wakeup 4 AM everyday , to  shower , get ready and catch the 3 hours ride to my university . moreover , everyone in the university i am at are obviously 3 hours away from where i live , so i couldn't have any social relation with any of the students there i still remeber the times when they plan something after the classes are over and i just pass due to this transportation difficulties i am stuck with , so yes this have been affecting my social life as well . I started developing back problems as well due to me riding the bus 6 hours everyday . I usally get back home at 8 PM but by that time i am extremely tired from the daily travel  so i just go to bed and get ready to wakeup on 4AM .  this have also affected my studies , i know university was supposed to be a fun place even with all the studying  , but i right now i really wish if i can go back to my teenage/school days . 


This is the third year and i feel its going to be the same living hell like the past two years , i just feel like giving up on university already . I really want to finish my education but under these circumstances i dont know what to do  . i will understand this situation more if my father had difficulties financially , but this is not the case infact its the opposite. 
i really need advice , what should i do ? Should i just drop out and go on with my life ,  Or am i just being spoiled?

178,"So long story short i just found out my 16 year old little brother was diagnosed with depression. He spends every second of the day behind his computer playing video games and doesnt have very many real life friends besides one close friend who he sees maybe once a month. He is becoming severely overweight and makes very little attempts at working on his hygene. Over the last ear he has been failing most of his classes despite being in the highly capable program when he was younger. My mom has started taking him to a therapist for the last couple months to work out what is going on with him but I havent noticed any positive changes in his behavior. To be honest we're not very close because we don't have very many similar hobbies, but when i do try to do something or take him somewhere he usually doesn't want to leave his room. I want him to be healthy and live a happy life but he doesnt seem receptive to any change in behavior or acknowledge that there is a problem in the way he is living.

But I have noticed I feel alot better when i'm staying at my mothers. I don't really know why though. I thing is I wanna move here to full-time because of it. Right now i'm living with my father full-time. Mostly because all my friends are in the area where he lives. 

The problem his my father is a very lonlet and broken man. Even though he doesn't show it. I know I would break his heart if I told him I wanna move to my mother. He drinks aswell.. And I sometime feel that it's because of me being there that he doesn't drink as much as he could. 

But at the same time I feel that I can't stay in that enviroment. I'm planning to start Uni next and move out when school starts. But I need a job until then. If i'm gonna be able to get one I have to get better mentaly and I feel like I can't if I continue to live with my father.

I never saw him as a ""love intrest"" but we just cuddled because we were the only singles there. He stroked my back and I told him that was fine and I honestly didn't mind it. Later on I closed my eyes and began to drift off. We werent sitting too far from the other couple and were lying under a duvet. He joked around with the others laughing at how fast I fell asleep. Although, I was 100% still awake. At that moment I didnt say anything because I was drifting off and was too tired. Minutes later I felt him look over me and look at my face as if to check i was sleeping. He proceeded to slip an arm around my waist and under my tank. He still did this under the duvet so the other two couldn't have known what was going on. At first I felt weird but I didnt think it would go on from there. He continued to stroke my stomach and then my bum. I felt really weird and was worried if I showed I was awake I would make things really awkward. His hand then drifted higher and he slipped it in my bra. He continued to feel around like this and I dint know what to do.

197,"About 7 months ago the apartments next door to me rented to a black woman and her three kids. To put it very nicely she's very inner city. She keeps her window wide open so we get a clear earful of everything she does in that tiny 2 bedroom apartment.

She always screamed at her kids, and on the phone, etc. Her boyfriend, the childrens' father, would also scream at them every single day but I never heard any beating. Something happened and the boyfriendfather was kicked out of the apartment by the mother, and she's gotten worse. 

The kids are I'd say 8, 12 and the youngest can't be any older that 6. I rarely see them since I work. Sometimes they're playing on the sidewalk in front of the apartments but that was mostly before school was back. 

I do hear them, though. Crying, and lately begging their mother not to hurt them. She just screams and screams. 
Just 15 minutes ago I was outside doing yardwork, and her window was wide open. I caught the backend of some issue. One of the brothers (the younger one) was saying the older one broke something in the apartment, while the other one was trying to put the blame on the younger one. Normal sibling hijinks, right? Normally a mother would just send them both to their rooms at worse, or take away toys or phones. Normally kids would be a little upset but these kids... the way they were begging and blaming each other desperately made me sick to my stomach. Like they were afraid for their lives. 

What followed was her screaming, and the sound of a belt hitting them while they shrieked and sobbed. And it wasn't just two hits, each beating went on for at least 7 minutes. Hard. I could hear it from the farthest end of my yard. I can't see a thing in that apartment, since it's two floors up, but I heard it all.

And then after that, silence. And her screaming at them again, mockingly going all ""Please don't hurt me, Mom!"" to them. Like it was okay. Just constant screaming and anger after beating her kids for at least 15 minutes. 

I'm ashamed with myself for letting this go on so long. And I will call CPS. But I need to know what info I should have beforehand. How can I be as useful as possible to CPS?",04Sep2017,34

203,"Hi all,

I'm 23, and graduated from college a little over a year ago. I have a BA in journalism and did some coursework in photojournalism. However, right before graduating I knew that I wasn't going to be a career journalist. I still like writing and photography but it's definitely not my life calling— just a necessity to complete a degree and have some education on my resume. I'd like to do it supplementally but it doesn't interest me as a full-time career. 

Anyway, over the past year I've done some traveling and have been thinking a lot about working for a conservation organization. Currently, I work under-the-table as a nanny and the money is good enough, but I know I can't do it forever. I'd like more stability and to be able to afford a decent living situation. Right now I pay very low rent in a crappy house, but this living situation is not meant to be permanent. I'm hoping to be out of it within the next 6 months. 

I just started volunteering at an environmental non-profit near me (located in Philadelphia) doing some work in communications, but the prospect for a job there in the future is very low. The work I do volunteering makes me realize that I do have some potential and that I actually am really good with design, writing and technology.  But I don't have much experience on paper, and when I come across job listings I might like, I feel really under-qualified. Unfortunately, I only feel qualified for things like internships, and most of them don't pay or require you to be a current student. 

Does anyone have suggestions on how I could get more educated in ecology and doing conservation work without going back to university, or what steps I should take to get my foot in the door at another nature organization? All suggestions welcome.  I've looked into national parks jobs and other US conservation organizations, but those jobs seem to be much more serious and related to field-work, which I'm neither qualified for, nor seriously interested in. I think it would be really interesting to do something like science writing, or behind-the-scenes conservation/advocacy work.  I'm willing to do something part-time and to supplement with something like nannying. I'm willing to move just about anywhere in the US. I have no idea where else I can look. ",04Sep2017,1
204,"So, last year the mother of my children and I fell out and broke up/separated (around march 2016) etc. My best friend (f/33) (we will call her ""J"")and I (m/31)met about late 2015. She was there for me completely through my hardest time. Would check up on me. Make sure I was okay, threw me a bday party so ""you'd remember people still love you for who you are"" (my ex left me in f*cked up circumstances.) But around Halloween 2016 or so we just clicked and started talking more often etc. NOW, she has a boyfriend so let's keep this in mind. But, every time we go to a party or hang out we become closer. About march or so of 2017 I told her I love her as a human and she told me I'm her favorite person in the world. Not much later we started talking everyday and are really just innocently friends. But since about late June I've started getting feelings for her... And so I just keep my mouth shut because she is a perfect friend. Well her bf one day shows me his penis and asked me if I'm in love with her (we were drunk) I told him yes, because it's true. I'm a very honest person so he replied ""well I trust you regardless."" This was early July, apparently he accused her of fucking me two days later. Since then we both talked to him and things seemed to calm down. Since late July our conversations are slowly drifting. I'll realize we are being lovey or too romantic with each other. We went on a trip together in july (over 12 hour drive) and I thought this would humanize her and thus I'd feel less romantic for her. Not at all what happened. We got stuck in the rain, got along the whole time and when I laid down she pulled over and laid down in the back with me. Since that trip she is a lot more affectionate and in the last like 2-3 weeks we have even turned to moments where I realize we are being too sexual with each other both via text and talking. IDK what to do /adv. I love her very dearly as a friend, don't wanna hurt her bf, not sure if want to be with her. I'm afraid to ruin my friendship with my best friend either by trying to make it a relationship and it fail or by withdrawing and her thinking I don't like her etc. I feel like it's going to come to a head one way or another. I just don't know how to rectify the situation. I'm not going to do anything with her unless she is single first and foremost.

205,"So back when i was a teenage boy i have had problems with dating girls because:

1.I wanted to date a girl at least 1.5 years younger than me, so i had to wait until i was at the very least 16

2. I was a nerd and thought i had to overachieve

3. I had a boyfriend who would've probably killed me if i cheated on him.

4. I was a poor-ass chinese vilager

But i'm still attracted to younger girls at 42. And it seems young girls like material/potentially material things (Money,Status,Connections)

And so during my visit to Israel 2 years ago i found a stunning 18 year old girl who didn't want to enlist in the army.I saw an opportunity, and thus, i helped free her from the army's obligations.

Now Israel's society is so disgustingly based on respect, luxury and reputation, that I guessed this girl enjoys the smell of money. This is the first time i've openly bragged (always had an ego but after failing to ""humblebrag"" about my relative successful career i decided i should be straightforward)

And boy did she like it.  She cared so much about the way she'd hold my hand or what suit i'd wear for events. It seemed her own evaluation of herself was essentially my evaluation of her.

It got to sex very fast. She was so submissive and adorable i knew i was definitely going to take her back to the US. 

We stayed for two years and i didn't lose one bit of my attraction to her. I wanted to own her but i tried to be as caring and least manipulative as possible. And our life is awesome. Maybe deep down i have always had an insecurity i need to fill with being someone's master. It didn't matter anyway

But i have been questioning the ethical aspect of this relationship for a while, and while both my primal voice and 10 years of evolutionary research tell me this is biology, i'm worried about her future. I'm going to help her pay for college but i'm an old guy and i get very mad at the thought of the person I perceive as my little pet should marry someone her age at some point in time. Yes, she tells me she doesn't have such plans but I get really jealous.

I'll try and keep this as short as possible. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for just a few weeks. Last week, she told me her sister is coming to visit on Friday (1st) and is staying at her place for a week. Over the weekend that followed, she messaged me frequently and was telling me all about how they'd been out shopping together and stuff.

It rolls around to today and I realise that I know absolutely nothing about her sister (who I may be meeting while she's here), so I check her out on Facebook just to see what she's all about. To my utter bewilderment, a public post made by her states that 19 hours ago, she arrived in the country and was on her way to my girlfriend's place. So, as it appears, my girlfriend has lied to me all weekend about spending time with her sister.

Can anyone offer any advice on how should I deal with this? I'm seeing my girlfriend on Saturday, should I bring it up then or just bring it up ASAP with her?

215,"Hello Reddit,

This is a pretty boring situation but if you could read through it and offer a boy some advice that would be appreciated. So throughout University I managed to save around £3000, however for this summer I have been staying at home to save some money. I have £10,000 owed to me from a family member's will, however my parents are withholding that cash from me as they say it should be used to save for a mortgage on a house. Now I totally understand where they are coming from, however I live in a small town and my career opportunities here are nil in comparison to if I moved away to a city. I have already considered getting a job here for a few months, but I would honestly just rather take the plunge and use the £10,000 as a security pot in case I run into any financial troubles whilst living in a city. I need advice on how to approach this situation with my parents, and possibly what you would do in this situation.

Obviously my main annoyance here is that they're withholding cash which rightfully belongs to me.",04Sep2017,2
216,"There's been this girl I've been good friends for about 6 months and I finally got the courage to ask her out. It wasn't until around May that I started to like her. Well, its been about 4 hours she never responded. She's uploaded stuff on her snapchat story since, so I think I have my answer. It's also her birthday /: I feel incredibly embarrassed. I believe I had a semi valid reason to ask her, meaning it wasn't 100% out of the blue.I don't know what happened, I fell for her and damn did i fall hard. Bitch has drove me crazy over the last 2-3 months. We're both in college and as of right now I totally just let myself get played so fucking hard and I cannot believe it. I've never had someone just not reply.

I've really tried to settle down and just have someone who gives a shit. This girl got to me by just giving me enough attention that I noticed and then played my ass hard. It  all makes sense now. I'm so embarrassed now because I'm friends with a lot of her friends through her. Now they all probably know and it will 100% be awkward form her on out. 

I've had my share of girls and i know I can play them. I know I can get a attractive girl if i set my mind to it-I don't know how to word it but If i really have the motivation for a girl and can meet her right, then I know I can have her like me. I'm just shy at times, and to see the right one that I want to talk to isn't too common. 
I just want to know what went through her head when she read it. its one thing if it was ""yeah not feeling it"" then ""hes weird as fuck

I guess another thing is, how do i react now? DO i even look at this snapchat story? If i see her on campus do I even say hey? I'm not going to pussy and turn my head when I see her but I probably will see her frequently.
I know the best way to get over it is to find someone new but damn has it been hard recently. 
If anyone has some words of advice please help",04Sep2017,1

220,"I'm about to start my first year at university, in Humanities. It's a pretty good school in Canada, and I'm happy to attend, but I'd really like to try studying in another country in my second or third year. I almost don't care which country so long as it isn't in North America and I'm not likely to wake up in a bathtub full of ice minus an organ. 

Problem is, I have pretty much no money. Help from my family cannot be relied on until after I've graduated, and even then, it won't be anything spectacular. I am pretty clever and can get nice grades, so maybe I can do some sort of exchange programme? I'm not totally against going into some debt if that's what needs to happen.

If it helps, I'm a Caucasian male and I speak English, some French, and some Japanese. What are my options?

223,"Unfortunately, right now the place where I'm going to be sitting at the front desk isn't very busy right now. That means I could get bored quickly and easily. It's a good thing that my supervisor said you're allowed to eat a quiet snack like trail mix. My last job I was allowed to do quiet activities to keep myself busy during down time such as homework, coloring, or drawing. On this job I can't do that anymore so, this is a major routine change for me. I also have mild Autism, I know mentioning this will help people give me suggestions of what I can do to keep myself from getting bored. There is one other person sitting at the desk with you on this job, but I don't think that you can really talk much on this job or either.

So my boyfriend and I have been together a year and recently he's said that his feelings about our relationship aren't cut and dry. He says he loves me though. He's started to go out with one of his female friends without me and has stayed at her place overnight. They were friends before we started dating. He has only stayed out overnight twice in our year long relationship. The first time he didn't text/call but I called him and then complained that he didn't let me know he wasn't coming in. Last night he did text and I was home when he was getting ready to leave to go out and he didn't ask me if I wanted to go to and before he did. Advice",04Sep2017,1
226,"DISCLAIMER PLEASE READ: I don't drink or smoke anything.  I am a very clean person, no drugs, 9-5 working adult and father / husband.  These painkillers are just from a minor surgery on Friday.  I'm not abusing any substances.  Please don't misunderstand this post.


So, my question.  How can I continue enjoying activities, conversation and ambition after I'm no longer on pain meds?  I want to enjoy playing with my kids to this level, doing things with my wife on this level etc.  Normally I'm very preoccupied with thinking about work or other things, focusing on stresses.  Normally, I don't want to talk to anyone and am just counting down to when I can have alone time.

I hate that I'm only feeling this because of some stupid pain pills.  Can anyone relate?  Ideas?  Should I meditate?  Will more exercise do this?  I want to change as a person to be more happy and adventurous like I am when on these damn pills.

EDIT: Just thought of a better way to phrase this.  

How can I be less selfish with my time?",04Sep2017,5
227,"So early june I started seeing a foreign girl who was living a state over on a student visa. We got together atleast once a week for a little over a month. She was very nice and very pretty but many reasons later I had to break it off with her. She got very attached and told me I should quit my job and move in with her. Talked about me going back to her home with her. Straight up fell in love well before we even really knew each other. Over this time of us being together she expressed how she was a virgin for religious reasons but made it clear she wasnt against anal. We had anal a few times and there were also times when I would start to get it in her vagina but she would stop me before ever getting far enough to cum or even pop her cherry. 

The break up didnt go well. She showed up at my house at 1:30 in the morning when I didnt answer her calls. She doesnt live close and it cost her alot of money to make that happen. Then she randomly shows up saying give me my stuff or ill scream in the streets and get the cops called. Again at like 1:30 in the morning. And it wasnt like I wasnt going to give her her stuff back? I wasnt even home. Thats what happens when you show up unannounced...

So she got her stuff. And that was that. For some reason I never blocked her or removed her from my social medias. During the time we were together she never used snapchat and said none of her friends used it. But I did and she knows that. So now 1 and half months later. She had tried to reach out to me about how she loved me and she always loses what she loves... i didnt think it right to answer bc she already knew how I felt. Well then this past week came a snap of her holding her stomach with ""pregnant girls be like""...

Now idk wtf.. like we never had sex... unless this is a miracle birth idk how this could be. So a few days later she texts me saying hey im going to need money you owe me from when we were together. I respond with okay but does this have anything to do with your pregnant snap? She ignored my question and just responded with what she believed I owed her.

Not able to get an answer out of her I told her I would get her her money but I need to know wtf. That was maybe tuesday. Now I wake up with her snapping in the mirror holding her stomach. She doesnt seem to show signs but it would only be almost 3 months in. I respond now with a text a call and a snap reply. She has ignored them. 

She never used snapchat before bc her friends didnt use it. So she definitely posts on there with the sole purpose of me watching it. But she is posting on IG saying she needs to find a roommate asap to help with finances. 

My friends are just saying shes a typical crazy ex trying to drive you crazy and probably just needs money. Which i am hoping is truth. And again I stress that we never had complete vaginal intercourse. Unless somehow when i literally touched her and maybe had precum? Idk how it would even be possible. And also if at this point she knows she is pregnant, why not just answer my question and say yes I am... then we can move forward like adults. The fact she hasnt answered makes me feel she is just enjoying toying with my head after she saw how I responded to her first snapchat. 

My friends say block her and forget about it. As much as I want to do that I also want to know if I have a child. What do you recommend? I was thinking of texting her saying please just answer the question and with proof or I will be forced to assume youre lying and block you on all accounts. Thanks for anything that could help.

228,"While going out day I got into 6 thugs that were on some bikes that,you know,talked shit about me while trying to look cool. I turned around to see them and kept going while also looking at them from time to time,and contemplating their stupidity.

All cool until I end up with all of them coming in front of me and forming a circle,blocking me from moving outside of it,and having a dude asking me if I had a problem with being called by ""names"" and asking what I was looking at,I didn't even know what to say cause I found the situation pretty funny but also dangerous.

232,"I used snapchat a lot and had it installed August 6, 2017 and somewhere between that date and September 3, 2017 an update was added that I didn't not install.

233,"So basically I'm a fan of metal, and as I started buying band merch (t-shirts) I always thought about expanding my style to more than just t shirts. I'm not rebellious or am depressed in any way. I would dye my hair and start dressing more thrashy but I'm afraid people would see me differently. I would try to break that norm, but I can't take the effort. 

I got extremly inspired to start wearing ripped jeans. I always had it on my mind and visualized it. And once I got to a store and tried out these black jeans with a lot of holes in them, I got this very uncomfortable feeling. Something just didn't seem right. Seeing my skin through those holes while sitting down, I got this very bad impression. I ended up not buying it obviously and walking away from the store, with a horrible feeling in my stomach. Now I feel very unmotivated to even listen to metal, let alone dress myself like a metalhead. I really don't want to use this example, but it's like masturbating. You have this great idea and you feel very motivated but after the O you feel very bad and just generally uncomfortable.

I want to know what the hell is going on, and what's for me in the future. Please don't refrain from answering. I know it's not the biggest problem in the world right now, I'm just in need of help here. I want to get through my problems no matter how petty they can be. As I said, don't refrain from answering.

234,"At my old job there was a lot of down time and I was actually able to do homework at my job (I know, sounds too good to be true). Anyhow, the environment changed for the worse at my old job and I had to switch positions. So, I basically have a new job now and I can't do anything (especially homework) during down time. My job is only part time but since this recent environmental change is a huge change for me... I need better time management skills to get all my homework done. I only have three classes so, the class load is not that bad. I work from 5-9 pm on my job on only two days of the week. I was especially more motivated to do homework before because I was doing it at work (basically getting paid for it). That is not the case anymore. The only thing motivating me at this point is my GPA and my degree. That's enough to motivate me, don't get me wrong. I just need better time management skills now. Good time management skills weren't as necessary before because, I could actually do homework at my job. So, I had all the time in the world before. I only have one class the day I work in the afternoon and my work is at night. I do have a gap in between when I get of class and work. I work on only two days of the week so, the other two days I get out of class at 3 pm. I think that another problem here is that I just need to get myself into a new routine. I should probably make a new and improved schedule which includes time designated just for homework. I could also do some homework during my fifteen minute break on my job but, not much.",04Sep2017,1

Our rent is about $880, so we splitter it in half between him and my fiancé and I. After a month, our roommate lost his job and was only able to come up with $350, he was $90 short. So we covered what he couldn't pay. Electric was due shortly after, which he couldn't afford at all, so we had to pay $320 for electric. 

He recently found a job about a week ago. We've been asking him for money but he continues to tell us he has nothing. Rent was due a few days ago but our grace period ends tomorrow. We're short $60 and asked him if he had anything at all to help and he still said no. We used the $60 for food, gas, etc. 

Come to find out, this whole time, he's been receiving money from his grandmother. One of our friends told us that he bought Percocets and cigarettes with the $100 his grandmother gave him and he got paid $74 on Friday for his first paycheck at his new job. 

We've talked to the manager/office on what we can do but they said they can't do anything. I have a promissory note saying he will pay back what he owes us in payments, all he has to do is sign it.

Two noteworthy ones are a cosplay i wanted to make, and trying to design a video game.

Now, i'm an absolute novice, both at crafting and programming, so this was a new and adventurous challenge for me. I made a handful of errors, but kept at it, until i was done with the base of the mask. But then, stopped.. I haven't worked on it in about two weeks now.

Meanwhile, i've been trying to learn Python, and making programs to go along with it (I stopped learning before Classes).

258,"My 30th birthday is coming up soon. My roommate recently moved out, so there is a whole extra room with no furniture and nothing in it. Initially I was thinking of just inviting some select close friends and having an intimate dinner, since throwing big parties makes me anxious. However, since it's my 30th I thought I'd take a risk and throw a large party in my apartment, invite as many people as possible, buy some booze, put music on and watch people enjoy themselves.

The part I need advice on is the theme, which is an ironic joke. Suppose my name is Tim Smith. The joke is that the party is a Tim Smith-themed birthday party. For example, in the invitation I would invite people to feel free to dress to express Tim Smith (my fashion stye is extremely generic). I happen to have had some headshots recently taken for LinkedIn, my portfolio website etc. It struck me that it could be pretty hilarious for me to turn the empty room into a museum-like gallery space and fill it with about 8 different portraits of me from the shoot. Obviously the humor in this is that it's such an utterly audacious thing to do that I hope people would get that it's a joke. I have faith that most of my friends share my sense of humor and would have a good laugh at it. Then again, I realize it's a risky idea, and if people don't find it funny, it could become cringeworthy.

265,"Hey Reddit, I'm very very white and I burn easily, but recently I went to Tahoe and in one day I got sunburned on my legs but after that it peeled and the area is much more tan than before. My problem is that my neck is tan and my arms and my legs but the rest of my body is really really white. I don't like the way it looks, and I want to match my tan up. The problem is that m parents are soooo paranoid that the sun is gonna burn me into a chicken nugget or some shit and so they don't let me go out and tan. I would only go to the river nearby and tan for a bit. My mom suggests gradually tanning but that doesn't really work for me that well. Plus, winter is coming. Should I just go out and burn and then have a tan after that? To me it's worth it because I also have acne on my shoulders and the sun would help with that.

Don't get me wrong it's not like I'm not interested in the medical field but I feel like if now when people ask me what I want to be when I grow up I respond with ""a surgeon"" instead of ""an actress"" like I have for my whole life I will be failing myself.

268,"Moved into a friends house last minute but they were nice and very welcoming to my situation. They were in need of a roommate so it all worked out. One of the people already living there got a new job that required them to move. I knew some friends that also needed a place to move into so they moved in shortly after. Both situations sorta required immediate action so all of our stuff is all moved into the new house. We've been here for a few weeks. 

Flash forward to yesterday. I went to go drop off the rent for all of us and she asked me if Judith still lived there. Even past the prior occupant who moved I'd never heard of a Judith living there. I feigned ignorance and said I was just dropping the rent off for a friend. I looked on their website and printed to the application to move into the house. I know they would plan to do a walk through after receiving the apps. All our stuff is already moved in. We are all employed with no criminal record but I'm afraid they may not let us live there since we sort of ignored the application process. I'm not sure how to proceed.

272,"I'm at a turning point, moving into college just a week ago for engineering, and I simply don't know what to do with music.  I was brought up in a musical family with several professional musicians, and was classically trained, myself, playing piano for 13 years now and percussion for 6.  At the start, I loved playing piano, and it was a large part of my identity all the way through high school--I was a bando, and I even auditioned for music, planning on a double major.  Recently, I've just been feeling like I really don't care about playing anymore.  The past few years, I've bumped up my practice time to 2-3 hours a day, and after learning audition requirements, getting a new teacher over the summer (a college professor who retaught my whole technique over the summer), I feel burned out.  Sadly, the issue goes farther back, with such a generally strict upbringing, but especially with music, I felt like I was practicing to appease my teacher, or because my mom told me to.  Music was never something I did because I enjoyed it, it was something I simply just did and hoped I liked it.  This past summer was really bad too, having my life's passion hanging over my head as something I had to will myself to do, and it doesn't help having a family who annoys the hell out of you (literally 10-11 hours of sleep a day during the summer and I still was sleepy and annoyed when I woke up).  Some days it's better than others, I've found i have a generally better mood when I'm around friends, which means i'm more likely to practice.  I met a teacher for college, assuming without thinking about it, that I would continue in college, and I need to know what I'm doing so I can set lessons up with him if I want to.  The music building is a solid 30 minute walk/10 minute bike ride away, which is another excuse not to practice.  I plan to take orchestra for percussion, which I  oddly don't feel very burned out to, but right now, I really just am enjoying doing absolutely nothing.  I also am afraid of time constraints, I really don't want to get less than 4 hours of sleep a night as I did my senior year of high school from all the stuff I was doing.

So I met this girl through a mutual friend. I got her number we texted for awhile then I asked her out and we've been going out for about 4 months.


In the last couple months I have been meeting her friends and have become very good friends with a few of them. Well we were on a trip with her me and a couple of her friends and I overheard her say she really doesn't want a boyfriend right now to her best friend. In that moment I kinda brushed it off as like whatever. 


So about a week ago I asked her what we were and she gave me the old. I'm happy where I'm at right now and don't want a boyfriend. And said that she just wanted to be friends. I asked if it was fine if I dated other people and she told me just wait and see. 


So I'm kinda conflicted and confused. I really have feelings for her and since I got friend zoned I lost desire to hangout anymore. I really don't know what I should do. I feel so down in the dumps it sucks. I don't know what I should do? Should I just move on?

I am 18 and about to study at university. I've got about 8 really good friends from different friendgroups. During high school I could never find myself a set group where I belonged. I love to be the center of attention and I'm fairly entertaining, yet I struggle to bring out my entertaining side a lot of the time. The problem is [and this has to do with not having had a real defined social group I think] is that I never really know what social event is going on. If someone tells me, they like for me to be there, they like me but they don't see me as one of them. This leads to about 2 fun social events per month, which I really don't like. I see these friends of mine who are partying everyday with their hockey team, scouts, ...

292,"The friend I speak of is a rather new friend, I only met them this year, but I know a great deal about their life. We'll call him Mark. Long story short, Mark got kicked out of his house because his mother is crazy. Mark used to live across the country from me and claimed he had no friends or family that will take him in so I offered him, in these exact words, a temporary place to stay to get him on his feet. He agreed it would be temporary. My dad's house has an extra room since I moved out and am going to college in the city so my dad said he could rent out the room for $100 a month and he has to help my dad with yard work, chores, taking care of the dog, etc. My dad is a very lenient and generous person, not strict. My little sisters, high school age, live in the house as well so Mark living there is obviously infringing on a little privacy and comfort and they said it's okay because it's temporary. 

Now a little more than 2 months has passed and Mark just recently got a minimum wage job that wouldn't be enough to afford his own apartment (which is what he should be aiming for). Important note: Mark has no license (he's 19) and has damaged connective tissue in his feet so being on his feet for long periods of time is painful for him and therefore he uses the bulk of his money to buy a lot of weed and smokes all the time. I've been pushing him to either ask for more hours, get a second job where he can sit most of the time, or get an office job because he has 2 months internship experience working for a state dept. of economics; attending meetings, note-taking, everything. 

Every time I start a conversation about going to college or getting a better job so he can move out he gets very emotionally charged and frustrated using words like ""shut up, fuck you, etc."" I never use these words back because I'm not emotional about this I'm trying to give him tough love to get a new job. He also takes it personal when I tell him I don't consider him family, just a friend, he doesn't get a pass to stay longer in my dad's house. He is a very pessimistic person towards himself meaning he always thinks he can't do things. He thinks he sucks at everything and always claims he'll end up in a homeless shelter if I kick him out or don't give him enough time. 

I talked to my dad and he seems to be fine with it so far because he does help out a lot around the house, but wants him out by summer of next year. I feel an overwhelming responsibility to keep confronting Mark on behalf of my family. Another reason I don't want him staying long is because I made friends with him at boot camp and I left boot camp because I knew it wasn't for me and wanted to leave all of it behind, but seeing Mark every time I visit my family sort of irks me I guess. I'm a very introverted person and keep my family closest to me and hate when friends invade that circle. I've told him all of this, but he only takes it personally and ends up crying. I know he probably isn't at his best considering he misses his family back home, but I don't know what else to do or how to motivate him correctly without him getting angry or frustrated. 

I just need some advice on how to handle the situation. He respects my dad a lot so I might just use my dad to tell him a timeframe to leave. A year seems too long in my opinion for it only took me 2 months to find a decent job, apartment, move to the city, and start college after boot camp. He just seems to be complacent with a minimum wage job that hurts his feet and only paying my dad $100. How can I approach him without him getting hurt and with him feeling motivated to apply to better jobs or college? I just really want him to grow up and accept his reality and own it. 

tldr: My friend got kicked out of his house, I offered him a temporary place to stay by renting out a room in my dad's house, now he seems to want to stay too long for comfort. He gets very emotional when I bring up he needs to get a better job and move out. I don't want to have to resort to kicking him out so how can I approach him to motivate him and not make him frustrated or cry?",04Sep2017,5
293,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text. Obligatory ""I've been lurking for a while but never actually posted."" 
So, I have never been good at relationships. For some reason, every single one, romantic or not, has turned into me being a sounding board for everyone else's problems, but the moment I have an issue their eyes glaze over and they just want me to stop talking and keep listening. I have been in counseling for about a year, have a solid friends group now that I'm learning to rely on, and am doing a lot better with all of that, so YAY!

Onto the main point. I have never dated a guy longer than 4 weeks (see above reason) and had kinda given up on it. A few months ago, before summer, I started seeing somebody. We'll call him Tiger. Tiger and I were classmates first, then he reached out to me and we became friends, and it was awesome. Literally, so great. The first time we actually talked as friends was when I lent him a book we needed for class, and he asked if we could hang out. We wound up talking for 7 hours. And it was amazing. He was smart, funny, sexy, GAH. 
Here is the problem. I had seen him around campus and kinda knew of him, and had developed a crush. Due to some personal issues, (again, counseling is great guys. Cant recommend it enough) I had suppressed that feeling and, instead, convinced one of my friends, let's call her Sally, that she and Tiger would be great together. 
So, timeline: I see and am attracted to Tiger, I make Sally like Tiger, Then, Tiger and I have a class together, actually become friends, etc. 
So, one night, he asks if I want to watch a movie. I say yes, and we're sitting on the couch together. I'll admit, reddit, I made the move. I put my head on his shoulder. Suddenly we were snuggling up for the rest of the night. It became a nightly thing, we'd meet up, snuggle, talk about our fears, dreams, relationships, everything. I have literally never been so open with a person in my life. I told him things I would never have felt comfortable telling anyone else.
Unfortunately, I got scared. I felt like things were rushing, I have a history of being cheated on and I knew he was so handsome he could never love me (yeah, my counselor had fun with that one). I felt myself falling for him and I panicked. 
I told him I didn't want us to be physically intimate (even snuggling) because we were just friends. But, problem is, neither of us wanted to be just friends. 
So, long story short, we argued about what we were. Well, I argued, he just kind of laughed and said we could be whatever I wanted. He said I made him happy, and that he couldn't stop smiling when he was with me. 
I got more and more worked up, this went on over like a week, and then suddenly we were over.
I'm not being dramatic. I literally don't know what happened.
I was falling for him, then suddenly he was gone, and I had pushed him away.
Then came summer vacation, and I learned through a friend that he had taken a different girl on a date, but that it hadn't gone anywhere. 
We didn't really talk all summer, like twice tops for maybe 20 minutes. 
Now I'm back at school, we live in the same hall, I see him around campus and I want him back so much it hurts.
He has talked to me once, I was reading on a bench and he came over and sat down. The verbal diarrhea was real, guys. Like, my mouth was spewing out words while my mind was kind of like ""Dear god, what is she saying? WHALES??? She's talking about fucking WHALES?!?!?!""

I don't know if it was my awkwardness or what, but he said he had to go, and we haven't talked since.

Reddit, is it too late? What can I do? Can I text him? Call him? I'm so fucking not over him. 

Also, side note, I don't know if it's important, but one of the big things he liked about me was that I'm a virgin, and I've never gone beyond kissing. Apparently the reason things ended with the girl over the summer is because he said he wanted to be with someone more innocent. I'm as virginal as they come, so.....

296,"Hello,
I need your opinion/advice with this situation. A few years ago, I dated this guy and we had a mutual group of friends (his friends, my best friend, our friends, etc). We broke up after a year and our mutual group of friends completely cut me out of their lives without saying a word. I tried to email, text, Skype, etc. each and every one of them for almost a year but never got a reply. I was so depressed and had to go to therapy. I decided to move on and eventually found a new boyfriend. My boyfriend happened to be friends with my old group of friends. When they found out we're dating, they wanted to know how I was doing. My ex doesn't care that I'm dating someone he knows or friends with.

My boyfriend has been asking me to hang out with them because they're also his friends. I couldn't do it because of what they put me through. They said they cut me out because I was really stubborn(?). I don't know much details about it, but I know it was partly because of the break up. They never got a chance to explain what they did and why they did it.

After a year, I've decided to give them a second chance because according to my boyfriend, they are really sorry. People make mistakes and I was willing to leave it behind. However, a few days ago, I found out (someone who used to be part of that group told me) that my ex boyfriend had a crush on my best friend when we dated and hung out with her without my knowledge. She also hung out with him without my knowledge. I don't care if they hang out together, but I found out that they constantly webcam on skype, non stop texting, taking selfies together, secretly going out at night and deliberately hiding it from me. I also found out that she went to eat with him after our break up to comfort him. On top of that, I also found out that our mutual group of friends knew about it, but no one said anything to me. They all let me stayed with him knowing this secret. 

All of this happened in the past. I just found out this secret after about 4 years and I'm starting to question if I should continue this friendship. Did they ruined their second chances with me because of this secret? Should I give this friendship a try or leave it?

298,"I'm an 18 year old guy, fresh out of high school, and I'm going through a phase in which I'm starting to think I'm not being productive enough with my life.

For context: while I lead a relatively healthy social life with my close group of friends, I feel like I really don't do much else with my life. All my friends are about to start college, while I still haven't even decided if I WANT to go to college.

Now, one of the main reasons to this is because I want to find a way to dedicate the rest of my life to music. It's pretty much the only thing I love and am good at: I'd say I'm an above average guitarist, I'm quite knowledgeable on music, I'm an amateur producer... But I don't dedicate myself enough to it: I'll write a half-assed song every week or two, or produce some mediocre beat, and go back to being a lazy ass. And here is where I see the problem: I just spend most hours with my eyes stuck on electronics: Reddit, Instagram, videogames, Whatsapp, whatever.

Electronics essentially distract me from everything I want to do in life, more so than other people, and it's not just making music: it distracts me from every other ambition in my life: my responsibilities, going to the gym, getting a job, or actually figuring out what can I do with the rest of my life. Say I want to get up and go the the gym? ""yeah I'll do it later, I'm playing some dumb phone game"". I could grab my guitar and write something? ""sure, just 30 more Pokemon battles"". Hell, I'm writing all this on Reddit because I spend half of my day looking at it.


So I'm starting to think: why not get rid of everything? My games, my phone, block every webpage on the internet that'll hinder my productivity... But I'm not sure if the pros outweight the cons. For starters, this would absolutely kill my social life: I wouldn't have much of a way to contact my friends except land-line or letters, perhaps. Second, want it or not, all these apps like Instagram or Whatsapp are valuable tools to promoting myself as an artist or contacting people for a job. I can't just straight up get rid of them. In this era, I kind of need my phone. I've been thinking of uninstalling any apps that could be a possible distraction, but I feel I would find a way to still distract myself anyways.

Maybe I'm being too extreme, and maybe I don't need to do all this, but electronics and the internet DEFINETELY are taking a toll on my life. So I need advice: is this a good idea? How can I make it an actual practical idea?

**TL;DR:** I'm borderline addicted to electronics and the internet, which affects my overall productivity in everything in life. I'm considering disconnecting completely but I feel like the cons outweight the pros. Should I take it to the extreme, or should I find another option? ",04Sep2017,3

300,"So, Thanksgiving is nearly upon us and now is about the time we are thinking of flight arrangements for my grandma in another state. Here are the details: 
1. I am in Kansas City, she is in the Dallas/ Fort worth area in Texas.

2. She needs to be on an afternoon/evening flight out of DFW with oxygen in some form, where she will be picked up in Kansas City. 

3. After staying for a while, she will fly back to DFW and be picked up by her other son, whom she lives with.

The problem: While she can get to and from both airports with rides from family, I would prefer it if I were with her on each flight. 
Here is how that would look:
1. I get to DFW from  Kansas city where I meet her at the airport and get her on her plane. We fly to Kansas city where we get picked up.
2. She stays for a bit
3.I go with her to the Kansas City airport and get her and myself on the flight back to DFW, I get her out of the terminal and she is picked back up by her son and taken home.
4. I get on the next flight out to go home to Kansas city.

302,"Okay so I've got some conflicted feelings about a friendship that I need other opinions on. 

I've been friends with this person (let's call them E) for about 3 years, we met at school through mutual friends. We had a lot of fun last summer/past year but recently I've been reevaluating some things.

For starters, E has had a rough year, a close family member passed away extremely unexpectedly and it was extremely heavy for my friend. I took care of them at their very lowest, which I am happy to do since what are friends for? But recently I noticed when I hang out with E one on one for long periods of time, afterwards I will feel super drained and honestly shitty, in general and about my self. They are a negative person, and obviously no one is happy all the time, but I just feel drained afterwards. Like when we hung out last week, I saw a drunk girl crying with her friends and I went over to see if she was OK/needed some kind of medical attention (she was okay just having a bad night). I walked back to E, who remarked ""you know, I just don't really have as much empathy as I used to"", which honestly made me kind of uncomfortable. 

Also, we had a discussion a few months ago where E said I needed to let others talk more in conversations, which I've tried to work on by not being as chatty. But now if we hang out, there will be long awkward pauses broken by E asking me ""what I'm thinking"" or ""is something wrong"" when I'm just thinking about nothing/trying NOT to take up too much space!! And whenever we hang out I feel like I overthink everything/feel like I'm doing something wrong even if I am literally doing nothing.

I used to be really depressed and the feelings of worthlessness about myself that I've successfully kept at bay for over a year are starting to seep back into my life.

Should I back off from this friendship for a bit? Or only hang out in group settings? Much appreciated (I know this is long)",04Sep2017,3

306,"I'm currently facing a tricky choice and I'd like to get an outsider's perspective on it. Last fall/winter, I applied to an extremely competitive Masters program at several different schools. By the end of the admissions cycle, I interviewed at 3 of the 6 schools where I applied, and was offered acceptance off the wait list to 1 of those places. It is important to note that I am Canadian, and that this school is in the United States (NY). I applied to all of the schools in Canada that offer the program, as well as 2 in the U.S. This school was **NOT** my first choice because I would prefer to study in Canada, but knowing that the program would ultimately lead to my dream career, accepting the admission offer was a no-brainer. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to get the financial aid that I anticipated I would. Without sufficient funding I was forced to request a one-year deferral. I had just been offered a year-long contract position and I was also working part time, so I argued that a deferral would give me enough time to save what I needed to attend the program next fall (2018). Luckily, I was granted the deferral. 

Now, I am wondering if it would be worth re-applying. These are the primary reasons I am considering this:

* Debt... The school where I am accepted will likely cost approximately $130,000 in total over the 2 years (including tuition, fees, and personal expenses). I will be able to personally contribute $30,000 - $35,000. I have also been awarded roughly $20,000 in financial aid. The remaining $80,000+ I will have to pay back. If I were to go to any other program in Canada, I would be paying $30,000 - $40,000 less. That is a significant amount of money that I could save, which makes reapplying very appealing to me. 

* I think that If I reapplied, my chances of getting accepted into one of my top choices would be much higher the second time around. I will be getting lots of relevant experience in my contract position, and I am planning on getting more volunteer experience as well. 
 
* My boyfriend does not want to live in the U.S., but he is willing to move anywhere else in Canada to be with me. We are already in a long-distance relationship now, and I am kind of dreading having to endure another 2 years of being apart.

However, there is one major drawback to reapplying. Ethically I am not allowed to hold onto my acceptance *and* apply elsewhere. So, If I decide to reapply **I will have to notify the program where I deferred, and I will not be able hold onto my acceptance there**. This means that if I do not get accepted anywhere after reapplying, I will also miss out on my chance to attend the school where I have deferred.

309,"Hello.
I am a girl and I am turning 16 in a couple of weeks.I guess I'm a pretty complicated case. But i will try my best to describe my situation.
I recently started high school, and I have many good things in my life. Great new friends and awesome teachers. I have so many opportunities.
But I also have many problems.
Evert since I was about 13 I have been drinking and doing drugs. At first it was just alcohol and weed, but shortly after I turned 15 last year I met my first love and his friend. The first time I met them, they were on drugs. Ecstasy. I had been to the cinema with a friend(a guy that liked me and that I had known from mutual party friends when I was 13. Pretty harmless, compared to what I was about to get introduced to). When we jumped into his two friends from school(one being my first ever love) after the movie was when my life changed.
I was intrigued by the drugs, and I have always had a facination for it. 
When I started talking to them I was fearless, and flirty! This is my chance, I thought. My lover to be's friend told me that he'd gladly sell me lsd, the drug I had been wanting to try the most. And later that night I texted them both and I could tell they were both interested in me and I was defenetely interested in them, and their life.
The more I hung out with them, the more I realized that I had some kind of power over guys. Every one seemed to want me and I loved flirting! It was my passion, even if I flirted with guys I wasn't even attracted to. This lead to many misunderstandings since I didn't know how to turn guys down. I didn't really want to do that either. I felt a power that I've never felt in my entire life. 
This of course crashed with my deep love for one of the first two guys I met. I was so madly in love with him, but still I couldn't stop myself from flirting with other guys, including his friends. I had officially joined their friend group and many people knew about me. I felt amazing. 
Then flirting turned in to sex... I've always been sexual I guess. I daydream about men all the time, actors, strangers on the street, teachers... I had always seen my fantasies as the impossible, since I never knew that I was actually a beautiful girl. 
First I seduced the guy I loved's friend. Best friend. I didn't think too much about it since I was technically still single. His friend loved me and said I was amazing and so forth... We had sex a few times more, even though I didn't feel particularly attracted to him. I think i did it for the attention and the satisfaction I got from pleasing somebody else. But I also felt cheap.
I started doing drugs. First it was weed in larger doses and then it turned into amphetamine. Every weekend I had new guys in my life that I had given the wrong signals to. Everyone wanted to sleep with me. I was so goddamn flirty.
I did lsd for the first time with the guy I slept with and another guy. The new guy and I had been flirting through text and I actually did find him really hot(keep in mind I was still in love with the other one). 
The lsd was an experience and I did love it. I faked an orgasm in the guys couch, just for them to get aroused and attracted to me. I told them ''Oh my god! The acid made me cum, this is so cool!''. They found it amazing.
During this time, the time when I did all the drugs and flirted with all the boys, I was regularly seeing the guy I was in love with. When I was with him was the only time I felt truly happy. I was so in love and so obsessed. 
But somehow he never seemed to fulfill my emotional needs. I found that random guys at parties seemed more into to me than the guy that was supposed to like me the most. I know, stupid of me.
So I slept with the hot acid guy. While still being in love with the one I was seeing. 
Then I did ecstasy and made out with another dude.
I started lying about it. I told him I didn't have any other guys and in the beginning he believed me.
I managed living this double life pretty well. Until everything crashed.
He found out about my secret life, my parties, my promiscous behavior and my, I guess, cheating.
He was in rage and he hated me. I cried and cried. Now my only happiness was in the drugs and alcohol. I drank unhealthy amounts and I was always the drunkest person at the party. No one took me seriously. Why would they.
I was the liar. I still managed to keep some friends though, but most of those ''friends'' were guys that wanted to get in my pants. It wasn't genuine, but I had to hang out with someone. Alone wasn't an option, since that was the thing I had been all my life before I started partying at 13. 
I did mistake after mistake and I felt like I had no control over myself. I knew I wanted to change but I kept failing and failing.

Then my life turned around again. At first it was great. I started hanging out with people who played in bands and I found some friends that felt more real. They partied too of course, and I loved drinking with them on weekends. I slept with two of them, for the same reason I had slept with people I didn't love before. I felt powerful and attractive. I always cried when we were done though. But no one knew.

Last summer I found my first close girl friend. She hung out with the rock band people and we both shared a passion for drinking and smoking weed. She was also in love with her ex and heartbroken. I don't think she messed up as much as I did though but she still liked me. I was ashamed to tell her about my sex partners.
She and I started smoking weed every day in the summer. It was awesome. I wasn't as crazy as I had been, I was more chill. Because of the weed of course.

Then a new weird and destructive behavior started for me. Pretending to be in love with randoms. 
I met some new people, stoners. A guy I thought was cute started talking to me. We started smoking weed together and I felt that he started liking me more than a friend. I did not like him more than a friend but I could never tell him that since I enjoyed his company too much. I pretended that I liked him back and we kissed and one time we had sex. 
Then we drifted apart and I felt weirdly dissapointed when he wasn't in love with me anymore. Even though I didn't even like him in that way.
I started partying again when I stopped smoking weed, and that summer I took three guys virginity. Shall I laugh or cry? I have cried about it, that's for sure.

Then suddenly life became pretty good. I started reading about the law of attraction and I really wanted to turn my life around. I didn't drink as much as earlier that summer.
Until I went to a concert with the girl-friend, her boyfriend, and some other cool people I liked. When the concert ended there was an after party. And the love for parties was of course still deep in my heart.
I went. Then I started drunkenly kissing the bass player of the band. Then he took me home and we had sex. Then he fell in love with me. And I liked him... But I was so unsure. He didn't drink or do drugs or even smoke cigarettes. He wanted to date me but then I had to quit everything. Even though a part of me wanted, it was really hard. I liked him but I thought I liked drugs more. And all my friends did drugs.
So what did I do. I lied. I lied to another innocent guy.
I told him I would quit everything except beer and ciders. I did not, but he lives in another town so it was almost impossible for him to find out.
I started going to parties again when a friend that had been gone all summer came back. We did amphetamine and ran around on the town. One night him and I met some older guys. I was drunk and he was high. The guys had been to bars and I could tell they were all attracted to me. I saw one with long hair and asked for his number. I love long hair on guys. Turns out he is 25... I say I'm 18.
I never plan to call him again until next weekend rolled around and I was drunk again and desperate for love and had no place to sleep.
''Can I sleep at your place?'' I asked. He said yes. At his place I met his 24 year old friend. I say I'm 18. They seemed thrilled to be with me and I think they believe me.
We drink and I end up having sex with the long haired guy. That is the oldest I've ever been with. He was very kind and sweet and he seemed to like me alot. I acted like I liked him back. What else could I do? I felt so grownup. I have 25 year old friends that gives me free alcohol and weed! And they have their own apartments!

I never told the bass player about this. He would be so hurt.

The weekend after I slept with the long haired guy I did lsd again with a new friend in the forest. The new friend got crazy and started hitting and biting me. I was so scared. I ran out of the forest, tripping balls. I tried calling the long haired guy but he did not pick up. SO I called his friend, that I'd met the weekend before... I needed someone with an own apartment, I needed safety. I was so high and so scared.
The friend picked up and sounded excited about ''saving an 18 year old girl on acid''. He payed a taxi for me to his apartment and we listened to music and drank beer. I was intoxicated all night, since lsd lasts for so long. We ended up having sex. I feel guilty the next day. He tells me he won't tell the long haired guy and that this stays between us. I am terrified he will find out I am actually 15.
The next morning he has to work so I decide to go to the long haired guy. I tell him I slept at his friends sofa because I was tripping out.
He gladly lets me come over and we smoke a joint and watch movies. He seems to be in love with me. He caresses and kisses me tenderly. I play along. I don't know what else to do. I keep lying about my age and that I'm a senior when I'm actually a freshman to be.

After that weekend I started High school and I meet some awesome people. A girl that doesnt smoke or do drugs but is still really cool. I introduced her to some of my friends that party and we go to a few together. I want to turn my life around but now I feel like party and sex is the only thing I have to offer. If I tell my new friends in school that I actually like, that Im quitting drugs, maybe they'll lose all their interest in me. I'm the party girl. That's what I'm known for. And it sucks.

I want to stop meeting other men and stay with the bass player. I want to stop smoking and doing drugs. 
But I don't know how. I feel like my life would be so boring without it and I would turn into a normal boring person that's just like everyone else.
This is so hard.

312,"I was interviewed for a position that sounds right up my alley  a few weeks ago. The company sounds amazing and so does the opportunity. I spoke to the recruiter afterwards and was told that I really impressed the hiring manager and that I should expect a offer this week or next week. The position is in another state, which happens to be where I am from and moved away from about a year ago which is another great benefit. I was already told that they would want me to start three to four weeks from receiving the offer, which would be fine but there is a catch. 

The catch is that I am an idiot and made a huge mistake last weekend. I was deservingly charged with a DUI. If they do give me a job offer this week or next week I have no idea how to handle it. I realize that this will most probably change their minds about hiring me, especially with how recent it was. I haven't been formally found guilty yet but will likely next week and will not be able to leave the state until I have fulfilled the court orders and I am not able to estimate how long that would take.

I can't decide if I should be honest and explain my situation and that I realize I was wrong and am working on improving myself. I would like to try and stay on good terms with them so I could potentially be considered for future employment. The only other option that I see is to just tell them that some things have come up and I am no longer able to relocate. Either way this will show up on my background check if I were to apply to the company down the road. 

On the extremely off chance that the DUI is not a deciding factor to them about the current position then I have no idea what timeframe I could give them.

If anyone has any advice on how I could handle the situation if I were to get an offer in the next couple weeks it would be greatly appreciated.",04Sep2017,1
313,"18 year old male, pursuing a career in firefighting. Been with the local Volunteer Fire Dept. for just over a year now and have had some exposure to the horrors of life. 

I think I have a pretty strong stomach, I've witnessed firsthand what death looks like. Without getting into detail death doesn't seem to really phase me.

I met a retired firefighter the other day who told me a story about what led him to retirement, and how until that point he'd thought himself to be hard and incapable of getting PTSD. He responded to a call in which a baby was killed in a motor accident and he held that baby as it died. It fucked him up and since then he hasn't been on any major calls.

I don't want something like this to ruin my career - I have worked too hard in this last year and intend to work harder still, and will be damned if I end up some mental case because my mind was ill prepared for some atrocity.

So it hit me, what if I started building up my tolerance now? I watched the ISIS decapitations back when ISIS first started popping up in the media and while it horrified me I felt stronger for it afterwards - unsure if this was placebo or not.

If I watch videos on bestgore, will it harden me more still? Will I develop a tolerance for such horror that will later save me mentally and emotionally as a career firefighter?

tl;dr: Will watching videos on bestgore harden me and prepare me mentally for the horrors I will witness as a firefighter?",04Sep2017,1

319,"Hello everyone! 

What the title says. School is leaning hard on me and I can't seem to get better. Let me explain. I'm in 11th grade btw. 

Almost all of my classmates can just absorb information as soon as they see it. I just can't. Let's say I'm in lit class and the teacher says to read 5 pages to discuss. When the discussion starts, almost everyone can say every detail about the book. They can say how one thing affects another, or what outcomes will happen etc. For me, I have to read the paragraphs 2-4 times in order to barely grasp what is happening.


This is greatly affecting my grades (currently @ 2.8 GPA) and I'm getting worried that I won't be successful. I'm afraid that I won't get into college or that I will get a descent job. 

I'm tired of sitting at my desk for at least 2 hours every day trying to study the hell out of my classes. I just can't put the information on my head. I have tried numerous things, but nothing helps. Here are a few things I have tried:

* Studying in a clean space.
* Studying in a quiet space. 
* Studying while listening to music (Instrumental Ibiza House/Chill out). 

I have also tried to change my ways of studying, such as watching visuals while studying or listening to audio. Again, nothing helped. 

It got to a point where I asked my parents to take me to a doctor to test me for ADHD. It is important to note that my parents are the types of not wanting to face reality. Basically, when I tell them I can't get the information on my head, they say ""You're just not studying hard enough"" or ""You're not paying attention."" I keep telling them that I study at least 2 hours every day with a quiet space and stuff but they refuse to believe. They just say ""you'll be fine."" When I got the results, everything was fine except for reading comprehension. I failed it. My doctor said that I had a little bit of ADHD, meaning just the AD part (not the hyperactivity part). Weird if you ask me. 

I'm too afraid. I'm afraid to take the SAT/ACT. When I took the PSAT, I got a 1080. A freaking 1080. Yes, I know there are SAT prep classes but I can't afford them. Yes, my school does offer them but they aren't good. 

This is affecting me so much that I have considered dropping out and going for a GED instead. But I'm too afraid. I don't know how getting a GED works or how it will impact me later in life. 

I also don't know what to do with my life. I find no interest in anything. I have taken multiple ""What should be my major"" quizzes but all of them said different things. The only thing that I find interesting and fun is playing the clarinet. I would love to pursue it in college. Yes I know it's hard, but I'm willing to work hard for it. But in case clarinet is not the choice, I don't have anything to fall back on. 

**I don't know what to do. What can I do to improve my academic performance? OR what other alternatives are there? Any advice is extremely appreciated!**

321,"Long story short

High school years..

1) 4.0 fresh-senior year

2) 12 years of pro theater/movie making.

3) 12 years of guitar (kinda stopped playing)

4) Won a national and state basketball championship (only 5'11 and had a ton of injuries senior year so due to height and injuries didn't play college even though I had offers beforehand to walk on).

5) Umpired baseball for 10 years made about $6K-$7K off of that.

After graduating hs..

1) Took one class per semester at community college and worked while doing that. I paid out of pocket no help from parents. Denied financial aid because my dad was behind in taxes.. 

2) Ended up stopping after I finished three classes to work full time at a golf course.

3) Two years later I have $40K saved up and bought an 08' BMW.

4) I am making roughly $25K-$28K a year from my current job.

5) I am a huge saver. Started my 401K plan at 21. Hardly spend money if it's not on food, gas and bills.


That's basically a rundown of my life so far. I am 23 now and thought about going back to school but my current job is insane. One week I clocked in at 4:30am and left at 8:30pm everyday. Some months I get no days off. I mainly work 5:30am-2pm everyday but it changes a lot. I might work 10-13 hour days occasionally. 

A lot of the guys I work with are 30 years of age or older and some have degrees, basically said they couldn't find jobs so they became golf pros etc.. They don't make much more than I do. (I manage outside golf related things and run the pro shop from time to time). Not a golf pro. 

I was majoring in business/marketing, but I have heard that's a really hard job to get. A lot of my friends I blew off because they talk shit how I am not in school yet they are... Even though I come from a broke family of six kids and they only have a few siblings and live off of trust fund money or parents money. 

Bottom line is I am always stressed out and tired. I can't imagine going to school right now. School for me in college was studying 24/7 and a lot of memerizing. I know some people are super passionate about certain degrees and have things planned but I can't find anything I really like...


I am pretty adventurous, id love to travel the world or do something different or cool. I have read that there are odd jobs out there where you could make $70K-$100K a year for being an elevator repairman with barely any education and no degree required.

What other high paying jobs are out there that require barely any education. I am not trying to cheat the system but I think it's stupid to goto college when I am 23 and I don't see any degrees that interest me or could lead to a future. I know there's gotta be something out there that's really cool but I can't think of anything....I am just at a point where I don't know what to do anymore..

My goal from day one has always been to make tons and tons of money. To me the most important thing is money. Money really dictates your life. I know a guy who has worked my job for 15 years. Has a wife and kid. He makes like $30K-$32K a year. Lives a super simple life and just watches netflix and plays video games a majority of the time... He's been doing that for 15 years literally. 

That's fun for when you are in your 20s but seriously I know there has to be ways to make more money without college. Gotta be a way to be successful and get more out of life. Any advice would be awesome!

322,"So today I had an eye appointment to refill my contacts, and if any of you have contacts or wear the daily ones you know you need to have an eye exam to get a ""refill"" or whatever. So first of all, I have abnormally high blood pressure for someone my age and weight, I'm very skinny, but not unhealthily so, and I'm 18, yet I have really high blood pressure, I'm also female in case that means anything. First of all, this lady takes my blood pressure and when it's super high, like always, she just says ""oh hm, it's ok we'll just take it again later"" (never did but ok), which I don't know but I feel like that's not how you respond to someone having high blood pressure, just because I don't look unhealthy doesn't mean you can be a bad fucking doctor.

Anyway so then she checks my eye pressure with that air puff thing. To my knowledge it's only supposed to be once or twice in each eye, she did it about five times in my right eye, seven in my left, back to my right eye a couple more times and then gave up. I get that I have sensitive eyes but if you notice that my reflexes can't take that, don't keep torturing me.

Then she checks my eyesight (I'm near sighted) with that whole letter thing they do, sorry I don't know the name of it. I'm kind of mad and not going to sound the smartest right now. Anyway so she does that and it comes out really weird so I ask a few questions and basically find out my record has it that my right and left eye prescription were opposite  of what I was told three years ago and then at another appointment a year ago again, so at both of those appointments they told me the exact same thing for which eye I had which prescription and this lady said her system said it was the opposite of what I have been wearing for three years. But the thing is I KNOW I was told that it was what I've been wearing, they even wrote which eye was left and right for me and this lady told me it's always been the opposite, which simply isn't true, I have PROOF it's not in the fact that my old contacts boxes have L and R written on each one by the doctor before.

Basically at this point I started crying because I had already been literally poked and pried at like some lab rat even when it's clear it's not going to work she kept fucking going and never even succeeded. She fucking then dilated my eyes after I was crying (not trying to but like my eyes were already bloodshot for how much she did to them and I was so frustrated) anyway the dilation never worked. I have had my eyes dilated and I always get blurry vision up close, but that never happened and still hasn't happened yet, my vision is actually ONLY fine up close, my far vision is completely awful right now, even worse than usual, I can barely see anything, everything just looks like a blurry color, that's not supposed to happen is it?

I really enjoy learning about physics and calculus, but being stuck in College Algebra and Intro to Engineering is proving to be a real drag because I make a lot of little mistakes and math currently seems like a real pain in the ass. 
I'm also relatively good at ""graphic design"", which is a really vague field. I basically make high-quality memes and other photoshop projects as a hobby, but I'm really unsure if I should turn it into a career over engineering and physics. Idk, here's an example of the kind of work I do, https://imgur.com/a/YSIwg so maybe someone can tell me if doing graphic art for a living is a good idea. Thanks.",04Sep2017,1
327,"Hello all,

I feel selfish writing here when I read some of the shit people are going through, but I've felt genuinely out of options for a while, and I hope that maybe writing everything down will help. This may be a wall of text, so I don't expect anyone to read it all.


The long and short of it is that I've had problems with depression and crushingly low self-esteem for a long time, and I've let the rot seep in so far that I've left myself in a really poor situation. I have no friends, no girlfriend, no contact with my family, no interests or hobbies, money troubles, health troubles, and I'm floundering at my job, which is the one piece of a normal life that I'm just about holding down. And part of me takes a perverse sense of satisfaction from seeing the state I'm in, because I believe I deserve it. I've ended up feeling so unworthy of help that I can't push for anything for myself - and that manifests as stupid things like not sorting out my medication after moving to a new city, so I'm currently without any benefits that they were providing. And definitely not pushing for help - I tried in the last city I lived in and was resolutely ignored by the therapy services for close to two years, despite my GP and Psychiatrist urging them for action. As a result, I feel totally despondent about them coming through now, and that I've put myself in such an awful position that there isn't anything left to rebuild. 


Thanks to a misspent youth, I have a criminal record for a pretty serious crime (counterfeiting) that I served some time in jail for. I haven't mentioned this to my employer, a decision that was made when it was preventing me from finding any work, and I fear daily that it's going to catch up with me. It also prevents me from doing... everything. Going abroad, getting finance, and doing anything that might make me visible enough to let other people connect the dots. On an unrelated but still soul-crushing note (thanks to some minor physical problems that I never sought help for) I'm a virgin at the age of 32 despite having had serious relationships in the past.  


I've made a number of suicide attempts, but have never got the hang (hah) of ligature strangulation, and am far too squeamish for cutting or hanging. Now that I have money, I can afford medicinal exits, though finding reliable sources online is not easy. Helium-induced hypoxia is currently the go to solution, though ironically my terminal procrastination has prevented me collecting everything I need. Normally the feelings last a couple of hours - and I'm onto my third day of it being all I can think about. My medication used to regulate my sleep, but that's not happening now and I can barely think straight as a result.


I feel like I've squandered every chance I've been given, and have left myself drift into an utterly shameful condition. And worse, I believe so strongly that I don't deserve help that it totally clouds my ability to do anything proactive to help myself. More than anything, I feel alone and disconnected from everyone - I can't even tell you how many of these I've written and not posted because I don't think random people on the internet need to hear another whining tale of misery.


I'm at the stage where I don't even know what to do. I feel like my minor (in the scheme of things) problems have seeped into every aspect of my life, and left me with no hope of fixing any of it, and absolutely no will to fight for it. I want to end it, but lack the courage.


So - what do I do? Where do I even start? And when my confidence is so low that any adverse situation sends me spiralling into even worse states then I'm currently in, what can I even realistically do to start? I'm out of ideas and out of fight. If anyone has made it this far, you have my thanks, because there's enough self-pitying posts on reddit that you didn't need to spend your time here.


**tl;dr** - depression and low self-esteem has caused global damage to my life, some of which is irreparable. I no longer know what to do, and hope someone has something, anything to suggest.",04Sep2017,1
328,"Hey there, so here's what happened.

A couple months ago the mailman came to my neighbour's door to give him a package, he wasn't home so the mailman ringed to my door and asked me if I could take it and give it to him when he would eventually come back; 

I said yes (first mistake) and then I don't know why, but I panicked : I left the package in front of my neighbour's door and went back inside and forgot about all that.

Now, my neighbour asked my and my dad (I live with him) if we got a package for him , because apparently the one I left at the door was damaged, and I lied and said I didn't know anything about it. 

Tonight my neighbour came at my door and told me the mailman told him I took it for him , and , even worse, that I signed. Again, I lied and said I didn't take any package.

Now, I don't remember signing anything, but I could be mistaken, because I don't remember so well that day.

So now my neighbour is going to file a complaint to the company who delivered the package, and if they actually have my signature i'm in trouble, I think.


So what should I do in this situation? In the worst case, what am I accountable for? Should I tell my neighbours? Or, if they don't actually have my signature, am I golden?



P.S. I'm pretty sure my neighbour is trying to take advantage of the situation too, because the first time he asked he told me the package was damaged, and tonight he told me it never arrived, so he may be pushing this thing just to get free stuff or a refund.

P.P.S I really hate my neighbour. He's racist and I'm pretty sure he beats his wife and daughter, I have no simpathy for him and I don't fancy the idea of telling him everything 

Thanks for any advice you can give me",04Sep2017,1
329,"I've been teaching first grade for 4 years now. I don't hate it, but I definitely don't love it. The increasing demands of test scores and data from administrators, and the lack of support from parents is making my job next to impossible. I'm at the point that I need to document my every move and be able to justify every decision that I make just to cover my ass. Changing grade levels won't solve the problem. 

What kind of careers could I be qualified for with an education degree? Any former teachers out there that could weigh in? ",04Sep2017,1

I met this girl online and we had a lot of similar interests. Long story short we ended up being in the same class but I was too shy to say anything, so wound up keeping to myself for the first day. She didn't seem to approach me so I just let it be. We kinda saw each other in the halls but I kept to myself bc I thought she wasn't interested. A week passed and I decided to message her, I said something like, hey I saw you in class. Or something really dumb. She still didn't reply, but before that changed her status (i messaged her after she changed her status). Should I even bother saying anything now. I pretty sure she's not even interested since she didn't say hi or respond at all. Honestly, i'm sad. ",04Sep2017,5
334,"*Disclaimer* This is NOT a political conversation about blackface. It's something that I need advice on how to tackle. Looking for actual advice on how to overcome possible problems in the future.

When I was an arts student at my university a show was put on with a role traditionally played by a black person (supposed to be cast that way if possible, but only white people auditioned). After getting the role I made an offhand joke about making me do it in blackface. Fast forward to the day the makeup kits showed up and wouldn't you know... they expected it. I was young and naive and was assured that ""it's not like you're doing Al Jolson"" which was true. The role didn't have stereotypical actions and the makeup wasn't white lips and palms; my skin was fully covered in a ""decent"" shade. Anyway, I stupidly agreed.

As the show was wrapping up we did a community program and a school with a lot of black students came and I felt REALLY bad at that point. Especially when they came up to talk to me after the show expecting a black person. I hid. I am still ashamed and these feelings and emotions are especially high right now.

The long and the short of it is that there are pictures and I don't want it to affect my performing career or friendships. I don't know what to do and am incredibly remorseful. Do I get ahead of it and post something about how I was part of the problem? Do I hire a PR person to figure it out? Do I cover it up? I am at a loss here.

TL;DR: I stupidly agreed to do blackface for a show in college and feel bad and need possible PR help.

335,It started when my mom would stare at my forehead while we talked. It made me really uncomfortable and i hated talking to her sometimes because of it. Then I noticed I started doing it too to other people. I only noticed bc of how they would act while talking to me. I hate that i keep doing this because I know how powerful direct eye contact is. Something so small has made me hate social interactions. So my question is does anyone also have this problem and/or gotten over it somehow?,04Sep2017,2
336,"-Currently have a part time job
-Just finished 2nd year of college and looking for an apprenticeship
-I have pretty bad social anxiety
-Terrified of losing my friends and being alone (perhaps overthinking this a bit)

Everyone I work with is a pretty close friend of mine since i started working there. If i get an apprenticeship, i will have to drop this part time job and leave all of those friends behind. I would love to meet up with them or something if i do drop the job but my anxiety makes me not want to go to clubs/parties (they do a lot of that stuff) 

My best friends (small group of friends) that i went to college/school with have all gone on to university and i didnt want to take that path so im looking for an apprenticeship. I struggled to keep in contact with some of my college friends and now i only regularly speak to 2 or 3 of them and only text 1 or 2 of them. 

If i get an apprenticeship in a financial sort of area, im genuinely worried that i'll never come across people as entertaining/interesting as the people in my current part time job and i'll struggle to make friends with them as they'll all be a lot older than me and eventually i'll be stuck with these types of people for the rest of my life. 

Also this new girl just started at my current workplace, and she's really nice but slightly younger than me. My coworkers are saying they want to set us up together but im not sure how serious they are about that. I want to let this new girl know that i wanna get to know her more and i kinda like her, but my god damn anxiety is stopping me from bringing myself to let her know. I wanna tell my coworkers to let her know, but that makes me seem sorta pathetic and incapable lol. 

I don't know if i'm just grasping at anything i can in order to make sure i dont end up completely alone, as that is probably my greatest fear right now. Also haven't had a girlfriend in wayyyy too long, so I feel like that may be contributing to me not wanting to be alone as well. I've got an interview for an apprenticeship tomorrow and i've genuinely been considering just fucking the interview up for myself so i dont potentially lose the people around me for good.

TL;DR- I really just need some advice or help or whatever, on how i should go about getting rid of this fucking anxiety, or advice on what steps i should take in order to not lose my friends and maybe even get a fucking girlfriend, because god knows i need help with that.

Any help is appreciated",04Sep2017,4
