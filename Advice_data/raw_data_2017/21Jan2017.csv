0,"I'm 16 years old and I'm so fucking depressed and lonely I feel so alone even though I have friends I'm  not as close as I used to be  and I'm too anxious to talk to them about it.  I can't stop thinking about death and being a failure. my family doesn't take it seriously, they always tell me if I get a job or think positive I won't think about that but it's not that easy it just isn't. I'm to the point where I just want to curl up in a ball and die. I asked my family to get me help but they said I don't need it. I just need somebody to please help me. I feel trapped and hopeless. I don't know what to do.

1,"I was an only child up until he was born. He is 8 and we have an age difference of 13 years between us. I feel bad sometimes that we don't bond or hangout that often, because I have my share of problems that I need to deal with as well and that he won't have fun memories to look back on or of me in general.

Growing up, I hung out with my cousins a lot(who are my age) or did my own thing, but I never felt that I had to ""bond"" with any of them and at home I played alone or had some friends over. 

When my brother was born it was great. I love him, I helped take care of him since he was a baby (he obviously can't remember that far back). I, to this day still help him with all of his homework, talk to him about school (if anyone is bullying him ect.), his friends, and in general if he has any problems. 

I look at him and think, ""man he's really grown up fast"". My worry is, looking back these past few years, I help him, but I don't really hangout or play with him that often and am worried that we won't have fun memories to look back on. I mostly want him, to have fun memories of us together like other siblings do. 

We played video games a couple of times throughout theses past few years. He still remembers the stuff we played like 1-2 years ago, but today I asked him when the last time we played was and he only remembered from a 1-2 years ago and said that we don't play that often anymore. Last time we played was about 3-4 months ago which he doesn't remember all that well because we don't play more often. 

Should I play with him more often or force myself to so he can have good memories of us together? Is it to late to create some fun memories with him? I honestly don't know what to do.",21Jan2017,1
2,"Our nineteen year old usually makes us wonder if we're bad parents. Her coming home drunk, sleeping around, smart mouth, laziness. But now she has crossed an all time low.

First of all she got this new boyfriend who she I guess was very into. They dated for maybe 4 months now and things have started to change with her. I have no idea why but she's dressing like some indian or some shamanic demonic stuff. 

Wearing barely anything over her chest, whatever the hell that is she wears has so much underboob you can practically see her nipples from the side. She wears this steel, leather, mideval belt around her waist or whatever it is, and has these small cloth coming down the frony and the back, feathers on it, it's still showing too much skin, and she wears some type of feather leathered sandaled boots, armlets.

Even got tattoos all over her face, breast, body that looks like some type of demonic crap. Too much mascara, feathers all over her hair, even her hair...  I don't know what the hell is wrong with her. We have kids that are scared of her because she looks like some devil. I don't know what to do, we tried to keep her from her boyfriend but she moved in with him, a month later she hated him for some reason moved back in and acts like this. 

She acts so evil as well, when she's watching stuff or on her phones or whatever she often mentions she is going to kill someone when she gets upset. She speaks in her own language sometimes. She also goes out in public like this and although I'm worried someone might mess with her or worse. I feel like she might hurt someone because she acts like she's possessed or something. I doubt she can ever get a job looking like that or ever again with all the tattoos on her body...

What do I do about her...",21Jan2017,1
3,"consumed by desire and greed. I got myself into some shitty areas. Bringing myself down to the deepest and darkest depths of my young life. Hello reddit, I'm 20 years old. At the beginning of 2016 all I wanted to do was be a youtube content creator. It first started with me wanting to play video games, but as you may all know that area is a bit over saturated. So I wanted to pursue the path of drawing as well as keeping up my studies in law school.
I was ignorant and needed money so I went on a Sugar Daddy/ Sugar Mommy website; I mean if someone willing to pay my bills heck why not. Anyway ended up doing some serious fck and then boom I ended up owing someone $2,000 and the bank. That was the first instance that I thought I fixed, BUT NOPE now I'm back in debt and the con-man who conned me has left me out to dry and i HAVE NO IDEA what to do at this point.",21Jan2017,3
4,"How's everyone doing? So I've been in a pickle ever since I finished my degree in December. I can't decide if I want to go back to school or not. I will give you more context. 

I just graduated with a degree in English. As with any degree in the College of Liberal Arts at my school, a student must choose a foreign language to study. For the sake of anonymity, let's say I chose a really in demand language. I studied this language for two and a half years at the university level and was even able to study abroad in the region. However, as I said, I finished my main degree in December, and received a minor in the language. 

I have grown very fond of the language and the people in the program at my school. They are all great people and push me to succeed. And I have. I reached a level of proficiency that could be described as abnormal for the class level that I am at. But, of course, my class as a whole worked very hard, so I am not the only one who received a higher than expected score on this government issued standardized test. 

Unfortunately, I was unwise with the amount of student loans I have taken out. I am nearing $45k, and two of the loans have high interest rates on them. I cannot decide if I want to continue taking courses in this language or just start to search for a job. Also, in relation to the latter, I don't really know where I would begin. I've always worked, but since I am out of school now I would like to get a job that I feel like I am qualified for (kind of elitist, I know.) 

Even if I did return to school, it would take me another two years to finish the degree in the language. In addition, I really am not sure what I would do afterward. My tuition is covered for about 2-3 more semesters (depending on my course loand), thankfully, and I have a job that doesn't pay much but I can get by. I live at home with my family and they aren't making me pay rent yet, but I would like to move out because the atmosphere here is somewhat toxic. 

Assuming I can meet the financial needs of returning back to school, but just barely, do you all think it is a good idea? Thanks for taking the time to read this, by the way. And of course, there is more context to the situation, but these are the basic, most important notes I could think of. If you feel like you need some more info to offer more sound advice, just PM me. Any and all advice is welcome. Thanks.",21Jan2017,1

6,"Recently me and my girlfriend were hanging out and decided to go to a mall. While at the mall ,my girlfriend runs into a group of friends she hasn't seen in about a year and immediately goes to hug them. After hugs my girlfriend introduces me to her gay male friend and a female friend of hers.after making introductions they say we should all go eat at the food court. 

After getting food we all sit with each other and  my gf and her female friend start to converse while me and the male friend talk awakrdly,until he decides to leave. Now after the male friend leaves , I'm immediately thrown into the girls convo about the female friends bf was never wanting sex and how she had to beg him for it in order for her to satisfy her need. The friend asks my opinion in which I reply with a joke of ""are you sure he's into women "" which she giggles at. After talking about it for a little the friend says we should all go hang out some more. Me and my gf agree amd decide to go to a bar.

While at the bar the friend invites her boyfriend who shows up about 15 mins after we arrive at the bar. He immediately convinces us to play a card game.  While playing the card game I get this weird feeling that I'm being looked at, and I immediately look up and see the female friend staring at me. She continues to stare directly into my eyes for 5 sec after I had caught her looking at me , before she looks away . At this point I think nothing of it and continue play cards 

After another 5 mins of cards I get the same feeling of being watched , I look up again and there she is staring again with a smile on her face . Nervously I smile back and look back down .this game of catching her staring continues for about an hour until we decide to stop playing  cards and the girls begin to talk. Me and the other guy are just listening to them speak,enjoying our drinks. When suddenly  in the middle of the convo the female friend gaze suddenly turns to me for about 7 sec and the she goes back to look at my gf . This continues for another 15 mins before my gf decides she needs to go to the bathroom . While my gf is gone me and the female friend are just talking about random  things. ( her bf isn't really paying attention ) while talking, the friend never breaks my gaze she just  keeps focused on me even when her bf did decide to say something, she didn't even look at him. After a while of tlking, My gf eventually comes back, and the girls  start to talk again and the friend goes back to glancing at me hear and there again as well . This continues for another hour or so until the girl bf decides he want to leave , me and my gf get up to say goodbye and walk with them to the door when suddenly  the female friend hugs me very delicately and tells me it was nice to meet you and we should hang again soon, which I reply with a nice firm ""definitely"". After letting me go she hugs my gf and her and her bf get in their car and pull off. 

MY QUESTION TO YOU GUYS AFTER THAT STORY IS, AM I WRONG FOR FEELING LIKE THERE WAS MORE TO THAT STARING OR AM I JUST CRAZY ??? 

P.s. I thought the female friends was incredibly attractive and  would have totally went for her if I wasn't in a relationship.  Please keep this in mind  for it might be why  I'm over thinking it as well ",21Jan2017,1
8,"Using a throwaway since some of my colleagues might get to me.

I've never been dealt a good hand in my entire life, and as such I've just had to work really hard to get anywhere in life. After finishing high-school and working for some years with everything from landfills to web development my dad asked me for some help with his company, which I gladly agreed to.

I managed to score an interview with a company while working for my dad last year. The company in question was working with my dads company and I just hit it off with their CEO.

They needed a guy for a new sales-office that they were starting up in April, but they wanted me in earlier. Dream opportunity! 
As such, I'm now at the company working with something that I don't have a lot of experience doing, but they just wanted to hire me before anyone else would swoop me up. I'm actually getting really good at what I'm doing, even getting a whole slew of clients to manage (right now I'm managing the most clients of everyone at the company, meriting a lot of overtime).

I just began working last month, but everyone seems to think that I'm just there because my dad persuaded the CEO to hire me (not possible because of regulations in my country). Other stuff also, like claiming that my dad bought me my car (08 Mercedes, paid for by my previous job at a landfill) and alike.

I worked long and hard for this position (four years of experience in the field), had several interviews with the company and met with every key person before getting this job and its just really annoying to be looked down at like this.

Hell, I can't even talk about my dad without someone scoffing and treating me like a child, even though he is one of our clients.

Now even some of my friends are starting to tease me about it. My dad says he would never try to force anyone to take me in, and even told me that I probably brought this upon myself.

Im really not sure what to do, and I'm quite frankly getting tired of it. I rather quit than have to deal with these allegations.

tl;dr: Got a dream job from a guy working with my dads company, everyone thinks dad got me the job. What do?",21Jan2017,1
9,"Now, I'm not saying that I already know a second language, but I have been learning French as my second language for a while now, and plan to continue doing so. I may being receiving the opportunity to take a class in another language for free. A college level class. Since English is my primary language, and French is becoming my second language, what would be a helpful third language for me? I'd prefer taking a language that doesn't rely too heavily on gender for words, or has verbs that constantly need to be conjugated with the subject, as that can sometimes be  confusing to remember. However, if you guys really insist that I take a language that has these two characteristics, I suppose I can tolerate it.",21Jan2017,1

11,"I had a talk with my uncle today about poor people. Poor isn't how little money you have, it's how little your desire is to improve.

Ever since the age of 18, I have been out on my own, unable to afford jack shit. Never once have I felt poor. I was expected to not have a decent job, and only work dead end jobs to wiggle my way through college.

Eventually I got a desk job, which didn't make me a lot, but it was substantially better than minimum wage. I was finally able to afford a new set of tires and still pay my share of rent.

I got sick of working that job, I began developing a cost of living that I couldn't keep up with. Car insurance, my own place, my own food. I broke free from room mates because I wanted to, not because I had to. I wanted more independence.

I was surprised with a job opportunity to make even more money than I am used to and I got to work from home. I was able to afford a two bedroom apartment and I wasn't even 20 yet. I was working around the clock making so much more than my peers.

I wasn't required to stay put, so I decided to move to a more expensive area. My cost of living went way up, and I was right back to not being able to afford much. I did get the bragging rights of living in a tourist town and live in the mountains, but I wasn't saving ANY money.

I wasn't poor, though. I was doing what I loved doing, living exactly where I wanted to live at the time, and hanging out with whoever doing whatever I wanted. The only thing you couldn't find me doing was complaining. I had everything I had ever wanted, but I was living paycheck to paycheck.

Got sick of not being able to save any money, though. It's not wise to go too long without having any kind of emergency money, so I kept on with the hunt. Eventually, I got the opportunity to move a thousand miles away and work from in an office again and get paid a salary. I will be within walking distance of my nice office and be living in one of the nicest apartments I have ever seen.

I feel rich, but I'm not driving a Bugatti. I don't have loads of cash, but I am not poor. I will never have money for as long as I decide to work for someone else, but the difference between a ""poor"" person and myself is that you won't find me blowing off the perfect opportunity to better my own life and raise my standards of living.

Don't ever complain about being poor. Being poor is momentary - everyone can be broke, but staying poor is a choice. Staying poor is just an attitude. It's an excuse to not immediately change what you are doing to better the circumstances.",21Jan2017,0

I wasn't feeling good in class, was having nervous tics and the sort (I suffer from anxiety, depression and take meds so will follow up on my doc about that) for nearly 40 minutes and I tried so hard to control myself. Normally every 60 min we take a break but after the 60 minute lecture we were going to take a break.
I went up to the professor and told him that I wasn't feeling good and he told me, 'Oh we can take a break we normally do at this time.' But I told him ' I don't want the whole class to wait for me.' But he said 'no its ok.' I said ok and then just started walking out to get water and get myself together but as I was walking he he said, 'ok we are going to take a 10 minute break, someone isn't feeling good.'
I mean I didn't get any comments from anyone except the person sitting next to me asking ' how are you feeling?' But I did get 1 girl looking at me as I was walking back to my seat and she was smiling.

We were just talking about arbitrary stuff but she kept getting more ""intimate"" with me as time went on, kissing me and stuff.

When she got on top of me I didn't know what to do.  Keep in mind I'm only 130 lbs so I would've had to try hard to push her off of me and I didn't want it to look I'm trying to hurt her.

17,"Okay, I am a student graduate (graduated last year) living with my parents. I don't have a job neither do my parents. My dad got cancer and it has been a rough year for 2016. I got money saved up but it's not a lot. I'm a game designer &amp; 3D artist. I'm also a bodybuilder who is also considering getting a certification to become a trainer to make money and be a indie game designer on the side for now. I don't want to find a job in the gaming industry for 2 reasons since it's a very competitive industry and tends to have lots of laid offs (most jobs are in LA). Second, I can't and won't leave my parents especially in my fathers serious health condition and my mom emotional state.

Also last month we went to Houston TX to go to MD Anderson for my dad and I started a GoFundMe to raise money. We raised $40,000 out of $80,000 goal. Which is great but all of it is gone and have been used for bills and medical stuff.

In order to get a job in the gaming industry for me, the resume is not so important as the portfolio is extremely important. You have to be at the top and stand out of many others. My plan is to go independent route as a indie developer and make a simple but additive game for the iPhone/iPad and then Android (possibly other platforms like Windows 10 or PC if it's a success). A few have had serious success making a simple mobile game on their own while others have made nothing basically...

Currently I have a desktop gaming workstation computer that is working great and is very fast. It's my primary computer that I use for almost everything and it got all my stuff in it. I also have a cheap gaming laptop that I got almost 4 years ago. I don't really use it anymore and it doesn't have any stuff in it other than some games and apps. The laptop kind of sucks and can't do much as far as game development or gaming goes. Right now I can probably sell it for between $500-700 if I'm lucky.

I'm in need for a iMac or a Mac mini (waiting for spring this year for the new iMac and Mac Mini to come out). I need a mac to ship games to any apple platform while I can use my desktop PC I have right now for the designing/development part of the game. I figure I could use the some of the money for the iMac (cheapest one) if I sell my laptop. As far as portability goes, I got a smartphone and cheap tablet that does everything I need it to do. I do want a razer blade but I don't have the money for that. I also have to buy expensive software to develop my games too (about $400 total).

What's your take on this? I know I kind of explain the answer to myself but do you guys have any advice? Know anybody who is a personal trainer (how much do they make a year)? Anybody in the gaming industry as a game designer or artist?

28,"Hello Reddit! Anyone interested in math, teaching, science communication, or the like might appreciate this post. I’m trying to figure out how to explain something slightly complex to another person over the phone, and would appreciate Reddit’s thoughts!

I placed an order from Bonobos in December for 8 pairs of pants to wear to work, on 30% sale. The total purchase price including tax, after the 30% discount, was $624.91. About an hour later I realized that I had forgotten to use some Bonobos store credit I had left from an old gift card, in the amount of $36.07. So, I called customer service and a Bonobos “Ninja” helped me by “invalidating” my store credit and applying it to my order, reducing the total cost of the order charged to my credit card to $588.84. So, at that point, I’d effectively paid $624.91 ($588.84 charged to my credit card + $36.07 in bonobos gift card credit) for 8 pairs of pants.
I ultimately decided to only keep one pair of pants (the others were skinnier than I expected them to be, or darker in color, and I got another couple pairs at J.Crew in the meantime). So, I returned the other 7 pairs of pants, and was issued a refund of $523.57. The pants I kept had a list price of $98, but I got them on $30% sale, so they should have cost $68.6. Then apply my store credit, and they should have come out to $32.53 ($68.60 - $36.07 = $32.53). However, instead of paying $32.53 for those pants, I have effectively paid $101.34 for the pants: I had originally paid $624.91 for the order ($588.84 from my credit card + $36.07 in bonobos gift card credit) and was refunded $523.57 ($624.91 - $523.57 = $101.34). The $36.07 in store credit was neither returned to my Bonobos account or applied to the pants I kept. My store credit effectively disappeared.

I called Bonobos today to explain this, but for the life of me could not get the “Ninja” to understand. He said the $36.07 of my store credit was “invalidated” then transferred into a price reduction on my total order, applied as a discount evenly across each item (I supposed he means $36.07/8 = ~$4.51, so each item was reduced in price by $4.51). But when I returned the 7 pairs of pants, I was refunded the price of each pair of pants only after their prices had been reduced, presumably by $4.51 each. So When I returned them, I was only refunded the reduced price I paid in cash, not the reduced price I paid in cash PLUS the effective value of my store credit for each pair of pants (and that part would total 7*$4.51, or $31.57).

I couldn’t figure out how to make the “Ninja” understand that the majority of my $36.07 in store credit had effectively “disappeared”. Reddit, do you understand?

Of course I have already spent more than $36.07 in terms of the value of my time to try to resolve this matter (even just in writing this post!), but I am now hooked on how to communicate it! Am I a jerk customer for buying then returning so many things? Possibly! But despite that, any thoughts on how to communicate this clearly and concisely? Thanks!

(Side note for the even more nitpicky reader: The difference between the amount I paid in cash ($588.84) and the amount I was refunded ($523.57) is only $65.27, which is less than the $68.6 I think that the pants I kept should have cost before my store credit was applied. I think that some calculated portion of my $36.07 was applied to the $68.60 reducing their cost, then tax was applied, bringing the cost back up to $65.27.)

Because of my negative experiences with being in a very large high school, I decided to attend a smaller, private college to help me get out of my shell, and make new friends. I lost many in HS, and fell in a deep depression state. For the most part, it worked. I made lots of friends, am in the best shape of my life, etc. But now I feel I will have to throw that away, because the school itself is not optimal at all for me.
  
I really like technology, and I can't really see myself majoring or pursuing a career in anything else, despite feeling a bit uncertain if computer science is 100% the direction I want to go in (especially since I'm not fond of math). Unfortunately, this smaller school is horrible for majoring in computer science. There's only one professor that teaches the majority of classes, and as kind as he is, he's not good at teaching the subject. He rambles on, talks with individual students for a long period of time, and does not know the subject that well. This is the second time I'm taking him, and I get anxious in that class because I feel like it's not preparing me for the career I feel I really want. On top of that, I can't figure out if computer science is the direction I want to go in with classes like this! I can't even register for another elective to experiment around in, because classes are full, with how tiny the school is. 
  
I did find an alternative school though, and it is just about the same commute distance from my current school. I hear their computer science program is really good, too. Should I transfer to this school? I'd have to throw away all the friends I've made here, but I just feel this school is leading me down a dead end. I am so stressed out right now because my schedule is horrible -- I even have a religion class I have to get rid of, since the alternative school wouldn't take the credit, like this religious school would, aside from the fact the professor is horrendous, too.
  
I just want to be happy, and feel secure in my future, and I am not getting that here at all. I don't think I CAN get that here. I am worried to take the risk though, I guess. What should I do? Thanks in advance, I appreciate it a lot.",21Jan2017,1
31,"Okay so quick background. I may have been around 15 or 16 when the heart cramps started. They would always happen at a time when I wasn't doing anything strenuous. Like when i would be falling asleep or watching Tv. Basically, I'd be fine one minute and the next my heart has an intense pain, I can only take shallow breaths, and I can't move without more pain. But they only lasted a minute or 2. They never happened everyday, maybe once every 2 weeks. 

So my mom took me to a cardiologist and I had ekg, a ultrasound, etc. The nurse never said something was severely wrong (thank god), but my personal opinion of the doctor isn't great. He just kinda breezed in the room (after all the tests) and said ,""Oh it's because she drinks too much soda."" To which my mom said ,""She doesn't drink soda."" I was an athlete so I drank mostly water. He then stumbled his words a bit and tried to make up another excuse (can't remember his exact words). My mom, mad now, stated ,""She is a great student athlete who only drinks water....(again stuff I don't remember)."" Then he excitedly said ,""Oh yes it must be how stressed she is in school."" Then he left. Not to judge, but he was a cocky doctor who didn't want to deal with this.

So I was never given an answer about why this happens. It still happens to this day and I'm 20 now. I just had a really bad episode that lasted at least 20 minutes. So should I go see an actual (non-dick) doctor? Is this normal? Any help would be appreciated!",21Jan2017,1

33,"I'm not sure what to really say that won't just be a wall of tl;dr. Feeling it harder than normal today. 10+ years with a 1 year separation somewhere in there. I've made the decision to move out as soon as the opportunity is viable and live on my own or with roommates, whichever chance comes first. 

I've said, ""I want to take a break.""

But I feel like what I really mean is, ""Maybe we should just be friends.""

The one year separation was similar to this—a split prompted by arguments and tempers getting a bit too physical for my liking. Aggressive behaviors that just make me want to get out of this place. I've spoken with him about it and he's toned it down and promised not to drink anymore, but honestly, I feel like the damage has already been done and I can't bring myself to feel like I'm safe or like I'm not living with a ticking time bomb that's going to have another mood swing or show up shitfaced-drunk and take out his frustrations on me. 

Frustrations that I know I'm a source of, because he's even said it himself—he's not happy in this relationship. Nor am I, no matter how much I want to believe I am or still can be.

I just don't know how to feel. The first separation was hard. I cried a lot and moved in with my dad for a time. Felt like my life fell apart and that I was the reason for it. We cut off friendship entirely when I started seeing someone else and rightly so, I don't blame him for not wanting to be around for that.

Fast-forward to now, I feel like I'm on the verge of a separation happening again and I just feel numb. I don't feel distraught or emotionally cleaved because I've been there and done that already and I think what's telling is that my heart and mind are well aware of that.

What I feel is more like an optimism that being alone and unattached to anyone will be better for me in the long run. Finish my BA, get a career, just focus on *me* and not a relationship that's been a huge source of pain and stress for the last decade of my life (not to say it hasn't been happy—I love this guy a lot. More than anything. Even after the end of this, I'll still say he's the closest thing I'll ever have to a twin, but maybe that right there is why it isn't working romantically.)

I'm not sure what advice I'm looking for. Maybe I needed to vent. I've felt like my head's been held underwater the last few weeks as I come to the realization that this second chance I really wanted to see succeed simply isn't. This relationship is dissolving and I find myself having a hard time feeling anything. 

Is this normal? Or is this reaction right here even further proof that what's ended is ended and I've just been holding on to a ghost? Do I try and nurse a friendship? Or do I let this person who's been my best friend for the last ten years slip away? 

Either way, I'm at the end, here. The road is looking clearer and clearer and it's one that I feel only I'm supposed to be going down, and I think I'm really scared, but I know it's a long time coming. I'm afraid of losing my best friend. But I realize I have no idea who I even am alone. 

I don't even know if I'm acting of my own free will or like something else is pushing me. I just don't know. I feel like I'm not even really here. Just being carried on rails or like I'm in a dream, with a frightening knowledge I'm going to wake up alone.",21Jan2017,1
34,"My ex has been adding me on social media under various fake female usernames for the past year. No real pattern to when he does this, but he’s always pretending to be a female around my age. I know it's him and not a robot/accident.

We only talked once after breaking up. He dumped me and I went NC. Last talk we had was bc he wanted me back and actually apologized for his behavior. I didn’t trust him, though looking back maybe he did actually mean most of it. 

Can someone please explain to me why he’s doing this? Has anyone else been tempted to do this to their exes? Or had their ex do this to them? I can’t stop him unless I change my phone &amp; email, which isn’t worth the trouble. I just want to know why he’s doing this.

I don’t think it’s to talk to me. He didn’t actually try to contact me pretending to be these girls - he just added me. But two of my accounts created AFTER we broke up, and he added these post breakup accounts.

I went up to the professor and told him that I wasn't feeling good and he told me, 'Oh we can take a break we normally do at this time.' But I told him ' I don't want the whole class to wait for me.' But he said 'no its ok.' I said ok and then just started walking out to get water and get myself together but as I was walking he he said, 'ok we are going to take a 10 minute break, someone isn't feeling good.'

42,"I just turned 30 and in the past few days I have been feeling depressed and not sure about my future. I'm looking for some advice but I need to describe to you my background and current situation first. I am sorry if it is a bit lengthy.

When I was 18 years old I tried for 2-3 years to get a degree from university in maths or engineering, but I ended up wasting my time and dropping because, even though I had a passion for the sciences, I found uni too hard and I wasn't committed enough.

Following a growing interest in photography and portraits, I then decided to get a diploma as fashion photographer (1year), after which I dedicated myself to the profession with deep passion and I became very good at it. During 3-4 years I landed a few commissioned works for respectable brands and I built a very solit portfolio as an artist. However, I became disillusioned with the industry, which mainly deals with superficial people and clients that talk talk talk but don't pay or are lunatic. 

Long story short, even though I had passion, I didn't want to have to deal with this type of industry any longer so I moved overseas and at the age of 25 I decided to attack university again, with a stronger will and motivation.

I started a bachelor of science (chemistry major), I graduated in 3 years with good grades and not failing anything, and then I did an extra Honours year in chemistry (it is like a short Master's degree), where I graduated with the highest grades.

Throughout the past 4 years I decided that I would continue my studies into a PhD in chemistry, and this is currently the ""plan"". I applied for a scholarship to begin a PhD at my university in July 2017 and it has been granted. So if I don't change my mind about it, that is what I'm going to do for the next 3-4 years.

However, I am starting to have serious doubts about this whole plan. I had doubts before as well, all the time, but now they are getting stronger, and since I'm in this 6-months break before starting the PhD, I thought I'd like to make up my mind once and for all about my future and what I want to do. Then stick with it.

Basically, I'm feeling like I don't want to study anymore, I don't want to have to deal with massive amount of bureaucracy and paper work that I have to produce over the course of a PhD, and doing it would just be a ""lazy"" choice dictated by the fact that it would guarantee me a safe (although low) income for the next 3 years. I have been trying to find a temporary job as chemist in my city for the past 3 months, after graduation, but there are not many lab jobs for chemists, and I am not even sure if chemistry is something that I even want to do anymore to be honest.

If you asked me what I would like to do right now, if I could choose anything, I would tell you that I would love to have a little place where I could work as carpenter and make wooden things or work with wood in general. I would like to ""build"" or make something with my hands, doing a very old or traditional job. But I don't have the skills, or qualification or experience to work as carpenter. And it would mean to start on a whole new path at the age of 30, which doesn't seem the best option after all what I have been through in terms of experience and study.

Alternatively, I would still consider working as photographer, I still have a deep passion and love for it, but again the market is what it is, and there is no guaranteed income. The way I see it, I would always have to have another part-time or stable casual job on the side and photography alone would not allow me to sustain myself. When I was working in the past I was living in Italy, where the fashion industry is very solid, and still I wasn't landing enough jobs to allow me to be independent by just doing that (I was in fact working a casual job to pay the bills). You might think that I was shit and not competent or whatever, but that is not the reason. And I know plenty of young photographers even better than me that go through the same struggles. 
I don't have funds to invest in a studio or anything like that, but I do have professional camera and tools so I could still work with it, but it would be a freelancer kind of job, and I don't like uncertainties. I lived through those for a few years already. That's why continuing the university path is somewhat appealing to me..

Another career option that could stem from my degrees could be teaching, and I think I would like it. But here in Australia I would need to study an extra year to get a Teaching Degree, otherwise I would not be allowed to work. I work occasionally as chemistry/maths tutor, I like it, the pay is good and people seem to call me back, so that is cool. But it is just a few hours a week and so it's not like a career, it's more like something I could do as a side job.

I really value my free time, and I would like to do a simple job, living simply with enough money to pay my rent/bills and maybe save a little bit as well, that's it.

But I need some advice on what I should do from now onward. I am really confused. Doing a PhD would be the ""best"" thing in terms of career, and I would probably/possibly get a well paid job at the end of it, being it postdoc or other paths. Still, even though I love scientific research, I don't feel it is the right thing for me in the long run. I'd rather follow a simpler career and get ""enough"" money, rather than a more ""prestigious"" career and get ""more"" money. Plus, If I really want to work as chemist I believe that getting a PhD is not even necessary.

Any thoughts? What should I do?

Sorry for the long post.",21Jan2017,3

46,"First, I have a bachelor's in Psych already. I've actually taken this class (Human Development) before, but because it was over 7 years ago, I'm required to take it again as part of my current degree. So I feel like I know what I'm talking about when I say these assignments seem inappropriate. 

My professor is constantly asking us to interview friends and family about our own childhood as part of our assignments, and she also requests their contact information so she can call them to verify the information. First off, this seems really intrusive to me. To my family, this woman is a complete stranger. I've already politely asked her if this is necessary, and she replied that she needs to do it to verify that we are completing the assignments. 

If it were just a privacy issue, I'd probably suck it up. But, I also had a uniquely shitty mother. I don't want to go into detail; I have a post history for that. As it so happens, most of the assignments involve interviewing my mother about details about my personal infancy/childhood/adolescence. She and I have zero contact, and though I could interview other family members about it, they're related to her and it's still uncomfortable to discuss her or our relationship.

My previous Human Development professor insisted we'd be learning all the theories of human development WITHOUT asking for any personal information or stories, for precisely this reason. That professor was also much older and more experienced than this new one. I know it's possible to teach this class without asking for personal information because I've been in this class before. 

What...can I do about this? Just suck it up for three months? I don't have another chance to take this class; I'm on a strict timeline. Otherwise I'd drop and take it with someone else. I'm stuck with this class. I've got a 3.82 GPA right now; this isn't about wiggling out of assignments. I'm an excellent, highly motivated student. I just don't want to share this information with her or anyone else who I have to look at. And I can't ask my friends to remember the right lies in case she *does* call them. ",21Jan2017,1

53,"Hi,

So tonight one of my mothers friends rang the doorbell and I answered. She seemed tipsy and said my dad was drunk out in town and I should go get him. So i assumed first he was maybe just too drunk and id have to go bundle him into a taxi to go home but as I'm walking into town with my mothers friend she explains he's basically gone back to this woman who used to be our babysitter's flat to have sex basically. Now although i was less than impressed at this my parents ""separated"" about 2 weeks ago, so I didn't mind too much. That said, it comes to light that this has happened on at least 2 occasions in the last month, including christmas eve (dates my mums friend mentioned match up with days my dad went out and didnt come home) and possibly loads of other times over the past few years according to my mums friend. 

The difficulty is I don't know if I should tell my mum about this because I know there have been problems over the years for various reasons and I don't know them all, meaning this may already be one of the reasons she wants a divorce. Equally my dad's become more of an alcoholic recently and my mums friend who knows nothing about their problems said he seems so lost and self destructive. It was mentioned in passing that he said something along the lines of i could go out and kill myself and it wouldn't matter and although its probably partly the alcohol speaking its not something i think should be taken lightly. I worry that bringing this up could bring more harm to both of them than good but equally it feels important to be truthful to my mum because its so disrespectful if something like this has been ongoing for years behind her back.

Im just wondering how to approach this... I have a half brother a few years older (he's 26 im 20, same mum different dad) who i think knows more about other incidents who i could talk to about it but equally he has more of a temper and doesnt take my dads shit 

Im just wondering what the best move is.. Do i talk to my brother first and then tell my mum? Do we confront my dad about it? Do I forget about it because its not worth the harm? Sorry if this is incoherent, brains churning and im tired.",21Jan2017,2

I ended up not going with a tux and instead with black dress pants, dress shirt, and shoes. To match my dates color, I went a tie (Which everyone seemed to like). All in all, the event went well and I even got pictures of us both. Will post when I can.

______________________________________

**PART I:**

I am currently being held back from any forward progress because of my University. So. Here's at least some summary of the story. It's a difficult one, so I may miss some details.

I am a student at a Commonwealth Campus of Penn State University. Currently 22, should be finishing up my Junior year, but instead, I am currently stuck at 3 *official* semesters under my belt. I LOVE Penn State, I really, *really* do. I have, however, been forced to look into transferring to another school because PSU will *not* allow me back because I owe them money.

Because I attended and graduated from HS in Florida, my status as a student at Penn State was considered ""out-of-state"". Understandable. I know that being born in PA, living there for 6 years, visiting every other Summer, and THEN moving there independently (not simply for college), means nothing. Because I have Pennsylvania blood in me, it doesn't mean I have always been a resident. **SO** with that said, my bill for attending was  $9650 per semester.

For my Freshman year, I was eligible for federal grants and loans. I think the loans totaled $2500 and the grants totaled $2500. So, what I/my parents (who *are* divorced, by the way) were expected to pay, was $4150. 

We could not afford this. My dad, at the time, had been unemployed after losing his job in 2012 (a year before I began college). After a lawsuit from the company who he had worked for, he was forced to repay the unemployment money he was given. Either way, he didn't make good enough money to begin with. Because my mom has had disabilities, she hadn't held a job since I was a toddler. What my dad made was not enough to classify my family (of 5 people) as ""above the poverty line,"" or at least, *well enough* above the poverty line. We were *always* eligible for government assistance. We had been utilizing Section-8 Housing and food stamps my *entire life*-- a fact I hadn't known until I was 16 and hadn't realized the extent of until I was 18 and had to actually *sign* the papers as an adult in the household. You'd think a man *(referring to my dad)* who has **3 Masters degrees** would make great money and be able to send his kid to college with very little worry. **NOPE**. The state of Florida was not kind to us in the job market.

_____________________________________________

**BACKSTORY about HS and grades:**

Being accepted to Penn State had been a life-long dream-come-true. I didn't do well my first two years of high school, because I liked to screw-off and be a defiant teenager. I had always had the brains, but I didn't begin to pick up my act until my Junior year, when the head of Guidance and the Principal at my HS told me ""You *CAN* get into Penn State. But if you don't better yourself *now*, you *won't* get in, nor will you get any money to go."" I had previously believed (because the school systems are misleading about how colleges actually look at HS grades/GPAs/test scores) that Penn State will not take anyone with below a 3.25 GPA. After getting my shit together,  I  worked my 1.07 GPA up to a 2.72 at graduation. The school had disallowed me to take AP or AICE courses because of my low GPA, but if I had, I would have succeeded in at least a B average in AP, which would have boosted my GPA just above a 3.0, possible as high as 3.5, as I was told. And, if I had done as well as I did my junior and senior years, *with AP*, I would have been in serious competition for Valedictorian. But I was a dumbass.

__________________________________________

Anyway, first year of college came and went, it was great. Not incredibly easy, because I took one 300-level course and one 400-level course but great (earned my 2 A's in those). The school offered me a scholarship after my family could not come up with the money to pay the rest of my bill off.

Sophomore year came around, my mother had actually taken an office job (part-time, filing and keeping book) mostly so she could give her four kids some money/pay for things we need. It's not great money, but it's supplemental to what her husband makes as a teacher at a local technical high school/technical college, which *also* isn't very much. 

**THIS IS WHERE THE STORY GETS WILD**

Five weeks into the Fall semester, I fall ill. I have no idea what I have, but I'm a bit sore, tired, apathetic, and sick to my stomach. I still attend classes the whole week, though I was struggling, because the symptoms became increasingly worse. The next Monday rolls around, and I get out of bed slowly. I'm running a fever and I'm sick as all hell. Slowly, one foot, then the other onto the floor, stand slowly, aching knees crackle painfully, immediately lose strength in my legs  and fall to the floor on my hands and knees. ""*WELL*"" I say to myself ""*I guess I'm not going anywhere today*"" and I try to get into bed again. I stayed home that whole week.

I could go on, but long story short, I suffer more symptoms, go to the hospital, get checked out, then sent home. I e-mail all my instructors, they send me what work I need to do for the next week. End of the week, mail from the hospital: ""*Congratulations!* You have mono!"" is essentially what I read from the test results letter. **COOL**. I e-mail my instructors again, let them know what's up, they tell me to take my time with coming back, and they'll send me all the work. I didn't leave my bed that whole next week. It was **that** bad. I couldn't do most of my work because I had missed lectures and notes, and they couldn't send me the quizzes or tests. I began recovering very slowly over the next week, but I was told by the doctors *not* to go to school. Which is fine, because I didn't have the strength, and I didn't want to get anyone else sick by any random chance (even though I knew it would be possible for the next few months, whether I'm feeling well or not, it was just less transmittable after the symptoms died down).

After 4 weeks of lectures, midterms, and other tests and quizzes missed, I finally went in to school a full week. It was then that I realized how much I had missed. I had discussions with my instructors on the *best possible* grades I could earn in their courses: ""C+"" ""B-"" ""C+"" ""C"" ""B"" and ""C"" again. So, I went to my adviser and withdrew for the rest of the semester. 

**HOWEVER** When I went to withdraw, she told me ""because you are not in registered status, I will only be able to *cancel your schedule* instead of withdraw you from the University. Basically the same thing, except your financial aid will be returned to the Department of Education and your debt will not increase."" Even though my grants and loans had been paid to the University, I still had a balance (which my mother was paying on) of over $1900, or whatever it was (we also didn’t get the money we already paid back, if I recall correctly). The Bursar's and Registrar's offices *could have* put me in registered status, but I guess we hadn't made enough payments on the bill to be eligible for ""good faith"" status in order to put me into ""registered"" student status. **SO** We canceled my schedule and my adviser re-enrolled me for the Spring semester. She, the head of Financial Aid, *AND* the Registrar each said I have nothing to worry about. So I didn't sweat it. I thought the cancellation of my schedule was actually an official and documented action. *It was not*. And *that* is the root of my problems.

_____________________________________

**PART II:**

In the Spring, I had gotten my license suspended for, apparently driving on a suspended license. The PA Department of Transportation (PENNDOT) *never* sent me any documentation or notification about a suspension. Not to my residence in PA (grandmother’s house), not to my former residence in Florida. It was for *non-payment of a fine* for a summary offense that had been **excused by PENNDOT due to an error in their system**. 

______________________________________________

**BACKSTORY to the suspension**
BACK TO THE PREVIOUS SEPTEMBER (then what was supposed to be my third semester of college) for **the reason I was pulled over in the first place*. Apparently, my registration plate had been suspended due to my car not being insured…while it actually *was.* PENNDOT had erroneously *not* filed my updated insurance information to match my vehicle registration, therefore, my old insurance policy (one my dad and I previously shared) could no longer be linked to my plate. My registration was apparently suspended; *the first thing* for which I received no notification. Went to court, cop offers plea deal for a lesser charge. I took it, because I was sick as a dog and wanted to go home. Didn’t think it would affect me. **Oh, it did**.

__________________________________________

When PENNDOT sent me the letter excusing my summary offense and erasing it from record, I figured I didn’t have to pay the fine. I called the local magistrate’s office who had handled the conviction, the secretary lady told me that I didn’t have any offenses on file, so there’s no fine to pay. I guess she didn’t look at people who still owe fines. And I was on a payment plan, so I still owed money (roughly $105 of the $210 I initially owed). So I didn’t continue paying my fine. After I had finally gotten over my illness in the Fall, I went to Florida for Christmas break.
I returned to PA and began attending classes again in January. I attended for three weeks, and then drove out to State College for an extended weekend with my best friend (My 2 MWF professors canceled their classes for that Friday and the following Monday). Not even 20 minutes after I left State College on the way back home, I was pulled over by a PA State Police Officer. I asked him why he pulled me over, and he said “Well, I ran your plate, and your license came back suspended.” I was confused. So I remarked, “*suspended!?* what for?” and he informed me that he wasn’t sure, but there was a pick-up warrant on the license. Then I asked respectfully, but still confused, “But why did you run my plate?” to which he told me “Well, you changed lanes once, but then twice more in pretty quick succession, and, because this is a college area and it’s early morning, I thought it looked more like you may still have been drunk from partying or something. You *aren’t* drunk, are you?” And I told him I wasn’t (and I wasn’t). He told me to sit tight, while he went to check up on the suspension.
Officer comes back to the car and asks “Do you know anything about an offense in [X-Town]?” And I said “Yeah. PENNDOT actually sent me a letter about that a few weeks ago, while I was vacationing in Florida, my grandmother read it over the phone.” He said “Well, apparently, it’s a failure to pay fines, and they sent you a suspension notice.” (Which PENNDOT didn’t do, *AGAIN*). I was even more baffled at that point. I told the officer I even had the paper they sent me about the overturned and excused conviction in [X-Town]. He asked if he could review it, and I gladly handed it to him. Again, he returned to his car, came back after about eight minutes, and said “Apparently, they still wanted you to pay fines, and they have been sending you letters. Which is confusing to *me*, because it was overturned. That’s kind of ridiculous. *BUT* I have to do my job and still take your license away.”

Which he did. Since I couldn’t drive anymore, he actually gave me a lift back to the main campus at U-Park, which was incredibly nice of him, because that took 20 minutes out of his shift. He said he would talk to the judge, but he’s not sure how much help it would actually be. He drops me off, and I struggled the whole rest of the day with finding somewhere to wait for someone to bring me home. I asked all my friends in State College…which were about 8 people. My best friend had classes all day and work all night, and the guy she was seeing at the time was coming over after she was off work. So *THAT* was a nope. Four other friends couldn’t give me a ride back because they didn’t have cars. I couldn’t get in contact with the others because they either didn’t use Facebook enough or didn’t answer their phones. 
Two of those friends shared a dorm with two other people and it was cramped, so they couldn’t give me anywhere to stay for the night. The other two who answered worked either an overnight shift, and wouldn’t be home, or had classes all day and was leaving for Pittsburgh for the night afterward. So I basically camped out in the Paterno Library for five hours, looking for help, but not making it obvious to anyone around me. I took to Yik-Yak and actually got help from a student [let’s call him Geo], who allowed me to stay at his dorm for the night if I needed to. He comped my meal in the dining hall, and we chilled in his dorm for an hour or so. My aunt called me and paid for a room at a nearby hotel for the night after my grandmother said she and her sisters will come get me and my car the following morning. Geo called up a taxi and again comped the fare, and I stayed at a hotel until my grandmother got me in the morning.

_______________________________________
 
**PART III:**

The next day (now Wednesday) I couldn’t find a ride to school. I thought “okay, short notice, all good.” Literally all my friends at school were commuters, as are 80% of the students at my Commonwealth Campus, so I thought I could get a ride the next day. Nope. All my close friends, somewhat ironically, lived far away (equal distance from campus as I, but opposite direction). I guess I wasn’t good enough friends with any of the others for them to say “I know my first class is a 11am, but I’m not getting up at 8 to bring you to your 9am.” *Well this sucks wieners*.

So, I kept trying for the next week and couldn’t get a ride. My grandmother worked, I was afraid to drive without a license, so I couldn’t get to or from school. The following week (now Week 5), my grandmother has a day off on Wednesday. *Great*. We go up to the school  at 10am. I go into my Adviser’s office, and tell her I need to withdraw…*AGAIN*. I tell her why. Give her the whole story. She says “Okay. And we’ll re-enroll you *again* for the Fall.” 

She goes to make the withdrawal request, and again sees that I am *still* in “scheduled” status, instead of “registered.” She says, “we’re going to have to just cancel it again. Same thing as last semester.” So we go ahead and go through with it. Again, I was assured by everyone that I’ll be fine, that I’ll just start back up in the Fall. And that’s that. No harm done.

________________________________________

**PART IV:**

Between the time I “unofficially” withdrew again and the time I returned in August, I had received mail from the USDoE and the company they had handling my loans. I had previously gotten the same letters telling me about my account info and what I owe and all that noise. So, they were nothing new. I thought I was still fine and didn’t have to actually pay anything yet, because I was still a student, not finished with school, and I had still had an official “continuous enrollment” record which would defer my loan payments until 6 months after graduation.

I went through 10 weeks of the Fall 2015 semester before I was actually e-mailed by Financial Aid about my bill. And it didn’t look right, because we should have owed $2150, but instead, the bill was $9650. We set up a meeting for the end of the week. However, *the next day*,  I received a notice in the mail from the loan handlers. They told me, in essence, “You have 10 days to repay your loans and accrued interest in the amount of [~]$11,800.” And I thought, “*That’s odd.*” and made a call later that night. 

The man I spoke to from the company who handled my loans asked if I could pay back the full amount now. I was shocked, and I damn near choked on my own esophagus. I almost yelled at him and said *“Are you out of your fucking mind!?”*  but I contained myself and said “No, I cannot do that at the present time.” And he asked “Can you pay back 90% of the loan, totaling [whatever high ass amount]?” and I actually got pissed off. “No I cannot.” And he asked for my employment information (I worked 8 hours a week at a warehouse sorting, assembling, and preparing bundles of Sunday newspapers for delivery drivers). 

Apparently, he could not put together a payment schedule for me, but he could take a lump-sum payment of at least the interest owed on the loans, which was some $1800. He, rather rudely, told me to call again tomorrow to set up a payment plan with someone. He gave me the number, and repeated to me “Call tomorrow to make that payment plan.” And I said “Alright, I’ll be sure to do that” and he said “Okay” and just hung up on me. Whatever, don’t care, already confused and scared about how to pay for school now.

I spoke to the Financial Aid lady a few days later, she told me that they never received the loans, and she said I need to be sure I’m getting them. “Re-check your FAFSA,” do this, do that…all this stuff I had *been* doing. But there was nothing she could do for me at that time. But the Bursar’s Office, later that day, set me up on a payment plan for the money I owe the University. *Cool*.
 
Next day, I called the loan handler. Gave this guy (different guy, of course, it’s a call center) my account info. He goes through my account and says “Oh, well, that’s odd. We transferred your account to the USDoE, Office of the Ombudsman just two days ago.” So he gave me their number, and I give them a call. The lady there tells me “**you’re in default** now, that’s why they transferred it to us”. *WHAT!?* “But they told me that I had until [whatever date, which was still 4 days later].” And apparently, they told me the wrong date.
 **So now, I’m in default of my loans, which would total above $12,000 in just a few days**

_________________________________

**PART V:**

Eventually, my parents and I put together a payment plan. At this point in time, my dad now has a job. Again, it’s a low-paying job for a company whose clientele is dwindling slowly, but surely. Now, on my FAFSA, since my dad is listed as whom I am dependent of, my mother’s information doesn’t matter to them, since she does not live within the same household and is re-married. My dad’s salary is still below the poverty line, and so he’s still getting government assistance, which means our payments are at the bare minimum. The bare minimum wouldn’t even make a dent in the *interest* after one year.

Penn State allowed me to finish the semester and owe them a balance of $9650, so long as we were on a payment plan with them as well. My mom and I have been paying back a couple hundred bucks a month since December 2015, which is great. And I re-enrolled for Spring 2016.

_______________________________________

**PART VI:**

I went through the entirety of my Spring term, thinking I was *finally* about to finish my Sophomore year. And then, with about three weeks to go (four, if you count Finals week), Financial Aid came a-knockin’ again. They told me that they *cannot* allow my instructors to award a grade for my work or my final exams if my balance is not paid. I said “But we’re on a payment plan, and you allowed this last semester.” But they said “yes, but University Policy does not allow you to receive your grades if a balance goes unpaid.” When I asked if they’ll at least allow my instructors to give me grades, but not allow me to get the credit for the time being until the balance is paid, they told me “if you were currently paying on *this* semester, yes. But because you are still paying off *last* semester, that’s not possible.” And I got upset. Basically saying “*So all this time, you allowed me to work my ass off and endure the extreme amounts of stress in completing classwork, exams, over 300 hours of research and study out of my free time, work with Student Government, running the Campus Safety Committee, running *two* clubs, and organizing, running, and attending multiple events and meetings, while also trying to get sleep at night and eat properly? I EARNED MY FIRST STRAIGHT-A SEMESTER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND IT WAS FOR NOTHING!? You allowed this?*”

Let me tell you what royally bones. **THAT**. 

I earned **ALL A’s** in CRIMJ 441: The Juvenile Justice System, CRIMJ 389: Gangs and Gang Behavior, CRIMJ 471: Legal Rights, Duties, Liabilities of CJ Personnel, PSYCH 100: Intro to Psychology, and FRNSC 100: Intro to Forensic Science. Granted, the classes were not difficult to me, they did require a ton of work. For JJS, I wrote a 26-Page Research Paper, co-created a PowerPoint Presentation for the research, and created a poster presentation for Undergraduate Research Fair (For which I won the top award. They would have given my work the categorical award, but their committee guidelines did not allow someone to win both a category *AND* overall award. Not sure why). *I had never achieved straight A’s since I was first awarded letter grades in 6th grade*.

So *that semester* (Spring 2016) counted for nothing.

____________________________________________________-


**PART VII:**

Penn State University policy will **not** allow a student to be enrolled if they are in monetary debt *to the University*. This is what I have been told. My mother and I have contacted Congressmen and Senators, who have tried to help, but ultimately led to nowhere. We exhausted every faculty member at my Commonwealth Campus as well. One in particular, the Director of Student Affairs, has been doing her absolute *best* to help me and keep me in the school, and I couldn’t thank her enough, but after a year or so of working with her, she, too, had unfortunately exhausted all her power. The Chancellor of the Commonwealth Campus was not very much help at all. He’ll be retiring, as I’ve been told, after this current semester. It sucks only because he at least knew the problem and knew my case. Soon, when the new Chancellor takes over, we’ll try seeing if there’s anything she can do that the previous one either didn’t think of or simply did not do.

*Currently*, my mother and I are in contact with University-wide executive officials who work at the Main Campus in U-Park. Since I had taken that one year off (as official documentation would show, even though I should have been on medical leave and then on leave out of my control), the Fall 2015 semester should have officially billed me as an “In-State” student, thus dropping my original bill from $9650, down to about $5400, almost half the original amount.
I am also currently *out* of default for my loans, and currently in a repayment status, which will soon be reverted to deferment once I am again enrolled in school. I would rather not go to any other school, but I wish to be back in school by this Fall (2017). If I *must*, I will. I currently have transfer applications out to Kutztown University (where my dad received his Baccalaureate degrees) and Point Park University. If my PSU issue does not develop any further, or results in my not being able to attend Penn State, I will put other transfers in at the following schools: Syracuse, U of North Florida, UPenn (worth a shot), Flagler College (easy, I know), U of Tennessee-Knoxville, and West Virginia University. 

Any other suggestions for a Criminology major? Any recommendations for what to do?

**If you've gotten this far without a tl;dr, thank you so very much.** 

I apologize for the length (something I usually never have to do) and the complaining...I should just be getting ready to receive my Bachelor's degree, but instead, **I'm stuck in a deep, dark hole and living in an especially strange Hell, right now:** On one hand, I am in crippling debt and not allowed to return to my dream school which is both terrible and somewhat frightening; but on the other hand, everything else in my life is great, although I've been working part-time jobs for measly amounts of pay, I have my own little place, a gf, a car, a phone, and food. 

I'm happy and optimistic, yet I know to fold my hand when I've exhausted every last resource. I don't care if I will be $40K, $50K, $60K in debt when I've finally graduated, I just want to go to this school so I can eventually become a detective, so I can teach high school, so I can run a business, so I can do my part and do my best at making at least the United States a better, more understanding, careful, smarter, and happier place.

So, again, from the bottom of my heart, *thank you*.

All The Best,
Fmr. President BrotherfordBHayes

I'm a healthy and very active College student that has been binge drinking I suppose, of Whiskey. I've developed a rather high tolerance being that I hate mixed drinks and often solely take shots. 
  Now... I finished a bottle with my gf recently and experienced sweats, fainting feeling and just general discomfort the next day. I had no headache, and just wanted to lay in bed and ended up leaving my afternoon class after a early morning of being okay pre, during, and after my workout and classes. These symptoms lasted a day as I felt fine after sleeping on and off once getting home and waking up in the AM.

89,"Hi, friends! Longtime Reddit lurker here. I made an account just to post this. Please help a girl out because I'm so beyond frustrated! 

Warning: this is gonna be loooong. 

I'll try my best to keep this relatively short because it's a lot. But basically I've been with my boyfriend for six years now (I'm 25 &amp; he's 27) and we are very happy together. With that being said, his family life is and has always been quite dysfunctional and it's really starting to impact our relationship. 

My boyfriend and I both live at home due to financial reasons/me being a full-time student. we spend a lot of time together and usually try to go to his house some nights and mine others. He lives with his mom, dad, and older sister (29). His family life has always been dysfunctional. His dad and mom are together only for financial reasons and don't consider themselves 'married'. The mom hates the dad and blames him for 'screwing everything up' as he is an alcoholic. As my boyfriend describes it, the household was extremely toxic growing up. With his father's drinking and his parents in a loveless 'marriage,' his childhood from as early as he can remember was always filled with hostility, open verbal abuse, drunkenness and bouts of rage. 

His older sister also struggles with alcoholism and mental health issues (depression but I suspect there may be more mood disorders). She does not work and uses social assistance to get by. However, she does not have many bills to pay because she lives at home and most of this money is spent on alcohol.

In an attempt to condense things a bit: Basically my boyfriend and his sister once had a good relationship (and her and I got along well enough), but about two or so years ago bf realized she had been stealing his things. He's a music buff &amp; a musician and so she mostly stole from his extensive CD collection and his guitar pedals/music gear in order to sell them to pawnshops for $$ so that she could then buy booze. Most of this she did when she was unemployed before starting welfare support and when she was low on money. It's estimated she's stolen around $1000 in total; as we know through talking to the used CD store in our neighbourhood that she made $400 off his cds there alone. So of course once he caught on my bf was justifiably pissed and their relationship really deteriorated. Since their relationship deteriorated, she decided to start hating me one day too. There was one night about a year ago now that she was so drunk (and also angry at my bf for something) that she peed on his bed (went through and soaked the mattress) as some sort of revenge. She's also done this in her parents' bedroom when upset with their mom about something (who is a very very passive and quiet lady). While there was tension rising before this event, ever since this night which was sort of the breaking point for my bf, she has decided to hate me with a vengeance. She began to become very vocal and when she would drink she would call me awful names through the walls (their walls are conjoined) and impersonate/mock me in high pitches ditzy voices, tell me to die etc. She was always ridiculously drunk at these points and it would be infuriating but also sad because I knew that she was essentially rambling and ranting to herself alone in this room almost incoherently. And while I feel some sympathy, it's become harder to when she consistently yells at me things like 'just go home you stupid fucking cunt' 'fucking die you fake bitch' etc. she always does this when my bf is not home (he plays hockey late some nights)/when her parents are asleep so it's only her and I awake. She also slams doors so hard the house shakes and sighs very dramatically whenever I am over and she walks by a main room like the kitchen or living room etc.

She moved out for about two months or so for the first time a while back, shortly following the pee incident. She used her social assistance to rent a room in a house with a single mother and her children. They had numerous issues right off the bat. She returned home after only a few months of being gone because one night she fell down stairs when drunk and fractured her pelvis. She returned home and was ok for the first bit but quickly returned to her old ways and ever since (more than a year) she has become more vocal in her disdain for me. I've tried to talk to her, both calmly and once fairly sternly following a night that she particularly verbally abused me, and she's pretty much shut me out. Stared at the floor, shrugged her shoulders, and acted like a stubborn teen when asked what her issue is with me and how I can help to resolve it. ""I don't know, I don't like you"" ""why?"" ""I just don't. You don't have to like everyone."" Thats the furthest I've gotten with her, and I've approached her quite a few times very calmly and from a place of just trying to hear her out and resolve things. The mother and I have (or had)a very solid relationship and would sometimes go for coffee and stuff just to talk so I think a lot of is jealousy and feeling like I am trying to replace her. She bullies her mom constantly and they have an extremely dysfunctional relationship where she uses manipulation and threats to get money or whatever it is she needs. She's actually threatened to steal more of my bf's things if the mother doesn't give in and so she usually does. The mom also acts weird around me if the sister is around and is almost rude to me. If the sister is with her when I walk in, I'll say hi and the mom will sort of mumble a 'hi' back in an annoyed tone. Then will go back to being super chipper and lovely when it's just us. I've asked her about this and she says she's just trying to keep things ok so the sister doesn't flip out and not to take it personally. ?? I get that she's trying to mitigate the situation but I truly think it's encouraging the behaviour. The reluctance to involve themselves and follow through on rules in their own house seems to just encourage this behaviour. She's very passive about the whole thing. But will complain constantly about the situation to me and I am constantly providing a shoulder to cry on so to speak. When I offer advice, it's always shrugged off. It's very frustrating to watch and I don't understand it. With that being said, I also feel sympathy for his sister. She doesn't have any real friends and is not productive. She's very lonely and very sad and isolates herself in her room most days drinking on her own. 

As for the parents' involvement in the situation 
, they essentially do nothing. I mean they try, they threaten, but nothing ever happens. They won't kick her out (the mom can't bear to do it - 'how can I do that to my kid? She'd be homeless' - and is a bit of a doormat in their relationship) and the dad is drunk a lot himself and not the most kind man. I think they've sort of just given up and almost adapted to her/the toxicity of it all. They are working class folks and don't have a ton of money and so the mom always sorts of shoots down my suggestions of rehab. The sister probably wouldn't even be into it. She's done detox once before and left the first night, threatening her mom that she would prostitute herself for cash if she didn't come pick her up. 

There is so much more to type but I feel like this is already quite a bit of information as it's a 6 year relationship, with the last two or so being filled with constant drama, and I'm trying not to totally ramble. 

What do I do, guys? This is so frustrating because I've never done anything to her and I've been very kind given the circumstances (as has my bf although he's pretty much cut her off and they don't speak anymore). I have tried to approach her, both calmly and politely and then sternly, and let her know that she can't talk to me this way etc. Nothing seems to help. It's really impacting our relationship as whenever we come over here, she's slamming the doors and starting screaming matches, and it just ruins the evening. We both get quiet and upset. My bf desperately wants to move out but is waiting for me and I can't afford it with school and he can't carry the two of us, so that isn't an option for us right now. I feel so goddamn uncomfortable being there sometimes. I didn't go there for about two months and only starting coming back over around Christmas time. This was because my being there was just becoming too much. I couldn't deal anymore. I thought the 'break' may alleviate some of the tension but almost immediately after I started coming back over the same old shit started to happen. We could stick mainly to my house but we'd see each other significantly less because my bf works weird hours and being at his house is just a lot easier on most weeknights. neither of us are happy about the current situation and we feel totally frustrated and powerless :( ",21Jan2017,2
90,"So, I haven't really talked about this with anyone except my SO. I know–I should probably go talk to a therapist. 

Sorry for this being so long too. I guess it's just my first time getting it all out like this. Writing it almost helps me collect and organize my thoughts. 

I'm not one to talk too much about issues like this. It's embarrassing, I don't want people to think they have to feel pity for me, and I don't want to hurt my image by looking damaged. 

TL:DR Had the most amazing dad growing up. Got along with him great. Then he was caught molesting my sister. Dad ran. Thought he killed himself or was in hiding...shows up at my house. 

Jesus. Sounds like a fucking soap opera episode. 
----------

I've lived a pretty average life up until a year ago (female in mid 20s). Parents were always supportive, friends were and still are awesome, I danced, I was in the band, did the college scene, siblings are all cool. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

I've always been much closer to my dad than my mom. I love my mom but personality wise, I was more like my dad. Less conservative, more outgoing, spontaneous. My mom is a bit more quiet and reserved. 


Last January, I got a call from my brother that something bad happened to my dad. He was being so vague. I asked if he (dad) was okay--and my brother just kept saying he was missing. What do you mean missing? And then, he dropped the biggest bomb on my life. My dad was being accused of child molestation...to my young sister.

It made absolutely no sense to me. 

Not my dad. 

Not my dad who I talk to every other day and who just helped me on my big move out of state. Not my dad who took me rock climbing as a kid or is the family jokester at family events. Not my goofy, lovable, smart, adventurous dad. 

The very first thought was that my sister was mistaken, but on some level I knew that couldn't be so. She wouldn't lie about something like that. And if she did lie, why was he missing? Why was he on the run? Why wasn't he doing his best to prove his innocence? Why wasn't he fighting for himself? 

And then that was it. That's what my brother left me with. I live 500 miles from my family now. No one could help me make sense of this and even if half my family wanted to be there for me, they couldn't have been. My brother didn't want to tell anyone except me and my other brother at the time (grandparents knew). My mom and my dad are separated so he didn't see a need for her to know yet. 


I only heard a little more info in the next couple of months---I heard that he went to grandparents and stole a gun and ran off in the woods. I heard he had a pretty big stash of cash. I heard he left all of his belongings back at home (phone, wallet, car). I heard he was using an old car and might be on the run. 
I never heard from a cop either. No convictions or warrants--brother kept me updated. 

Meanwhile, my world is upside down. I didn't know what to believe or how to feel. Was I allowed to feel worried for him? Because I did. I was up all night thinking how terrified and alone he must feel. I kept picturing him breaking down and trying to kill himself. And then I would shame myself for feeling sad for him...he was a bad person. I would get torn and confused and just burst out crying unsure what to feel. 

After a couple months, I'm in my house with my boyfriend watching TV and I see someone on my porch through the window. It's my dad. 

He is skinny, dirty, just different looking. He had all of this backpacking gear with him. Compass, sleeping bag, maps, etc. He had this old red truck outside. It was so surreal. I mean the most surreal thing to ever happen to me. He just came to my house after being missing and didn't say anything. (He was off the grid to be fair). My boyfriend and I talked about it privately and we decided to let him stay in the extra room until he fixed his truck (couldn't go in reverse or something). 

He stayed a few days. My boyfriend chose to stay elsewhere, but offered to help in any way needed. My dad kept asking why my SO wasn't staying at the house...
How uncomfortable for my boyfriend. How uncomfortable for me to be put in that position to choose to say no or yes face to face with my dad who needed me. He drove 500 miles to my house. He had nowhere to go. I didn't and still don't understand why my dad was confused about that. Why would my boyfriend feel okay with this situation? 

He left after a couple days, after we got the truck fixed. My dad paid for it. I was next to him when he told the mechanic a different name for himself. So surreal. So strange. 

He asked me to sign the lease on this truck so I could renew the tag and keep it on insurance...he was going to try and live off in the mountains. I said no and then he was on his way. 

On one hand, I wanted him caught. On another, I absolutely didn't. I knew how he would be treated in jail. 


Again, months went by. I was still upset, but a little more at ease. Brother came to visit me. They finally had a warrant out. 

Recently, my dad was found half alive on the side of a road. Police arrested him at the hospital. 

He calls me often from jail. 


I don't know what to do.
It's been about a year and now my feelings are changing. I don't know if I want to do this...have contact with him. It would be easier for me to just move on and get pass this. 
He's begging my family to help him make bail. The judge said he can live at a house with a monitor on now, but my grandparents are refusing to bail him out. 

When he calls me, it's just like the old days on the phone. He's still just my dad. He was never anything but an amazing dad to me. He never touched me. He never hit me. He never disrespected me. He was always just dad.

And I still don't know how I'm suppose to feel, but I'm growing less empathetic to him as time goes on. That's my little sister. How could he do that? 

My whole family knows now and all this shit is spilling. Apparently, he was molested was a child by his dad. That side of my family has a history a mental illnesses. Etc etc 

I still haven't told any of my friends. 

He just called tonight and I denied the call. 

But he's my dad. I miss him. ",21Jan2017,1

94,"Hey all, 

First my recent educational history:
I finished my B.A. (with Third Year specialization in English) in 2013. After which I did a one year PG Diploma Media course, centered around things such as journalism, broadcasting, advertising and the ilk. 

After that I spent the next few years meandering between jobs, getting into advertising and journalism followed by quickly realizing that they are not what I want to do. And while I am passionate about writing and storytelling, it doesn't offer a stable career path. 

Realized my personal fascination and interest in psychology over these years. 
I am interested in studying Clinical Psychology, but the bulk of my interest (i.e. what I might want to make a career in) lies in counselling and therapy. 

My question, of course, is regarding what I should do next, if I want to eventually complete a Doctorate in Psychology. 
I intend to spend some time relearning/revising/catching up on what I have learned in the past and missed in TYBA. 
I'd guess the next course of action is to apply to a Masters program and then get on the road to a doctorate? 

A bit lost so any advice is most welcome.

106," Hi everyone. a couple of days ago I was on my way to the skate park and I was walking  around  the corner to it  I got within  about  200 ft I could see a big fight was going down  and about after 5 seconds I could  see it was a friend of mine getting beaten up badly by a girl! I immediately stopped and froze because  I couldn't believe what I was seeing!. She had him pinned down and was punching  and pounding him hard everywhere she could! It was some intense shit and he was groaning and shit saying ""stop"" the other kids looked really nervous  too. Anyway not long later she finally let him go and he took off limping running  down the street. By this time I snuck away  around the other side of the park so nobody would see me especially him.
I just walked  around in a state of nervous shock for about 7 or 8 min because my mind was blown, until I decided  to  go to his house and check on him, and as I was walking  down his driveway I could hear him crying in his garage..! Man that total floored me  and fucked with my head so I  got out of there because I didn't want to confront him about it. I ended up going  back to the park and the girl and her friend where leaving and I was still nervous as shit,  but  I saw another kid I know and he said he wiped out on his board and fell on her breaking her board and that's how the whole thing started.. He said they both went at it good and he got in a number of punches but once she got him down to the ground in  rear sort of headlock she wasted him and beat  him up  bad. I  told him I seen the last min of it but I didn't  want him knowing  that I saw it so I took of a bit down the other  sidewalk.  It's so fucked  up because  he said  u could  her him sobbing  as he was leaving and she was calling him a ""pussy  bitch"" and other stuff. He said he didn't know who she was and probably went to a different school then us and asked if I saw some his blood on her shirt and jeans as  she was leaving but I didn't. He even left his board there because  he was so scared, so the kid gave it to me to hold onto.  That's  what's  so messed up is because  he's  one of the last kids i would think would  ever get beat up by a girl especially that bad. And the girl wasn't some big birtha,  she was about average size and not bad looking, she looked a lot like Kristen  Stewart  to me actually.. well anyway I texted him he seems fine but I didn't bring up that I have his board or anything. Eventually soon I'm gonna have to give it to him, but how should I  go about doing  so? Should I let him tell me about what happened because it's going to be obvious once we go back to shool every kid that was there will be blabbering about it.

119,"Ok so this is a bit of a long story, my life has kind of turned upside down in the past 6 months and I need some advice on where to go next.


So this past summer I was a full time student and worked full time at a sales job which I enjoyed and thrived in. I was the leading salesman for the entire year. We had an assistant manager who was a giant douche that nobody liked or respected besides one kiss ass who would suck up to him constantly. The assistant manager constantly makes up stories about fake girls he's slept with, takes shirtless pics and posts them on Facebook, and is the most selfish conceited person I have ever met. I literally have never disliked anyone more than this guy and most of my co workers feel the same exact way he's a power hungry sociopath who manipulates people to get ahead.


I am not a kiss ass and I never sucked up to the guy, I made it no secret that I didnt like the guy, I wouldn't take any of his bull shit for a few reasons 1. I knew how valuable I was to the company and 2. I was really good friends with the manager and I knew my job was safe.
So fast forward to this past October and I start having memory issues, anxiety, joint pain, sleep problems, fatigue, and all kinds of crazy symptoms. Turns out I had/have chronic lyme disease. I was in a really bad place, I dropped out of school and I know my work 
performance suffered too. I explained to my bosses what was going on and obviously my friend was understanding but the assistant manager of course told me ""business is business and we need you to performe"" and he's been pretty cold to me while my entire life is falling apart, but it really didnt bother me too much because I had bigger fish to fry.


Well lets fast forward to a few weeks ago and my friend left the job and the assistant manager was named the manager and the kiss ass was names assistant manager.
My performance has improved greatly since starting treatment and I'm somewhat back to being my old self and I am once again the leading salesman. My problem is my god damn manager and assistant manager are the biggest weenies on the planet and just scape goat me for every single problem, it drives me crazy. I just hate being around them hearing there douchey conversations. I hate my job now.


Now, Im sure your thinking just quit and get a new job. But this job pays pretty well for someone that doesn't have a degree and I need the money to pay for treatment because insurance does not cover lyme treatment after the first month. I really don't know what to do, should I try to get by with a job making less money or should I just tough it out and get healthy before i quit.

Since I've been feeling better, I thought I would try and see if being drunk still makes me feel like that and it does. When I'm at a party, all I can think about is every thing I've ever done wrong and how much life is pointless and I can't look forward to anything. I sit there and think of all the ways I want to die. It's always a big set back because I convinced myself I was better then after a night like that it's hard to get myself out of bed again. I've never heard of this before in regards to someone with depression and I was just wondering if it was normal?

134,"I was expecting to finish my studies this year so that I could finally apply to my dream job, which is being a flight attendant for a very important Middle Eastern airline. I always dreamed of living abroad, seeing the world and living in a developed country, and though I have everything I need financially and a loving family, I can't help feeling my life sucks most of the time because since my best friend stopped talking to me two months ago my social life close to nil. I have been feeling depressed and I was seeing this as the opportunity I desperately needed to finally turn my life around. Now my parents suddenly need a loan from me, which I can't deny in light of their situation, but I'm giving them the money I had set aside for paying my school fees (which I was a little bit behind with) and taking a subject that will only be offered on summer lessons and not during the regular semester (my school is small). Not taking this subject will cause me to hang one more year in school only because of that subject and its sequel. I was going to be 26 when I graduate, now I will be 27. I could still apply at that age, but the thing is, I can't wait. Like I said, I can't help feeling my life sucks (though I feel bad for feeling that in spite of having a loving family, health and food on the table), and I feel I desperately need a change. I want to be out NOW. I could wait this year, but waiting till next year will be too much for me. Besides, some of my family members make me worse when I talk to them about my plans by asking me if I'm thinking of marrying at all.",21Jan2017,1

138,"I've had the worst of luck growing up, as a child I would play online games and I would date pedophiles, not knowing it wasn't normal for a 9 year old to be with a 20+. Alongside of this, my parents were in a messed-up cult, being obsessed with it and manipulating me into feeling worthless, and also they would beat me for the smallest of things. When I was 13 I had a relationship with another 21 years old guy, and he made me feel useless when I didn't want to sext him. Eventually we broke up, but then I got together with a guy that would do things against my will, touch me when I told him not to, and then he would tell me I didn't love him and stuff like that. It went on for 2 years. It got as close to rape as it can, but we never had sex, still he would do other things. I got post traumatic stress disorder from him, I would see his face in random people suddenly, and I would see things that weren't there, thinking they'd touch me against my will like he did. I still suffer from flash backs, I'm 19 now. I've wanted to kill myself several times. I've got a lot of anger in my life because I've been used by every single person I thought cared about me. Right now I can't go to school because I get flashbacks from my ex boyfriend, and I don't fel safe. Since I grew up with parents in a cult I was a part of it, so those people in there were the only ones I knew. They are all fake and lying and hurting each other to gain status, and I thought that was the normal society. 

My entire picture of humanity is screwed up, every single person I've came cross has abused me. I'm super naive so I give them chances over and over but they keep on hurting me. I finally cut my ties to the cult some months ago, and that helped a lot with my moodswings.

Still I feel like I have nothing to live for. I have happy moments, but they get darkened by these pedophiles I constantly keep running into, or just guys that want to use me.

And I am now seeing a therapist but I keep letting him back into my life because of pressure from my other relatives every time I cut him out. He belittles me and tears me down and he thinks it is funny. I try to approach it logically and say things like ""Dad, please don't talk to me like that, it hurts me."" And his general response, get ready, ""I can talk to you however the fuck I want motherfucker, you are my fucking son."" ""You think you are entitled to some sort of respect?"" And it just escalates. I have been making a decision to just walk away from him when he acts like this or leave my parents house. My therapist says that is perfect, because I am worth something. I would like to hear your thoughts on entitlement? Thoughts on if I am or humans are ""deserving"" of respect? I try not to act entitled but I don't want to be his doormat.

Let me provide you with a bit of information before I give the options.

I have 6 two ringed binders (smaller), and I have 3 three ringed binders (bigger), but i have dividers for these.
At home I have a two hole holepuncher,
 at school there are only three hole holepuncher.

Note: I'd preferably like to get this process done before school starts again

Option 1) I punch all my papers with 2 holes and get it done now.
Problem: When ever I get any sheets at school I would have to wait until I get home to be able to hole punch them.

Option 2) I punch all my papers with 3 holes, so that when I get sheets at school I can hole punch immediately
 Problem: I can only get 3 ringed binders at school (more pricey than 2 rings), and I would have to bring all these sheets into school and punch them there.

141,"As I stated in the title, I have this deep seated hatred of small dogs in me and I don't know why. 

I have grown up with dogs all my life but they've always been big dogs. Whenever I meet big dogs, even ones with nervous or aggression issues, we're always instant best friends.

But for some reason whenever I meet a small dog I feel an incredible desire to kick it and I don't know why and it makes me feel guilty.

I think it might have to do with the idea of small dog syndrome because so many small dog owners let their dogs get away with everything and treat them like babies. So whenever I meet one it always has an ""I own everything"" attitude even if it's not yappy or anything.

But that shouldn't make me feel a desire to hurt it?

This has never really been a direct issue in my life until I started seeing this girl who has 2 wiener dogs, and she 100% has small dog syndrome. One isn't so bad, but the other acts like such a spoiled brat and when I scold her on her discipline habits she'll keep up the changes for like a day before reverting back to before.

She'll send me snapchats of her lying in bed with the dogs crawling all over her and digging in the sheets and stuff captioned ""my babies"" or some shit like that and I become filled with instant rage.

Does anyone else have something like this? Or suggestions on how to fix this? I don't think I should feel this angry over badly behaved dogs, especially cause I never feel this angry over badly behaved big dogs. Only little ones. Not sure what to do.

Thanks for listening.

She doesn't like to talk about stuff she's very upset about and avoids letting anyone see her cry. She's been with this guy for awhile now who won't commit. He enjoys being with her and seems super sweet, loves hanging out with our friend group, but says a past relationship scared him from the word ""girlfriend."" For my roommate, this is difficult because he's the first guy in a long time she deems worthy of the word ""boyfriend.""

So last night. She wasn't home when I got home around 1am, which is unusual, so I texted her to make sure she was safe. She said she was with this guy, so I headed to bed. We share a bedroom. I got a text around 2:30 that she was headed home, which is really unusual considering the hour and that she'd usually just stay over at that point. 

Well, when she did get home, she didn't come into our bedroom until about 30 minutes later. I woke up a when she did, and she had turned on ""Dear John"" by Taylor Swift quietly and was listening to it repeatedly while hugging a bear this guy got her and sobbing to herself. I didn't think asking her if she was okay at 4am while she was clearly not was appropriate, so I rolled over and tried to sleep. 

What do I do? Should I ask her if something happened when she gets up? If I tell her I heard her last night, am I insensitive for not saying anything?

156,"Now the situation isn't as straightforward as the title obviously.

A year and a couple of months ago I left college because I couldn't afford it, it was making me depressed and suicidal because I knew how much it was hurting my mom to help me. We have never had much money and she always did everything she could to get me a good education.

So I started working in a warehouse to help my mom pay rent on the house because her boyfriend left. After a couple of months my mom had a massive heart attack, I spend 8 weeks watching my mom drift away until she finally passed. This was 8 months ago.

Now I am trying to get back into school, but I have no idea where to start, I have no money and no skills to get a decent job to pay for school. All I have is my intelligence from the education my mom worked so hard for me to have. It doesn't help that my depression caused me to fail my last set of classes so I can't get into a university until I take a few classes at a community college. I have thought about the community college route but that won't be possible since I am majoring in mechanical engineering and no community college that I have seen has any engineering programs.

I almost forgot about my dad, he could help but he won't. He was never really a major part of my life. Trust me I have talked and pleaded with him.

I guess I just feel so hopeless, this is one of the last places I thought of to turn to for help. I know reddit is a wealth of people and information, so any advice on what I could do would be greatly appreciated.

Me and my friend realized that if we do the amount of work we been doing the last couple of months we will graduate and i will graduate way earlier because i  never failed a class he failed all of his since freshman year, but here's the thing i still wanted to do school because i wanna do  college so what i wanna do is do all the classes i can in this program for this year and my senior year go back and do classes i couldn't do in that program because it does hands on learning like physics and band 
Because those are requirements for college and stuff can i do that? Will they let me instead of graduating or will i be forced to graduate also is it a good idea? When i told my friend  he got all really upset about it but i still want to go to college he doesn't .he's family has enough money  to 
Let him live with them comfortably until  he's 30 while i live in a family with a bunch of problems so i wanna make enough to move out on my own

161,"I accepted a job on Craigslist.  It's a cleaning job, but he needs me to run errands for him.  I haven't met the guy yet, supposedly he is moving to the city near me and wants me to get the place ready by cleaning and purchasing groceries/etc.  

He mails me a check.  It is almost 10x my pay.  I just deposited it because he tells me it is the correct amount.  After that, he wants me to send about $2000 to (sorry for racial profiling) a Mexican in California.  He says it is for furniture.  This is where things get sketchy.

I looked my guy up and couldn't find him on Facebook.  It could be a fake name he gave me.  His phone number is in a different state, could be a burner.  I looked up the guy in California and found the guy I was looking for.  He was a cook, nothing about furniture.  California, Arizona, and Colorado have money restrictions because of drugs.  So I am thinking this might be drug related.  I want no part.  

I tell him I will not send the money to California.  He urges me to send the money quickly.  Now he urges me to send the money back to him so he can purchase it.

This reminds me of another scam.  They send you a check for ""too much money"", you deposit it.  The next day you send him money back.  They withdraw the money, then their original check bounces and you are now negative in your account.  

So I worry that if I send money to him or the guy in California that it might be a scam and the check bounces.  

Here is a list of things I don't like about it:
* He didn't tell me I would be sending money, only cleaning.

* I have never met/seen him (or Facebook), he could be using a fake name.

* I have never seen the apartment, I don't even know if it exists.

* The guy in California (drug state) looks very much like he sells drugs (sorry for racial profiling). 

* The urgency in which he wants me to send money, this gives a few days before the check bounces. 

* He sent a printed check signed ""Autograph"" with an address from a P.O. Box. 

Important *: He told me to send the money back to him, then tried to trick me in sending it to the other guy. 

* Why couldn't he just write a check to the other dude when he was writing a check to me, unless he didn't want to use his own name when buying drugs.  

* He told me the key was arriving at my place tomorrow.  Then after I told him I don't want to send it, he told me the key hasn't been sent yet.  

This seems all very sketchy from what should have been a ""clean my house"" into a ""buy things for me"".  

I want to return his money.  However, I am scared that I might send it back and discover a week or two later that his check bounced.  Because of this, I want to wait a while before I send him his money back to make sure the check settles.  But at the same time, say the check was real, I do not want to get into legal trouble for having his money.",21Jan2017,1

167,"Several years ago, I moved places to where I am still there to join a primary school where it would be my last year before I move onto high school. Whilst in primary school, I met this wonderful girl called Gibi (not her actual name) who was a year below me and during my time there we spent a lot of time together. I mean a lot. Most of the time during the week, we would spend time with each other outside of school whether it would be outside, at my house or commonly at hers. 

Despite us not bringing up the topic personally, everyone around us including her friends thought we were going out yet we denied all of the allegations and just called each other friends, although on Valentines day I was her 'secret' valentine, and I didn't think much about it at the time, but looking back now I defiantly had something for her, and as a result of founding out later that day after school I went to her house and left a card and some other items. 

According to her friends, on the last day of primary school where an annual presentation is held talking about what everyone's future ambitions her, apparently she cried. In the first year of high school, we still communicated via Facebook, however, I cannot entirely remember if we met in person again. At one point, I realised that she deleted me and ever since we haven't talked. I'm at the stage now of high school where I'm nearly finished but still got another year to go. Within school, we often see each other and briefly make quick, but very deep eye contact, however, I shortly look away because I feel awkward after we haven't talked in years and she deleted me. I really miss talking and spending time with her because she is the only person I've really connected with and spent the most time with her as an introvert. As cringy as that sounds, it is very much true as I don't have any 'proper' friends in high school apart from one person.

I don't know why she deleted me, especially after how much we connected and spent time together. I would really like to know your opinion on this and I would appreciate some advice on what I should do.

184,"So, i've had this guy in my life for a year or so now and since being together at the start I've told my mum about him. She wanted to meet and see the guy to see how he was like and to know that he wasn't someone I was potentially fucking around with. After meeting him, she was happy to see how he was and classed him as a nice guy. So, from then onwards, it sort of became a regular thing where we called him over to our house occassionally to know a bit more about each others families and so on. Now, you need to bare in mind that only my mum, and two brothers knew and not my dad. Being a girl, I was the type to tell my mum everything because I was genuingly closer and comfortable with her. So, days went on and due to some issues and paranoia about my dad finding out my mum didnt allow me to go out to see him. It had been a long time, so I thought Id try asking and when I got a no, I flipped because of the frustration I had inside. 

This made my mum turn angry at the point where she rang my dad telling me that shes going to tell him that Im going out for a guy"". So dad comes rushing home after and mum angrily bickers that I want to go because of someone aka him, but obviously my dad didnt understand the way mum was hinting.  Thats when things fired up and I was trapped in my room with a lot of barling and words thrown at me. I was getting so worried, I thought to myself, since things are already building up, I might as well tell my dad I have someone. So I slowly told him how I knew the time wasn't right but I had someone. He seemed calm at this point and was listening and told me to give his number to see if he actually was a man. So, I gave him awkwardely and things seemed abit calm until night. I was trying to get some sleep from all the headache I had from earlier when my dad comes into my room and turns the light on. I was blinded by it but the way things happened after I dont think I cared. 

He randomly started shouting at the top of his voice telling me how dare someone step into the house like that, why didnt anyone tell me and then ontop of that he was saying really filthy and negative things about my boyfriend and his family.  Now, the main thing here to point out is that Im Pakistani, and the guy I was with was Bengali, so we were both from different backgrounds and this seemed to bug my dad alot. He was just swearing continuosly, it was all just a shock. The next day he unexpectdatly found out his address and paid a visit to his house to speak to his parents, which was his mum and sisters in this case. He went there so he could barl and tell them to make his son stop and end ties with me. Now, this made me feel like shit the way he was assuming they were bad people and was going off at them when they hadnt done nothing. 

He even threatened to them that if their son didnt end things with me they'd see my picture in the papers saying im no more. From this, you can see how much my dad didnt want me having a link with them. The gifts that I had recieved for my birthday from him, he had also taken away and threatened he would burn those things infront of his house. I was given a Michael Kors watch and Timberlands and both those things my boyfriend had worked his ass off for. I have been annoyed about this because his taken those things off me and I want them back, especially knowing that they arent inexpensive things. After this incident, it has been many times his been telling people whats happened and his given me a bad impression including my mum just because she knew it all and didnt tell him. But as you can see, judging by the consequence, no matter when we would tell him he was still going to go psycho, due to him being bengali and of another culture. His mentally doing me and I dont know what to do and who to go to for advice, so I thought Id post something and perhaps get some sort of relief that I do have someone. The main issue here is how his from a different background but the way we are, I can say that hands down we are really serious and mature about one another.  just dont know what to do and feel as though I'll never get my way in.

186,"I wasn’t given the time I needed to figure out my career path after dropping out of the Game Production degree. I thought it was something I would enjoy, which I did, but the reality of it hit me and I called it quits.
When I wanted to call it quits on the film degree, I could not call it quits and had to endure it, because my parents wanted me to keep going.

My classmates from January 2016 to the present are dickheads with the exception of a few.
I really started to think about football again a few months ago and how I really want to get back into it. I felt like I had so much more potential in high school, now that I have the heart to start caring about it again, with the addition of having lasik surgery. I also can control my anger, and I can unleash it anytime I wish. I also learned the importance of being persistent. I want closure. I know I have potential and love for the sport. I also am feeling very nostalgic about high school and the good times I had there. I really want to get back into the social settings I was once in, compared to the shit-hole I am in right now. I want to go to a college where I can have lots of friends and meet girls. LAFS doesn’t allow me to experience that college life. I want to experience what others are doing my age.

I desperately want to move out from my parents house and live with a friend or soulmate.

I want to get a job that I enjoy that it’s not my parents workplace. I dread working there now, because of repetition, people constantly leaving every 3 months, having to train new people, and my bosses being my parents. I see my parents most of the day.

I never have been lucky with girls, and I have invested so much time into them but it never goes right.

My friends don’t really keep in touch anymore, because of the school barrier.

I don’t have much opportunities to talk about myself

I want a routine life, but I can’t do it with my parents with me.

I want to finally master driving but I still haven’t mastered a few things.

I have ADHD and it’s hard to pay attention sometimes.

I have difficulty trusting people because of constant betrayal and inauthenticity.

I want to go outside, but I can’t drive. Therefore I resort to just staying home.

I have Uber, but my dad doesn’t let me use it on an everyday basis because it’s expensive and my mom will catch on. My mom doesn’t want me to have an uber.

I want a friend to work out with me at the gym.

I want to escape living with my parents, but not alone. I really want a bestfriend or girlfriend to be with me. 

I am very late to learning to be social. I’ve always been socially challenged. I don’t know where it rooted from, but 
I fluctuate a lot socially.

I turn down hanging out with friends when I feel shitty.

I hate having awkward silences when hanging out with people.

I feel like I’m late with a lot of things in life and I constantly need to play catch-up.

I always fantasize about changing the past. 

I’m paranoid easily and assume the darkest sides of people.

My mom always expects me to get good grades and go to all my classes, when I don’t mind settling for a lower 
grade, and go to the classes I feel is necessary. 

I desperately want to fix my social awkwardness. I hate that I can’t keep conversations going.

I’m super mono tone and feel emotionless. 

I don’t know what career path I want to take, and it’s stressing me out.

I feel anxiety when I want to have free time, because of the fear of not doing something more important not getting done.

I’m not good at talking to people who have more power over me, I cower over it and I ask others for help, instead of asking myself. Sometimes, even when it’s bullshit I don’t seek justice because I know I’d lose.

A lot of things I don’t think I can do by myself and I mostly as others for help. Most of the time I have to decide for myself.

188,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old male; currently in the first year of college.

As the title suggests, I feel extremely embarrassed at the low, low levels of sex drive I have. I mean, I masturbate often, like once a day or twice. But honestly? Those 15-20 minutes watching porn and jerking are the only moments I feel 'horny'. Guys in my peer group are like talking about chicks, boobs, etc virtually all the time and I have to feign interest to not feel left out.

Do i get erections? Of course, no reason boners all the time. When I wake up, like clock work. But that isn't what I'm talking about, if you know. Am I attracted to women? Yes.  But I won't be lying if i said i'm a bit curious. However, in that case, I should be aroused/horny while thinking of men - and that is certainly NOT the case in any way, shape or form.

I don't know what the reason for this is. To top it all off, I have a gf who is really, really kinky and horny 24/7 (though our relationship is complicated, I had a post about this on r/advice) and I feel so unmanly when I coldly respond to her sext initiations. In fact so many times I fake it. That itself carries guilt, but at least she doesn't know.

I don't know why I am like this. I reason it to myself daily - mental preoccupation with depression, of which I have been suffering for 5 years now; dissatisfaction with academic and creative growth as an individual; or maybe just stress? IDK. What do I do? I'm the guy, shouldn't I be craving sex and being the one initiating it towards my gf?? I feel weird and uncomfortable about how non sexual I am as a person. It makes me feel abnormal. People watch music videos with the girls showing ass and tits and are like ""DAYYAMM""; I just watch it and go on with my day.

192,"A friend of mine I met around eight years ago in school is severely (class 3)obese.  As far as I know, weight has always been an issue for her, though no one else in her family shows signs of having similar issues.  I also know that she has been battling depression for quite some time.  Her weight itself isn't the issue  I wish to speak to her about, other than fearing for her health, but rather her behavior towards others in connection to her weight, and safety issues relating to it.

I too would be classified as obese (class 1), and I know how hard dealing with the weight both physically and emotionally can be.  However, the issues concerning her weight and behavior have become problematic enough for me that I feel I either need to say something, or limit my interaction with her. 

One direct issue we run into when she and I go out anywhere, is that she tends not to fit into chairs or other seats wherever it is we are going. I feel bad for her, especially knowing that she is embarrassed by this happening. However, invariably her response is to blame the people who are serving us, and treat them poorly as a result. It doesn't matter to her that they are not responsible for the size of the chairs (which are never actually that small), she still treats them like they are at fault. She has refused to tip waiters and has nothing good to say to them despite their amazing service, because she does not fit comfortably into any of the seating.  Similarly, if we are seated in a place like a concert hall or movie theater in which others are seated closely to us, she blames people next to her who wish to move because they do not have enough space for themselves with her next to them. During one occasion, she did not fit into the seat at all at an opera hall, and she and I were made to sit off to the side instead where we could not see much of what was happening on stage.  On the one hand I again felt bad for her, and knew it must have been terribly embarrassing, but I couldn't help but be upset that I was mostly missing a show I had paid quite a bit to see, and would not have the chance to see again anytime soon. I also feel bad for having felt that way at all. I could have still sat in my seat without her, but I did not feel that was the right thing to do either. 

Another time, three of us were seated in a row with five chairs, and two were taken up by other people.  I sat between our other friend and her, while she had the last chair. The chairs, unfortunately, could not be moved from where they were.  Because of her weight, she only fit on half of her chair. She demanded that I switch with her, so that I'd be the one with only half a chair, even though I fit just fine on a single chair otherwise. Later I ended up sitting a row behind them because even when we had four of the five chairs to ourselves, she sat such that she took up part of the chair to her left, her chair, and part of the one I was to sit in.  Whenever I'd ask if she could scoot over a bit (since there was still space in the chair to her left), she'd react as though I was asking something horrible of her, and she'd slowly scoot back over time until she was taking up part of my chair again.

Her weight has also had an impact on my safety while I'm driving.  I usually drive her and I places when we get together, and anyone else in the group, because my car is the only one that can fit more than one person in it. She is constantly complaining that my car is not suitable for larger people (everyone else says it's very spacious.)  On a few occasions while driving, she has shifted in her seat so roughly, that her weight and sudden movement have caused my car to veer partially into other lanes. It frightens me and sets me on edge trying to be prepared for that when I'm driving with her in the car. 

She has also shown little care for damage she does to the property of others when it is the result of her weight, such as sitting in chairs she knows are not rated to hold her, or she'll even sit on other people's coolers while camping, warping them and rendering them useless. If they become upset at the damage to their property, she'll claim she didn't know it could happen. She has also demanded that people give up their larger, sturdy camp chairs that they brought for their own comfort, so she can sit in it while they sit in whatever narrower chair she brought along, if she brought one at all.

I understand that how she treats others in these situations may be connected to her depression, but it is hard to watch her treat people that way, and I'm tired of her treating me in a similar fashion.  Whether she gains, loses, or stays the same weight isn't going to impact my desire to be her friend, but her behavior will.

Sometimes I've tried to guide her towards a nicer response to others without outright saying ""you're being rude,"" but it never seems to work. My mother actually once told my friend that she was being rude to our servers at a restaurant, and my friend left then texted me that what my mother said was ""unforgivable."" 

Do I bring any of this up with her, or just continue to try and ignore it? Alternatively, should I just distance myself from her? If I do bring it up, what might be a good way to do so? What would be appropriate if I do bring it up and she gets angry with me like she did with my mother? Would it be fair of me to ask that she not move around in her seat if I am driving her somewhere?",21Jan2017,1
199,"Hello,
I was in public speaking class a day ago. When I was writing my speech i thought it would be a good idea to flip a table and make a scene for added effect. I thought it would be good. I was wrong -_- So very wrong! Everyone laughed, probably at me not with me and a lot of people looked at me weird and asked why I did it. The teacher laughed as well but he then stood up and made me sit down(and pick up the table) He wasnt that mad though and he did like the speech. I dont care what he thinks I care what everyone else thinks. What am I supposed to do, Im fairly sure Im going to get teased for a while when I go in Monday morning and I think a lot of people think I have mental issues, which I dont. Im just a horrible comedian :( Im really nervous and want to punch myself repeatedly in the face. What should my next move be to not look like the stupid idiot of the year?

207,"I'm really into this sort-of-close friend of mine. We had several classes together last year (freshman year in college). We hit it off a lot of times in class and in discussion (when we had class together), and there was some chemistry (quite literally because we both took chemistry) but since we're different majors we started drifting apart since we have different classes. I've tried reaching out via Facebook and she's responded positively to meeting up, but when I tried responding (almost immediately after), the message (on Facebook) goes to delivered/sent and not read (so I'm certain she's not ignoring me; I also haven't said anything off putting now or in the past, we're just pretty good friends). She rarely goes on social media, not to mention the fact that she commutes to/from college so it's more difficult to find her on campus, and not to mention different schedules. I really think there's something here and want to know her better, but the logistics are more difficult to figure out. What should I do, to reach out more effectively without seeming needy/desperate/stalker-ish?",21Jan2017,1
208,"Hey guys, so I'd like some advice here if possible. Awhile back me and this girl kinda had a thing going. We would text and message constantly and then we started hanging out. Then one night after a movie we kissed. She told me she liked me and I definitely liked her. Well after awhile she just seemed to have lost interest and eventually we just stopped talking because she was constantly working and eventually ended up with her ex again and had since left that dude. Well anyway I really miss this girl and I've been wanting to see if she'll hang out again because I still really like her but I don't know if messaging her is a good idea. Could you guys give me some advice? Thanks.

210,"My 8 month old german shepherd puppy is housebroke, I have had her since she was 6 weeks old. We have two 8 month old shepherd pups, one is very well behaved, the other needs lots of attention and has some behavioral problems, possibly related to the fact she was taken from her mother and litter mates too young. But regardless, I need help. Today she has peed in the house three times. Twice right in front of the back door where she knows she goes out to potty. We have bells on the back door too. Why is she doing this?  Also, she has this issue where, first it was shadows and any kind of light, she would dig and pounce and bite at it and get mad that she couldn't get it. She would pee randomly during these times too. Now she has moved on to just digging at certain places in the carpet, regardless of shadows or light. I thought perhaps the cat peed there and she was trying to get to it. So I cleaned the carpet and solved that issue, so I thought. Then, she tore up the couch in one spot and continues to try and get to a spot under there. I sniffed it out and I think the cat peed there too. So the couch is now out of the house as of today. And now the peeing issue. What is wrong with my dog. I have OCD and am very peculiar about how things are and cleaned and I am having a hard time with this.

212,"I am a 28 year old guy trying to figure out which school to go to. A little bit about myself: I am 28 years old and I have a BS in Geology, BS in Environmental Science and a BA in Spanish. I currently work for a consulting firm as a Construction Inspector II. I am a dual citizen (Chilean and American) and I know Spanish and English fluently. I am planning on taking the Geologist in Training this upcoming March as well.
The ordeal is that I was accepted to a couple schools that I really like but cannot make up my mind which one to attend. These are the two schools: 1. The University of Magallanes in Punta Arenas, Chile for a M.S. in Glaciology (emphasis on Antarctic Sciences). 2. Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in Monterey Bay. (M.S. in Marine Science with a focus on Geological Oceanography).
There's some financial pros and cons to both schools which affect my decision as well. I did not attain any scholarships from neither one but I was told by both schools I could eventually apply for a TA assistanship. California is very expensive to live in (what scares me the most since Monterey is very expensive). The school is somewhat expensive as well at about 24,000 for the entire program, loans I'll have to take. And the program takes three years. I'm scare of loans since I already have 11k in student loan debt from my Undergrad studies.
The Chilean school takes two years and only costs 3,000 dollars for the entire program. The one thing that scares me is that If I ever decide to comeback to the US and work here, that my Masters will not be accepted since it's from Chile.
I love Geology/Environmental Science and both schools offer the education I am pursuing. After my studies I would like to find work in Climate Change research as a Geoscientist. I am also open to pursue my Phd if the right opportunity presents itself.
Lately I have been leaning towards Univ of Magallanes since it takes less time and very much less funds (I miss it too). I just want some professional opinions from the experts. In the end of it all I simply want to contribute to research and do what makes me happy and follow the path that gives me the most purpose.
