13,"I've finally came to the realization after talking to a friend that all the guys I've associated with took advantage of my situation. I grew up being damaged due to sexual, mental, and emotional abuse from my family. So I've always kept things to myself and stayed in isolation. I grew to like being being by myself, just not alone because I am human and we're built to need socialization... 

Anyways, throughout these past 7 years, I've met guys (still never had a boyfriend) and they all seemed pretty nice at first. Fun to talk to and chill as friends. Eventually, they took advantage of me, knowing that I don't really go out and I don't have any friends, either. They pressured me into emotional entanglements and promote sexual contact because I am a virgin... I refused them all and eventually lost them as friends. I'm not sure how to feel about this but I feel like a loser.

14,"So I just finished my freshman year of college and I was able to pass all my second semester classes but one. I had a really bad case of mono halfway through the semester (was in the hospital twice) and I guess I never really caught up in physics so I failed the class. But here's the thing, I met with my physics professor once I got back from being sick and she was very understanding and she said I should still try my best (which I of course did) but that she would pass me with a grade of D. So you can understand my confusion as I logged into my school account this week to see that I have a final grade of F in the class. I emailed the professor two days ago and still haven't gotten a reply. I'm not sure if this is the sub I should be posting in but does anyone have any advice to help me out?

Thanks.",17May2017,1

16,"So there is this guy who has been on my nerves lately and I feel like I have valid reasons. I'd like to preface that if you feel like I'm out of place, tell me, I'm welcoming to a change in perspective.

A few weeks ago this guy who I will call ""A"" started talking to me. He overheard me talking about KPop and decided to talk to me about it. We are in a gifted class together and he began talking to me during lunch when I would eat in the gifted classroom in an attempt to find some quiet. For whatever reason I suppose he finds interest in me. 

My memory is blurry but within a week or so I began to notice that at the end of one of my classes we share together he would wait, holding the door for everyone until I walked out (he will wait literally two minutes...I know because I was held back talking to my teacher and he just stood there), and would talk to me as we both walked to our choir class. Disregarding if I have my earbuds in, he would forcibly talk to me. 

Then, in choir, every day without fail he began to walk with me after class to the gifted room for lunch. As I tried to work on my homework or studying he would sit next to me (even though there were plenty of open seats) and talk to me. 

Perhaps he just wants a friend. I don't blame him for that. (Although when I say I want to work on studying, that means don't continue talking to me the entire period.)

A little while later, at a choir competition where we are there all day, he sat down next to me and began talking to me a lot even though I was clearly watching Netflix on my phone.  

Everything has consistently continued. He holds the door for me, he has found my class period and held the door for me even though he wasn't in my class, and has gone so far as to pick up my backpack/lunchbox and puts my backpack /on my back/ despite me clearly feeling uncomfortable and telling him every time that I've got it. 

The other day he followed me out of school after class to my friend's car who was giving me a ride home. And only started to walk away after I got in my friend's car and said ""Bye A""

I don't entirely know if he is interested in me romantically. He's told me numerous times in our one sided passing period conversations that he is asexual though so I know it isn't a sexual attraction. Romantic though? I'm not sure. 

He has been kind and supportive of me at times. I appreciate that. I'm just overwhelmed with his persistency when I hadn't reciprocated. Had he been a bit more considerate of my personal space and needs then maybe a friendship could've bloomed naturally.

He also has a habit of feeding off of my depression. He will tell me pessimistic, people-hating comments because I can tell he thinks it'll resonate with me. It doesn't. ""Ugh I hate all of these people."" ""I saw a girl cutting in the hall"" (he says in an expectant voice...for what, I don't know). ""Why is your suffering so relatable?"" It pisses me off. Yeah I'm obviously not the happiest person but don't use it as a trend please. 

A bit about his personality is that he is socially awkward. Which is fine, I honestly don't care about that. He has a tendency to give people death glares. He doesn't smile in pictures, ever. His dark black hair almost always hangs in front of his face. He's quite muscular but very lanky. 

All of that is fine. What gets me is that he pushes people in the halls. He has slapped someone (full on SLAP in the face) in front of me. He has pushed people against the wall to get them out of my way. 

I'm sorry but violence and hurting others just freaks me out and doesn't fly well in my eyes. 

It also has me worried about my safety even though I do believe he is harmless.

Today he said he didn't know how to describe us ""as a unit"" and has been trying to find me after class in an attempt to schedule times to hang out this summer. 

I feel like a bitch in being annoyed. I feel like a bitch avoiding him. I just have tried to give so many queues of feeling uncomfortable but he's not getting it. Even directly telling him to stop certain things hasn't worked. 

I don't want to hurt his feelings but he is so fucking taxing. 

What do you think? Should I put up with it? If not, what do I do? 

Thank you. I apologize for grammatical errors. ",17May2017,2
19,"My boyfriend and I are both Reddit users. We have both talked about our usernames before because we have showed each other reddit posts in the past and he has always told me what his reddit username was. I rarely check his Reddit because he mostly posts about gaming or school stuff, nothing too exciting. Today, I was scrolling through Reddit and decided to look him up, just to see what he has been posting, since I haven't been on in awhile. He had a recent post about needing to borrow money, and how he needed it asap. I texted him, told him I saw the post and wanted to make sure he wasn't in any kind of trouble. He got really upset and defensive, telling me that he doesn't have to tell me everything and that I am always asking about every move he makes. He is essentially mad at me now, because he said I was keeping tabs on him and that I need to back off. Am I in the wrong here?

23,"Currently a second year in community college, trying to transfer to UCLA and UC Berkeley as a mechanical engineer. With my major, it was really important to me that I get into those universities.

I was a moron in high school with no goals, which is why I ended up in CC. But I pulled things around and studied my ass off for the past 2 years, and I've managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA both in general and STEM units. But this semester kicked my ass. Engineering physics, multivariable calc, etc, all at once, and I've ended up with a 3.0 GPA for this semester, bringing my total GPA down to barely a 3.8, just a tenth of a point shy of a 3.7. Which isn't bad perse, but considering its the AVERAGE GPA for engineering transfer students, and I don't have a single extra curricular activity to my name, I'm basically fucked. What do I do? I was supposed to apply this year fall.",17May2017,1
24,"I'm a recent college grad that has ran into a financial roadblock so I need some advice. In December I graduated with a bachelors of science with a specialization in child psychology. I aspire to be an applied behavioral analyst but in order to do so I must return to grad school which requires me to take the GRE (approx $200). If I don't go to grad school by fall my student loans will stop being deferred and I'll have to pay that monthly as well. I currently work at Olive Garden ($9/hr) and a trampoline park ($8/hr) neither of which provide great hours but I work enough hours to never see my friends or family.

 Because I am now done with school I want to move back home with my parents in order to save money but I still have two more months of my lease left ($350/mo). I was trying to sublease it but haven't found anyone interested. I had a little bit in savings but I recently got towed (despite parking in the designated location) which depleted my savings. I was going to sell my game system and other valuables but at the beginning of the week My home got burglarized so I guess they beat me to it. My parents have paid for me to go on a family cruise in two weeks but I have to pay for my own excursions which is nice but my mom has been raving about all the excursions she wants us to do despite me telling her it's out of my budget. So I somehow have to come up with enough money for at least one excursion so that she won't have my head. 

I tried taking out a loan for $1000 because last semester I took out one for $1500 with no problem and paid it off in five months. For whatever reason the same bank told me I didn't qualify even when I tried to take out $700 instead. I checked my credit and everything was in good standing; I couldn't see my actual score but I've always paid things off and on time so I don't understand why I got denied. I was going to use that loan to pay off my rent, move back home, and have some vacation money. But now that the loan has fallen through I'm pretty stuck. I've tried taking odd jobs off Craigslist when I'm not working, picking up extra shifts, and even attempted to sell my panties on sketchy websites but nothing has really worked. 

So my options are: Stay in my college town, work both jobs to make just enough for rent, and rely on the food bank and tips for food and gas. Or, go home and hope to find a job there to pay off my rent while also having food and transportation provided. Or, find another reputable loan provider outside of my bank to try to get a loan asap. I know this was lengthy but I really need some informed advice before I turn to a life of crime (like I've seriously considered it) ",17May2017,1
29,"Hey thanks for offering to help with my post. So basically, I am a 17 year old senior in high school. I'm doing this event at our school where senior guys go and do like a talent show and it's for ""Mr. JHS."" If you win you get free prom tickets and a trophy. I'm doing it simply because it's my senior year and I've never really gotten involved in many activities. So I'm doing he napoleon dynamite dance as my talent and I bought the costume and everything. My parents however don't approve of the dance. They said it gives more people reasons to make fun of me and that it's too feminine. I was doing hand gestures and I asked my mom why she couldn't just leave me alone and she called me the equivalent of a faggot in Spanish. I just went to my room and continued to practice my dance as if it didn't phase me but, it did. (A piece I info is that I came out as Bi to my parents around December). And then I asked if I could just thin my eyebrows a bit earlier today because I have VERY thick eyebrows (and I'd have a unibrow if it wasn't for me shaving it), and she said ""do you want me to get you some earrings and some nail polish with that?"" I just don't understand why my parents are acting this way. My mom is coming to the show on Friday and I'm not exactly sure if I can handle the pressure of her staring at me and disapproving every gesture and dance move I make. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

TL;DR My mom called me a faggot in Spanish and disapproves of me doing the Napoleon dynamite dance for my school as part of a talent. She will be going to the show to watch me and I'm not sure if I can handle her pressure constantly. And what can I do to try and improve this situation with my parents. ",17May2017,4
30,"For the past two years, in school, I've been in chorus. Over the past several months, however, I've come to realize how much I hate it and how shit everyone really is. I'd really like to take an instrument next year and have my mind set on the violin since it's such a beautiful sounding instrument, but I have some concerns. Everyone there has been taking violin for at least 2 years. That would leave me incredibly far behind. I'm afraid of being judged, and I know it's probably going to happen if I do decide to do violin.
  
I was thinking of bearing one more year of chorus while also practicing violin on the side every day. This would leave me more prepared if I decided the year after. The other option of to get a violin and practice it for an hour each day from now to the end of the school year (around 40 days) and during the summer as well. I don't know if this is too aggressive of a goal and am not sure if string instruments can be ""overdone"", so to speak. After the summer, I'd enroll in violin instead. Of course, the only problem is that I have to decide before the end of the year.

38,"Apologies if this is against the rules, but this Reddit seems best to just get this out there and maybe get some advice on something that is weighing on me recently.

For over a decade and a half, I ran a FFRP Channel on IRC (For those unfamiliar with the terms, Free Form Role Play/Collaborative Writing Community on Internet Relay Chat). We always had decent numbers, but we were never the ones with the most but we always lasted and we had a good time playing characters in a setting similar to Tamirel and Azeroth before they even existed. We always had incidents here and there (Drama explosions, some players attempting insurrections and creative disagreements) but for the most part we had a good time and the ship was stable. Over time however we started a decline, I guess attribute it to being the '8 Track Tape' of Role Play mediums in a land of Blu-Rays (People now prefer to RP on graphical games). Numbers started to slowly decline, activity stared to wane.

Around five years ago, I thought I achieved happiness when me and a woman who..never really got it right before..finally got together and we formed a wonderful creative team. The writing, the characters and the stories were wonderful and it felt like we were in a new golden age. But she was grooming another player to try and take over cause she had a crush on him, and cause he made her characters the star of the adventures. It all came to a head when she felt she should not be 'restrained' by the title of 'girlfriend' and feel free to do what she wants while she was also trying to push out every female player she felt was a threat.

Drama ensued, people scattered, and in it all I lost my creative spirit. I lost that creative nature about me. I just felt so drained, so weakened..so..done. Just done. Having ran a long race, out of breath and now just falling to the ground.

While running the group was good, it also brought out some of my worst tendencies at times. I was prone to moments of rashness, paranoia, being overly controlling. I had gotten better over the years, but having that 'power', for some reason, brought out parts of me I knew needed to be controlled but I had trouble doing so.

In the years since the group folded, I feel I have improved and become a better person. I've been working on myself. More humility, less rashness, no paranoia, no controlling. 

A good friend of mine keeps wanting me to restart things, make another go at it. I can't fault her, she loves having a creative outlet. But out of all the players we had, she has really been the only voice wanting a 'Sequel' to the group we had.

Tonight, a friend of mine posted on social media wanting to start her own group. This is a friend who I've known for a long time, and I do not feel she has any bad intentions. But when I saw the post..and the flurry of responses..well..I had a dark moment. A Superman in Injustice 2 kind of moment.

1 - I felt anger, a little betrayed. Why had that effort not been expended on MY group?

2 - I felt an old twinge of paranoia, wanting to watch and see who was 'against me'.

I quickly recoiled and realized that this was *ALL* the wrong things to feel but...not doing the group again, I feel like I am letting people down..or is it just a person I am letting down.

I want to be a better person, not be THAT guy. At the same time, the powerful relationship I had..my creative spirit is gone. Just..gone. I don't have it in me anymore. That part is broken.

But I still feel I am being selfish and letting people down if I decide to completely walk away from it.


What do you think?",17May2017,2
39,"Hopefully this qualifies as the right sub.

I'll try to get straight to the point. The bones of the story are:

- I didn't see many good examples of conflict resolution as a kid. My parents argued a lot, and my father in particular would fly off the handle and yell at my mother (or us kids) frequently if things didn't go his way. The next day, everyone would pretend that the screaming arguments had never happened and things would go back to ""normal"".

- In childhood, I had few friends and was often bullied. As I entered high school, my personality developed to become a lot like my father: it was my way or the highway, and if you didn't like me, screw you. I was a horrible person to a lot of people, and held a lot of really horrible views.

- In early adulthood, I started studying psychology at university, and found a group of stable, compassionate, good friends. I started to work on who I was with the skills I was learning in my classes and in my social circles, but I still have a long way to go.

I still suffer a lot from the pride I developed in high school, so find it very difficult to apologise when I have overstepped a line. I force myself to do it, and to do so genuinely. I address my behaviour, explain why I did it but (more importantly) how I know what I did was inappropriate, and acknowledge that in future I'll do my best not to do it again. I have managed to gain a lot of control over my emotions; I don't get so angry or upset now, but nonetheless, I often ""steamroll"" over someone if I think there's been any sort of slight aimed my way - and so, though I'm better able to control my emotions, the results of these ""arguments"" are typically the same.

The horrible views I mentioned earlier are gone; thank goodness. That said, though, I now have very strong opinions on social issues such as racial equality, transgender rights, feminism, etc. All good stuff, but I know I can do damage to all of the above causes by not being able to take a step back and talk to people reasonably. I'm trying, but I still get very passionate about it and... well, that's when I steamroll, and I can end up being condescending and rude to people who actually agree with me, purely because I've misunderstood them or have totally forgotten the importance of asking questions to clarify their stance.

I struggle still to compromise, to listen respectfully, and to let go of anger. I've lost friends and know I'm at risk of losing more if I don't get my bad attitude and argumentative side under control. I need help to build bonds with people if we don't click straight away, and can be really nasty in high-stress situations if I'm not stopping to think about what I'm doing.

So, I want to know what advice or suggestions people might have to help me become better at listening - as well as continuing to reduce the bad behaviour impulses I have.
  ---

41,"So as of a few months ago I've developed some unfortunate trust issues with a friend of mine, after I discovered they weren't exactly telling the complete truth about their role in a conflict with some other people I know. Add to that sometimes they aren't always consistent with stuff they're telling me, though it may be cause they're somewhat forgetful and I don't understand how they feel about expressing themselves etc. Thing is though, I like them, and want to restore the good days of our friendship. What should I do?",17May2017,1
42,"Before you think I'm some insensitive jerk, hear me out.

My mother and I have had a very rough relationship since my childhood. Long story short, she would choose men over my brother and I and we could never rely on her emotionally or even financially as children. I was molested, beaten, verbally abused, and neglected for most of my childhood. Despite (or maybe because of) this I turned out to be a strong, independent, and morally sound individual. I have moved on and forgiven her for what she put me through, but I will never forget. 

That being said, I am now married with two children and a life of my own. My mother still doesn't have it all together, I sware shes more of a teenager in her 40s than I ever was. But, I try my best to be supportive and non-judgemental. I know she will never have the qualities that I feel a mother should have but its something I try very hard to accept.

My mom has always had issues with mental health. She has been in and out of hospitals, eating dosorder clinics, and ""women's"" homes for victims of spousal abuse. I have often felt like she exaggerates her ""state of mind"" but to be fair I honestly have no clue how ill she is emotionally. I have tried to be supportive lately by suggesting she starts a hobby, or even talking to someone. She agrees she should but never does and slides even deeper into her depression.

Aside from always forcing her to get out and do things or talking to her on the phone 6 hours a day, I have no idea what to do for someone who doesnt want to get help for themselves. I would love nothing more than to see her happy and healthy for what would basically be the first time in my life but I now have a family of my own and I honestly feel it isnt and was never my responsibly to take care of her when she couldn't do the same for her child.  

I could really use some support or even insight into dealing with a family member with an undiagnosed mental illness while trying to balance your own life. Thank you for reading!

Possibly to somewhere like thailand where its dirt cheap to live. Basically this was all me vs my mom. My mom takes a shit ton  of pills and she's addicted to them. She will flip out for no apparent reason, Like what happened today. Reasons like this are why I need to get the fuck out of this house because I feel it could corrupt me. 

Ok so guys back to the advice part of this. Im a programmer, and so far ive made $600, but that was starting from $0. Im really happy my mom left, but she will be back within a few days (she always does this). I need to know, how can I get as much work done as possible, within those 3 or so days she will be gone. When shes here she constantly comes in on some crazy shit like every hour.. she will come into my room for some reason. Its really hard for me to think  when shes here.. 

Also last thing, If anyone knows how I could live for cheap around united states, mexico, south america, canada please let me know.  Im willing to live in the worst neighborhoods etc.. I dont care. Thanks guys.",17May2017,1
76,"Hey guys, I'm in a course for Business right now, it's a diploma course that started in late February. The second semester is about to end in 4-5 weeks and the exams will be on a week after that.

Now, lately.. actually, for years now, I haven't been able to turn my life around, I have bad motivational issues, I feel like i'm stuck where I am not knowing what to do which scares me. I felt that starting a Business course might help me realize what I want when really.. I really haven't enjoyed the course and the studying that comes with it. I've finished Year 12 but I have NEVER earned anything higher than that.

I haven't submitted 3-4 assignments that were all due in the last 2 weeks and I've failed a test getting only 28%. Obviously because i haven't been attending classes but I just feel like I'm only going because of the fact that I'm paying a good sum of money for it.

I feel like I don't want to study anymore and I feel like starting a trade would be a good idea such as Plumbing (My entire ancestral tree is revolved within the Construction industry) but the problem with that is I'm not really a hands-on type of person and due to being an excessive gamer, not exercising etc, I haven't got a good back.. Hell, whenever I carry my 4 year old cousin on my shoulders my back gets a temporary strain.

I feel like I've already failed the course, I mean i can study my ass off and do the exams to get by but I feel like what is the point.. I don't enjoy studying and I'm iffy about the idea of doing a trade I'm just stuck.",17May2017,1

To turn in the homework he gives us folders and then collects them. Obviously we don't know what exact homeworks to turn in and he doesn't either, so it's a scramble. So obviously sometimes I'll have just stapled it and it's like 5 seconds to late to the folder. And he'll say too late and give you a zero. 

I guess that's okay once or twice, not fucking 5-10 times.

Today was just especially bad and I'm still sour about it. At the beginning of class this idiot had put the folder under his binder and so nobody at the table put their homework in.

We realize afterwards that it was there and obviously give it quickly without realizing. And then the same day we have a Binder Check.
Simple 10 points, and my binder is always the same way...... 0/10 when I get home. I heard him under his breath say something about classwork, but it's there so now I have to attempt to talk to him about that to.

He's probably the most forgetful teacher I've ever had, always unorganized, but of course, that's unacceptable for the rest of the class. We're all human, so I don't get pissed off or anything when he forgets cause I try to sympathize.

91,"So there's something wrong inside the AC unit.  IDK what exactly but I looked in there and I can see stains on the sheetrock where a lot of water at least used to be running down.  There's also a pool of water at the bottom.

I reported it to maintenance, told them what was up and where it was, they came like 3 days later and only opened the cabinets under all the sinks, which obviously aren't leaking.  They came when I wasn't home else I would've told them.

I waited through the weekend and reported it again today, and I fully expect to wait another 3 days.  But my hallway floor is soaked in some places, it's like a damn swamp, if I step in the wrong spots water literally covers my foot.  Since it's been like this for so long (it was a few days before I caught the leak because at first only a very small spot on the floor outside my bathroom was wet, and I'd just cleaned the carpets, so I thought I just spilled a lot of water and tried to dry it) I fully expect the wood to have rotted some and mold to be under the carpet.  Not to mention the previous water damage already visible inside the AC unit.  It looks dry but you can definitely tell water was there for a while.

So IDK, what should I do?  I can't turn off my AC because it's too hot, I can't stop the leak because I don't have access to it (it's behind the AC unit in the same cabinet, I'd have to remove the whole AC unit, I can barely even see back there) and don't know where its water source is (it might be coming from the upstairs neighbors), and since it's under the carpet I can't really put down towels to keep it dry.",17May2017,1

So, a few months ago, i applied for job A, i kinda wanted that job even though its definitely not a high paying job nor a 'respectful' job, its still in a very respectable firm. I didn't hear from them for a few months (about 3-4 months). In the mean time i accepted another job in the same position (Job B).

Anyway, this morning, just now, i got a call from job A with the question if i could start today, i declined since i had to go to job B in a few hours, but i told her i could start tomorrow and the day after and i accepted. The problem is:

105,"Brief backstory:
Long story short my life in the last two years has been insanely crazy in a bad way. It's taken a load of shitty twists and turns. Subsequently my relationship with my family is strained because of it. It was so bad that at one point in the heat of an argument my father called the police on me and lied and got me arrested and charged with a shit ton of bullshit which took me months to sort out in the criminal court system, including rehab/anger management, which resulted in me dropping out of my first college semester a month in. On top of that we've quarreled about my friends, marijuana useage and a bunch of other things. I see a therapist and she even can concluded that they're too caught up in their cultural and conservative beliefs which they then try to shove down my throat. Long story short I'm at ends wits here. 
My Problem:
 After my arrest I picked up a job full time at a store and ended up making decent money for my age, 19. I work 35-45 hours a week and walk away with decent money. It's hard work and I'm not really loving it but the money is good for now until i get back to school in the fall. I also vape and smoke from time to time so I go to this smokeshop in my town a lot. I became good friends with the owner and he even helped me out when I was going through the legal shit. Today he offered me a job at the store to work on the weekends and I honestly want to take it. It interests me and is something I'd enjoy. My dilemma is how I'm going to tell my family about it. My mom and dad hate the fact that i smoke and everything about it and they tell me almost hourly, yes hourly, that i need to quit and all that shit. I really don't plan on stopping and thats annoying but I feel like if I tell them about this job they'd lose their actual shit and that scares me cause they've already had me arrested, kicked me out which led to me being homeless, created a living hell throughout high school and overall have just fucked with me for a long time. I can't take their crazy bullshit and I'm just trying to get my money up and go to school and hopefully avoid them as much as possible for the next couple of years.

My Question:
How do I even begin to introduce/talk about this topic? I'm scared as to how they're going to react and honestly I just don't want to deal with them giving me hell for just getting a new job that I actually would look forward to.

108,"Currently a sophomore in college and I was put in the same math group as this one guy. He was very nice and asked if I wanted to hang out with him and ""a couple"" of other friends after class. I said yes and he basically brought me to church. 
Having no religious background, I was very confused and kind of scared that I was thrown into this environment. He didn't even tell me that it was going to be a religious event with a little over a hundred people. Basically, every week he would text me asking me to come out again and I would either make excuses or tell him no, religion isn't for me, but he never got the hint.  
Fast forward to this year, we got put into another group together and once again, he's asking me to join. I said in person no, religion isn't my thing and I just felt uncomfortable when I went to that ""meeting"" with you last year. That was 8 weeks ago, and he still asks me to come to their events. I don't know what to do anymore. He obviously doesn't get that I absolutely do not want any part of his group.

112,"I am not one to seek advice online, but with a recent turn of events I don't know where else to turn. This is a long story, but if anyone has the patience to read it, I would surely appreciate the advice.

Three weeks ago I was a happy go lucky, nothing can keep me down, the sky is the limit optimist with stars in my eyes and a heart full of love. I was soon to be engaged to a woman who had already said yes. We had looked at rings together and I was already looking to get one custom made for her. She suggested we move in together when my lease ended and while I had my reservations at first (my drive to work would be trippled and I would be in an area I was unfamilar with) the thought of waking up next to her every morning left no doubt in my mind that this was the right decision. I had met her family and she had told me numerous times how excited she was to become Mrs. 5nugzdeep. 

I decided it was time to introduce her to my family, so I flew her out of state for a few days to meet everyone. Long story short, everyone loved everyone, and I had never felt more confident in my decision to make her my wife. We flew back into our home city, took a shuttle back to my apartment, and called her a Lyft to go back to her apartment because I had to work the next day and I was having car troubles. She told me how well the trip went and that she was happy to meet everyone. I kissed her goodbye, told her I loved her, and sent her on her way. That was the last time I ever saw her. 

I work 12 hour shifts so when I work I dont have much time to do anything but eat, sleep, and work. We didn't talk much, which was usual when I worked, but something felt different. She felt distant even considering, and most unsettling, she wasn't saying ""I love you"" back. I was at work when I finally confronted her over text about her distance, and before I knew it it was all over. Just a few days earlier I was holding her on a swing next to a fire surrounded by my family, and now I felt utterly and entirely abandoned. She never gave me a real reason why she ended it, and even after asking again later I got no response. 

I was obviously shaken by the sudden turn of events and I was looking to my friends to help me through these rough times. I am fairly new to this city/state so the few friends I have built over the past 2 years are very important to me. My best friend, and the one who I leaned on the most is a woman who I will call ""J"". J is an amazing person and has always been kind and generous to me. I met my closest friends from here through her and in the days and weeks following my break up she was there helping to console me and take my mind off of things. One night we were out a friends house party/get together and after several drinks, some skinny dipping, and a few other things we grabbed an Uber and headed back to her place. I planned to crash at her place like I normally do, but that night she said her guest bedroom was messy so I should just sleep in her bed. One thing led to another and before I knew it we were going at it. An hour later we both passed out, then in the morning we did it again. She had to leave do to prior engagements and I head home feeling better than I had since my soon to be fiance left me.

I didn't hear back from her until the next day, but what she said was another blow to my already injured soul. She told me that after we had sex she felt different about things. She said it had changed everything and that things are never going to be the same again. She apologized and said she is still here for me, but that she needs space. I haven't seen her since that morning. 

These two women were the closest people I had in my life and the people I went to when things got bad. Now that they were gone and things were getting bad I reached out to a woman that I have known since I was young and honestly the person who understands me better than anyone else in the world. The one woman who always knows what to say and the woman who I love and trust more than anything. She truly is my best friend in the world even though we live in different parts of the country and haven't seen eachothers in years. We keep in contact and catch up often, but we usually go weeks or months without talking, which is normal for us. We just pick up where we left off. We will call her ""R"".

It had been a couple of months since I had spoken to her, but that was nothing new. I text her a few times, but got no response. After some time I became curious and checked her Facebook. I sent her a message asking if she had the same number and that I needed to talk with her. Again, I got no response. 

At this point I feel myself slipping into what feels like madness. I can't concentrate, I can't express my thoughts, I cant even think anymore. Finally I decide to contact an old friend from highschool that I had helped through some extremely dark times in her life and had often been there for me in the past. We have a deep history and I have sacrificed a lot to ensure her safety and happiness. Care to take a guess what happens next? That's right, no response...again. 

Just to be clear, there is no reason for these women to be upset with me, and they have told me hundreds of times how much they care for me and that I am their best friends and someone they would do anything for. It seems like over night I lost every person whose words actually make a difference in my life. I have had friends die at a yoing age and seen horrors that I cannot even begin to describe, but in these past days I have more alone and abandoned than I ever have, save the one time I tried to kill myself. Now before anyone worries, I am far from the person I was then, and suicide is not the answer, but I feel cold and alone and I feel as though everything that I have built up inside myself over the years in quickly draining out of me through a hole in my heart. I feel rejected, abandoned, and lost. Part of me wants to scream, part of me wants to run away and start a new life, and another part of me wants to curl up in a dark hole and never come out. I would cry, but I haven't been able to do that since a couple days after my girlfriend left me.

Does anyone have any advice as to where to go from here? Any advice as to what I should do to repair these wounds? I have never been one to ask for help, but right now any words of encouragement would be much appreciated. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. That is all I have really wanted this whole time.",17May2017,0

129,"I work part-time in a supermarket in a small city that could easily be mistaken for a country town. Its population is 90,000 hence it is classed as a city. As such, the economy isn't great, and you can't be too choosey when it comes to jobs. 

I'm grateful for my opportunity to work at this store. But recently they've undergone a drastic restructuring. 

I work in the deli and am the only guy within an otherwise all-female department within the store. The store manager named Steve treated me as if I was his own son — he was impressed with my work ethic and would always commend me. Needless to say, this guy didn't just throw out compliments to anyone. I was often recognised for my good efforts by upper management. 

About 6 months ago they reassigned Steve to a new store that had just opened up, and we were given an overly aggressive butch lady named Emily who is very open about letting everyone know she is lesbian. She's very reminiscent of Lea DeLaria (for anyone familiar with her). 

She's grumpy, hyper-masculine, intimidating, and often at times condescending. Despite this, I turn the cheek and am always polite and courteous to her. If I see her around the store I'll smile and greet her. I'd rather have good relations with a manager than poor relations. 

Despite this, for the first time ever, Emily has received an internal anonymous complaint about me from one of the women in my department. She wouldn't say who, but now she thinks she knows me and I have been branded as ''the guy who always talks'' in her eyes. 

Talking is a byproduct of communication, but now whenever I communicate with my co-workers, I get a manager target me and humiliatingly tell me not to talk. I politely remind them that it's work-related, but it hasn't stopped. I can't seem to do any work now without managers following me around and trying to catch me engaging in conversation with co-workers from around the store. They're now also unnecessarily critical of everything I do specifically. 

I know there's nothing I can do about this specifically, but it's getting worse. 

I'm now having third-parties from work inform me that they overheard Emily bitching about me. Aside from my friendly greetings, I know next to nothing of Emily, so I don't know how she can assume she knows me. But we've also just lost another amazing manager named Michael who was just replaced with a lady named Lucy. Both of these managers have apparently been bitching about me, but neither one of them have approached me to discuss my performance. 

I'm 100% confident in my performance so I invite both these managers to talk to me about my performance. But their evasive behaviour is worrisome. Not only that, they're basically slandering me behind my back when they've yet to actually talk to me or understand why things don't always go their way. 

The slander is what concerns me. They seem to have no problem bitching about a guy they barely know and have never worked with before. These ladies are also managers who should know better. But they also seem stuck-up and arrogant in their way. 

I'm at a complete loss on what to do. I haven't even been given the opportunity to discuss this with them. They've just labelled me and assumed they know better. 

Is there anything I can do? For obvious reasons, I can't just leave my job and get a new one for the time being. But I am disappointed in the behaviour of these ladies. 


**Tl;dr** I have new managers in my store who know nothing about me as a co-worker, but they received one complaint and are now indirectly associating every problem in my department to me. I've had numerous colleagues inform me that they've caught these two managers bitching about me [a guy they don't even know] often. My concern is that what they're doing is slander and will give people a false impression of me. Neither of these managers have called me to the office to discuss my performance [I'm more than happy to do this as I'm 100% confident in my work ethic]. But I feel I'm unfairly being pigeonholed as the problem worker, partially because I'm the only guy in a female oriented department, and partly because I look young for my age, and partly because [and I hate to make this generalization] but women just seem to be very bitchy in comparison to men. How can I deal with this in a civil manner without burning bridges? 



This is Lea DeLaria on Conan with Bill Burr if you want an idea of what my new store manager is like. My new manager is Lea DeLaria without the sense of humour. You could also compare her to the headmistriss from the movie Matilda.

132,"Dear Reddit

My backstory: My problems I would say began around 5 years ago, I had a reoccurring injury and over a few years that eventually lead to surgery, during these few years I became a recluse and gradually put on weight which sent me down a path of anxiety and depression. This anxiety and depression escalated with breakdown of family, and important relationships with siblings and close friends which are now nonexistent. I went from being a self sufficient woman to depending solely on my long term partner of 12 years. (note: I have taken medicine and had therapy for both anxiety and depression)

Around 6 months ago I had a small but important breakthrough moment, and since I have been desperately clawing to get some sense of control and routine in my life again. However I struggle with crippling anxiety on a daily basis, I struggle often to leave my home. I really need some guidance and help as I am currently stuck in a life I no longer wish to be a prisoner to. Bar my relationship with my partner I do not have much else to live for this frightens me, and it frightens him. I am very blessed that I have him in my life, but also recognise the toll that my depression and anxiety has taken on him and our relationship. He is however still amazing, and through even this tough time, has remained by my side and we both still love one another and cannot see a future without one another. However as much as I am grateful for him in my life, he has currently been supporting both of us for 5 years... I feel disappointed in myself as I have morphed into my worst nightmare (not being a equal partner, relying on someone else for financial independence) Financially my partner is able to support us both with ease.. again I am grateful for this, but this is not what I wanted for my life. He has never voiced an issue / we have never argued about money...before this point in my life I was very much financially independent. I now feel like a sinkhole and a waste of space.

I want myself back. I have lost alot of myself. Currently I dont know what I am doing with mylife. I dont even know what I want to DO. I have the option to try start again in a new career... but I just dont know what I should do....I have a skill set which revolves around the creative field, mainly photography and retouching...which I could use to start a business from home but I have no passion for anything. The few business ideas I have I dont feel like I have the personality to do certain things... i.e I hate social media... and personality wise I dont believe I have the chirpy persona needed etc. On top of that I dont think with my anxiety right now I could deal with face to face situations... Im trying to get better... I dont know what the hell I'm doing... I'm tired of living in a self piteous cycle. Please.. any advice/ help would be welcome.

137,"Can you have both? Can there be a healthy way to obsess over something? 

I feel stupid writing this so please go easy on me, I'm not some lunatic all the time. I am currently kind of with someone. It's not official that we are boyfriend/girlfriend but I still consider myself taken and he does too. 
I like him a lot. I didn't want to, I hated the fact I was liking him so much and it's weird. I never care to see people that much but I want to be with him all the time even if we're not doing anything. He doesn't really do anything, it's not like he's spectacular or he's ever taken my breath away and all that typical shit. 

I usually spend most my time thinking about him, like in some fantasy world where everything is perfect and he's perfect. I didn't think I really had an interest in having a partner, I just wanted to work and do stuff I liked without that drama. But I also did think it'd be nice to just have someone and have the physical side of things which is something I can't do without. Which is another thing I was thinking about; what if it's just the sex. We have the best sex ever, I've always had a high sex drive but I had issues trusting guys so I'd fuck it off, but I'm really comfortable with him and it's allowed me to explore a lot more.

Anyways, I dream of him every single night, I always wonder what he's up to. Every thought includes him. It could be love but I don't know, I just want him all the time I need him to know everything I think almost and I wish I knew his every thought. Weird clinginess but I know I don't directly show it to him.

I had said I was still interested in the position during the phone call and was told they wanted to offer it to me. 

Now, that I've had time to think about it, I don't want the position anymore. It helped me realize what I really want to do in the library system and now I may go and get my MLIS for Youth Services since that's what I've mainly been doing for the past two years although I have dabbled in Adult Services/Programming a bit.

Is it bad that I have now changed my mind? In one hand, this helped me realize what I now want to do and I haven't received or signed the acceptance letter yet. Part of me feels bad because I took the time to apply to the position and interview for it and knew what would go into the job and that if I declined that I could have wasted their time, but on the other hand it made things a lot clearer for me job/future wise. Plus, even though I interviewed for it I still plan on applying to other jobs that pop up in the system to become a Youth Associate, especially at the new library branch that will be opening by the end of the year.

Or maybe, I'm overthinking all of this because I'm a people please and have never really turned down a job offer because I could use the money but I may also have a slight problem to saying No. This ended up with me hating two of the jobs I used to have due to being taken advantage of and other reasoning (not in the library system).

I have been to five different universities, largely in the hope that the change or starting afresh might make a difference. I have a student debt that's probably larger than those who study medicine and will spend a lifetime paying it off (although, thank goodness, my country doesn't charge interest on said debt.)

I have approximately zero interest in becoming a lawyer. I don't want to study law at all. I have spent the past five years listening to and being swayed by how law was so perfect for me and how I'd be so good at it and how it would make me rich. Arguments to parents about the oversupply of law graduates and level of competition for higher paying jobs were ignored.

I understand they want the best for me, but this is getting ridiculous. They simply cannot and will not accept that I am finding university study impossible at this stage of my life.

How do I convince my delusional parents that carrying on in this is just a losing battle? I can no longer motivate myself with the thought that it would make them happy, or that I somehow owe them for them supporting me while growing up.

I've been there for her all my life helping her in different ways (you can ask if you want, too much to write here), but got nothing back. When my son was a few months old she moved to the other side of the country. She said she was fed up with life and needed to get away. She called and texted now and then. She stayed there for 25 years. The weird thing is that she only called me and my son, but not my daughter. Give my love to her, she said. 

She moved back down and had every chance to get to know her granddaughter, but no, she never even suggested they'd meet. My sister just had a baby and grandma was over the moon so you can guess how my daughter felt. Six months later my mom decided she didn't like it here, she missed her mountains.

182,"Even typing this right now I feel kinda empty.

I finished highschool over a year ago, and the college education phase was disorienting me. I had not signed up or tried to enter any universities while in my senior year, so my choices were limited. Most of my classmates had somewhere to go, but I didn't. In a rush to catch the approaching new school year I had to settle for an education course major in English in some lowly university that was known for a sex scandal involving two students. But after realizing I had little patience in people, I began to wonder if that was what I really wanted to do. I began to hate everything, ranging from the school itself, my classmates, and certain teachers who I thought were doing a terrible job (To be fair, they kinda were). I hated the country I was in, I hated the environment I was born in, I hated how 90% of the people I talked to either can't respond in or understand english, and I hated how my former classmates from highschool would experience things far better than I would. I stopped attending classes, 'til the school took notice and told my parents. I was pulled out, and I felt an immense momentary relief for a long but limited amount of time. Then, I was clueless. I did not feel like going to a university. I did not feel like going to school. I did not feel like working. Existential nihlism kicks in. Life just seemed so boring. There was no point in living. There was no point in doing anything. Believing in a deity doesn't seem to help because the eternal silence from a so called god only strengthens the nihlism. Faith is for the optimistic, and I am not that. Whenever Id talk to my friends about my problems in life, the reply would always be something too optimistic. Something that I always knew would never work for me. 

My mother has been the target of my hatred for as long as I can remember. I despise her, and I hate the fact that she created me, and put me on this boring earth just to discipline me with a leather belt everyday for the first 3 years of my school life. It began to dwindle down from 4th grade, and eventually stop entirely. I could never forget, however, the humiliation and betrayal I felt when I was relentlessly hit over and over again for something that I didn't even know what I did wrong. Every. Single. Day. Even though that leather accessory would graze me and lightly touch my lower back, I would tear up and beg her to stop. I swore payback, but to this day 13 years from then I could still feel the ripples of pain my younger self received. No reparations have been given. No apologies. Nothing. If the topic of her attacking me with a belt when I was younger comes up, she doesn't seem to care. She either thinks I don't care, or believes that I shouldn't care, and therefore she herself shouldn't care. 

I planned on asking for advice on how nihlistic I felt and how life was pointless for me, but then I just straight up unloaded on the being I hate so much: my mother. She's the reason why I wrote this, she put a sense of fear and a sense of danger in me which is why I couldn't sleep and had to unload.

194,"TL;DR: As the only viable offspring of a family, should I refuse to marry/reproduce unless they agree to bequeath their property to me?

So, my grandma is getting old. Like, really old. Like, declining health, probably-doesn't-have-a-lot-of-time-left-in-life kind of old. She has two younger sons and two older daughters. My aunt has two daughters, one of whom is in her thirties, lives at home, has no kids, and is not a functioning member of society. The other is a high-powered business lady who has moved to the East coast, adopted six cats, and is never coming back. My mother only has me. My mom and aunt are going to get the family farm when grandma dies, and pass it down to me eventually. Maybe. In like, thirty years.
My grandma's two sons are both in their early fifties, and have never had a job or girlfriend in their lives. They live with her and are going to get her house, which they have no way of paying property taxes on or supporting themselves in. Everyone in my family knows that they're going to lose the house, but nobody talks about it.

I'm the youngest in my family, and the only one who is currently both a functioning member of society and of reproductive age. I'm in my early twenties and have a career in technology, which has kept me busy and, like the wages of most millenials, is enough to support me, but not enough to buy a house or property - let alone support a family. I am extremely not cool with marrying anyone or starting a family without a long-term stable housing and financial situation, which is what having posession of my grandmother's house would enable, in one way or another. 

I think I am being cheated out of this property, because I (and everyone in my family) knows that my uncles will lose it the moment they don't have my grandma to leech off of. I would think the only logical course of action is to give me this property, because I'm the only responsible adult offspring in the family who is capable of maintaining it, and also of reproducing and carrying on the bloodline.

Is it reasonable, ethical, or horrible of me to express to my grandmother that I don't feel comfortable starting a family unless she gives me her property? Is it awful to use my power to end the genetic legacy of my mother's side of the family as leverage to get them to give me the assets I need to set up the rest of my life for a greater chance of success?

Now I feel reluctant about this for many reasons. But my problem is that I feel like it isn't their place to make any comments about my weight. When I try to vocalize this they tell me it's just out of concern and wanting to help. One of my aunts has even gone so far as to keep showing me pictures of this girl she knows who had weight loss surgery. When I brought up, you're just talking about her appearance. And she answered well what , should I have asked about her digestive track? 
Also my other aunts have brought up that I will be disadvantaged in the workplace and even that nobody would date someone with my physique. 
I really don't know how to explain to them that this is my life and I am trying to be as healthy as possible and I don't need them to repeat their ""solution"" over and over again.

tl;dr: Need advice on how to get relatives to stop ""giving advice"" about getting weight loss surgery. ",17May2017,2

211,"So like the title said, there's this girl (for all intents and purposes) called Katy. 

Katy's a little younger than me, and when I met her a few years ago, I was in a relationship, but kinda got a very close, very friendly vibe from her. She opened up to me a lot. Now since I was in a relationship at the time, I didn't even think twice about her in that way. 

Fast forward a few years. We've gotten back in touch, and things are exactly where we left them (conversations just drifted apart as she didn't really keep coming to the place we met for her own work, and went somewhere else). She's still uber close, and broke up with this absolute dick she was seeing in the middle. He was a colossal dick-bag if there ever was one. Cheated on her and such. 

Now I don't know if I have a crush on her or what it is, but I can definitely see myself loving Katy with everything I have. She's a close friend, we tell each other a lot, and help each other through tough times. I am a little bit of a protective friend with everyone I know, and have always messaged things like, ""Be safe"", and stuff like that. 

She was leaving for a long trip abroad, and I made a few jokes about her keeping in touch, and lots of 'haha' and affectionate replies later, I said, ""Have a whole bunch of fun, and if you get a chance, let me know once you've landed safely!"". I got an, ""OK Dad"" and then a, ""You're such a second father to me, I love you"". 

Does this mean I'm father-zoned (I loathe that I have to say that kind of phrase, it's so stupid to subscribe to this whole 'zoned' thing, but meh)? 

It doesn't change a thing. If I never date this girl, I'm not gonna change the way I am with her or anything, but I just wanna know for my own peace of mind what to make of this, because while I don't necessarily feel a burning urge to date Katy, I would be over the moon if it worked out.

Just wanna get some fresh perspective on this. No matter how brutal, just let me know your thoughts.

I have a problem. My life kinda hit a dead end. I had no Idea what kind of job I should do after I graduate. Now, I'm 20 and graduated – poorly. I had to repeat a year and was one year behind others my age by default since I choose another type of school. My grades aren't that good, looking at the important ones. Math, Science, Informatics... I barely passed.

My plan was to do a working holiday starting this fall. This is something I've been looking forward to for years. I wanted use the time abroad to think about what I really want to do as a career.Also, I feel like I NEED this in my life, after all these years of school.
Now the problem is, I didn't get any summer job. My plan just failed. Now I neither have money to do the trip, nor a plan for what to do instead now, since I am late for applying to do a training or to go to a higher school. As mentioned, Grades are a problem here too.

225,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for any input on my current situation to help me make the best decision I can. So, here's my story. I'll try to abridge it as much as I can.


I got my license last July, quite a while past of being 18 years old because I was pretty terrified of cars. Fast forward to gf, and I got my license with an awful 93 buick. Solid car, but expensive to repair and replacement parts weren't generally good anymore.


Traded it in and got a 2013 Ford focus. Got absolutely plagued with the transmission issues that were very common (Didn't know about this going in). The clutch was scaring the hell out of me. My car is automatic but shifts like a manual, and the clutch would constantly stutter when accelerating from a complete stop. At one point, the entire transmission started turning off and back on repeatedly while drive.


I took it in for repairs, they replaced the clutch and the TCM. Great. Two months later my clutch starts failing and now it feels like I'm being rear-ended when I accelerate. Take it back in, they repair it again. They're covering costs since it's an extended warranty for 100,000 miles. It's been a couple of months, and the stuttering is back. I know it's going to get worse and most online complaints explain how the issue never went away.


I'm working with my original dealership to get a new car, and they're able to cover most of the cost of the car except for $2000 that would be transferred to the new car. They're offering to switch me from buying my car to leasing, but the new lease payment would be roughly double what I'm paying right now. The new car would be a Kia Optima.


I can afford it...Just not as well as I was my Focus. I get paid twice a month and this would basically wipe my first paycheck of each month out, leaving $100 left. The 2nd paycheck would be rent and any credit card debts, medical needs, etc.


Pros:


* Do not have to worry as much about the new car
* Get the factory warranty on parts
* Can trade the car in after 4 years


Cons:


* Expensive, would nullify my first paycheck of each month
* Prevents me from saving money


Any/all help is appreciated and feel free to ask questions if it helps you guide me.",17May2017,1

227,"I eat just over 3000 calories per day as I'm trying to gain weight and put on muscle. I eat three meals a day, each around 1000 calories with roughly equal macro proportions of fat, carbs and protein. My daily total for today, for example, is 240g of carbs (main source is either white rice or sweet potatoes), which made up 32% of my intake; 136g of fat (41% of daily intake), mostly coming from animal fat as well as a tablespoon or so of coconut oil for cooking. The remaining 27% is protein (195g), which is a combination of red meat and fish (salmon in particular). I include vegetables with each meal such as spinach, kale, etc. and also often eat a few pieces of fruit each day (i.e. a couple of bananas and an apple). 

After each meal, I often get an irresistible urge to nap, or at the very least lie down. It happens often enough to be inconvenient and somewhat concerning, as the energy drain is severe. I thought it may be my blood sugar so I took some readings using a glucometer (fasting as well as two hours post-meal). Every single one of my readings came back normal (&lt;99 mg/dL and &lt;140 mg/dL). Not only that, but I don't feel light headed or any other major symptoms except for the extreme tiredness and I don't feel hungry during the time I feel this way. Eating doesn't seem to give me any relief either, the only thing that seems to help is to let some time pass.

236,"There is a section on my University's website that will show your grade. Professors show their grades differently (choosing to show percentage out of 100, not showing the grade at all, etc.), and this professor's way of representing my grade seems extremely misleading. A number that appeared to be out of 100 (percentage) appeared next to the words ""Current Grade: Total."" Unbeknownst to me, this number was the total number of points I had earned out of 139 possible points.

Here is my e-mail to my professor:

Professor _____,

Throughout this semester, I was led to believe that the number next to the course name under the ""grades"" section was meant to represent the percentage out of one hundred. 
In the middle of this semester, around midterms, I had the flu for a couple of weeks. During this time, I checked my grade, and saw that it said 72 next to ""current grade."" I took note of this, and decided that I would use the extra credit opportunities to make up some points. While continuing to go to class and doing the assignments, I periodically checked BlackBoardLearn to see my ""grade"" steadily climbing. Towards the end of semester, the number next to ""current grade"" represented a B+. I was satisfied with this grade, and stopped doing extra credit assignments. As you know, and as I know now, that number is to represent the points received out of the total, which is not shown or represented unless you manually add up the total points of all the assignments and attendance. 

Without realizing it, I ended the semester with a C. I'm not sure what to do about this issue, as I feel like the number next to ""current grade"" was extremely misleading, and would require a student to manually add up all of the possible points to get an accurate grade. Obviously this was unintentional, But I am wondering if it is too late to do anything about this.

Thank you for your time,

I often see him glancing over at me and I'm 99% sure he's looking at me. He does this several times and then goes back to talking to his friends or whatever. + our eyes did meet twice. The morning isn't the only times he looks at me.

In the morning when I do go to class he asks if I did homework or something about the test, just small talk I assume.

240,"Wasps make nests under the eaves of my house, in the can lights, and in my chimney every season. When I find a nest I spray it.  They die and either build a new nest near by or come back to the exact same spot to build a nest. I've tried painting over the location where the next was but that only works temporarily. What can I do to stop them from returning ?",17May2017,1
241,"So, I'm (20/f) going to make this otherwise long story as short as I possibly can.

The backstory: So my current house can comfortably house 7 people, and prior to August 2015, that's how many people lived in my house- my grandma, her boyfriend, my mom, and my 3 siblings and I. With my mom's hospital salary, we could afford to live pretty comfortably. 
Then August 26th, 2015 happened. My mom had what I call a psychotic meltdown and did some horrendous crimes against one of my siblings. The FBI raided our house and CPS took my siblings away permanently, my mom was subsequently arrested and let out on bond until she could be sentenced to prison. Obviously she was fired from her job and the bills still needed to be paid, so she took out her retirement fund- 18 thousand dollars, and spent almost all of it on things that were not bills. Then got sentenced to prison for 5 years, so she's gone currently.

Now my grandma and her boyfriend can pay the bills with their social security and disability checks but paying the bills takes every cent they have every month, so since I still live here and I work a full time, good paying job, I'm expected to help out as part of living here-- which is fine. They don't qualify for food assistance so I help out with groceries and rent and paying the water bill when it comes out. I'll add here that my grandma and her boyfriend are healthy and ""with it"" mentally, they're just unable to work.

The thing is though, I'm getting married. Within the next year and a half- my fiance and I have been together for almost 2 years and he understands the living situation but I'm getting more and more eager to move in with him and he feels the same way. My grandma and her boyfriend know this, and they know I want to move out soon, but without me they can't afford this 7 person house. I've suggested to both of them that they find an apartment that they can afford but their excuse is they have too much stuff to get rid of, so they prefer to just be broke every month with maybe 20 dollars to their name and depend on me for help. Now my grandma told me she's letting my mom's ex boyfriend move in for awhile to help pay the bills, he's not a bad guy, but I'm not comfortable at all with my grandma turning this place into a freaking boarding house...I seriously feel trapped and I want out and I'm not sure what to do. I feel terrible cause I want my grandma and her boyfriend to be safe and secure.

Am I a bad person for wanting to go my own way? Yes, it's nice not having so many bills to pay and a lot of extra money in the bank, but I can't be living here forever. 

TL;DR, My grandma and her boyfriend can't afford the current house we live in and they depend on me to help pay the bills or else they'll go under. Engaged to be married, wants to find a place with soon-to-be-husband and can't cause they can't afford to live here without me. Grandma is pretty much turning house into a boarding-house. Not comfortable.",17May2017,1
244,"So, I just graduated yesterday and my friend Ariel invited me to go to a party with her. It won't be a huge celebration or anything, but it will host up to four other girls (one of which I know and another I barely know). It's going to be a two day trip w/ them to a place that's two hours away from where we live....While I'm excited to go, I'm just...dreading it. While I love my friends, I kinda just want to stay home and watch movies and draw and apply for a few jobs.

To me that sounds like a perfect weekend. I have social anxiety and I know that's a huge factor in my decision, but I'm just so awkward that I freeze up and I don't know what to say and I just stand there quietly. I love talking with Ariel, but I prefer over the phone or just a simple day spent together....not a two day trip far from home where I KNOW I'll get drained from. I don't want to sound selfish (I'm sorry if I am) but I don't want to put myself in a situation where I know I'll be unhappy. The more I think about it the more I get anxious about it and start to hyper focus on the situation and give myself anxiety over it two days before the trip.

IDK...I would just rather enjoy time by myself than be with a bunch of people I don't really know. And it's not like I DON'T want to hang out w/ Ariel. We both love the movies and she can spend the night at my house and I over hers and just do other fun things....

Anyways, we hear our garage open, seems like someone just got home. A few minutes later out walks our neighbor, we will just call him Justin. So Justin just got home from being out except he is not with his wife, he is with another girl. The girl had a light blanket draped around her arms and would not look up. Justin also didn't make any eye contact with us, just a quick HI and booked it inside. About 30 seconds later we hear him take his dog out, out front.  Typically he would bring her in the back and chat with us for a few minutes. But not this time. Both my fiance and I found it extremely sketchy but just left it as is.  

Yesterday we went for a walk and ran into the wife. She was really tan so we complemented her on it. Her response was ""thanks"" I just got back from Florida! So long story short she just confirmed that she was out of town Saturday when her husband brought another women home around 11pm. It obviously could be nothing, or it could be something! Fiance and I are in an extremely odd position considering we are not super close with them. Nor do we have any real confirmation that he cheated on her so in a sense we don't want to stir up anything if it was nothing. However if the roles were reversed I sure as hell would like to know!

&gt;Professor, around 60?? M

So long story short, I needed a certain number of credits. I signed up for several courses I wasn't particulary interested, including this one. 
I knew it wasn't good idea since the first lesson. The professor is about as far left as possible, and even though I am usually open to any views, i refuse to be called a nazi because i don't think 
that justin trudeau is best man that graced this earth. I regret opening my mouth tbh. We had an arguement on the very first lesson and it continued for the majority of the semester.

However, about halway in, I noticed that he is specially trying to get me talking, that he wanted to discuss random stuff when I met him in the hallways, that I recieve much more e-mails from him than the rest of students combined. I still thought nothing of it, because apparently I have an IQ of a brick.

It culminated last week, when he send me an e-mail describing how he has a song which reminds him of me ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPsfpnXR3CU ), that he thinks of me all the time and some other stuff.. 
And since then I experience the most horrible anxiety ever, including headaches and urge to vomit. I thought he hated me tbh. I am afraid and even though i know it is irrational and he probably won't do anything, I don't think I'll be able to go to the exam. 
When I was at uni today, he asked me about the e-mail, then followed me around for a while, then went away whistling the song. I told him I haven't checked my inbox yet, but after he left, i had to go vomit from anxiety. IDK what to do.

There's this girl(what a surprise). We've been friends for a few years, but there has always been a crazy chemistry. We always have fun, we can share music, books, ideas, everything. I think there's definitely more than being just friends. 

The complicated thing is, is that I'm totally not sure how she feels. She's very close, we're not afraid of physical contact and we both enjoy spending time together, what to me could mean she's into me. On the other hand, she's also frequently mean and distant. She sometimes makes little insults (not sure if they're jokes) and while she can be very close at one moment, the next thing I know she just won't talk to me or look at me.

Lately I've been thinking about talking to her because it's kinda eating me up on the inside. A lot of people around me have been asking about wether we're together or not because we spend so much time and because there's great chemistry, so I'm not totally crazy. But I just can't shake the feeling that I'm gonna freak her out and mess it up. 

I know this is kind of a common story, but I'd really like your thoughts on this. Do you, based on what I told you, think there's something there or that I'm just fooling myself? And if I should talk to her, what do I have to tell and what should I avoid? ",17May2017,1

273,"So this is a long story - sorry about that. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about three years and plan to get married after I finish my degree. In that time, I have met many of their family. So long story short, we are pretty close. I know them and they know me. 

Now, let me introduce my boyfriend's sister and her shitty (in my and a majority of the family's opinion) husband. Let's call this sister Jane and her husband Jon. Jane is a RN and works a regular schedule (9-5) and her husband does something with the city. Jon is really into fishing and hunting. And I mean REALLLY into it - to the point of being gone most weekends no matter what the season since there's always something to hunt/fish. Most of the time he is out with his buddies drinking, though I wouldn't exactly call him an alchoholic. When I met my boyfriend's family, they had two kids: a boy and a girl. The boy was almost three when I met them and the girl was probably eight months old or so. 

The kids are great to a point. I'm not a psychologist but I can say in the future they should probably go for some testing for learning disabilities/ADHD. Last year, Jane found out she was pregnant and immediately moved back home to her parent's home. Her mom is a S&amp;L pathologist and her dad is a farmer at the family farm. They have lived there for almost a year, though their original plan was to find a house in the town and move in. The problem is that my boyfriend's/Jane's mom has rheumatoid arthritis and got her knee replaced last summer. She had also discussed with me that it is difficult to lose weight no matter how much she diets and how much low-impact exercise she does. She is also so exhausted by the end of the day (due to her being mom #2 bc Jon is NEVER home to care for his kids) that she'll fall asleep anywhere. Look, she's tired, old and in pain constantly due to these kids and the fact that she never has time to relax; she is always the servant to these toddlers. 

Do I have a right to tell my (kind of) mother in law to take a vacation away from the kids? To tell her ""Look, the stress is making you retain the weight (thanks to the constantly heightened cortisol levels) take a vacation somewhere without kids. In fact, go somewhere they can't go. You need it and you deserve it for being such a great grandmother.""

You might tell me to suggest kicking her daughter/SIL/grandkids out but she wants them to buy and move into her oversized, stair-filled house (remember, she has arthritis) and she will just build a smaller, flat house next to her old one. I also really do think Jane is planning on getting a divorce someday; she is just waiting for her kids to get older so they understand what is going on. 

Any advice is appreciated. I have too much empathy to keep watching this go on; it's painful to watch this situation go on but I'm not very good with how relationships work in families (since I grew up in a pretty fucked up one) to know if this is normal or what. 

PS: Jon has fetal alcohol syndrome. My boyfriend's cousin who is a PA says it's obvious. Also, my almost MIL (whose specialty is disabled children) says her grandkids display classic signs of ADHD. 

PPS: If anyone ends up reading all this, thanks. I have no one else to ask. ",17May2017,1
274,"I'm 23 years old and I suffer from chronic depression and generalized anxiety. I'm also autistic (Asberger's) and struggle with Tourette's, profound bilateral hearing loss, ADHD, OCD, and several other things. My story is long but to keep it short and simple, my parents have legal guardianship over me. I hate it so much. My mother is a gaslighting abuser but she also is a good mother sometimes. The abuse I have suffered and continue to suffer has led to me nearly killing myself many times these past 6 years (only one actual attempt). I self-harm to cope with the abuse. My parents are *extremely* overprotective, overly controlling, and my mother is very manipulative. I need to get out of this cage I'm trapped in. I have no life. I have no job, no school after high school (1 college course online), no money, no internet at home (mother is isolating me- she also has my laptop), no car/license (not ""allowed""), and my parents are trying to keep me from getting a job.

What do I do? I have nowhere left to turn. Please help me, reddit. I've contacted every volunteer lawyer group I could find- I've called APS- I've talked to lawyers I personally know- I've talked about all of this with countless doctors, therapists, counselors, crisis line operators, friends, even people online. Nobody has been able to help me get out of this hellhole. It's gotten to the point where I think about suicide just to escape. I have nightmares about screaming at my parents and trying to break out of my own house- doing anything to feel the escape I so desperately yearn but can only get in my dreams- drowning myself, hanging myself, overdosing, jumping, running in traffic, slitting my wrist/throat, firearms, etcetera. You name it, I've dreamt it- hundreds of times.

I haven't given up, though. I'm holding on. Please help, reddit. You've helped me with so much already.",17May2017,8
277,"Five years ago, dad had a motorcycle accident which nearly killed/paralyzed him.  We got lucky and he made a near full recovery save a bit of brain damage.  Sometimes he gets in logistic loops or gets really angry over trivial matters.  His memory has always been kind of spotty even before the accident, even more so now.  Usually his angry spells are memory blackouts that he doesn't recall later.
He's always been a dangerous driver always trying to pass people even when there's oncoming traffic.  On multiple occasions, the oncoming traffic has had to pull over to avoid accidents.  This has always been a point of contention between us and I have been quite vocal about my opinion of his driving habits which he shrugs off.
So after he recovered from the motorcycle accident, the government gave him his drivers license back (I was furious) and sometimes has angry spells or forgetful moments while behind the wheel.
Last week, he was up a ladder trimming trees next to a cliff... alone... and fell out of the tree, slid down the cliff and knocked himself out.  He's all bruised/scraped up but refuses to go to the hospital.
Mom is kind of jokey about the situation but I can tell that she is scared.  She told me the other day, someone cut him off even though he had the right of way, and he intentionally hit the gas in an attempt to hit the guy to teach him a lesson.  Mom was in the car at the time.  He doesn't remember this instance.  Also, mom is bipolar, and has a habit of exaggerating, but I buy her story.
I have no brothers or sisters, mom and dad are living in a rural area outside of town, and I'm about a 4 hour drive away.
I have no idea where to begin.  I feel like I should be taking action somehow, but I don't know what the legal situation is, I don't know if just having a serious discussion is enough, I have no idea what kind of services would be available to help with this type of situation.  I love them both and I don't want to ignore them and let them sort out their own mess because I don't think either of them are equipped to handle this.  I'm getting married in the fall and I want them to be there, but I'm also scared of them making the drive down.
I just feel like this situation isn't going anywhere good and it's going to reach critical mass at some point, but I don't have the right tools for the job.
How should I handle this?",17May2017,2
279,Hey guys so I recently starting seeing a girl who I absolutely fell for but she was talking to another guy at the same time. I knew it all along as she told me they were having problems hence why her and I started talking. We hung out on my birthday and had the time of our lives with each other. A few days passed and she starts being distant. Later she tells me she thinks it can work with him and she wants to focus on tying to make it better with him even though he treats her like shit. I know she likes me but I feel like she's just too used to him and idk what to do about this.,17May2017,2
280,"So basically, this girl messaged me on Facebook and she wants to hookup, she has sent me a picture of herself ""from a friends phone"" since her iPod doesn't have a camera. She knows kids from my school and knows a bunch of stuff about my school. She has no social media besides for Facebook messenger, and she says she dorms at a school nearby me. She wants to meetup this Sunday, but I'm too scared becuase she might be a predator or something. She's always talking dirty and stuff, yet ive never seen a live pic from her and one of the pics she sent me I reverse image searched, and boom she got it from online somewhere, but other ones use sent weren't from online. Been talking to her for bout 8 months now. She's also Jewish as I am, and she knows all about the culture of the Jews in my area (not so religious) so there's a lot of ups and downs to this and idk what to do.",17May2017,2
281,"Hi everybody! I (23F) recently moved into a pretty fancy high rise in my city; this is my first ""nice"" living situation, previously I have lived in very old apartments or houses with a laissez-faire management style. This new building has a great management and community. There's a 24/7 concierge, amazing amenities, all common areas are impeccably kept and cleaned, there are semi-frequent events hosted by management for the residents, etc. 

I had originally planned to live in this building with a roommate but those plans fell through. Luckily for me, the complex offered me a stellar rate for a one bedroom. So, I'm spending a little more than I had hoped for on housing, but nothing I can't handle. I would, however, like to make some extra cash to start a rainy day fund, and figured I could babysit, dog walk, or house sit for other residents of the building. I've babysat for 7 hours and have enthusiastically loved dogs for 23 years, so let's assume for the sake of this post that qualifications aren't a hindrance here. 

My question is what's the best way to advertise my services? I made flyers but this isn't really the ""tape up flyers everywhere"" kind of place. And I don't want to get in trouble with management for advertising etc. I also don't want to approach families in the hallway or elevator and just randomly offer my services--I don't want to come off as creepy. 

I have thought about taping the flyer to my door so at least residents on my floor see the flyer, maybe sticking one in the gym, and maybe taping one or two up in the garage?

Looking for any and all advice!! Thank you!!

TL;DR: how should I let the older, fancier people in my apartment know I'm available to babysit, dog walk, or house sit? ",17May2017,1
