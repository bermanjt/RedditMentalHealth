1,"My father is 71, married to my mother for 41 years, and he has turned into an absolute asshole. My (38) brother and (41) I live on the other side of the country, so we're only around once or twice a year, but it's almost always awful now. He loudly berates my mother in public for nothing other than expressing an opinion, or choosing something. He screams at every driver on the road, and yells at the weather channel at home. Whenever we try to plan a family event, he wants nothing to do with it, and comes up with wild scenarios where the thing will be ruined, and so why bother. He has gotten in screaming matches with my brother and I while we were agreeing with him. He used to be very chill, and good with technology and stuff, but now screams at the TV when commercials come on, and can barely navigate email and texting without a string of expletives. In my opinion, he has little to be angry about. Recurring threads are that myself and brother have not married and produced grandchildren, and that my mother has to take care of her 95 year old mother, and mentally handicapped brother and will not put either in a home. He owns 2 houses, 3 cars including a new BMW, a boat, and is gainfully retired with 2 pensions. He's survived 3 cancers and still has his health, although with some scars. On the contrary, when he talks to his few friends, he's all smiles, laughing, bullshitting about the old days, college and cars and stuff. I really want to help him cheer up, but more than anything, I want to help my mother who really has done nothing wrong, and is somehow dealing with this daily and carries on. She has cried to me and my brother on the phone more than once. ",21Aug2017,1
2,"I have about 5 or 6 things that I want to really learn. They all involve practicing a skill that can make me money down the road, think 3-6 months. I live with my parents and every day here is another that I feel like shit, so I'm really wanting to learn something to help me get out of here. 

But I can't keep from bouncing around from thing to thing. I'll start on the path of one thing, then think, ""Oh that other thing would be so much better long term..."", so I switch to that other thing and it requires a budget before so I switch to another thing because, ""oh I can make some side cash there to build my budget..."", and then some other venture I started is seeing a TINY bit of progress and it makes me think I can start that up again despite some problems I've faced..... I don't know what to do. 

Fundamentally I think this is a work ethic problem. I've always considered my work ethic strong, but I'm questioning it now. I have a will to succeed in my own terms, but everything I try to do on that front always gets switched to another thing. It's resulted in me wasting a lot of time, whereas if I would've just picked one and went with it, there's a good chance I wouldn't be living with my parents anymore. 

I think I also think this way every time I come into a setback. For instance, I'll get a grandiose vision of my exact plan coming to fruition; except, when I run into something that blocks that plan, I just switch to something else. It's funny because I recognize this, but my fucked up brain can't seem to comprehend it. 

The result is that I've overloaded myself with information. I don't know where to start. I've now felt this way for around a year and a half, whereas others that I've talked to in my situation only felt that way for 2-6 months. I hate being left out more than ANYTHING. 

Fuck this was a ramble. If you have any suggestions I appreciate it.  ",21Aug2017,1
3,"	All stories have a beginning and an end. Whether that end is clear is what varies. Perhaps some may be definite and others murky. Some abrupt, and others delayed. But an end is an end. 
	
	For me, I cannot say that it will be so certain that death will take me away on a specific day. Rather, it has been creeping and won me over in many different senses before my knell will have struck. The death of my ignorance, the death of my god, the death of my meaning and self-worth, etc. In many ways I am already a dead man wandering the long trialed halls of a life that is not a life, with a mind that exists to be tainted and alienated beyond that which is natural and pure. No matter the obduracy, then, of the body that wishes to exist without consideration of the will of the conscience, it is all too clear that bittersweet release is near. Pain will have only existed for mere seconds compared to le néant (the nothingness) that encompasses the world-in-itself as opposed to the perceivable world that only really exists to an individual for a blip in the grand scheme of things. Furthermore, such a release is not something to be mourned as exemplified best by Meursault in the novel L'Etranger as he so euriditically states ""I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself... For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate."" Instead, as all things lack value besides such that we give them, it is laconically simple that attempting to assign meaning to death, or life for that matter, is the equivalent of attempting to think that grass is green for a reason other than the statement as a simple fact. In terms of predicate, it can be given as, green(grass), in the same way that death can be given as end(death), such that a quality of death is that it is an end (note: it may be perceived as something more than an end, but for sake of argument, it was used as a simple quality). After all, we live in a world made up of facts, not of things, which come together to form what is immediate. Facts are observable, therefore when as animate entity such as a human stops observing and thinking, whether consciously or sub-consciously, they are freed into what is truly there, free from phenomena: the noumena. Death merely aids in the realization of such as an intermediary. Therefore, death and the nature of dying, in general, cannot be allowed to be limited to human perception and language as both are mere mechanisms that overcomplicate that which is truly simple. And that simplicity cries, ""Let death wash over the individual, acting as the sponge that will soak up their horizons, being the darkness that sets the suns of their future, the light that forever rids their mind of clouds, and the agent of change that frees them from themselves!""
	
	But an ending alone is not a proper story for more regimented Western audiences, so it is pertinent that background be given. Karl Marx viewed currency/money as the universal alienator, stripping away from commodities and, in the case of slavery, individuals their essence. On the contrary, however, the universal alienator, at least in personal experience, is time. As it progresses, the unthinkable becomes reality, the hopefuls lose their optimism, and a person is dug further and further into a hole existing due to the unrealistic demands of society. So it is only fitting that I separate portions of my short life based on different periods of alienation.
	
	From the moment of my conception my paternal grandparents were very suspicious of me due to the rather close proximity of the marriage of my parents. In my culture, fornication is highly shunned and looked down upon due to the unification of such with the quality of facts known as taboo. Islamic Bangladesh, while far more moderate than, for example, Pakistan, clings onto such a viewpoint as a child does to their youthful comfort object. Taking this into consideration, comes the first point of alienation. My birth was lonely and isolated in the small town/village of Joypurhat. My mother had to undergo a Caesarian section in a small clinic on the way to her parents’ home in the village of Amair in the Naogaon District. It was and still is difficult to travel with a newborn, but it is more difficult when it is done alone. My father, like my grandparents, was not present as he was in college at the time in Texas Tech. Two riffs resulted from this. Firstly, his parents lost natural parental love that came from the fact that he was doing away with the tradition of the eldest child having to look after their parents, leaving it instead to his younger brother. This would greaten the present gap between me and my paternal grandparents further as they would extend their hostilities to those closest to my father, my mother and myself. Secondly, the other shaken up relation came between him and me, his only child. The lack of a male figure early on in my life meant that I developed a closer relationship to my mother when I was young and this would stir up trouble later on. But for the moment, I grew up in many different households and my father's parents would even welcome us back, but still with suspicious eyes and only after I had learned to talk and move on my own two feet. So it was possible that I grew up in the mindset of a naive, simple farm boy, taking up the natural setting of the area my mother and I were found to be the most, her parents' farm. Many occurrences come to mind, but only one, the incident where I had fallen off a motorcycle at the age of two and suffered a brief coma, truly matters. This would be the first, and unfortunately not the last, traumatic experience I would undergo. Beyond this, everything would change around the time I was three. After numerous attempts, my father had successfully attained visas for us in the United States. So, with I heavy heart, I left the only land I knew to take up a more urban lifestyle as a first-generation immigrant.
	
	This resulted in the second and third points of alienation: between myself and my homeland, and myself and my father. Upon arrival to Miami, Florida, my mother and I were wanting nothing but sleep as we were simply exhausted. At one point in the journey she made the mistake of missing a plane from London to our destination, and instead had to catch a plane to Chicago before reaching Miami. The travelling had made her ill and she had to immediately rest. As for me, I had to have dinner. Tradition dictates that parents spoon feed their children for longer ages than is accustomed here in America, so my father took it up as my mother was asleep. However, this proved to be a problem as I was used to my mother performing the task and no one else. So after numerous failed attempts to get me to eat, my father demonstrated something I will never forget, in an instance that will have forever rendered me timid and afraid as it was simply shocking and emotionally traumatic. He succumbed to anger, reached for a chair, and smashed a big hole in the wall of our apartment, before storming off to the bedroom. Hearing the commotion, my mother came back out and fed me. The following day, we would go shopping for supplies to fix the hole, but nothing could fix nor remove the memory from my mind. I would recall the encounter years later to family friends, which would lead to my father denying the event with a light smirk saying that I had broken the wall. As a result, he would develop into a figure I would always fear. To make matters worse, I had a mountain of trouble acclimating to the new country I had come to. The cultures were so vastly different and my barely developing English did not help this. So, my father would give me lessons, which would only evolve into further episodes of rage when I demonstrated incompetence. But as time passed, more events would take place. Just as I had mostly remembered my coma from when I was younger, I mostly remember a large storm from that period as something significant. I had not known it then, as I was used to big rainstorms (coming from Bangladesh), but that storm was Hurricane Katrina. Aside from this, I would not stay in Miami forever as we would move to Canada seeking citizenship. Here I would truly learn English, get a grasp on French, and begin my schooling. What sets it apart from other places I've lived was that I had no bad memories. Times were good, the people were incredibly open and friendly, and I thought I might fit in. But dreams always come tumbling down towards reality. My parents realized that it would take just as long a time to obtain citizenship here, so they thought they might as well have moved back.
	
	The destination came to be where I've undoubtabley lived the longest, Texas. It would be here that I would grow on the muddy, weak foundation laid by my troubled past. I would start Kindergarten in a school in Kingsville, not too far from my apartment. The biggest thing that set this place apart was simply how small the mindsets of people were in terms of ambition. I had lived in a big city and rural farm, but I had never before gauged the people of a small American city. The situation was simply strange, but the people, for the most part, were rather nice. Although I had learned English by then, I still had to learn to take words into the context of Americans. In one such instance, I had gotten into a fist fight with a peer over a rather trivial matter of misunderstanding. And as my time in school would progress, I gained a reputation of getting into such fights. My parents would, many times, receive an envelope from the school, detailing my transgressions. However, nothing that would haunt me later on would occur. Except, of course, the summer of 2008. Due to the nature of my parents having accents, they would teach me what I perceived as a different kind of English, a strange kind of English. I was forced to speak what I knew as ""correct English"" when they were not present, as I ""knew"" that to be correct no matter if my parents thought otherwise. To hide this from them, I would simply keep quiet around people that spoke English to me while they were around. However, this would lead to them sending me to summer school specialized for foreign students. It was, for the most part, pleasant, but one person changed that. His name was something that I revile to this day, Kevin. From what I assumed to either be Japan or South Korea, he was in 8th grade and seemed very friendly at first, always wearing a smile, but I couldn't comprehend the hideous intentions of such a smile. It started with him attempting to hug me, which I resisted as I was in no way a hugger. But it evolved into him trying to kiss me multiple times, such as on the head and even on my lunchbox. Some older guys noticed and pushed him away from me and punched him. These events would lead up to an instance when Kevin and I were in the bathroom together. He groped me and tried to remove my clothes, though at the time I didn't know what he was about to do. Thankfully, a couple of guys showed up again and started hitting him. At the time I thought he wasn't really doing anything, but looking back, the ordeal was terrifying. Either way, I was alienated for a fourth time, from my peers, as even though I didn't know what was occurring, I became quieter due to my confusion of the nature of the situation. I didn't feel like I understood anything about America anymore.

	And yet, came point of alienation number five, as my mother would join my father in being at a distance from me. At times, it seemed like the only reason why they were together was due to my well-being. Fights broke out numerous times, and either parent tried to leave, but never came across to actually doing it. They tried to show they cared for me by telling me numerous times that they suffer just to raise me (as if other parents don't), but this was contrasted with incidents such as when my mother would try to kick me out of our apartment simply because I had thrown a water bottle out the window of a car when I was eight years of age. Of course, I had done something childish, but I was a child and such a thing was not beyond my nature. It seemed that at every corner, they expected me to be older than I truly was. To me, this was a pure waste. Why would a child waste their childhood on the difficult future? It never made sense to me. The idea at heart was and is just phony. It is met with some similar verbiage in school in examples such as when teachers will tell their pupils to ""act like 3rd graders"" even though they are not truly such. It's this looking into the future that is filled with mixed emotions. On one hand, I will be free of my parents, but on the other, they expect too much out of me. This can be seen in their attitude towards school. They forced me to put my safety and education first above anything social (not that they cared for anything social). Embarrassing articles of clothing (I wasn't allowed to pick my own clothes until I was ~13) and strange behaviors made it even harder for me to fit in. It was by sheer luck that I made friends, but I wasn't close to any of them. I was accustomed to staying home while others ""hung out"" and engaged in social activities. In addition, when they spoke of activities such as video games, I was left with silence as I was strategically disadvantaged. This was because I was more accustomed to obtaining what I wanted by getting it myself. Sure it built a sense of independence, but having to buy and pirate what I wanted was hard and kept me below my peers. I secluded myself to a more sedentary life and grew to be ""larger."" This would make it harder for me later on. But for the moment, things were constant, though I felt like stabbing myself simply as I viewed life as futile (a thought I've had since I was ~6-7). But the new decade of 2010 would change everything. 
	
	We finally got a house and moved to Corpus Christi, and with that came the task of adjusting to a new school. I wasn't the least bit socially skilled and ended up being very lonely. In my previous school, everyone was each other's friend, no one was very self-centred and no one was truly that elitist. But London was different. London was privileged. London was rich. London was the home of social stratification. My poor athletic skills didn't aid one bit as such skills were a highly desirable quality. A quality I lacked. So came my sixth point of alienation. No one seemed to really want to befriend me and I was left as the outcast. Such continued until winter rolled around and something strange took place with Star Wars being mentioned in class and a commonality being found between me and a few other guys. It was my big break, but it wouldn't last long thanks to modern technology and shamelessness as point of alienation number seven same to being: Pornography. Referring back to second grade, I had heard about something called ""sex"" from my greater aware peers, but never got around to researching it. That is, until I heard more of it in fourth grade, where I was also introduced to the concept of homosexuality. Needless to say, I didn't remember the incident with Kevin just yet as I was somehow supressing it sub-consciously. But in general, pornography came to be a large part of my pathetic lifestyle. For the longest time until my sophomore year in High school, it made me feel less lonely, took away sadness, and left me wanting more. As this occurred, I grew to be very lewd and would speak of such in terms of sexual humour. Of course, my contemporaries didn't find this the least bit appealing and I gradually lost whatever friends I had. All I had was myself. I was back to where I started before the euphoric period of Star Wars afficiandoism. Yet two remained with me, my outcast friends. We were the laughing stock, the victims of homosexual humour, and such continued until I reached another relatively flat period in my life in sixth grade.
	
	Religion was, for the longest time, something I held near and dear to me. For someone of my mindset, I would get down on my knees and die for a god I couldn't tell was there as I knew no other place where I actually did fit in. Logic was not with me and I was blind to the true metaphysical nature of reality that was easily proven with the paradox of omnipotence. But I was purely fascinated with the fairy-tales of religion as toddlers are captivated with fairy-tales of the Grimm or Andersen sort. The tales of Noah and his arc and Moses and his serpent staff had me wanting more and more. I wanted to believe we are here on this blue marble in the middle of vast nothingness for a reason, that I had a reason to will myself past all the tough times. So, in order to live the path I believed in, I wanted to truly be a good Muslim and commit. Though I found it hard, living in a Christian nation, I tried to make it work no matter what. I would listen to debates between the likes of Sam Harris and Reza Aslan, watch sermons by scholars, and try to live ascetically. Yet, this was merely another alienation, number eight, from the reality of the world and all that is really there. I can never again gain back the time I had wasted on religion, though if I could do it over, I may do it again to simply gauge even more delusions and why it is all false. Yet, there was another side to this alienation, bigotry. From 5th grade onwards, I couldn't escape jokes, ridicule, and hate speech directed at me for simply being in a religion I was born into. Even as I started to let go of Islam, I just couldn't tell people that I was atheist or non-religious simply as it would look like I was giving up and conceding they were right in their own delusions. But while I remained religious, various issues would come up that would make me fundamentally rethink myself as the year 2014 started rolling in.
	
	I had subtle interest in politics, but after looking at various Socialist ideas, I started wondering why things were the way they were. As it so turned out, the words of Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx liberated me from the muddy nature of what we call society. Sadly, at the same time, when taking this ""red pill,"" I came across my ninth point of alienation. This was the direct result of finally realizing that society was manufactured in the favour of an opposing socio-economic class that also pulled political strings. Of course, I knew life isn't meant to be ""fair,"" but to finally see why changed everything. Whether this was a good or bad thing I'll never know. It begs the question of whether it is better to live a life of blissful ignorance or that of the depressing truth. No matter, I made my choice unknowingly and ended up reading further into Leftism. In comparison to my past, I was formerly a neo-conservative in my youth and turned towards classical liberalism before finding social liberalism and progressivism. However, I abandoned these right-wing and centrist paths of thought to find what was and is real. Eventually, I jumped from Marxism to Leninism to Trotskyism to Titoism to Luxemburgism to Anarcho-Communism to Anarcho-Syndicalism. The last one being where I will now, and forever reside until I die. But no matter the long political journey I underwent, what is clear is that it was merely the tip of the iceberg.
	
	I had always breezed through classes and was regarded as the best of the best academically, but I had no way of knowing the sheer horror that was AP World History, especially as I barely started High School. The summer project was in itself tedious, but little did I know, things would not get better. Notes and essays took hours and hours to complete, with quizzes and tests being notoriously difficult. Getting a B the first six weeks had crushed my sense of success, but for whatever reason, I adapted and forced my will onto my work. Eventually, I would be at the top of the class and attain a 4 on the AP Exam. This was paired with the entirety of my freshman year. It almost seemed like I had friends and people tolerated me. Various little things would improve, and events such as being chosen as the freshman class representative for homecoming would give me an unrealistic outlook. That specific event was not truly ""serious"" as I was chosen as a joke, but to someone like me who's basically an attention-whore, I ate it up knowing that it was at least better than being ignored. It had all actually gone by quite well, and I started believing the lie that I could do and be anything. This was my tenth point of alienation due to myself falling for the notion of success based on simply trying. Those who try do not succeed as success is based mostly on chance. No matter if anyone believed it to be true. No matter if I believed it to be true.

	The period of time from the beginning of my sophomore year in high school (2016) to the present is very unique in that so much has warranted my attention to the true nature of life and living. So it is only fitting that they be examined in their own section:
	
	It all started with a bit of euphoria remaining, thinking everything would go by finely. Oh how wrong I was. In the month of August, another altercation occurred with my mother, where I refused to wear a pair of pants she had told me to wear. Upon coming home and walking into the garage of my house, she would glare at me and ask what I was doing coming into the house. I ignored this and went into my room, but she would follow and tell me to get out of the house. That she had no need for a child like me. And for what? A pair of pants. But things would get out of hand as I took my phone. She would follow me grabbing my shirt as I left, almost tearing it. So I pushed her off, ran to the other side of the house right next to the fence, and called my father hoping he could stop the insanity. When he got home, I can't say I was the least bit surprised as to what happened. Crocodile tears flowed from the woman I call my mother's eyes as she would explain that I was being violent. My father would yell at me as I would stand there petrified as to what would happen next. He yelled at me to go to my room. I would not leave that room for the rest of the night and stayed in there the whole week. Not acknowledging any other room as I came home from school. That single moment eliminated any sense of trust I had not just with my parents, but with everyone. Thus, resulting in alienation number eleven.
	
	However, later in that month, something would take precedence over the horror that was that day. I was watching a movie, and my father was mowing the lawn. Without warning on that fateful Sunday, I heard him calling for help whilst lying down on that patio saying he was sick. My mother heard the commotion and sat there with him for an hour trying to figure out what was wrong. After he took a shower, my mother forced us to go to the doctor. As I sat there in the waiting room, something utterly profound happened. A nurse would walk up to me with a smile saying that my mother would like me in the back, although she said I could stay there. I chose to stay, but my mother came over there a few minutes later saying that I should come see my father as he had in actuality had a heart attack. The news hit me hard and I would sit at the hospital waiting room knowing the future was up in the air. The rest of that day is still clearly etched into my memory. Though he turned out alright, the incident reminded me of the fragility of life and became the twelfth point of alienation. That is, between me and my life itself.
	
	From the moment I saw her my freshman year, I thought she was a nice kind of strange. I'll never remember what specific day, but I'll always remember saying hi to her for the first time. Of course, we had no classes together and she sat on the other side of the table I sat at during lunch, so it was hard to get to talk to her. This was especially the case as a certain someone would always be around her. But during sophomore year, things would change incredibly rapidly. We both had band and marching season meant that we would get to talk more than ever. It all started with a few words and, in one instant on a bus, going to and coming back from a road game did I realize that I had a strange set of feelings for her. I'll never forget that day when I was mostly just being typically annoying and started messing with her hair and drumsticks as I sat in the seat directly behind her. The next two weeks would portray me, then, as Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a mountain. I had never truly had the guts to ask out a girl or tell a girl I liked her. This came as a result of two things: firstly, I had never actually truly liked a girl besides in a lustful manner, and secondly, she possessed something different that willed me to at least try. I possessed ambition in the sense that I realized my will to power, my will to succeed, and my will to be someone greater. So it was, that I would talk to her more often in that time period and, thusly, acquire a kind of confidence that was and never will ever be found in me. A friend would jokingly confront me on my crush and told me that if I truly liked her, I'd go for it in spite of the fact that someone else had also taken an interest in her. So I rehearsed some lines in my head and waited for the perfect time to ask. Then, along came October 13th. There was a meeting afterschool for an extra-curricular club, so I used the time afterwards to talk to her alone. I would explain that I had thought about her since the time in the bus and that I just wanted one day to her. Yet, she stated that she was ""not good with relationships,"" avoided dating as she had a lot of guy friends who would get jealous, and that the answer was a maybe. Being an absolute fool to the truth in my blind optimism, I could not just easily let it go and instead decided to keep trying. That night, I sought ideas and things I could do to get her attention and decided on a poem. The centrality of it was derived from comparing her to a specific flower, which I would hand with the poem. The next morning, after marching band practice, I tried to tell her to meet me in a spot where I could give her the poem and flower without attracting attention, but she instead walked away saying ""not gonna happen."" But I still tried and tried, as she left I tried to almost drag her over there, but upon realizing the absurdity of the situation released her. As she walked past the doors I handed her the poem and I tried for the flower, but she had already left, leading me to throw it away in the trash that was right next to the door. Strangely poetic arrangement in retrospect. The object of the utmost worldly disgust lay there just by the door, right next to the trash. The whole day, I panicked at my stupidity for opening myself up to someone in such a personal way as the words ""never gonna happen"" kept circulating through my head. This thirteenth point of alienation opened my eyes to how things really were in life to the hell of the year 2016. But what was more was that I would still try to talk to her or at least be in her presence after that awkward encounter. Later, around winter, I would find out that the other person that tried to gain her affection had succeeded and many before and after him. That only led me further into the hole of nothingness I was in. It was all too clear that she had lied in her statement that she avoided dating and this left me in a status worse than trash. I was not worth a single chance, much less the truth of such. The statement that the bitterest of truths is better than the sweetest lies holds the utmost subjective truth in this instance.
	
	Election Day came in November, leading me to pre-maturely laugh at the face of Trump supporters, who had little chances of winning the presidency. That night, when the results came rolling in, sheer horror came about me as the chances of him losing slimmed. The man that was set to win the White House had, to me, been delivering such scary rhetoric throughout the duration of his campaign towards my people, Muslims. I never thought that people would favour such a man who had clearly embodied a certain figure from the past come to haunt the future. But they did. And with it, I was alienated for the fourteenth time from the very nation I lived in, trying to come to terms with the horror of reality. The fear that was implanted within me could not be easily espoused. I carried a strong sense of hate and disgust towards all those supporting that man. I just couldn't shake off the feelings from that Black Tuesday. So, I decided I couldn't live in that kind of a world and made a noose. On the night of November 12, I wrapped it around my neck and decided to try to strangle myself as when I tried to give my ceiling fan a pull, it creaked. But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't force it. It was only the third time I tried doing something like that and I just didn't have the strength. So, I brought out my favorite razor and cut away (though I didn't self-harm frequently), making a new habit.
	
	Communist ideals had freed me from conformity in the past, but existentialism would free me further and make it impossible to conform. His name was Max Stirner. He opened his book du jour with a line a will never forget, ""What is not supposed to be my concern! First and foremost, the Good Cause, then God's cause, the cause of mankind, of truth, of freedom, of humanity, of justice; further, the cause of my people, my prince, my fatherland; finally, even the cause of Mind, and a thousand other causes. Only my cause is never to be my concern."" Those words alone liberated me from the world and its falsehoods. I had gone through life trying to appease others and society, when in reality I should have been trying to please myself as there is no struggle greater than that of my own. The ideas of nationalism, Islam, etc., were forever gone in an extended fifteenth moment of alienation. I took all of Stirner's words to heart and realized that there is no one greater than one's self.
	
	As it so turned out, in the beginning of 2017, I decided to get an Instagram account and actually follow the trends. So much occurred as a result of that account that I couldn't possibly have predicted it. But on one fateful day, I started talking to the same girl that had rejected me. In one instance in March, we were having a normal conversation and she switched to the poem. After talking about it, she said she was sorry and didn't stop thinking about that moment. The poem was, according to her, the nicest thing any guy could do for her and that she ""liked me."" I guess I felt what is known as happiness, though I can't describe it. I thought maybe I had succeeded, maybe I could do the impossible. Then came March 25. It was a normal Saturday, like any other, but a singular Instagram post crushed that. She had started dating yet another person and for whatever reason, I felt incredibly depressed. Whatever trust I had in her words fled like lambs from the slaughter. To say that you ""like"" someone and start dating someone entirely different renders the former invalid. Of course she didn't actually mean it. Again I had fallen for words in a ridiculous sense of optimism. I popped a few pills hoping I'd find a friend in death, but words circulated through my head. Not ""never gonna happen,"" but ""All things are nothing to me. Nothing is more to me than myself!"" And with that, the idea of love was alienated (number sixteen) from the corpse I call my body with the help of my hero, Max Stirner. Accordingly, I induced vomiting and decided against going through with it.
	
	The following months would be strange. We would continue to talk more and had long, extensive conversations. I would truly get to understand her and found her strangely relatable. Eventually, in mid-May a day after my birthday, she would send me a long paragraph describing how she wanted to ""be with me."" Whatever that truly meant, I did not know. And it's rather sad, I would have liked to believe that and any other nice things she would tell me, but I thought of just how many people before me had likely received the same words. It's easy for her as she has been there with a great many others, so why, I thought, would I be any different, any better. In all honesty, I never thought she meant it too seriously. After all, she had still been dating the guy that nearly drove me to suicide. Yet, she would keep telling me that she looked at me differently. But why would I just blindly trust such words, when lies phrased similarly had led me to pain in the past? In spite of all this, I chose to try to feel love, knowing it could all easily backfire and blow up right in my face. So, time went by, she and her boyfriend broke up, and summer began. It was long and arduous. No matter the lack of trust, I still cared deeply for her and decided I would write more poems. One for every day of the summer I didn't get to see her. 
	
	It just so happened that at the end of June, we were texting and she said she loved me. The emotions that came were indescribable, but to attempt to do so would lead me to say that they were a combination of longing and depression. I couldn't help but break down into tears as I just didn't know how to feel. So I told her that I couldn't believe that she would view me the same way I viewed her. She would cry as a result of my words, but I would try to fix my clear mistake. Fast-forward to the end of the conversation, I felt a weird sensation of happiness and hope, knowing that if worse comes to worse, I would still have her. So I continued writing the poems. The process was tedious. Writing them on a piece of paper, before transferring them to text files, printing them out onto a few pages with small font, and writing them down with nice ink. I did the last of these late into the night until 3 a.m. in the last days before school began as to avoid my parents finding out about the matter. The first day of school, I was overjoyed to see her beautiful smile and gaze into her eyes once more. As the day came to an end, I gave her the poems and described a few things. When I got home I waited for what she thought and was shocked to find out that she had read ALL of them. All 50+ poems, many of which I thought weren't very good. The following conversation would have to be one of the happiest I've ever had. I felt like life was actually worth living, but that would change in less than twenty-four hours.
	
	On Wednesday of the same week, I would walk into 7th period to find two of her friends talking about her in secret. I heard someone new came in and the girl I liked instantly took a liking to her, almost clinging to her. Eighth period I would stay very silent, which let her know something was up. After school, she would ask what was wrong, leading me to ask if she liked the new girl. She denied it, saying that she only liked her as a friend, but I just didn't know whether I should believe it. After all, from my experiences, she could easily like anyone so long as they were not me. What I could accomplish in the span of months in getting her attention, someone else could accomplish in a single moment just by being there. I guess it's my fault really, nothing to blame on her. I was born ugly and dull. My personality is not one that evokes emotions from others very quickly. Rather, it requires time for me to connect with other people. But going back to that night, I said that if she didn't want to be with me, she didn't have to. Needless to say, the results of that conversation held a mirror to my face and I saw a jackass being reflected back. The following weeks would expose a rift that had grown between us, leading to my seventeenth point of alienation. The worst of them all. Between the girl I had come to love and myself. She had trouble feeling the same way she used to as I had shown little trust, leaving me in limbo.
	
	A household situation would take place in the midst of this that would worsen the situation and erase whatever little we had. Thus, it was so that I invested in Nihilism more than ever before as I realized that nothing really did matter anymore, and nothing would. Out of pure chance, someone had, at random, direct messaged me saying I was “cute” and that they wanted to go out with me. I had to naturally decline as my heart only belonged to one person, but as the person asking was a guy, I had flashbacks to another guy that had an interest in me, Kevin. This led me to my eighteenth point of alienation, where I recollected the past and realized I was forever bound to it. I couldn’t live for the moment without being haunted by the spectres of yesterday.
	
	As I sit her today typing this, I realize that I have incurred my nineteenth point of alienation as she has transferred to a different school. Thus removing her from my life physically. The emotional divide is now embodied and I have realized that I have nothing. I'm back at a spot I was in last year. Only now, I don't know how I coped with the loneliness. Humans are social creatures. Take away social contact from them and the results will be detrimental. Of course, you could say I have ""friends,"" but they openly mock me and ridicule my existence. I have parents who say that I'm the source of their suffering. Most importantly, I have myself and my own conscience, which wants out of the losing war being waged by the corpse it embodies.
	
	So, it is simply able to be stated that throughout the duration of my life, things have only gone downhill with no prospects of a fair tomorrow. My life is not one worth living and begs me to ask why it must live without the presence of anyone or anything. Besides, all it takes to remove the pain of the past is one final point of alienation. Between myself and my body.
	
	I long for a sense of there being something. Anything. But, the more I think, the more it becomes all too clear. I roam through the dark halls of my life that is not a life, in a home that is not a home, for people whom I am supposed to be indebted to for the pure sake of existence. All is superficial. That is the case of the conception that is life. A shame really, for it is nothing more than just that, life. To attach anything else would be a lie. For millennia, philosophers of East and West have written extensively on the various ways to truly live life, but have failed the moment their ink touched paper. So I would like to correct this mistake by asking, ""What truly matters? What really is there to live for? Why are we infatuated with living over death?"" For generations, people have incorrectly searched for the best way to live. Why not to die? After one looks past the taboo that is suicide, they realize that there is nothing at all wrong with taking their own being from a society and life that enslaves them from birth. The moment when their gaze falters, their senses become numb, and spontaneity ceases, they can say with pure confidence and a rare kind of certainty, ""All is well.""

So is there any reason why I should live?",21Aug2017,1
4,"My paternal grandmother is approaching 102 years old. I don't think anyone expected her to live this long. Although she has dementia, and needs to be monitered 24/7, for someone her age she is otherwise remarkably healthy and energetic.

My dad is obsessed with the idea of providing her care himself, in his own house. My mom is against that idea because she knows the implication is that she will be providing most of the care and she understandably doesn't want to be a constant servant to her mother-in-law whom she already does not like very much (its a long story).

Currently my oldest aunt is taking care of my grandma in her home, but I don't think it is right for her to continue to do so. On top of providing my grandmas care, my aunt is already taking care of two high school age grandkids. Their mom, my cousin moved into my aunts house with her kids after her deadbeat husband overdosed on heroin. I can see how all of this is starting to wear on my aunt, and I feel so bad for her. Me and my sister do what we can to help out when we can, but we both live and work more than 3 hours away.

My dad is very against the idea of putting my grandma in a retirement home, but I cannot think of any better option. He sees it as abandoning her. 

The retirement home we are considering is only two blocks from where he works, he could visit her everyday if he wanted to. Also it is a well run facility where she already has friends. The place has a lot of activities for the residents, and they are not necessarily confined to the home, being able to take guided walks outside. I feel this place would be more ideal for my grandma than being cramped up in my aunts house just watching TV all day.

While I cannot say anything bad about my dad's devotion to his mom's care, I don't think he is going about it in the best way. In some ways I feel he is being selfish in not considering how his way is going to affect other people, namely my aunt and my mom.

Any thoughts or suggestions on this matter would be appreciated.",21Aug2017,1

He said he feels like there's something for him to do. He said it sounds silly but his getting this overwhelming pull nd guidance of him doing something greater nd to discover him self. 

Then he has me. Our relationship. He says he loves me so much that's why his been struggling so long.

I suffer from multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. When I was 18, It was discovered that I had multiple neuroendocrine tumors in my pancreas. Some were so big that the doctors feared they would spread to other organs and so, in 2013, they removed 3/4 of my pancreas.

 4 years went by without too much trouble, and only a few other minor surgeries related to my deseace until last friday. They called from the hospital and told me that the monthly injections that was supposed to stall my tumor growth has failed and my tumors are suddenly growing fast and I need an emergency scan. 

My time is up and they will be removing the rest of my pancreas at an, as of this moment, unknown date in the very near future.

 I'm looking for advice from someone who has been in a similar situationen that can tell me from personal experience what it is like to have severe diabetes and only being able to digest food if you medicate yourself properly. Just reading about it from a medical perspective is not that reassuring.

Maybe if I cannot find such a person, I would just like to hear an internet stranger tell me that everything is going to be alright.

My job is downright toxic (I am currently at a nonprofit) and sometimes puts me in unsafe situations. On Friday I was asked to go to a terrible part of town on my own and when I expressed concern I was yelled at and told I was not a team player by my boss. This is not the first time I have been verbally harassed in the office. I have exceeded every goal that has ever been given to me so it isn't a performance issue, it is an issue where my manager just doesn't like me. I have gotten Human Resources involved and honestly nothing has changed. I have been at the company for a year and nothing is getting better. My mental health is being greatly affected and I just can't take it anymore. I have been miserable in my position for about 6 months now. 
I have been interviewing with several other places and some seem really promising but I don't have an offer yet. I find the job search very difficult while I am at my current job because I have to take time off to interview etc. I have enough money saved up to where I could survive about 2-3 months without a job.

I thought it was one of those ghost cars that the police use at first until they followed myself and the guy I'm dating, Dev. Two guys were in there just watching us. I couldn't see them very well, but I didn't recognize them at all. Tried to grab the license plate number, but the car sped off.


Then I got a text from a random number days later referencing that night, what I looked like, etc. and asking me out. This person told me his name is Carson and we have met before. I told him that I don't remember meeting him at all. He says, ""Why don't you meet me again and you'll remember me instantly?""


So, the other evening I hung out with a male friend. The next day, that friend gets a message from a fake facebook profile. The message says, ""Hey ahole, I know you're dating H! She's got a man. Stay away."" and includes a screenshot of Dev's profile which clearly states he's in a relationship with me. Doesn't this mean my boyfriend is somehow involved in this?

There's ANOTHER possibility though. I was seeing someone about 3 months ago for a little bit. He told me that his friend (who I have never met) had seen me kissing another guy, which was true. I just told him that was interesting. He assumed his friend was ""just jealous"" and chose not to believe him. We were NOT exclusive so I should have just owned up to it. Eventually he told me he wanted to stop seeing me because he thought I should stop hanging out with male friends even with female friends around because he thought that all the guys had crushes on me.

17,"It's kinda long, so bear with me (TL;DR to follow)...

I've been teaching English in Japan for the past 5 years, but hadn't seen my family and friends in over 4. Rather than go home for annual visits, I decided to cross countries off my travel list instead, as well as treat family to stays in Japan.

This year, I finally returned home to visit family and friends in Jamaica and the US. My boyfriend came with me so my family could finally meet him –as I had already done his– face to face. We were excited! We visited family and friends in NY, Jamaica, Illinois, and Michigan. It bore a hole in my pocket and I just about maxed out my vacation days, but it was a trip desperately needed. We had a BLAST, and at the end, I was super sad to leave.

My plans had me returning to Japan a week before my boyfriend. For the return leg, I booked a flight with Delta to take me from Detroit to NY, and from there, I'd fly to Japan (by way of Taipei) with another airline. My boyfriend and a close friend of ours drove me to the airport in Detroit. I checked in, said a tearful goodbye, and got held up in TSA's looong line. Worried about the delay, I bolted to the gate when I was through, constantly checking my phone as I went. I got there with just over 15 mins to spare. The gate was closed. No agents outside.

Maybe they hadn't boarded yet, I thought, and asked a passenger seated by the gate if she was on the flight. She was not. Panic started to set in. Another passenger recommended I speak to the gate agents nearby.

Crying and shaking, I ran. Borderline incoherent when I got there, I pointed at the plane still at the end of the jet bridge and told the gate agents that I needed to be on that flight because I had a subsequent flight to Japan. ""Sorry, the door has already been closed. They're retracting the jet bridge now,"" was all I heard. ""Visit our Help Desk."" I nearly collapsed.

Willing my legs to work, I ran to the Help Desk, wailing bitterly the entire way, got in line, and in between loud sobs and blinding tears, told the agent I'd missed boarding by about 5 mins. She clacked away at her computer and told me to call the ticketing agents at the free telephones behind me.

I went. $383.20 was the cost I was told I needed to pay for a flight out the next day. I reeled. I'd halved my savings to pay for this vacation to see my family, and barely had enough left to pay for this, much less for the flight I was about to miss to Japan.

I said I'd call back.

I thought about my options, but realised I had none. Additionally, Delta had sent my checked baggage ahead to JFK without me, so I had to figure out how to retrieve it. I called my subsequent airline about the flight I was about to miss, had them put me on standby, then returned to Help Desk phone, gave Delta my credit card information, then sat and wept bitterly over my situation.

When I finally messaged my boyfriend, he was perplexed. He asked me to recheck with Delta about the calving. I checked my ticket too, and confirmed that there was no boarding time on it, but rather instructions that my seat was to have been assigned ""10 - 45 mins prior to departure"". I was there within the time. What had happened? I returned to the Delta Help Desk, and enquired about the flight again, this time, with a different agent. Turned out, the flight had left 12 mins early.

As the events unfolded, I realised that Delta had me pay almost $400 for a flight when they had the one I was supposed to have been on leave early. Since then, all I and my loved ones have gotten from Delta about this is rhetoric and rudeness. I was told they reserve the right to re-assign seats if the passenger isn't at the gate 20 mins prior to departure. My ticket said my seat was to have been assigned ""10 - 45 mins prior"". How can they have one thing in my ticket then enforce a different rule at the gate? Next, I was referred to their website which states I needed to have been at the gate at least 15 mins prior. I repeated that I was. Ultimately, I was told they don't reimburse flown tickets, and was offered a reimbursement for the flight they made me miss ($148.20) with a $150 travel voucher.

I'm not looking to get a ""free"" flight out of this. I PAID for that initial flight, and all I'm looking for from Delta is fairness and accountability, and to be reimbursed for the second flight. So far, they have refused to take responsibility for what they did, and I'm upset and heartbroken over this. I was in serious mental anguish, and I still can't fathom how they had me pay nearly $400 for a new flight, when they were the ones who left me behind. Thankfully, the check-in agent at the airline from JFK to Japan took pity on me and gave me a new flight that was just $34.50 above my old booking (thanks, EVA Air!).

TL;DR: Delta's DTW-JFK flight left early and they charged me almost $400 for a new one.

Reddit, what should I do? Should I take the initial flight reimbursement and the travel voucher, should I just give up, or should I keep fighting?

I'm okay with religion. I completely understand the concept of it, why people would want to believe in a religion, and I even believe that there *could* be a 'god', but I really dislike it when people make religion about *everything*.

20,"It's weird, but when I'm trying to fall asleep, I start hearing voices. Sometimes they're voices of random people that I've never heard before, sometimes they're voices of actors or musicians that I'm familiar with, and sometimes they're voices of my family and friends. And the things they say make no sense, they're little snippets of conversations or a few exchanged lines between two people. I usually hear only a part of a sentence, so I'll begin to hear it mid sentence. I'm never part of these conversations but I can hear them loud and clear. A few nights ago, it was my two friends who were talking. I forgot what they said because I fell asleep right after and I couldn't remember when I woke up 8 hours later. And sometimes I'll hear someone's voice and my mind will match it with a visual based on what I'm hearing. Like one time it was this woman that I'd never met and she was at this extravagant restaurant wearing an extravagant red satin dress and holding a glass of red wine extravagantly and she said while laughing, ""half of them are gone anyway."" I only remember this because I woke myself up afterwards and wrote it down. They're like mini dreams, but usually I only get the dialogue, though sometimes someone will be singing.

Along with that you have a living space + kitchen. My roomates all selected to be with each other in the same suit (and one of them had to transfer out last minute which is how I got off the waitlist). After living here for about a week and realizing they are quite social. They often have people over (which I dont mind) but it feels awkward to be excluded and just kind of walking past everyone and stuff (its not that I hate it its just the awkward feeling of not belonging). So I guess what I am asking is how do I at least approach them to try to get 'in' the group. I should also say that while I am not anti-social (I have friends that I party with occasionally etc.) I do tend to be a bit awkward in settings which surround me with people I dont know. I just find it hard to talk to people when I dont have a specific reason to which makes things difficult and basically impossible to force a conversation. I should mention all of us are seniors so we are all in our last year of school. ",21Aug2017,1
31,"I've been talking to a girl for four months. Sometimes, she will be on snapchat posting on her story and whatnot, but doesn't open my messages until like two hours later. I asked her if I annoy her, she says ""not at all, why??"" I was DM'ing her on Instagram 30 minutes ago, which is when I asked if I annoy her. She opened one of my snapchats 15 minutes ago and still hasn't responded to my IG DM. If I don't annoy her, why is she ignoring me but is still on snapchat? I like her a lot and I feel like I should leave, but the thought of it makes me physically sick. I'm sick of being ignored. ",21Aug2017,3

One moved away for college and his girlfriend, one is our next door neighbor with hia wife and the other one still lives with his mom but he comes to our apartment almost everyday. Literally. If he isn't helping his grandfather on the farm he is here.  He rarely cleans up after himself knowing I mainly clean the apartment. We all get along fairly well except for the fact that I am sometimes annoyed to the core that I can't have my own apartment to myself sometimes. It especially bothers me when my boyfriend goes to work but he stays here... not like he wouldn't let me watch what I want to,it's just annoying. What do I do here? I've tried talking to my SO about it but he just gets frusterated and says ""well then what am I supppsed to say??"" (When he asks to spend the night, because he also spends the night frequently) .

35,"Okay this is a really uncomfortable situation I am in, and I have been debating constantly about what I should do for the past couple of days. This is a throwaway for personal reasons. TLDR is at the bottom, but this is the entire story.

So my younger brother is 4 years younger than me, and we used to be pretty close growing up. Now that I am in college and have moved away we aren't as close, but we do still talk often. Well I came home for the weekend and was bored so I logged into his computer to play some video games. He wasn't home and gave me his password beforehand. Right when I logged in I saw that he had a folder named L on his desktop. I know it's fucked up to invade my brother's privacy but my curiosity got to the best of me and I opened it. It was full of porn pictures and I thought no big deal and was going to exit out. Then I noticed a few of the pictures that looked out of place. They didn't look like normal professional porn pictures, but pictures that he took off his phone. I opened them and was completely horrified... They were pictures of our mom naked. To make things even weirder and creepier it looked like he took the pictures from underneath my mom's bathroom door as she was changing or going to take a shower. I immediately exited out when I realized what the fuck I was looking at. I mean what the FUCK was my brother doing with naked pics of our mom!? I still don't really know what to think or do about it. I just turned off the computer and haven't talked or done anything about it since. I really don't know if I should just shut up about it and never bring it up, or if I should tell him to delete them asap and yell at him for it. I haven't told anyone and don't know who I would. I would never tell my mom because it would horrify her, but I do have older brother's that I've been debating to tell. If anyone has any advice on what I should do in this fucked up situation please tell me. I also really just needed to vent about it and tell someone because it's eating up my conscious


**TLDR** I found pictures taken of my mom while she was naked in her bathroom on my younger brother's computer. They were taken from underneath the door, and are really creepy. WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO!?!?",21Aug2017,74

So I go to the hospital then the next day it turns out I have to stay here for a week, but obviously I need to go to summer school it's only 1 week left, but I can't. So now I have to take algebra again which means I basically wasted my time going to summer school.

I had told my parents that I didn't want to continue. I want to focus on school and not have a gut-wrenching feeling all day for the next two months. They told me they couldn't give a shit if I continue playing, however, quitting does not build character. Ultimately, they said they don't care if I play or not. My decision had been made when I heard this; I am done.


However, my parents for some unknown reason, still had the idea that I was going to continue playing. After hearing about my practice taking a break for the eclipse (Thanks, local news), they immediately told me, ""You better be at practice tomorrow!"". 


Oh boy, if only you could feel my heart at that moment. My heart sank to my stomach faster than I could blink. I didn't respond to what they said. I plan on telling them I'm not playing tonite, but the thought of them potentially saying I'm going is killing me. 

Any advice...?

45,"Hello,

Turning once again to reddit because I have no idea what to do lol. So me and my mom get along pretty well most of the time. However, when fights ensue or things go bad, she has a really bad sailors mouth. Now I know, you can hit me with the ""snowflake, grow up, some people have real problems, yadda yadda""... And rightfully so. I know there are many worse things people can go through, but I don't know what to do in this situation. I curse all the time, and have no issues with dirty words. However, when my mom gets angry, she has a special talent for finding out the worst thing you don't want to hear, and then going a few steps further. I know it sounds pansy, but it really gets to me, to the point where I have to go to my room to cool down. For instance, we got into an argument tonight, and called me ""F@ck-face"" in the harshest tone she could muster. She has called me a filthy white trash ho/wh@re many times, and many other phrases. Again, I'm a 21 yo college student who loves swearing and considers myself a partier. But when my mom does this in the tone of voice that she does, she manages to make me feel horrible. 

It's just a little different coming out of your mom's mouth than a friend frat boy or college friend. She also adds foul language into her daily living, which can be entertaining at best, but is often a little much when done to excess or with more colorful phrases. 

What do you think I should do, if anything? I just want her to lay off for a little bit, or maybe stop using these words in sensitive situations where they hurt more and dig deeper. Thank you for your time",21Aug2017,1

47,"Hi everyone,
Im currently a first year student in university (i'm 21 btw). I had to put my university studies on hold to complete my diploma in music (parents wanted me to). Im at a crossroads.

Either I leave my music studies, and go on to complete my finance degree which will take another 3-4 years, or get my bachelors of music in piano. Alternatively I can switch to computer science/MIS and it will take the same amount of time as the finance degree.

Piano Pros: interesting job, good work-life balance, rewarding, graduate at 23 Piano Cons: unstable job market, unknown wages (it varies a lot), self employed

Bachelors Degree Pros: can use degree for variety of jobs, pays less for starters, competitive Bachelors Degree Cons: entry level/mid level jobs are not really rewarding (at least in finance). Mid level jobs definitely have higher job security than music and better wages. Graduate at 25. No/Very little social life until I graduate.

I decided to try and get a hold of my life as last year my grades had a downfall, and very recently a close friend has left me/ I too left a close friend due to other issues (I'd rather not talk about). 

I've been going to a psychiatrist ( working on finding a therapist due to anxiety/ minor depression) and decided to get a job, and start working out. It's nice having these distractions to improve my life though I noticed that when my attention isn't on something, sometimes I tend to stray into how lonely and sad I feel about myself. 

I also can't help but notice something that's been bringing me down a bit. Due to not really having friends anymore, I feel embarrassed about going out to places. I've always felt this way. Like eating at a restaurant, going to the mall, or just watching a movie. I feel sad and embarrassed about being alone. Although I do want to try and be social, I also want to be able to go out without feeling this way if I felt like it.

52,"So a few days ago this girl texted me this whole thing about how she liked me for a year but her friend (another staff member below me) also said she liked me (this is when I was their equal).

I really do like the girl who confessed how she liked me a few days ago but I will be risking the termination of my job if anyone finds out. And if the friend that hooked up with me before found out she might say some crazy stuff out of jealously. 

TL:DR I have 2 options, date this girl and risk losing my job or wait for her to leave and possibly risk the relationship to never happen. She said she has another Job lined up but I'm not sure how soon it is. She also said she would wait for me but I don't know how serious she means it.

54,"Hello, Tonight I was riding home from my brothers on my motorbike, CBR125. about 9:40pm. about a minute after I leave I see another biker at the mini round-about who was already waiting to give way to me, I give him a nod as I ride by and go on my way.

So at this point he is following behind me, nothing unusual. I will admit I was speeding a bit, roads are pretty quiet, but he is keeping pace with me, I don't pay this much notice as sometimes if I'm out riding and see another biker i'll ride with them for a little while.

But he is following me turn for turn, and if I overtake a car, he does the same. we pull up at lights, he stays behind me at a normal distance, lights go green, I over take the car in-front and ride fast up to the next set of lights, he didn't over take the car immediately after I did so I built up a little gap, as I approach the lights, they turn amber, as I pass through them I just see them turn red. he was maybe 4 seconds or so behind me, I'm keeping an eye on the mirror, and yup.... that single headlight is still there, he ran a red light. I'm concerned at this point.

so he catches up with me, he must have been doing double the speed limit easily ( we were riding through 30 zones ) now he's lurking in my blind spot, I thought he was going to over take me but he was just hanging around in my blind spot, until after a while he creeps a bit forward so he is almost level with me and starts waving his hand as in to say '' hello, '' but over enthusiastically. It's at this point I realise he also has another guy on the back. alarm bells are now ringing.

he drops back behind me again for another 20 seconds or so, then pulls up almost along side me and shouts '' PULL OVER '' '' PULL OVER '' whilst pointing to the side of the road. I shout '' WHY? '' I'm not sure if he heard me, but he just shouted '' PULL OVER '' again. It's a quiet road with no houses on it, there was no way I was stopping.

So now they over-take me and he indicates to the left whilst slowing down in-front of me, he didn't pull in himself, but was slowing down in-front of me and gradually pulling over to the side of the road into the bus stop, basically was trying to box me in so i'd have to stop.

whilst they are infront, the pillion passenger is looking back at me, but more looking through me and looking around, I assume looking to see if any other cars were coming or any witnesses around.

I dropped a gear and took off, giving everything the bike had, I'm on a 125cc and their bike was at least a 300, if not a 600cc, 
adrenaline pumping I was now riding like I had stolen it myself, got round the corner, over taking cars, my street was only a few streets along and I did think about just keep riding and try to lose them but I got into my street without them seeing me. I almost done a '' once around '' a main round about to see if they would follow just before we got to the road where they ordered me to pull over. and if they did I would have took off, but I told myself i was being paranoid...

So they tailed me for about 3 miles. keeping up with me, over taking when I did. ran a red light. riding way too close for a stranger. telling me to pull over, for the life of me I cant think of any good reason they would do all that other than to steal my bike as soon as I pulled over. also worth noting, protective gear on them was minimal, pillion dude literally only wearing a helmet and an adidas tracksuit. looked and sounded sketchy.

any other bikers had a similar experience? or any advice or anything would be appreciated.

I know it probably doesn't sound all that scary, but It shook me up a bit, Im not the biggest of guys and there was 2 of them. Have never felt threatened like that before whilst riding, small town not a big city, population of about 32 000.",21Aug2017,4

64,"To be clear, I was bullied as a kid. I was very overweight, very ugly, and had the kind of depression where you burst out crying. I have a slight mental illness but it is wholly unnoticeable. I have had therapists tell me I ""don't even belong in therapy"" because I am ""normal."" Edit: I worded this first part weird. But what I am saying is I have major depression and it translates as ""just chill all the time.""

A TLDR: I work in a highly competitive, small industry. I have my childhood dream job. A girl I used to know in college replaced me at work and I moved up a job. She has been acting weird.

Turns out she is best friends with a girl who hates me. In fact, the ONLY person who hates me in the world. I am usually very well liked. I would even say respected. I stayed in my lane in school and at work, always diligent, quiet, afraid to rock the boat.

Well the only person who hates me in the world is my former roommate. She did unspeakably mean shit to me like go grocery shopping without me when I had no car for 4 months and she would make me walk alone to the grocery store at night in the dark. 

One day I called her out on her bullshit but my pent up energy from being bullied so much came out TOO HARD. Instead of taking stabs at her behavior, I took stabs at her using me to move and the fact that she was 3 years older than me and couldn't find an apartment alone, instead she made me, a total stranger, find one. I got too personal.

Fast forward to now, her best friend works at my work. Her best friend blocked me on facebook, as did both of them, after 2 years. I want to know what is going on. 

I don't WANT enemies!!! This is the one time I stood up for myself!! I am so so so terrified they are slandering me, I have been obsessed with this fear for over 2 years since this all happened. 

I know they have been out and about on the town calling me ""crazy,"" as a mutual friend said so, but I have no evidence. All they have on me is my mean texts calling them users from 2 years ago.

To make things the WORST: I just lost my job. So now this villain took my position at work and I no longer work there. So who knows what she is gonna say??? Who knows if something she said is the reason I got let go??? I am going INSANE and I am having chest palpitations and panic attacks over what they could be spreading.

67,"Hello, /r/Advice! I've lurked here quite a bit, so I thought I'd finally add a thread to this lovely community. Thanks in advance for reading (this long post)!

Anyways, I guess I just am looking for outside opinions. I've been working as a waitress at a small restaurant for almost three years now as I get through college. I actually somewhat enjoy the work and customers, but it's the people - a few certain coworkers and my main boss - that make it suck.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best waitress ever. I have days where I'm a little dunderheaded and forget little details here and there. However, I've never showed up late, I gladly switch shifts or take them when I can, help out my fellow waitresses without being asked, and I always try to give 100%.

However, a few of my coworkers and my main boss have been perpetuating this idea that I'm completely inept and can't do anything right. Mostly it's the main boss, his daughter, and her friend.

They've told newer waitresses while I was standing right there to ""never ask PiPstein how to do anything, you come to me instead!"". One of them has made jokes about ""having to babysit"" me while I was in earshot. They scrutinize and nitpick everything I do... almost LOOK for things to criticize and then bash me repeatedly over the head with it. Other waitresses make mistakes there, but they never point theirs out for the most part.

Just today, that same friend of the boss' daughter was in a section with me that we always split between two waitresses on Sundays. She arrived late, so when we had both a 10 and a 16 come in I was able to choose and took the 16 so she wouldn't be as overwhelmed when she got there. When she asked me which I took and I told her, she gave me this raised brow look and said, ""YOU? YOU'RE taking the 16?"".

I told her that I've easily handled groups of 20-30 before.  Then she just remained silent, rolled her eyes, and walked away. 

Throughout the day, she kept taking my tables from me ""because I was moving too slow"" (even though they'd just sat down), got mad when I told her that her table needed coffee (as they asked me to ask her; I would have just gotten it myself but she always tells me not to touch her tables), etc...

It wasn't the worst day I've had with her, but it's a good example of what she's usually like. The boss's daughter is less mean, but still condescending and uses her position as the owner's daughter to try to force me to take shifts. 

The boss himself gets mad at me for the smallest things, such as dumping out our pots of coffee when we closed because no one - until his friend that loitered around 1/2 hour after close - decided she wanted some AFTER I asked her if she wanted anymore and she declined.

I also don't get breaks, which - while not required by federal law - IS required by my state laws. He lets girls early off of lunch/dinner rushes to save money without caring about the other one or two waitresses who try to pick up the slack. Then he barks at the other two or me (if alone) for being so stressed out/slow. I've told him repeatedly, ""I'm going as fast as I possibly can, I'm sorry."", and then he always tells me, ""Well, your fastest isn't good enough.""

Despite their comments, customers do compliment me a lot, even right to my boss's face sometimes when he rings them up at the register. And the other waitresses and other boss/his son almost never say anything about me being inept or stupid.

Maybe I've just been steeped in this stressful environment for so long that I can't tell whether or not this is way overkill or not? And if I was THAT bad of a waitress, why haven't I been fired yet? I don't really fit in there socially, either, but I feel that's mostly because the boss, his daughter, and her friend go out of their way to ostracize me to the others.

69,"Hello, 
So, I have no health insurance, am unemployed  (looking for work, but you know how that goes) and I think I may have strep. I woke up two days ago with a really sore throat with white patches. Initially I thought it could just be irritation from drainage due to my allergies, but it's only gotten worse. I woke up this morning with my lymph node under my jaw swollen and painful to the touch. Basically, I need to go to the doctor but with no health insurance I'm not sure what to do. If you've been in this or a similar situation and figured something out, please let me know. I'm kind of up shit creek right now. Thanks in advance. ",21Aug2017,1

73,"Over the summer this year I meet this girl through a mutual friend, let's call her Megan, one night on discord. We hit it off and began texting more frequently and all seemed good. Now, mind you this is the first time that I have tried to do anything with a girl. I was a shy, nerdy, chubby kid in high school and now in college, I've hit the gym and groomed up a little bit so my confidence has risen a bit. Anyway back to the matter at hand. We would stay up late at night and talk until 4 or 5 in the morning and whenever she came over with my friend we would watch a movie and she would come and cuddle with me under the covers. Now I don't know much about girls but I had a hunch that she liked me and I asked her one night if she did. This is when she told me that I like you too but as of right now I am not looking for anything but I just wanna be friends. This was a real bummer for me and so I decided that fine we could just be friends with each other. The next day I was kinda sad about our talk last night but she wanted to hang out and so Megan, my friend, and I all went out. Now, this is the part that confuses me, whenever my friend was not in the room she would come up to me and hug me but it wasn't one of those friend hugs, it was more like an embrace and she would look at me in a way I don't know how to describe. After that day we continue to talk as usual and one night I was at my friend's house watching the GoT premiere and she texts me after coming home from a rave what I was doing. I told her and she said that she wanted to go see a movie with me. I said sure and went to go pick her up that night. During the car ride to the movie theatre, she was wrapped around my arm and playing with my hair and face. We went to a theatre with reclinable seats and during the movie, we cuddled with each other. That night when I dropped her off she told me that we shouldn't do this because she is not looking for anything and she didn't want to hurt me. Well, when she said that it did hurt me but I told her that it was alright and that I respected her decision. This cycle of us hanging out during the days and then coming home at night and talking about how she wasn't looking for anything happened almost every time we hung out and at this point, I was just used to it. I knew that we weren't going to be anything but I just liked spending time with her.


Every time we hung out I would see her text this guy and on this night when we went out to the mall I asked her who she was texting. She said that it was her ex and that he wanted her to go out with him and some of his friends. This devastated me but I tried to put in the back of my head and keep hanging out as usual. When I was driving her back to her house we got into some sort of argument and she said that she didn't want to talk to me anymore and left my car and went with her ex. This night was one of the toughest nights this summer and when I got home I talked to my friends and I got drunk for the first time in my life. The next few days I tried to get her out of my mind but then suddenly one night at 3 in the morning I got a text from Megan asking what I was doing. I told her that I was playing League and jokingly said you wanna come over and play. She said yeah and came over. That night we laid in bed and cuddled and she asked me if I had ever kissed a girl. I told her no and then we kissed. The next night she came over and we had sex. Yeah, it escalated quickly. We continue to talk and then one night after dropping her off at her house she said that we can't continue what we are doing because she wants to get back with her ex. Once again I was devastated but she said that she still wants to be friends with me. I asked her why not be with me since we have been clicking so well together and she told me that she wanted to make things work with her ex. She told me that all of the stuff that we were doing had to stop once school started because her ex was coming back in town. I was sad but I continued seeing and talking to her because I really liked her and thought that she would change her mind and be with me.


One night, while we were texting it slowly turned from casual talk to flirty talk and eventually sexting. The next day I picked her up from her house and we went to the city and walked around and just hung out. We came back to my house and we had sex again. We did this for three days straight. I left for a trip for a week and we continued texting and flirting but in the back of my mind I kept on thinking about what she told me. All of this will be over once school started and that once her ex came back things would end. During this trip I met a girl, let's call her Abby, that I really clicked with and I began talking to her. and during the trip, we kissed. When I came back from the trip I met up with Megan again and I told her about Abby. She was really excited about it for me at first but as the night continued I began to sense that something was wrong. I asked her if she wanted to be with me and start some sort of relationship. She repeated what she told me before and so I agreed that if that's what she wants I will start seeing Abby. As the night continued I saw that she was crying and she told me that she loved me. I was so confused. She told me to not think about it too much. I drop her off at her house and we talk for a little bit about how if we did get together it wouldn't work out. I told her her good luck on your ex and she told me good luck with Abby. Later that night she told me that things didn't go well with her ex.


The next two days went well I began seeing Abby a little bit more and I was focused on her but then Megan texted me a long paragraph about how I was being a real jerk and that she loved me. I was so confused. She said that she wanted to get back with me and that if I had waited for her we could have had something. This really confused me because she told me that it was all ending once school started. I told her that I wanted to focus on Abby and I didn't want to be hurt by her anymore and she cried and continued telling me that she wanted me back. I told her no because I was scared of her hurting me again and began talking to Abby more.
While I was with Abby I couldn't stop thinking about Megan. I didn't want to hurt Abby like the way Megan hurt me so I broke things off with Abby. I talked to Megan the other day and we meet up and talked for a while. She said that she still likes me but her trust for me is broken. I apologized for making her cry and breaking things off with her in the first place. I said that I was scared of being hurt again but in the process, I hurt her. We hung out the other day like we used to do and came back to my house and had sex again and then we talked about what we are. She keeps telling me that she likes me but the trust isn't there. I tell her that I am sorry and that I miss her and we continue to talk late at night but at this point, I don't know what to do. Yesterday I saw on snap chat that she went to a rave and danced with another guy and today I wanted to hang out with her but she told me that she is hanging out with another guy and that we could hang out tomorrow. I really like her and care for her. I don't know what to do.


TL:DR Meet a girl over the summer. Fell hard for her. She told me she wasn't looking for any sort of relationship but we continued to do things. I asked her what we were and she said that we were essentially FWB until her ex came back. I went on a trip and meet a new girl and she got jealous and began to want me back but when I did come back she said that I had lost her trust but she still likes me. I don't know what to do.",21Aug2017,5
74,"If it matters, I'm a 15 year old boy. Basically, after school a lot of kids skate in this one area of my school including my best friend, Friday I decided to hang out with him. Basically, every day me my best friend and this other kid would hang out for an hour after school every day. It was really fun but a lot of bad, stupid shit happened back then. Me and my best friend getting jumped, us getting chased by this gay kid cause he thought we were being homophobic, getting dropped by this dude,getting slapped by this guy, barely dodging a punch that would have turned into a full on fight if I didn't dodge it, this kid fucking my bike up (it was an easy fix but still). This year those things are less likely to happen, I bring a padlock and a knife to school now so I should be able to prevent some really bad shit from happening (I know not to pull them in just a regular fight, I'm talking about if there's a good chance I'm gonna get seriously hurt or I get something valuable stolen from me) and I don't think we're gonna do as much stupid shit any more but I still felt really anxious that day. I ended up having to leave early because I felt uncomfortable and just said I was leaving cause I was hungry. I obviously want to hang out with him, he's my best friend but I constantly feel like some shit is about to go down and I get anxious, what do you guys think I should do?",21Aug2017,3
76,"Me and a friend have been stealing bottles for a year now and even stole 4 each at one time at our prime. We stopped doing it to let the heat die down a bit and then yesterday, him and I decide to get one each from target. When we were walking out, we were stopped and grabbed forcefully by a plainclothes LP? Idk exactly. They were gonna let us go and just bar us from every Target but since I didn't have my ID, they had to call the cops.

The cop and the LP didn't give us that hard of a time as we were pretty ""clean cut guys"" who look like we don't do this often. I smirked a little on the inside when he said that. Before the cop came, they said we might or might not get a letter in the mail for paying a fine for the bottles. I guess they don't really care after they catch us and kick us out for good. When the cop came though, he was saying how he could write us up for a misdemeanor and even possession but he's a nice guy (his words, even though he was pretty cool to be fair). He also said he would've taken us both to jail if my friend was also 18 like me (he's 17) and his reasoning is that he didn't want to take one but not the other for the same thing even though he technically could've taken us both regardless?

 They just let us go after getting our information. Didn't even escort us, they just uncuffed us and we walked down to the doors and left. What should I expect now? I don't think we were charged with misdemeanors, right? The cop and LP were pretty laid back and were joking with us a little so we could've been lucky idk. Atm, I'm just expecting a letter or something to come in the mail and just have to pay an out-of-court fine like the LP said before the cop came, which could take months. I know I'm an idiot and I'm done doing this shit for good. Any help of what is going on and what to do?

TL;DR: Caught and cuffed by LP; cop came because I didn't have ID, they got our information, not arrested, then let go.",21Aug2017,4
77,"My husband and I are late 20-something software engineers who have the option to work remotely. We live in an expensive urban area which is getting more dense by the day. We've wanted to move out to a rural area for a while now. However, it's imparative that we be able to perform our jobs from wherever we live. We want to have the option to raise livestock and grow various crops. Basically we want some freedom you don't get in suburbia.

I don't know anyone directly who has moved from what we have now to this type of lifestyle successfully and I'm wanting advice. If you've done this before I would really love to hear what you did, how, and the challenges you encontered. Main points are:

1. Is it possible to get a reliable enough internet service to work remotely, including remotely accessing servers to perform maintenance? Is streaming a no-go? I don't want to get back into cable...internet is a BIG must have for us. We've got to fund the dream somehow.
2. How reliable are ""off-grid"" properties? I've seen this advertised a lot and it sounds cool but I feel a bit suspicious. It is a goal of ours to be as off-grid as possible but we still need reliable power. I'm not looking to live at a glorified camp site. 
3. What is getting home insurance like for rural properties? 
4. What are some gotchas we should look for when buying chunks of land with homes on site?
5. We are looking in Colorado/Oregon. Were expecting to have extended periods of cold weather. How likely is it for us to go Jack Nicholson on each other? Is cabin fever fightable? This is a kind of silly fear but it's still there.

78,"The oil pump went out in my car. I was gonna get it towed to a shop, but my stepdad insisted on coming and checking it out. He got it started, drove it around a bit, got an oil change in it, then kept driving it until it stalled out. Then he started it back up, where it went ten feet before dying again. He then spent two hours trying to jump start it before being willing to just let me call the tow company we'd broken down right in front of.

Turns out, I was right all along. The oil pump went bad, and after all my stepdad's attempts to make it run without adequate oil pressure, the whole thing seized up and died, and now my options are to put a new engine in it or get a new car, neither of which I can really afford right now.

Now, my family's upset because my stepdad works on cars for a living, and to them, I should have never questioned him throughout this process. 

The worst part is, I wasn't the one who brought up the idea of my stepdad replacing my car (though, when my mother brought up the idea in a fit of anger, I did reply ""well, when someone breaks something, they should at least offer to help fix it, shouldn't they?""), but I'm left wondering if I really am being an ingrate? 

I never asked for my stepdad to help fix it in the first place. I was just gonna get a tow to a repair shop, then pay the repair bill. He insisted ""let's try a few things before you throw a bunch of money away on what might be nothing,"" my mother agreed with him because he does this for a living, and despite my misgivings, I decided to trust him, since he was the professional, here.

I've lived in England in my childhood. Then I was forced to move to France, where I've now lived for the majority of my life. Recently everything seemed to be ""together"" ( AKA studies going well, found a nice circle of friends ), but that's when my parents divorce happend.
My mother decided to go to Finland, and I followed her, curious of the language and the culture that I have origins in.
A year passed, and now I am pressured to choose where I wish to remain for at least until I graduate high school ( which will take a different amount of time depending where I am ). Now here's the thing : I don't know where would be ""the best"". 
I've already done a list of pro's/cons which I will list here :

Suomi

+ Can learn Finnish

+ Could learn Swedish

+ More possibilities after High School

- Harder
- Will be at risk of failing ""normal"" studies since I don't speak the language yet

- I will graduate in at least three years, French friends are graduating next year


France

+ I know people there already

+ No language barrier

+ More socialising

-  Will not be able to study Finnish and therefore I won't be able to access superior studies in Finland if I wished ever to do so

80,"I figured it's time to really get help here. I've been with this girl for just about four years now. We were extremely intimate and sexual for the first 3 or so, and then things started going downhill. 

I will take the blame and say it was my hobby of making music that pushed her away, as I wanted to make a collection of songs before I turned 22, I felt like it was very important to work on something for myself that I loved and actually have something to show for it at a young age. Now I'm done with my album, and she seems done with me- or does she?

She tells me she needs a break- gets new friends, goes on vacation with them, feels uncomfortable around me, doesn' t let me see her messages or who she's talking to/snapchatting, and has has completely cut off the sexual contact 100%. There is absolutely none of it, and when I get close or even get it to happen, she tells me she was miserable the entire time and was disgusted. She berates me about my physical appearance because I can't gain weight, and she tells me that she's lost all interest in me and that I'm just not as smart or interesting anymore. It really puts me down because I watch old videos of us and I was clearly a complete boy before with no ambition and nothing going for me. Now I work 2 jobs, built my own music studio, and am trying to make something of myself. 

Now you are thinking: ""are you stupid dude, she doesn't want you! Let it go and find someone else!""

But the problem lies here:

She tells me she loves me still and she cares about me. She tells me that she wants to be with me and sometimes we hang out and sometimes we have fun. There are times where it doesn't seem out of the ordinary at all and we are together again and it could go on like that forever, but if the sex doesn't come back, I'm going to lose my fucking mind. 

The longest I've went so far (after finishing my music that clearly ruined the entire relationship for her) is probably 3 days of treating her well. Anything longer and I just can't help but to ask her where she's getting her satisfaction from, why she won't allow me to give her any, if she truly loves me, what she expects me to do about this, I just go absolutely ape shit and can't wait for sex. 

Women who have been in this situation, I really need advice: Is it going to be a non sexual relationship until she cheats, or do I still have a chance to make this relationship go back to how it was?

Every fucking day I think about sex with her. I cry about it sometimes because it's been so fucking long and I feel like such a total fuck up. How does this usually end up? Does she really love me if she says she does? Will she ever be sexually attracted to me again if she says she's not now?",21Aug2017,1

Place I work at found out via social media (added co-workers who no longer work here on FB who passed on info thinking it was matter of fact)..

Have just found out today that despite better efforts to keep everything private (and avoid perception of overestimating job security or making myself subserviant knowing I now have a mortgage to pay), my whole team knew that I'd recently bought a house. This could only have been achieved by either snooping through paperwork on my desk, or listening into private conversations. Despite protestations of ""but everyone was really happy for you"", I'm really annoyed at this.

I get on with my co-workers well enough, but not enough to want to share my personal life with them, and find it a quite invasive as in some cases seems to be cynically motivated. 

My goal when I return to work is to shut down conversation about photos, baby names, any other stuff is to be able to say that I don't find this topic of conversation appropriate for work and would rather not discuss it.

Unfortunately, that's almost certain to come off as rude, destroy professional relationships, and obviously, super paranoid as well. And that's before I point out that we're doing a blanket ban on photos.

On the other hand, dislike the idea that they feel entitled to know this information and prefer to keep both lives separate.

85,"I created an account to post this because this is the first time I can actually say that I need this subreddit. So, here is my situation: I am 21 years old and my sister is 14. She is close friends with a girl she's gone to school with for several years. Over the years our two families have naturally gravitated toward each other (we've had the occasional family barbecue, things of that nature). Tonight my sister was at this friends house intending to sleep over. Around 11:00 PM my sister called for my parents to get come get her. She was crying hysterically and I knew something was seriously wrong. My Dad leaves to go get her and when she comes back (now it's about 11:30) She is absolutely trembling. Now here is where things get tricky. Because she is traumatized it was very hard to discern what she was telling my parents but from what I understood, during the sleepover, the friends family had a major fight break out. The family contained the incident to an upstairs bedroom leaving my sister downstairs to make the initial call to my parents. What she heard while downstairs was the father shouting verbally at the family. She also said she heard voices saying ""keep your hands off of her""! My sister said she talked with her friend after the fight and the friend apologized saying that ""this happens sometimes"". When my sister asked if it ever became physical, the friend simply replied ""Please don't tell anybody""  We were able to calm my sister down and get her to bed but I'm not sure what kind of effect this is going to have on her. 

Next, I went to talk to my parents and I am very unhappy with the conversation that unfolded. I said that the next course of action should be to report what information we have to a local authority, an idea they both seemed pretty set against. My Dad said ""Well you don't have all the details, you have absolutely no proof anything happened."" My mothers argument is that we have known this family for almost have a decade ""and this is the first time we've heard about anything like this happening."" I was very upset about my parents attitude toward what could potentially be a very serious case of domestic abuse. 

Some time has passed now (hours) and while I initially thought reporting what I know was absolutely the right thing, I'm starting to have doubts. 1. This man is the head of a rather large family and I have to take how this might affect all (five) of the members. 2. This man is a very successful local business owner and many people rely on this man for their income. I need to take them into account. 3. (This is the most selfish but) This guy knows where I live. It wouldn't take that much detective work to know that it was somebody from my sisters family who talked. He could really come after us if he wanted.

I really don't know what to do. My stomach is doing somersaults and I doubt I will get much sleep tonight. Any suggestion would be helpful as I am honestly very concerned about the members of this family.

Usually when I'm sad I'll go to him and he'll make everything better, but I can't for this because he's what I'm sad about. He's just as upset as me, but instead of acting like it he's avoiding the issue. We're still talking but we don't know how to talk to each other or even what we are now. We were together for a year and I trusted him more than anyone. He's the most amazing person I've ever known. If we had met in college or in our 20s I think we'd be married.
It's not that I want to get over him yet. I don't think this is something I should get over quickly. But how do I learn how to be alone again? It's been so long and he made me so much better. I just don't know who I am without him because I'm not who I was before him anymore. 
I'm going to dinner with his sister on Wednesday. We're friends and I think it'll be nice to talk to someone who also misses him. 
My boyfriend and I hung out every day the whole time we were together. We were so in love but we didn't feel stupid. We were each other's rock. We told each other everything and trusted each other in every situation. There is no friendship or relationship I've ever experienced that had been so devoted, so caring. He was perfect and there's so much more I still want to share with him. I'm so mad at the universe. I've spent hours just screaming at the top of my lungs until it hurts. Any less would feel like I wasn't doing the relationship justice. We were fantastic. 
But who am I now? I was the girl who loved him. The girl who felt smarter, braver, kinder, gentler around him. How do I keep all of that without still living for him? How do I find myself when everything I see reminds me of him?

93,"Hi everyone,
I'll explain my situation first without revealing too much.

I live in Singapore, a country that requires 2 years of military service for male residents and citizens at 18. However, because of my age it would likely take 3 years before I can go to college from the time I graduate(1 year waiting time).

However, if you are not a citizen, there is an unofficial option to renounce your permanent residency status before having to serve.

So I am now faced with a dilemma of whether I should renounce my residency status and leave or serve the military term. It is difficult as I was born here and raised here my entire life and my family lives here.

However, my final plan is to leave the country anyway and try to get a job/migrate to the US or Canada, possibly Europe. I would most likely study Computer Science so the possibility of getting a job is slightly decent but still pretty hard. My family may or may not leave and go back to where my parents were born(India). I'll also mention that the job market in this country is quite competitive and getting a job here isn't the easiest thing either as it is a very small country with a large percentage of foreigners, although being a citizen would likely help.

The disadvantages of renouncing are that you are never allowed to come back to the country to work, study or stay for longer than 30 days on a visit pass. I do not have any friends that will likely stay here after this as most of them will go abroad anyway. The only connection I have to Singapore is that I was born here and of course my family. 

The advantage of doing the military term is that I could get the Singapore citizenship which is a very powerful passport compared to what I have now and it makes getting a work visa in the US easier as there is an easier work visa for Singaporean nationals and also gives me the option to come back here to work or stay(not my first choice). But this work visa is not a dual intent visa so migration would still be difficult as I'd have to transfer to one that is. 

It is also 3 years of my youth gone and that is a huge amount of time in my life where I may not be doing anything to further my personal goals(can't get a job in the waiting time) but there is the possibility that serving in the military would change me as a person in a good way.

The decision is one I have to make but what would you do? Some arguments for leaving would be that I could save the time and since I plan on trying to migrate anyway it wouldn't matter so the 3 years is a waste of time. On the other hand Singapore is very safe and is a good backup option, and the military term may not be so bad depending on what job I'm assigned.

Finally, please don't lambast me with moral arguments of how I have taken from Singapore and now want to escape without paying my dues. I am here for advice. 

Sorry that this is long. Thank you!",21Aug2017,1
94,"Needless to say, right now very uncomfortable. It's almost 4am and I can't sleep because there's a practical stranger downstairs in my mum's bed.

He's not fully moved in right now, but he'll be staying here all week to help us with renovations. We're moving out soon and he's apparently moving into the new house with us. What I fear is that he's using my mother to find himself a house, as right now he's living in a tiny shed he renovated on his brother's lot.

However, I may just be upset as my mum and I used to be very close before they met. Now, we never spend time together, and if we do it's with him and I'm practically invisible while they're all over eachother. If we make plans he whines that she's not spending time with him and she cancels. She's had boyfriends in the past and this hasn't happened :/

I've told mum how uncomfortable I am with this situation and how much I miss spending time alone with her but she doesn't seem to care. She got mad at me and told me to get to know him... which I feel I already sort of have, as she brings him everywhere we go, and I don't really like what I see. He seems to be way too smothering and moving way too fast with my mum. 

I'm not sure what else I should do. I just turned 18 and I know I should probably be able to move out and support myself by now like most people my age are, but my mum and I were super close so that wasn't really the plan. I was planning on staying here while I finish school, but now I don't even want to be around them. I want to move out but I'm not really sure where I'd even go... and I can't support myself.

Can anyone please give me some words of wisdom? I've been stressing out about this so much :c",21Aug2017,2
96,"There is this guy who parks in front of my house every night from about 12-4 am. 

 https://imgur.com/gallery/mbVBk

The lot across from my house is a public library that closes at 8. He is never there during the day. He is always alone and no one comes to meet him. He is on his phone about half the time but the other half I can see his face looking into my screened in porch. This has been going on for 3 months. 

I'm in college and like to have friends over occasionally and we all enjoy hanging on the porch and enjoying cool nights. My friends like to make jokes about him returning books and being an encyclopedia dealer, but he generally creeps us all out.

Tonight I was sitting on the porch alone smoking at about 2 am. I could make out his figure really well. He was messing with his phone, placing it on the dash, texting, using the flashlight, flash, just being very spastic and glipsing up at me while I try to not make it obvious that I am watching him too. I can feel his eyes like burning into me. I decided to stare back for the first time. We held eye contact for about 2 minuets. Which is actually an incredibly long time to hold eye contact with a stranger parked in front of your house at 2 am. About 5 minuets after breaking it he flipped on his headlights pointed directly at me. He sat there for about 30 seconds blinding me with his headlights. I stated directly into them, confirming to him that I was infact watchinf him too. Call it a power move but I was fucking scared. He drove off slowly after that and disappeared. 

I'm so terrified of this guy, or at least my minds idea of him, that I  started sleeping with a loaded  gun under my bed. I always want to assume it's just some guy using the library's internet late at night  (12-4am 7 days a week?) But the time he's not spent on his phone looking into my house has me convinced otherwise. He could be doing drugs, I see a lighter occasionally, but the wide open public library parking lot just doesn't seem optimum. Especially with the heavy police patrol with it being right next to downtown.

It's getting to the point that I don't want to open my door at night to let my cat in. The majority of the time I'm all alone here.

98,"TLDR at bottom

About 8 months ago I made some of the best friends I've ever had. We would spend almost all day every day with each other. It was me and 2 other guys and a girl. Of course, I have the misfortune of having a crush on this girl. I know it's a stupid idea since it would probably break up our friend group so I don't want any kind of relationship with her. But she starts acting like she likes me. So it gets my hopes up. Eventually after talking to her for about 2 or 3 months I'm confident that it's safe to tell her I like her since it seems pretty stable. The other two guys are supportive of it and it seems to be a good idea. So I ask her out. And things go downhill. Within a week she starts ignoring me and arguing with me. The relationship is like this for the entire whopping duration of 3 weeks. She took a complete U-Turn, going from cute and nice to manipulative and kind of insane. Sadly I've fallen for her and I try everything to keep us together and happy but it seems like she is hellbent on breaking my heart. So she breaks it off between us and gets a summer job in another city and moves in with some family there. BUT she says that she has feelings for me and that she'll be moving back in 2 months. In that 2 months I am in one of the worst emotional states of my life. I picked up smoking and the situation with her is almost all that I can think about. I try to keep talking to her but she ignores me over and over so I give up. Then we don't talk for a month. At the end of the 2 months she comes back. With a new boyfriend. Somehow? (Still confused on that since the only way they could've talked was through the phone...) So she texts me one day saying that she doesn't want any trouble with me now and I basically tell her to go fuck herself. By then I don't want anything to do with her I'm just trying to fix myself. I would have been completely fine too. If she didn't steal my friends too as if she hadn't done enough. I used to hang out with the other 2 all the time and we used to be so close. Now it's been 3 weeks since we've done anything together. They've replaced me with her. I just want my friends back. One way I could do that is try to ""make up"" with her so I could be around my friends but then I'd have to put up with her. On the other hand I could just try to forget about them and make new friends. I would rather not though. I hate her guts and it would be VERY hard for me to forgive her. I'm just sad and I don't know what to do. Any advice would help me. 


TLDR this girl broke my heart and took my friends. If I forgive her I could get my friends back. Is it worth forgiving someone who doesn't deserve to be forgiven to get back friends? ",21Aug2017,3

102,"Throwaway account for reasons. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this and I'm very sorry if this lacks a reasonable train of thought, I've always been bad at writing long posts/stories/essays. Also formatting. 

Recently I've been feeling lonely regarding both friendships and romance, which is something I thought I came to peace with a few years ago when my depression was at it's peak. I dropped out of Highschool because of my depression and literally crippling social anxiety, subsequently losing all of my real life friends in the process.

Being only 19 I know I have time to turn around and have made some serious progress in the last year or so. I got my first job and have been working 5 days a week for almost a whole year. However due to reasons beyond my control my hours have been cut down a lot. I worked 1 hour total last week and 2 this week. I'm becoming a NEET again, more so a shut-in, and it's taking it's toll.

My only social circles are as follows

* Immediate family and a family friend

* Co-Workers. We treat each other as a second family but I've 
   always suspected I might be the charity-case around there.

* Online friends. I play the occasional game with them but I 
   don't play the same games they've been into recently.

These are my only friends and none of them lead to meeting new people in real life. I don't know where to go even if I did leave the house to socialize, which sounds terrifying really. I've recently been trying to push myself to find a second job which could help distract me again I suppose.

If anyone could give me some advice on meeting new people or even just finding reasons to get out of the house I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you once again.

When it comes to these guys, I'm completely comfortable around them, as are they with me and we have a really close bond that only time can create. We usually go out for drinks or light up a bonfire or just go out on the town, and I love that, but sometimes I feel like their friendship isn't totally fulfilling. I like to talk passionately about politics and philosophy, and every time we hang out I feel myself needing to hold back from talking their ears off, many times failing to do so. Friend #1 really isn't a deep thinker at all, so I never talk about it with him, but friend #2 likes to listen and engage me and we usually wind up talking philosophically about something, whether it's music, local or geopolitics, consciousness, quantum mechanics, or some other philosophical subject when it's just us one on one. The problem with friend #2 is that even though he likes to listen, he really never has anything substantial to contribute. It's mostly a one way conversation with a generous amount of nodding and questions on his part. The worst part is that no matter how many times we have such conversations, it usually seems to go in one ear and out the other, no matter how engaged he is appears to be. Don't get me wrong, he is a smart guy; he's a computer science major who has already worked with giant companies for high pay, but I'm a philosophical musician type and he just is not, so there just always seems to be this barrier. He also has an extroverted streak which leads him to hang out with groups of friends that I would never in a million years hang out with myself. I think fundamentally we're just really different people. 

I hope this wasn't too much of a ramble. I'm not really a very social person so going out and making new friends is difficult for me. I'm not in school either which makes meeting like-minded people extremely hard. I'm really yearning for a friend who really gets me, someone who's on my wavelength.

108,"Living in a foreign country, colleague took us 4 new employees to bank to teach us how to check balance on foreign language ATM. 

I volunteered to be the one to check first. When it came time for me to put my 4 digit PIN in, I covered up the screen with my body. 

A colleague, who happens to live below me in the same apartment building, and has been giving me rides to work until my car has been delivered, saw my PIN. He is a stereotypical sassy gay talkative person, and I assume he thought my
covering up was unnecessary. He then blurted out, ""His password is ****!!"", saying the correct 4 digits. 

I looked up in disbelief and asked him why he did that. He just laughed it off. 

20 seconds later we sat down because 2 other coworkers needed to talk to the teller. I asked him, why did you do that?
He said, to annoy you. I said, It's working. I'm really annoyed. 
He said in his gay voice, What, are you serious?
I said, okay so what's the purpose? What's the purpose of saying my pin?
He said, to be a dick. 
I said, It's working. 

I tried not to talk to him for the rest of the day. To change your debit card PIN in this country you have to go to the teller and my skills for the language in this country are still low. 

What should I do in regards to my colleague? I don't really like him. He's expressed he will only be here for a year. I am seriously considering exacting revenge but after the fury subsides, another part of me says just to change my PIN and forget it and keep my distance from this piece of shit.

117,"So let me set the background really quick. My mother in law has survived stage 4 cancer and a tumor in her head. She had part of her brain removed and part of her lungs and vocal cords removed to offset the cancer. The doctors also said that if the cancer camelback that there was really nothing they could do. 

Now here's the issue that my wife and I are running into. My mother in law is under this assumption that wine helps diminish cancerous cells in the body and that it acts as a healing agent. Now she drinks so much wine that it completely changes her into a different person all together. 

My mother in law typically when she is drinking starts numerous fights with my father in law over things that don't really exists. She berates and belittles anyone she come into contact with. She never apologizes for what she does or says because she can't remember what she did typically because she blacks out throughout the night. She claims to have survivors guilt because her parents both died from cancer. She refuses to go see a counselor for these issues. She's driving us all away with her hateful words and controlling nature to where she tries to punish people that oppose her. 

Now the issue that I'm dealing with is that my wife has over the years of dealing with this traumatic event and the events after is that my wife has developed crippling anxiety to where most tasks that she could do are extremely hard for her to do. (Examples: job interviews, Work, babysitting, hanging out with friends, meeting new people, taking classes, and others) I have also noticed that with my mother in laws constant berating of my wife that with limiting her contact with her mom these feeling of anxiety kinda work themselves out. So after noticing this and with my mother in laws drinking getting so bad to where she is rarely sober; I decided that it was best to cut my mother in law off from seeing us for literally everything until she goes to counseling and some form of rehab wether that be family in home based or with an institution that her insurance will pay for. 

The events that have transpired after this ban are hopeful and my wife is extremely hopeful and has the mindset that all of her issues are gone and she's clean. She also feels that we never should have had the ban on her in the first place because she's doing fine now but I think that with the ban it allowed my mother in law who was already circling the drain to hit rock bottom and realize that she needed a change in her life. It's also a good thing to see that my father in law has stated that he finally has his wife back. 

My question is what do I do from here? Should I wait for more confirmation that she is doing better? Should I stick to what I said about her going through rehab and counseling. Should I apologize. What should I do. 

Ps. My mother in law is supposed to go into the hospital for cancerous scans every year on e a year to see if the cancer has come back and she's not been in four years and could have cancer again. ",21Aug2017,1

Being confident too much, you will end up being a victim of your own destruction as you may end up thinking too highly of yourself but do stupid mistakes

Being too ""humble"" or think too low yourself, then you are either convinced that you truly are as much of an idiot or incapable as you think (a self-fulfilling prophecy) or try to compensate your lack of ability so that you won't be ridiculed by boasting your ""abilities"" and in the end, you will act like an overconfident idiot.

And to me, I find it hard to find that correct balance in many things. Whether it is intelligence, social skills, confidence in novel abilities and so on


I would want to consider myself as a smart person. But if I do that, I will be considered as a overconfident idiot so I often want to downplay my abilities so that I don’t think to highly of myself.

A day later I get a message request from Raul on my phone... ""need to chat, let me know when you have a moment"". So I write him back and confirm all the good stuff we'd talked about, how the family likes him, how we can be friends if the relationship were long term. It all seems very normal until he starts talking about me, like... a lot. too much. Finally it got really weird when he called and drunkenly slurred some shit about my brother. 

Thank god my wife was beside me this whole time! She's insanely curious to see WHERE IS HE GOING WITH THIS... he basically teetered on the brink of overtly making a pass, and just short of it saying ""you gotta say it, man"". 

Nothing overt was said. My Wife confirms it was super weird and looked like he was trying to proposition me. I don;t even know how to react. I've been hit on by a man before, and that's fine, I can deal with that like an adult. But I'm worried about mentioning this to my bro? I don't want to fuck up a good thing for him by ratting Raul out. But I also don't want Raul to treat my bro like a sucka. What do you guys think? ",21Aug2017,9
139,"Hey /r/advice,
I never thought I'd make a post about my problems on reddit but here we go:

A close friend (F24) of mine (M23) suddenly looks for way more closeness after a recent a breakup and a somewhat failed relationship. I totally get this. 

But it seems that she is so uncertain with her feelings that she uses me as her sanctuary. Not in a bad way though. 

I'm not sure if she wants a relationship with me (we always joke about how our friendship is already somewhat more than her last relationship) but it pretty much feels like a relationship at the moment (except we don't kiss each other or have sex). 


Should I just ride with the wave and see what happens? Because I don't want to screw anything up by falling in love with her (if it didn't already happen).",21Aug2017,2
140,"Sorry this is so long, but I started my apprenticeship almost a year ago. Things have been going smoothly with my coworkers up until we hired a new employee. The new employee and I get along fine, and I have taken him under my wing to show him the ropes. I was very glad we hired him, as I have been doing the majority of our company's workload, even though we have two other senior employees and an office assistant. They mostly sit on their computers and pass the work off to me. Okay, fine. I'm an apprentice, I get it. 

But over the past few weeks since our new guy was hired, my other coworkers attitudes towards me seem to have shifted. They are very cold, and barely speak to me anymore. I've also been excluded from things, and have started getting reprimanded. I work really hard, I do my job, and I do their jobs, too. It's very frustrating. They have also begun making comments about me to the new guy. I feel like I'm in high school again, which sucks because high school was awful. I dread going to work, and I'm sad all the time. I worry about my job security now. 

We don't have a manager at our location, and one of the senior employees is my preceptor, meaning he has to sign off on all my paperwork that gets sent to the state board. He treats me the worst. We used to be friends, but now it seems like he's mad at me all the time. I want to ask him what the problem is, but I'm worried he'll get pissed and write something messed up on my paperwork. He has ""jokingly""threatened my apprenticeship multiple times. He has like zero self-accountability and thinks he runs the place, so I wouldn't be surprised by retaliation. Plus I hate confrontation of any kind... I also worry he will call our main office and talk crap to them in hopes of getting me fired.

Do I peacefully confront him? Do I call the main office and consult my ACTUAL manager on how to handle this? Or do I suck it up and get on antidepressants? I've worked really hard to get to where I am, and the thought of losing it over petty office drama kills me.

TL;DR Coworkers being petty, excluding me. Need to confront one, but worried about repercussions. Apprenticeship may hang in the balance.

147,"So I've known my friend's SO for quite a while now being that they've been together for a decade and over the years I've started noticing things.

For example, she texts me personally when she's hammered even though we usually use a group chat with mutual friends. She also ALWAYS invites me to social gatherings and hounds me to the point where I usually give in and tag along.

She can be pretty touchy-feely. At a party she once embraced me and gave me this really lustful look that has been hard to forget. My friend (her SO) was present at the time but I think she was too drunk to realize what she was doing. Even when she's sober there's this sort of tension even though she's way more reserved and restrained.

Now, I would never in a billion years act on anything ever to damage my friendship or their relationship but I feel like her actions are becoming much more forward and intense lately.

151,"I'm going into the twelfth grade this year and working part-time at a library to save up for university. I earn around $6,000 a year and save around $4,500 of it.

However, the program I want to enter costs well over 10K (CAD) per year and I'll have to take out loans to pay the brunt of it if I quit my job after high school.

In order to keep my job though uni, I'd have to move out (so as to live at a reasonable mid-point between the university and my workplace and continue using public transportation) or buy a car and pay for gas and insurance. Both of these options would take up the majority of my income.

I considered taking a victory lap during which I could improve my grades and work more hours to save up for university. I also planned to take courses I couldn't fit into my grade 12 schedule, including 3 AP courses (math, chemistry and biology), data management, and computer science. If I did well in the AP courses (which is likely, as I will have already completed the non-AP version of the courses beforehand) I could get some first year courses out of the way.

My mother and my friends are encouraging me to take out loans and just ""go for it"". I've been told that taking a victory lap will put me at a disadvantage as I will have forgotten a lot of content by the time I start university. They also tell me that this will delay my life and career.

I trust my mother, but she grew up in a different country at a different time, and went to college in Canada while being supported financially by my father. I have serious doubts about taking huge loans and would prefer to save up as much as I can. And learning as much as possible in high school, while its still free, seems like a sound idea. 

I usually agree with the advice I'm given so being the only one with this rationale is making me seriously doubt myself. Should I take a victory lap, or are my friends and my mom correct on this one? All advice is appreciated. Thank you~",21Aug2017,1

I'm honestly okay with her going out. But when she actually goes after awhile my mind wanders to negative places. I trust her in my heart I know she would never cheat on me. I caught her in one lie about who she was with and this is the first lie in 9 years. I found out she has been texting a guy that she says is a friend for the last 2 weeks. I confronted her about it and her answers all seemed genuine that they were strictly friends, he knows she is married and it's just somebody to talk to. I believe her answers but then after we talk and I'm alone my mind goes back to cheating. It's my own insecurity that's causing this. I'm pushing her more and more away and I don't know how to stop it. I found this out my logging into our Verizon account and checking messages.

157,"My friend leaves this week for air force bmt. We have been very close friends for two years. We met online and have talked every single day either text phone or gaming since we met. There have been several times when it was obvious it was more than a friendship. But he was adumant. Only friends. I went last summer and met him and we spent two weeks together. It was amazing for both of us. 
This year he really struggled as they gave him the run around about joining the airforce which was his dream. But finally he made it and i was the first one he told. We were so excited and i was so proud. We decided that i should come visit again before he left for bmt because i might not ever see him again. Due to my financial status and his avaiability. 

The week before i went to visit we talked on the phone every night for over 5 hrs each call. The first night there was amazing. Then 2nd night he couldnt come see me. Third couldnt so i got upset. He said that he was just super busy making sure everything was in order before he left the following month and didnt realize how busy he was until i got there. Needless to say i was hurt and went home early. 

On my last day there he stopped in and we talked and he said it was just a super busy time for him. And that it would be best for him if we took a break so,he could concentrate on his airforce committment. I agreed. And he hugged me. Kissed me. Told me he loved me and would miss me and then i came home. 

When i got home i saw him online and asked when he thought we would speak,again and his,answer was. At least a year if ever. I was devestated. My heart was broken. He then stopped talking to me. Hetold a mutual friend that he would talk to me again when he felt like it in his terms. That he was just so stresssed by his upcoming future move that he needed to just concentrate on that. So here we are two days before he leaves. And i havent spoken to him since july. 

I see him online in games we play (phone games). He however is not being the same sweet guy ive known and loved for 2 years. Hes being very distant and uncaring. Even his friends who have known him longer than i cant believe it They say its not like him at all. I just keep getting this feeling that i will never hear from him again. Others tell me yes i will. That he is just super stressed about bmt and his future. And that once he gets into bmt and has time to think and as they wear him down he will contact me and reach out as his support. 

I have always been there for him through everything. And have done so much for him. I dont understand at all what happened. But i hope this isnt the end. Because i love him. I just dont understand and maybe someine here whos been thru the basic training and anticipation can help me out Also. When he came to see me before he left he made a statement he was cutting everyone out if his life even his parents. I said no youre not. Youll need people. He said no he wont that hes a loner and will do it alone. 

Also. Before I went to visit about a month before. We were on the phone and i mentioned never seeing him again. And his reaction was yes you will once im at my active duty station i will get leave and come see you. Now. Its he will never see me and talk to me again. 

I dont get how he has changed so much just in the month before going Does bmt change you? I mean. Will it maybe make him realize what he has and who he can depend in... Im a mess and dont know what to do",21Aug2017,5

**Background:** If any of you were on Reddit in 2015, you might have heard that Reddit used to run a Reddit Teacher Exchange where redditors would donate school supplies to a matched redditor who is a Teacher.

This year, redditgifts has decided to cancel this program as they thought it was too difficult and complicated to organize.  In the past, this program impacted 17,000 redditing teachers, a number of which I'm sure truly needed all the help they could get.

In an attempt to somewhat fill this void, I am trying to organize a similar type program at /r/TeacherExchange with the same premise of redditors donating to redditors and teachers thanking their donors on our sub.

___

**What I need advice about:** It's been about a week since all of this has started and I am running out of ideas on where to post this.  Sure, posting here gets me some exposure but I promise this is not my ulterior motive.

I truly am looking for advice as to how to get this program out there.  Are there any subreddits you all would recommend that may be open to this kind of thing?  I really believe that many people would be willing to be apart of this program if they knew it existed.

As of now, I am not allowed to post in /r/secretsanta as I believe they are trying to maintain distance with any sort of Teacher Exchange program.

166,"Hey guys! Thanks in advance for your time and advice.

I (29 F) just found out that my brother (31 M) is gay or bi-sexual in a very unorthodox way. 

My brother and I, who have always been very close, lived together for about a year after our college days. 

Fast-forward to last night: I have been going through old boxes and de-cluttering when I come upon an old cell phone. I thought that it belonged to a friend of mine whom I have not seen in about five years. I plug it in to charge it, turn it on, and look through it. It became clear, almost immediately, that the phone belonged to my brother and not my friend.

In it, I found many emails of him meeting up with men on Craigslist, exchanging pictures, messages back and forth to other men about having sex for pay and also not for pay.

Up until this point, I had no indication that he was gay. He is divorced with one child. He has been with the same woman now for several years. He has always dated women. 

I did find out about a year ago that he had slept with a close guy friend in high school, and even though it came from a reputable source, I never approached him about it.

Now that I see this wasn't just a one-time thing that happened many years ago, I am trying to decide if I should approach him.

My reasons to approach him would be to let him know that I love and support him, and that he can always talk to me if he would like. I would let him know that I will never share what I found out with anyone.

I want him to know that I can't imagine how he feels or what he has been through, but that I think he should feel no shame or remorse for any of it. I hope he can find compassion for himself and carve out a path for himself to live how he wants to. I would be happy to help him in any way he wants.

Lastly, I doubt he has confided in anyone about this, so I would like him to have me as an outlet to share anything that he would like to with. 

My reasons to not approach him are simply because it's not my place. Coming out, should a person choose to, is a big decision, and not one for me to make. He has chosen to keep this a secret for 15+ years. If he wanted me to know, maybe he would have told me.

I'm very torn right now and I want to be there for him, but I also want to respect his privacy to talk about this on his own, should he ever want to.

Thanks for any advice",21Aug2017,3
167,"Some info: My husband has been friends with this guy, we'll call Steve, for a long time. He has a child with a girl we've never met. He started dating his current girlfriend probably around two years ago. She now has a relationship with his child and is about to move in with Steve. 

This weekend Steve told my husband he has cheated on his girlfriend 5-7 times, all with different women. His girlfriend does not know this. 

I have tried to find his girlfriend online. I don't care about any friendships being ruined, but I do care that Steve's girlfriend does not get sexually transmitted infections. Further, it's shitty that she's moving in with a guy who is cheating and I'd like her to avoid that. And to top it off, it's bullshit that she's providing childcare for a guy who is cheating on her. 

Also, I like her. I digress. 

So, I can't find her anywhere. I can find Steve though, but what the fuck would I say? How could I convince him to give me her contact info? I'm not looking to start a fight with Steve- for one thing, my husband spent all night berating him and telling him to break it off with her. Didn't seem to get through, because he's a scumbag cheater. I want to let Steve's girlfriend know somehow. 

TLDR: A friend is cheating on his girlfriend and I can't find any way to contact her. I still want to do *something*, but I feel like confronting the cheater would be fruitless, as my husband already did and he's a scumbag who doesn't care to change.

Someone in my family recently told me that they had been having an on/off affair with a professor for years which started under the age of 16 they are now 21 and no longer in regular contact. 
They wouldn't tell me which prof it was nor the age it started nor the age of the prof nor if they still worked at the college. 

The family member told me that they had evidence of their affair in the form of screenshots etc which they would send to the prof occasionally to scare them off doing anything like this again. I'm the only person who knows this and it's clear that the family member is adamant no one else knows as it could 'ruin [the professor's] life'. They also said that if the affair had started when they were 18 they would probably be together. 

I have no doubt that if I told someone of authority I wouldn't be forgiven. But at the same time I feel someone should know, especially if the prof is still working in the college. It's not my family members' responsibility to keep tabs on them and to prevent the prof doing anything again.

181,"Long story short:

1. Parents moved in temporarily to fix up their house and move out of state after selling it.
2. Sister needed a place to stay; ended up here ""temporarily"" (2-3 weeks was my offer) while she waited for her next apartment.
3. Parents had a serious relationship problem. Father is no longer staying here. Continuing with the original plan. Mother is still here.
4. Mother does not have a job. Recently laid-off. Sister has a part-time job that is set to expire soon.
5. Neither mother nor sister has been in any big hurry to find real jobs or a new place.
6. Sister's next apartment is no longer an option as her friend backed out of it.
7. Mother is known for holding grudges and drama.
8. Apparently mother told my sister that she had at least 5 weeks here (I never said that). Sister is over 21 yrs old.

I'd like to have my place back. I have my child who just started back in school. I have a GF whom has her own apartment but we have grown very close and enjoyed hanging out in the living room, cooking together, etc.. in our limited spare time off work. It is putting a lot of stress on our relationship. I also feel condemned to the tiniest room in the house, as I took it to help make their ""temporary"" stay easier. I'm afraid to buy groceries, because I can't afford to feed everyone. Electrical bill is out the roof because AC constantly running + Windows being left open. I can't stay at GF's apartment much because child has school and she does not have a spare bedroom (I don't want him sleeping on the floor every day). I also work from home, which is difficult to do having people around all of the time.

I don't want to destroy my relationship with them. We have a large extended family, but nobody really has space/money to support extra people. It has been about 1.5-2 months total since parents moved in; maybe 1 week since sister moved in, and less than a week since parents' relationship fell apart.

I don't really know how to approach this situation. I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I think it will explode when approached. I don't want to throw my family on the streets and would never let them go homeless. Unfortunately, from what I can tell, nobody is making an effort to move on at this point (except my Father).

182,"I'm feeling slightly annoyed that a friend has basically gone silent on me, we are relatively young and on summer holiday/vacation from university so time doesn't seem to be the issue.

I used to talk to them fine, I even went for a meal with them, saw them on a night out and other events and would talk somewhat regularly on Snapchat.

Then they started just leaving the Snapchats late but I don't really mind, they're obviously busy. This was 2 weeks ago, I asked them on Facebook if they'd want to go for a meal last week seeing as our holidays are nearly at an end , no reply nor has it been viewed.

I sent them a snapchat message and a text like a few days apart, the snapchat has been viewed and ignored and the text ignored.

Is it okay for me to cut off the friendship with this person over this? I mean I'm not going to confront them at this point, I have other friends as do they. Surely friends don't just ignore their friends for weeks",21Aug2017,1

I have South African and Bulgarian citizenship. If I buy a drone from Bulgaria, as far as I understand, I can't claim the VAT back at the airport. When I land in South Africa, if I get stopped at the gates to get my bags checked, can I say that I have BG citizenship and I already paid VAT and taxes on the drone in BG then do I need to pay South African taxes?

At the store they said no, and then argued with me when I asked if there was any other way, nicely might I add, because I've been in customer service. I know what it's like.

188,"3 months ago, when i was starting my second year i was looking for flatmates to move in with. I tried to find people from my class as we have a morning schedule unlike others. My closest friends couldn't really join me as they either lived with their family or weren't allowed to live in a flat. I found a person from my class to move in with who I knew decently well and seemed to be a fun person to be around.

However, after we moved in, as the days have passed, he has developed an unknown hatred for me, not telling me why.He makes disgusted faces when he sees me, as if my mere existence disgusts him. He calls me all kinds of names and talks about how he wants to kill me.I told him even if its a joke I'm not able to handle what he's doing as I'm uncomfortable and to please stop.He doesn't listen and has made me even cry and break down many times.

I have decided that I want to move out of our flat ( we live with 2 others from a different course) and go back to my old hostel for now, but If i move out without finding them a new roommate, i'll lose my advance payment of 25000 rupees(roughly 400 dollars).Even though nobody minds moving in with my roommate, (he only does these things with me), its tough finding one at this time of the year. One person said he can move from next semester, which is 2 months away.
This would mean i would have to stay here till then. With my semester examinations a month away, this is all I think about everyday and is really pushing me into depression.I'm not able to work for my assignments or study.

I've tried to talk it out many times to no avail. I don't think i have the strength to go through 2 months of this, but I also don't want to lose the advance payment which is a lot of money to my family who are already paying a lot for me.

Do I move out and lose the advance payment or do I try to survive another two months?

Should I use craigslist to sell all of my other stuff?  Should I consider trying to move it 1200 miles and storing it?

198,"Firstly, I am - for simplicity sake - an atheist. I was never a believer in this or that baseless claim, but I have only recently matured the ability to articulate and justify a faith in reason and scientific skepticism.
About a year ago I was hired as an audio engineer at a local baptist church. I was hesitant to take the job in the first place, but in stark contrast of the grungy filth of a music venue I was then working at, the church’s well maintained, state-of-the-art system was all the more attractive. Not to mention they offered to pay me almost twice what I was making. Not that I had much of a choice - but I obviously decided to work for the church, and have since been not only listening to, recording, and mixing their sermons every week, but planning, shooting, and editing all their various promotional videos and church announcements as well. 
Needless to say this has been extremely taxing on my sanity. I watch a very unintelligent man give a stupefying speech to a massive congregation of credulous people every week, and I am responsible for giving them the highest quality media they have ever seen/heard. I think most of them are at least aware that I am not religious, but I think they also fear going into detail about it, as I have become something of a valuable asset to them, and it would likely force them to fire me if I were to really tell them how I feel about their delusion.
Recently I have been asked to shoot wedding videos for some of their church members who are getting married. I have many reasons for not wanting to be a part of this kind of production, but mostly because I am sick to death of hearing impulsive people make promises to others that they almost certainly will not keep. Especially when done in the name of Jesus Christ. For reference of “how it should look”, one couple sent me an otherwise well made wedding video that was - even by christian standards - distastefully, even obnoxiously laden with religious jargon and beautiful nonsense; it made me sick. If you removed the words “lord”, “jesus”, and “god” from their vows, you would be left with the pitifully deflated, unimpressive noise, that was surely the basis of their entire relationship.
I realize I’M not the one getting married, so if these blindfolded lovers want to throw their lives away and pay me to make a video about it, why should I care, right? Well I do care. Despite cinematography being my area of expertise, I have consciously avoided the obvious money maker of wedding videos because they are the quintessence of religious delusion in the south. A wedding of active church members in NC is the white-hot focus of all their misguided faith - second only to their funerals - and creates a situation where I would have to put on a mask and pretend to be something I am not. Alas, this is more or less what I have been doing since they hired me.
If I stand by my “principles” and refuse to do the wedding videos, I will almost certainly be made to justify my decision. Since that justification illuminates the deeper issue of, “you people are delusional.” I am afraid that I am left with choosing between doing the weddings, or losing my much needed job - thus my dilemma.",21Aug2017,1

205,"So, I had this friend who was basically my soulmate in every non-romantic, non-sexual way (she's female, I'm male). We became friends by talking about movies we both loved during breaks at work. Hanging out became a regular thing after we shared an obscure Ghostbusters reference. The whole exchange still makes me happy to the point of tears thinking back on it:
  
She came up to me at work and asked, ""are you the keymaster?"" and without thinking, I looked up from my computer and replied, ""are you the gatekeeper?"" She smiled the biggest smile I had ever seen, and we were joined at the hip from that day forward.
  
We spent 2, 3 even 4 days a week together after that, watching old movies; going to concerts, theaters and museums; having long drawn-out dinners; getting tipsy in the parking lot before a long day at Disneyland (we had passes); or sitting in her car listening to music and talking about our lives, sometimes until the sun came up.
  
She fell in love with me early on, but I was crazy about one of her close friends. It created some tension between us, but we got past it, and the friendship lived on long after I stopped dating the friend. All together, we were friends for something like seven years. I often told her that I loved her, but things stayed platonic.
  
That's when I think I fucked everything up. After another bitter breakup, I decided that I should stop chasing the women who really turned me on and essentially settle for my friend, whom I didn't find especially attractive but connected with so well in every other way.

I approached her with this proposition in an extremely utilitarian sort of way that I'm sure erased any positive feelings she might have felt from the suggestion. I wasn't blatant about it, but the subtext was, ""I love you, and even though the chemistry isn't really there, we should try it anyway."" Needless to say, she declined.
  
After this, she became much more closed off, spending more time with online friends, cancelling even important plans with me at the last minute, though still getting upset anytime I had to pull out of something. Worst of all, she became close with a person who completely hates me for no rational reason.
  
This was the final straw, and after several incidents of her putting him before me, I ended the friendship. I discovered recently that she and this guy are in a long-distance relationship and have met up a few times in person. Apparently, they became close when her grandmother died, and she had no one else to turn to for support. I've also learned from a neutral third party that he treats her terribly and that she's probably very unhappy.
  
We haven't spoken in something like four years now, but hardly a day goes by without me missing her terribly and wondering if she's okay, but somehow I can't bring myself to make contact.
  
It would be painful, but I could deal with it if she won't talk to me. But what if she still won't separate from him? How could we be friends again without keeping it from him? Is there even a point, or would it just make things worse for both of us?

206,"By chance i met her only a few days after she broke up with her ex of 2 years, they had a really toxic relationship of daily arguments (this last part lasted months). I helped her a lot and she helped me getting over some problems too. We became really close and unintentionally fell for each other.



We got along great (still do) and spent June and July practically always together. Even while we were apart we were either texting or playing video games together.



At the end of July we were already extremely close, when we first had sex (non of us is the kind of person to go around having flings and banging other people only after a few weeks together. It just happened), something i said made her remember her ex. She said although she likes me, shes not ready for a relationship and wants to be single for some unknown amount of time.



She wants to remain friends and be single for some time... She says that shes not trying to forget me, but also isnt going to make any efforts to keep liking me during the time period.



I really dont know how to feel about this. I really like this girl, its strange cuz i've never been this into someone in such a short period of time, however im terribly afraid of letting time fly and one of us just forgets...



I'm giving her space, i've completely stopped starting conversations with her. She sometimes sends me something, but always replies with short texts afterwards and the convos dont go as long as they used too.



After rushing things and her asking for some time, how do i deal with this? Sometimes doing nothing is harder then actually doing something...


And yes, I know im single and i'll keep my options available... I wont turn down any conversation with a girl I may find interesting if she does appear... But my worries aren't with the girls im yet to meet, but rather the one i really like and hope she gets ready for a relationship.

210,"Hello, my name is Ethan. I'm a recently turned 17 year old Sixth Form student from Liverpool in England.

I live at home with my single mum who is disabled and it's making me extremely depressed and stressed.
 
I'm not 100% clear on what her disability is, but I know she has damage to her spine that makes everyday tasks extremely hard for her, she also has a brain injury that makes her emotions uncontrollable, she gets stressed easily and angry too. This in turn means that I have to help out a lot around the house. Which is fair enough, I'm more than happy to help and I have been for the past 2 or 3 years now.
The thing that actually makes me depressed and stressed is the way she treats me. I do so much for her, like way more than most people my age do for their parents. My girlfriend came down for the week from London and she instantly noticed from the first day that I do so much. Admittedly there's a lot I don't do, mainly due to forgetting it or getting distracted by talking to my girlfriend or my friends. I understand she needs help, but sometimes I just need to relax and have a break.

But the problem is, is that when I make these small mistakes they build up, and for some reason despite how much I actually do, they're the only things that matter. She seems to forget all the things I do, and focuses on the mistakes I make. And instead of acting like an adult and treating me like one she just screams at me for it. For me, the way I cope with things bothering me usually, is to just stop caring. So when she's screaming at me, I just put as little effort into the way I speak and say things like ""Okay"" or ""Whatever"" and I guess she just likes to argue so this bothers her a lot.

I know maybe I should just give in and apologise most of the time, which I do sometimes. But when you're being screamed at for making a few small mistakes after spending most of your time helping her, it’s kind of hard to just give in and be a mindless zombie. Another thing that she seems to get angry at is my attitude when I'm helping her. Despite the fact that I still do things for her, I get really annoyed so therefore have a pretty monotone or sometimes negative attitude towards her; which I can see why it would annoy her, but at least I'm still doing what she wants and not refusing or arguing back at her.

Like I mentioned before, my girlfriend recently came down from London to stay for the week for the first time. We're in a long distance relationship so our only real options are to stay at each other’s houses or save a lot of money for hotels which is basically impossible for a 17 year old starting his second year of Sixth Form and a 16 year old starting her first year of college who both live so far away. The night my girlfriend came down was the same day my mum had an operation that is supposed to improve her back. Before my Girlfriends tickets were booked I made sure my mum was completely fine with her coming down still, and she was. During this entire week, despite my girlfriend being there I still did everything she wanted me to do, I constantly helped her. The only things I didn’t do were look after the dogs constantly but that’s because we were in my room and needed at least some space. I still let the dogs out to pee and I still fed them every night. They just stayed in her room and sometimes in the hall. I do/did so much for her to the point where it’s made my girlfriend appreciate her mum a lot more now. During her stay, my girlfriend and I had a massive falling out that made me really depressed, so whilst she was out I was spending hours alone in the house. Due to this, I barely did anything, I still helped out when my mum asked but I didn’t go out of my way to make her a queen.
Fast-forward to over a week ago, me and my girlfriend have fixed things between each other and plan to meet each other before summer ends otherwise it’ll be over a month until we can see each other next which really isn’t healthy for a relationship especially after going through such a rough patch. Of course, we didn’t make these plans without my mum’s permission. I spoke to her, completely calmly explained everything between me and my girlfriend and then explained how and why we want to see each other. I said I can either go down to see her, or she can come up here. She refused to let me go down, and said if she comes up she can only stay for the weekend. Obviously, I appreciated this and said thanks. It’s been pretty hard to try and sort the trip out considering the weekend she’s coming down is a bank holiday and it’s more expensive than if she stays for an extra day. I explained this to my mum, but she still refused, I didn’t argue further because I know she’s being fair enough letting her stay so soon after the last time. We eventually did find a suitable way for her to come down, she’s getting the train for £30, despite this being £10 more than it would be if she could stay for the 1 extra day we just accepted it and went on.

Now to yesterday where me and my mum where making tea. She randomly started going on a tangent about how I’m barely paying attention to anything or caring about anything. Saying things like it’s because I’m too focused on trying to get back to talking to my girlfriend. I tried explaining to her that that just isn’t the case considering I’ve just finished talking to her to come down and help with the food and kitchen. I was doing exactly as she wanted me to with nothing wrong. Then she pointed out I forgot to put ham back in the fridge, and when I asked her where the sponge was to wash the dishes she got really angry because it was in the bowl. For some reason this was enough for her to just get really pissed off at me, she went to her room, didn’t carry on with the food and just left me to do everything basically. So naturally, I carried on doing the dishes and I turned the oven off so nothing would burn. When I went back to my room, somehow we got into an argument, I don’t even remember how. I recall saying something like; “I do so much more work around this house than you but as soon as I don’t do something you want instantly or perfectly or I forget something everything I do to help just goes away” and then I said things along the line of her not appreciating me enough. She took this as me calling her a bad mum and me basically saying she does nothing to help. Which is completely untrue, I understand her situation; I understand that she can’t do much. Which is why I do so much myself, I just don’t think it’s fair to get angry at your 17 year old son who already does so much for making a few mistakes. Anyway, after the argument she’s now said my girlfriend can’t come down to stay. I’ve tried explaining that the tickets aren’t refundable and there’s no other way she can stay anywhere. I’ve looked at multiple hotel sites but being 17 without a job, and only £80 I can’t exactly afford them. I’m not begging for money, this isn’t what I’m here for. There’s no way I can even think of that you could give me money. I’m here for advice on what I can do.

I’m more than fine with carrying on this way. I can take the constant under appreciation and the massive amount of work I do, but I can’t handle her making my relationship harder than it already is. Especially considering it’s the only thing keeping me sane and happy. I still want my girlfriend to come down but I can’t see my mum allowing that at this point. All I’ve been able to do is offer to give my girlfriend the money back. I’ve spoken to her, and she’s said to try my best to suck up to my mum, but I really doubt that could work. I’ve also considering just moving out and being independent, but with a long term relationship, last year of A-Levels and having a job, somethings going to have to be sacrificed, and that’s probably going to be the relationship and with that will go my happiness, making me feel extremely fucking lonely.
I just need advice and to hear people’s opinions on the matter. I’m just so lost for solutions at this point.

**TL;DR** I'm 17 in a long distance relationship that requires one of us to stay at the others house if we want to see each other. My mum is disabled so I have to put in a lot more work than most my age, around the house and for general care for my mum. However I constantly get treated like crap for making a few mistakes and it's making me depressed. As well as this I'm starting to see potential in my mums attitude ruining my relationship with things like not letting her stay even after her paying for her tickets.

(Sorry for the mass amount of text, it's the best way I could think to explain my situation.)

I was 5 hours away from home, on a contract job, when I got news about my girlfriend being in a huge car accident. Speeding big time, and I got a ticket. I was dumb enough to just listen to my parents advice and just pay it, not realizing what the consequences would be. So now I got this one. I work for a medical facility, got called in last minute and they were having very limited staff so I wanted to get to work fast, because shit hits the fan, fast, when you're understaffed. Got caught, and you can guess from there. This was in Oregon. What can I do to try to reduce the punishments as much as possible? I don't and two tickets on my insurance, it's already killing me as it is. 

Please no passive aggressive ""maybe you shouldn't have sped comments."" I understand what I did and that it was bad, and now I'm just trying to find ways to reduce the amount of punishment I may receive.

Thank you very much, guys!",21Aug2017,3
213,"Hi,

I have a clinical condition that has slowed down my reproductive development, as such, I have just started my period. I have been on pills nearly all my life to facilitate my growth and hormone balance. Today, I woke up to a surprise that the doctors foresaw would arrive by the time I was 40. 

I started my period.

I recently celebrated my 34th birthday, and I am absolutely thrilled that it arrived before my 40th. It gives me time to have children. However, I am worried about daily maintenance. I've heard about cramps, and I do feel them, trust me, but there are so many things about the menstrual cycle that I do not know. 

For instance, smells. How do I control them? And how often should I change my sanitary napkin? Can I wear my tampon overnight? I stained my underwear, how can I prevent that from happening again? Why do I feel like I want to cry at the silliest things? What's happening to my body?",21Aug2017,1

I've watched videos on charisma, confidence,  etc.  I feel empowered when I watch these videos but am extremely scared to apply these in real life, especially when approaching girls.  When I am out, I make it a goal to approach that one attractive girl, but after 15 minutes of contemplation,  either I leave or the girl is already gone.   Then I spend the rest of the day beating myself up (metaphorically)  about my missed opportunity.   This has become a vicious cycle and I am tired of it.  I want to put an end to this once and for all.  I want to completely destroy my social inhibition and my fear of rejection and make sure that I never feel these two for the rest of my life.

Come fall, I'll be living with 5 other MALE (I am male to) roommates, in a place with 2 bedrooms (3 per room) and 2 bathrooms. Any tips for not wanting to kill each other?

The thing I'm most worried about is cleanliness. Obviously 6 people is a lot of personality and personal living preferences to account for, but I'm trying to think of how to keep a generally nice place. I'm not a neat freak, but I don't like dirty dishes laying around for more than 2 days and general grossness is just unpleasant. How could we go about figuring out cleaning and dishwashing?

Dishwashing is something I'm VERY worried about. I currently live with 2 other roommates and one of them has never done a dish in her entire life and myself and the other roommate absolutely loathe her. I can only imagine 6 people instead of 3 will be even more trouble.

Anyone have experience with a lot of roommates?

220,"Recently i've been subjected to family issues consisting of infighting between me and my dad or me and my brother. These usually consist of me being called names like Retard, abnormal or Derek (My mum's brother is 50 and he still lives with his mum). I'm 15 and my most recent fight has been about the fact that i have a ""Bed-time"" during school nights of 9:45. Doesn't this seem a bit outrageous? 15 and i have to be in bed by 9:45? The reason this has been an issue is that i questioned why its so early, giving reasons as to why it should be pushed back or just straight up removed. Such as: I don't do anything ""Bad"" such as drinking/smoking/doing drugs at my age which a lot of people seem to do, I go to school everyday never missing a day unless i'm super ill, And also how I put effort into school while a few others my age do not. Recently i got an award at my school for being in the top 20% of students with exam results and they still want me to do better than that. Also some past cases of them being strict is that i wasn't allowed in my house alone until i was 15, and another being that i'm not allowed to go out on my own or even with friends, Yet another being that i wasn't allowed out of my street until i was 12 and that if i went out and went somewhere new i would have to go back home, tell them where i was going then go. Oh, and let me not forget that one time i got in an argument with my dad he pushed me to my bedroom floor and started hitting me and kicking me.

221,"I'm studying computer science, this is my last year in school, and while I like studying this field, I don't like the idea of working in this area. I enjoy learning, discussing course topics with classmates and teachers, and I even enjoy taking exams! However I don't like office work and I'm too unpassionate/uninterested to go full academic. The only reason I'm studying computer science is because it's the field that I'm the most interested in, but still I'm not interested enough to work in it...Does that make sense? I'm actually pretty good at my courses too. 

I'm just not interested in anything that would make money. I do mixed martial arts but I only like it as a hobby. I started playing guitar last month but I still suck at it and at 21 year of age I feel like I'm too late to be serious about music. I really like singing when I'm alone while playing guitar, but my voice is straight up horrible. I write poems and short stories and would like to publish a book and become a professional writer, but I know some writers and they all need side jobs to provide for themselves financially. 

What can I do at this point with no direction? My school is forcing me to do my obligatory internships, and even thinking about that office work is making me depressed to the point I can't eat, get out of my bed, or sleep... and it's just for 25 work days! If I graduate and start working full time in this field I would just kill myself, I'm fully sure. I don't want to come to that point. ",21Aug2017,1

227,"So I am starting my first year at Community College in less than a week. Because of what happened today, I am very worried that my journey will be over before it even began. I am so embarrassed and ashamed. 

Here is some context: So, my Biology professor had a workshop last week from Monday through Thursday, and I along with most of the people in the workshop were in a program called ASAP (Accelerated Studies in Associate's Programs) We all had to attend the workshop for all four days, as it was worth 5% of our final grade. So after the fourth day, we were given extra credit as a thank you for taking time out of our summer to attend the workshop. It would add an additional 3%-5% to our grade. It was an easy assignment, we just has to answer a few questions out of a textbook. My partner that I was sitting with took pictures of the assignment and said that she would email me the extra credit assignment that night. Unfortunately, that never happened. So I had to email the professor and ask her when I can come to pick up the extra credit. She said she would be busy last Friday, but she can do it on Monday (which is today) I said nothing more, and before I knew it, today came. So, I went into the college looking for my professor so that I could collect the assignment and have a more in-depth conversation about the course. I looked in her office, and I couldn't find her. So a few minutes later, I called her. This is the part where I messed up big time. So, she didn't answer. It went to voicemail. I just dropped my other phone, and while holding the phone in my hand, I said something along the lines of ""God dang it, Professor ____, you had one job. Fuck."" I genuinely thought I hung up the phone at that point. After I called her, I sent her an email. Literally a few seconds later after I sent the email, my professor walked by. She saw me and called me. She asked me if I called her and left a voicemail. I told her I did call her, but I don't recall leaving a voicemail. I was confused, because at the time, I genuinely thought I hung up. I thought nothing more of it, and we talked for a little while we went to her office. I asked her how she was doing, and other questions relating to the course. We get to her office, and she opened her emails. She saw the email that I just sent her. Somehow, my professor's voicemail is connected to her email. So she opened it up, and she heard those bad things I said. I was initially shocked, partly because I said such bad things and partly because I didn't realize that I left the voicemail in the first place. I apologized to her profusely. She berated me quite a lot. My head was down the whole time because I was so ashamed of myself. She was disappointed, because she initially had a great impression of me, and this incident ruined it. She also said that something like this is quite serious and that she could take disciplinary action, report it to the higher-ups and I would never see the light of the college again. She said that she is only going to keep her mouth shut because she doesn't want to ruin the career of any of her students. Yet, the professor went outside and told one of the receptionists at the front desk nearby about what I said, and the receptionist told the professor that she should call the police. I was still in her office thinking about what I have done, and I heard what the receptionist said and I thought, ""Is what I said really bad enough for her to report it to the police? Damn."" She was questioning why she was helping me at this point, but she still gave me the extra credit assignment. She said she may delete the voicemail message depending on how well I do in her class. After that, she told me that she had a meeting and that she couldn't stay for much longer. I was trying so hard not to cry. I told her ""Thank you. Have a good day, I will see you in a couple of days."" I exited her office dejected, went home and cried for a little while on my bed, and then I typed up the behemoth of a story that you are currently reading right now. It isn't easy to make me cry, but when your life is on the line like this, it is hard not to cry. I am scared that she will actually end up taking disciplinary action against me and I will be kicked out of the college, all because of a stupid mistake. I am also scared that during the semester, she will grade me unfairly because of this incident. What should I do? I mean, the first day of classes hasn't even started yet and I already messed up. It's not like I can transfer out her class, it is too late for that. I need some advice on what to do moving forward. I am going to have to end up going to her tutoring/office hours in the near future because I will definitely have questions to ask her. The ASAP program also assigns you a counselor and the thing that you talk about with them remains confidential. I want to talk to my counselor about this, but I don't know what to expect when I talk to her about this, I fear something worse will happen. So this is why I am here. Please don't be too harsh, I am quite upset right now. Any advice is appreciated, thank you all for reading this whole story. :)",21Aug2017,2

I've also done electrical work with my dad for about a year but it didn't interest me all that much. I just need to find an odd job that interests me and I can stick to.

229,"Long story short, awhile ago I was pulled over and given a careless driving ticket while learning stick because my tires chirped pulling away from an intersection with a hill. I tried to explain to the cop I had just bought the car at the time, and he asks, ""how old are you?"". I said, ""19"", and after me still trying to explain I had just bought the car that was a stick and wasn't intending to skip the tires, he says, ""No don't give me that. You dumped the clutch to do a burnout on purpose"".

I figured it wasn't worth arguing over, so I would just take it to court. At court, the officer enfatuated a story that didn't happen. He said, ""two cars pulled up to the light. Both cars were revving and when the light turned green they took off. The Corvette was the one I could catch"".

I was speechless. I didn't know what to say because that wasn't what happened. The road I was on wasn't even a two lane road! I was intimidated into paying $300 because he said if I fight the ticket he would write me more.

I payed it and figured it was over with. But a few weeks later, I passed the same police cruiser (explorer with the same car number). It was around 1am and I was heading home from work. The moment I passed (he was on the side of the road), he pulled out and followed me for several blocks. At one point when he was behind me, he flipped his lights on (with no other traffic around). I pulled over, he started to pull over behind me, then turned off his lights and passed me.

Yet a few weeks later, I saw the same explorer (same road). I was behind him, and he pulled over to the shoulder. I went around and he got behind me. I made several turns and he followed me, but never lit me up.

So it starts to get a little more weird here..... One night I had just went out to Best Buy to get a part for my camera. I was a few blocks from my house when (you guessed it) pulled behind me again. He followed me for several blocks, and even onto my street. I live in a residential suburban dead end backstreet so its not a road for traveling. I pulled into my driveway, and parked. He slowed down behind my driveway, then made a u-turn in my neighbors driveway and drove off.

So fast forward to today. I went out to get some Starbucks and I saw my neighbor there. We started talking, and he mentioned he had gotten pulled over a few days ago. He told me that after he handed the cop his licence, the cop asked, ""Do you live by that kid with the Corvette?"" My neighbor said, ""yeah"", and he told me the cop said, ""Tell him I said to take his window tint off. He knows who I am"".

I just don't feel like this is being handled in a professional way. To be honest, I feel like I'm being harassed and followed for no reason. Any advice on what I should do?",21Aug2017,4

My dad helps pay for the house bills my mom lives in so that me and my sister could live where we grew up cause my mom wouldn't be able to afford it herself. My mom got married 3 weeks ago and her husband ""my step dad"" moved in a week ago. My mom with her bad money habits borrowed 1700 dollars from me 4 weeks ago saying she would give it back to me  in 3 days. She didn't I just got my money back 2 days ago and when I gave her the money to borrow I was currently looking at motorcycles so I had to put that all on hold for 3 weeks tell she gave my money back. I nagged her everyday wondering where my money was and my step dad didn't like me bringing it up all the time. Now 2 days ago she gave me 1500 dollars back. I asked where the other 300 was and she claims I didn't loan her that even though I clearly know I gave her 1700 I got in a big fight with her but surprisingly I kept my cool some what. She started swearing at me then hit me and through stuff at me.

233,"Hi, have been married for 7 years. After the last few months of counseling I have discovered I have been trying to please my parents my whole life, and have not been authentic; autopilot. This has lead to me being unhappy, bringing out OCD, addictions, sexual and porn addiction.

Had an affair 4 years ago, and now it has been leaked. My wife and I have been living together, and it's been 3 months since the leak. We have came along way, however I am needing help keeping authentic . I can go 4 days, then it switches back to autopilot. If anyone is confused when I am authentic she loves to be around me, and we can grow as a couple. When I'm not it goes back to signing the divorce papers instantly, and it pushes me hard on my face.

Ultimately I have to fix myself, but fast. I looked into rehabs but they are 20-50k, (all equity is in our business). I cannot lose the love of my life, otherwise I cannot live on. It's hard enough being a parent of 2 young boys with our situation. We run a small business together, own 1 car together, so you can imagine how hard it is on myself. Yes I did wrong, but I will go to the end of the world for this person, no matter what. Having a divorce would be absolutely unbearable.

I have had to end all ties with my family to do this path of authenticity. It's always about them, never about me. Also if I lose my wife, I lose everything. Kids, house, all my money.

237,"So I (24m) finally got two job offers after a hiatus due to a knee injury. I have only been out of college for about a year, and had one job in between then and now doing software sales. Unfortunately, I got the job offers on the same day (today) minutes apart and have no idea what to do. A great problem to have you could say. I want to know which one I should take.
One of them is for a top med device company, at a salary of 45k a year, but its extremely entry level. The majority of my day would be setting up trays in the OR for doctors, surgeons, and what have you. It is also a long term commitment in the same role before I can get pushed up. However, the longterm pay off is great because the company is extremely successful and I should have lots of connections by the end of my time in that position. I just don't think at this point in my life I can say that industry is the same one I want to be in the rest of my life.
The other job is for a startup at around a 55k base plus anywhere from 15k-30k in commission. It's inside sales, but has most of the perks for any startup, and only has about 50 people in the company. I don't necessarily like the work too much, but nobody does. At the end of the day, it is almost twice as much money. You could say the security of the job is a lot less, but I will have a voice at the company.
Both are 8hr jobs give or take. Same commute. 401k, etc.
Also I should add, that somewhere in the next few years, prob 1-3, I want to travel for about 3 months. So that's a huge kicker.

They countered (still out of my range) and said I could message them to sort out a price. I did this is, and here's the gist of what I said: I have a budget of $350 that I can't go over, so would you be willing to do $335, since the shipping is $15? I also mentioned why I was getting it (I need it for a class), and the possibility of maybe altering the listing as it came with some extras if they weren't comfortable setting it that low. They wrote back saying they'd do $350 (without some of the extras) via paypal so we could avoid the fees from ebay. I think they're just doing this so they can get the full $350 rather than just $335, but still I wanna be cautious. That's a large sum of money for me.

I'm a sophomore studying physics and I have been thinking a lot about whether I want to pursue this to the end or change my major. I had fucked up the last year of high school mentally and I didn't perform as well as I could have thus I missed the chance of getting into architecture which I had always thought I'd end up studying. I can't help but think that if things had played out well, I would have been there now.

Another thing is that I feel quite confused as to what I actually want to do in life. It doesn't have to be architecture, doesn't have to be physics. 

My question is that: If you did in fact change majors, how was the process for you? How did you understand that you wanted to do that? Or how did you understand that your original major was not right for you? Like, HOW CAN I FUCKING BE SURE THAT I am doing what would be fullfilling for me? I know that it wouldn't be the same for everyone but I'm just trying to get some more perspective on this.

249,"I started first year of University in September 2015, however over the course of the first year I was struggling with mild depression, although it has gotten much worse and anxiety has seemingly stemmed from my depression.


 I filed NEC forms (Notification of Extenuating Circumstances) and was allowed to sit my exams at the end of Summer, during the referral period, as first sittings. However, I didn't end up sitting the exams and thus retook first year.


And now here I am, one year later I am in exactly the same predicament, didn't take my exams, have been referred, but I've scarcely studied and my work is all over the place. I found A-Level challenging but was able to grab ample amount of UCAS points to get into University, and believe that A-Level in most respects is actually more difficult than Uni.


I know I can complete a University degree if I was in the right mindset, but for the past few years I've been a completely different person. I struggle to do menial tasks such as shower/clean my teeth, and struggle with finding some sort of 'meaning' or 'purpose' to life.


I know my life isn't over if I don't go back to Uni, but its all I've ever wanted to do, and due to these unforeseen circumstances, it now feels like my chance has now drifted by.

We're good gym buddies and we both work in the same field so we bonded at the gym, but I'm not comfortable going to the house of a guy living alone who's 3x my age.

Knowing that my internship is about to end he sent me an email yesterday asking me when I would be available. I have 2 different gym memberships so I could not see him again until the end of my internship, but that would be rude, not sure it's the best solution.  

Honestly it's tough for me to admit that I'm scared of something, but I'm definitely scared of going to an old man's house, especially considering that I only konw him from the gym.
I wouldn't mind suggesting to eat dinner at a restaurant if that's less harsh.

251,"I'm 22, I lost a lot amount of weight during this past year, now I'm 12 pounds to reach my goal (I've always been the fat guy my whole life), the weight has changed but the issue is that my confidence never changed... girls didn't notice me before but these days whenever a girl look at me I got scared and bow my head (i don't know what to do).... never been with a girl before. I got so shy if I ever talk to one, and I almost make no eye contact with them.

what're the things that can help me to build my confidence? ",21Aug2017,3
252,"Hi, I'm a 17 years old french Canadian. I only have one year of high school before either going to the Canadian army or the university. I have some questions concerning the university. I'd like to go into a computing field, not sure which one. Anyway, I'd like to get the best education possible thus I'd like to go to the best university on earth.

First question, which university would you consider the absolute best? On which criteria?

Also, I've heard that university was not cheap and since I come from a middle class-ish family, they won't be able to pay for my entire student loan. What can I do about that? Getting a job and saving my money would be the obvious answer but I doubt It would be enough.

Also what kind of grades do I need? Before now, school has never been too important for me and it's showing is my grades. They're pretty average and I know I could've done better. This is my last year and I'll really put in the effort but, again, I doubt that it's enough. Is there anything I can do?

Bear in mind that I don't know much about this whole university thing so I'm sorry if some if my questions are obvious. Thanks!

253,"We've been dating since May and school just started last week. I love her so much. But, however, I don't like her/have a crush on her. I told myself this summer that it'll come back when school starts. Idk why. Maybe it's stress (getting ready/used to school/my mom yelling at me/the fact I'm not too attracted to her in the first place) or maybe it's that I used to watch porn (I've been trying not slowly cut it out of my life with varying degrees of success due to religious and relationship reasons) or that I didn't have a strong crush on her. It was probably a quasi crush if you could call it that but it's not the strongest one I've had. I don't want to break up with her. At all. I know that she loves me very much and it would absolutely break her heart, and she is the only person I trust with some very personal stuff. She is also very funny and I love being around her. She is, in a way, my closest and best friend. Please help.

Edit. We're both in middle school if that helps.",21Aug2017,2
256,"Apologies in advance for the long post.

I recently bought a 2010 Mazda3 from a local car dealership that had fairly good reviews. I bought the 90,000 mile vehicle for $8,000  with no down payment. At the time the AC was not working to which they mentioned they had already ordered the part to fix it and would cover costs to get it replaced.

I recognize I should not have purchased it in this state, but I did. I brought the vehicle in when the part arrived and it did not fix the issue. I brought it in again a week later and the second part that was ""supposed to fix it"" didn't work. The mechanic the dealership uses advised we take it to a Mazda specific shop to determine the issue.

I brought it in for this inspection (which took a couple days) and Mazda determined the wrong compressor was attached. They ordered the part and asked me to bring it in one more time.

That brings us to now. I just received a call from the dealership informing me of the ""fix"". He said the correct compressor didn't fix it which means it is a problem with the internal computer. Mazda is going to see if they can reset it but, if they can't, we would need to order a new one which, and the dealership representative was very clear and vocal in saying, would cost $500.

Obviously he wants me to cover the cost as I imagine the fixes are outweighing what he feels is covered by the cost of the vehicle. I am of the opinion that they should cover all costs associated with the AC as it was made clear they were taking care of it.

Am I correct in thinking this way? If not, why? Regardless, how do I approach this situation?",21Aug2017,2
257,"So I’ve been working at a company for just about 3 months now.  Originally I agreed to full time but then I decided I wanted to go to college, so I requested part time.  I went straight to the owner of the company and asked him if I could switch to part time and I told him the circumstances and that I still wanted to work for him.  He was relatively happy with the conversation and I think he respected the fact that I went up to him.  He told me that in a week, we will sign paperwork for what time to come in but for now, I am allowed to come in and leave when I am comfortable as classes have started.  Well, a week goes by and everything is perfect.  I get to work today, and my boss (not the owner) is standing outside waiting for me.  He fires me in the parking lot because I “do whatever I want to do” and that I didn’t sign the proper paperwork to switch to part time.  But I wasn’t even given the paperwork because last week was a transition period.

Should I go in and talk to the owner about straightening this out tomorrow?

Is my boss wrong?  Am I wrong?

Edit: Thank you for the quick advice guys!  You brought my mood up and helped me realized there’s something I can do about this!",21Aug2017,3

259,"So i am at university and just had a chat to the nursing faulty, they told me i have met the requirement to transfer into their faulty from my original degree. That's the good news. But the bad news to me is that they also told me i can withdraw this semester , but i have this feeling. This feeling that if i withdraw this semester that there will be that 1% that i may not get the transfer to their degree at the end of the year. I am really tossing between withdrawing and continuing my subjects this semester. I dont want to waste this half of year, nearly all my friends are ready to graduate and i am still in my first year.

261,"As the title says, I regret getting my masters in social work. I knew I'd be saddled in debt, that is OK. However, I didn't think I'd live on the poverty line. I see my clients at the food bank. I'm overwhelmed and overworked and underpaid and my own mental health has taken a bad hit. I can't put the oxygen mask on my own face, so to speak, because I work non stop to skip lunch and come home with an empty belly and miss meals. 

I'm a single parent so every penny that I do get goes to my son. His schooling and sports and clothes and food. I feel like when I get home I'm so emotionally drained that I'm missing real life with him. My mind is freaking out about hundreds of client issues. I manage ten staff as well so I'm thinking about all their needs. I barely sleep. I'm 34 and I'm so unhappy this past year that I've been suicidal. There doesn't seem to be an end in sight and you can't talk about this in social work. There's like this silent martyr crap that goes on and your just shit on if you happen to say I feel overwhelmed, or I need a day. 

Anyway I've been thinking more and more that I just want out.i want out of social work and it's misery. But what could I possibly do? I'm still buried under a mountain of debt and cannot possibly go back for another degree. Any savings I have goes towards what my son will need for college. Is there another career I could do with my degree that is not even remotely related to the field but can take me out of poverty? 

I do live in a high cost of living state and that is so my son has the best education and safety that our community offers. Other mitigating circumstances mean we cannot leave, so I can't reduce cost of living any more than I currently do so I must take a job that is at least liveable wage, IE 40k minimum just to survive",21Aug2017,129
