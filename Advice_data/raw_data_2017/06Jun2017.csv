0,"I was wondering if folks had advice for getting a subreddit noticed/growing it without being a spaming ass hole. Yesterday, I made a new subreddit called /r/things_explained which is basically ELI5 for videos. I have noticed many of these style of videos posted to /r/videos so I think there is a strong demand. However... I don't want to spam to advertise it but I can't see any other way. Nobody reads subreddits such as /r/newreddits and I think the difficulty in growing a sub is largely responsible for most of reddit being dominated by the top 100 subs. ",06Jun2017,3
2,"Sorry in advance for all the details but it would mean a lot if I could get some opinions on my situation. I started materials engineering at McGill 4 years ago, fairly sure of my choice because I was very interested in nanotechnology. After learning more about how focused the program is on mining and metallurgy I lost some of my certainty, and ended up dropping out in my 3rd term after a family crisis left me emotionally unable to attend classes. It took a huge toll on me, leaving me severely depressed. I felt like everything I use to be as a person was gone. I pursued my passion for cooking to pay the bills and see if there was maybe a future there for me. I loved it, but I found myself, or at least my ego (and bank account), calling me back to higher education. After being out of school for so long I am very worried that I will either fail completely, or hate it. Math and Science always came easily to me, but after trying to brush up on algebra and calculus in the last few months, im having a harder time than I expected. My mind is dull. I dont see myself working in the materials engineering field, but I have heard from countless people that an engineering degree is the best option with the most versatility. I am unable to transfer programs(trashed my GPA by leaving mid semester), so if I want to stick with McGill, which is the best school I can attend for the least money (Im Canadian), it has to be Materials Engineering for now. Im already 22 and I really dont want to waste more time and money flip flopping around between degrees. Im sure I would be happy with a business or management degree, but I would probably have a hard time living with my choice to not pursue my childhood goal of getting an engineering degree. In the end the decision comes down to whether going through with this will be worth it if I end up not being interested in engineering careers. I really have no idea what I can see myself doing but Im pretty certain it has nothing to do with mining or metallurgy. Is a materials engineering degree flexible enough to land me a job in a wide range of fields? Assuming I am able to do it, is this degree a worthwhile use of my next 4 years?",06Jun2017,1
6,"So I decided to finally balls up and put myself out there a little. I took a picture of myself, and got positive reactions. This girl I kind of knew for a little while, but didn't really interact with liked a few of my pictures (even some from weeks ago) and added me on snap. She asked if I wanted to start a streak, and said ""yay!"" When I said okay. We talked for a little while, we have very mutual interests and when I asked her to play PS4 tomorrow, she said she'd love to.

9,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post I didn't know where to post.

Memorial weekend my friend left to Seattle. Had fun there and came back and seemed fine. She then started acting weird. By acting like her roommate wasn't even there. Went into her room and started writing names on herself and crying. She then put tape over her eyes and locked herself In the bathroom. I can her her saying a name of a guy that turned her down in Seattle. And she was then on the phone with another friend talking and couldn't understand what she was saying. Hours later we finally got into the bathroom where it smelt like burnt hair and she was on the l and she's naked under the sink with more names on her and still tape on her eyes. She went to sleep for about 2 hours and woke up and asked what happened. We told her and asked if she was fine she seemed okay. Ate some pizza and then would get on all four and make weird noises and animal noises. With her eyes closed. After that she didn't wanna open her eyes and would make sounds and we called her sister and she came and they took her to the hospital where the Sedated her.  Next day she woke up and had breathing tubes in her and IV in her neck and she tried ripping them out and but with here eyes closed and wouldn't open them for no one. So they Sedated her again and took more test. The toxicology test game back negative Everything came back negative. It's been 4 days and today is the only day she's acting pretty normal and she is opening her eyes.

10,"I'm 17 and in the past few years I've been going downhill. My mood has been improving (not steadily, mind you but I'm happier more often and rarely get depressed for longer than a week) but with that my cares have been decreasing. So much that I no longer have any motivation to do well at school or pursue creative interests. I don't care because the worst that will happen is that I'm in the same position as I am now except with less possessions/food choices but I don't mind. When I try to do something like revise for an exam or draw a picture or make music I always lose momentum after a few minutes. My mind feels so drained I just want to stop existing because I don't care about life enough to think about anything.

I like listening to music and watching shows/movies and consuming media in general. Those things make me short-term happy so I can stay consistently happy. But I see people around me revising non stop and doing well in exams or pursuing their own interests. Even the people I used to effortlessly ""beat"" in school have part time jobs and hobbies. 

My problem is that I have no determination and no lasting motivation. I get so tired trying to be good and being disappointed that it doesn't seem worth it. I know I don't need money to be happy but success brings all kinds of social privileges (I currently have one friend so I'm very deprived socially- don't care enough to not accept it though)

12,"I've met this girl twice, first time we were at a house party and had sex then kept on talking. A week later we meet up and have a pretty good time together walking around. Sounds good, right? 

Well not so much. I know she really likes me because she's my best friends friend and that's where part of the problem lies. He told me about her shady past and few things about her that I believe are true. Other thing is that she's not my type at all and I don't special feelings for her, when we're together we laugh but I don't feel much for her. 

So I'm torn between telling her that I don't want to date get (obviously say it nicer than that) or just say screw it and play it by the ear and see if anything happens.

Also 
1. she lives pretty far away from me but I'll be moving to a different city which is actually closer to her. 
2. We had sex first night we meet (usually red flag for dating) 
3. She's my best friends friend and I want my best friend to stay the way we are.

One of them is an actual jerk and finds fun in grabbing people from behind, lifting people fireman style or rugby tackling them, especially me. At one occasion, my legs were covered in bruises from being tackled. When I sit on the couch, I'm either squeezed or crushed on purpose.

My good friend is in the group and I would expect that she would stand up for me, but no. The jerk treats her like a princess and so she really likes him and won't say anything against him. Now they're in a relationship and I don't know whether to even go to the group events anymore as I know she'd be even more submissive about his behaviour. The other day I faked being sick so I wouldn't have to go and get tackled.

19,"(-Sorry for my bad english-)

I've only had one girlfriend in my life, a relationship of 5 years, with a lot of cool experiences. She was a cute homebody girl, a little bit nerdy, with a lot of problems in her home. I tried to be the best boyfriend that i could and help. Later the tables turned, she got a really cool job eventhough she didnt had a career, and this time the problems where in my family. Money really changed her, she was not the same cute girl that i was in love with, and then she decided to brokeup with me because she didnt wanted to deal with my problems... a little bit cruel, but understandable. The relationship showed me a lot of aspects in my life that i had to improve to become the best version of myself. The breakup was 3 years ago.


I overcome the sad part of the breakup really fast and worked in my career and mental health, also deleted all my social media.


Months latter i realized in a very bad way that she was saying things about me and the relationship, really hurtful things. So i started to feeling guilty, you know, things like ""Damn, maybe i was a shitty boyfriend after all"".

Months later I found out that she was cheating for all the last year of our relationship... that hurt me so bad, but in a weird way helped me to ""overcome"" a little bit the feeling of guilt that I had.


Little by little, besides all my difficulties i've been progressing, one month ago i graduated from the university and in a couple of weeks i will start working in a cool company. Years without even remembered that she existed, until today. Im really nervous for my work, so i decided to distract myself and install tinder. For my surprise I stumbled upon her profile.Her profile was one of those kinky profiles looking for threesomes with her boyfriend. It really shocked me and i've been thinking about that all day.


The shy homebody girl that i loved years ago is now a really successful girl that search for threesome on internet... really makes me think in how much people can change, and how you never really know somebody. Is it weird that im so affected by that?

20,"My boss illegally launders us money through a church he occasionally works for, or pays cash to avoid paying taxes (this happens every so often). He gives less than 12 hour notices almost every time he wants me to work, ex: text at 7 a.m. to meet somewhere at 9 a.m. the SAME morning and it's a 40 minute drive. 
He is also just rude and increasingly unprofessional. 

I would like to quit as soon as possible. I've worked for him since February, but I need 300 credit hours for my internship to be completed. I'm about 176 hours credit wise. However, the paperwork doesn't say anything about him contacting the University. I could lie on the paperwork saying I've completed the 300 hours. Besides this being unethical, can I have any advice? 

The person responsible for the internship paperwork at the University apparently got taken to the dean by my boss a few years ago for something (so she's definitely not fond of him). I could probably get her pity, but I also don't want to completely destroy this guy.

30,"I'm a highschool student in Korea and thusly spend a lot of my time studying. I usually stay every weekday (Mon - Fri) from 8am to 10pm in school. In weekends, I spend about 4 hours going to scam schools so as to prepare myself for exams and whatnot. So, imo, it is only natural for me to have the desire to be lazy for a change, unproductive and not achieving anything for when I'm free. So when I do finally get a free day, I usually spend it browsing Reddit, watching Youtube and generally being as unproductive as humanly possible.

The thing is, this is not how I want my life to be. Especially since I'm doing things against my will (studying subjects I have no interest in) for the majority of my time, I would love to engage in hobbys. May it be programming or music production or whatever (I'm not good in any of these but I took some time learning them and plan to do so in the future as well).

The problem with that is, that my brain perceives persuing a hobby as a ""productive task"" and tends to recoil from it whenever I try to get starting. I always end up saying to myself that after 1 or 2 hours of browing reddit, I'll spend the rest of my day on my hobby. But these 1 - 2 hours would become 4 and 6 and 8 and at the end of the day, I end up having spent an entire day doing nothing.

Even if the act of doing nothing is technically what I strive to do, as said before, I would also love to get better at my hobbies. And here comes my problem:

Is there an effective way for me to balance my unproductive time and my hobby time when I am free?
Are there ways to stop myself from wanting to feel unproductive in the first place?

Just as an example, I was waiting to be picked up and a young guy sat not far away tucking into a pie and seemed a bit off. He didn't look 100% and then I noticed his hat was in front of him for people to donate. Everybody walked by staring at him, no one gave money and it just felt like he was being viewed, not as a person. I had no money but wanted to say something to him or do something but felt frozen for some reason. 

Another gentlemen who is usually around the front of the local shops too is in a similar situation, always minding his own business but clearly down and out. This gentleman I see regularly and can't keep walking past, today he was in the food court and I wanted to do something like buy him a meal and just chat with him, make him feel part of the community. But again I was frozen.

I contacted Chase and talked to an employee. It turns out, someone likely made a duplicate card of my Chase card. The employee told me a physical card had been used at 3 local stores in the Bay Area. I cancelled the card and had them send me a new one immediately. 

Fast forward to today when I still have yet to receive my new card from Chase. I actually am annoyed at this point because I am trying to purchase plain tickets to travel this summer.

 I am sitting at a bar eating wings with my friends and I get another text about fraudulent activity, but on a different account number. This time $106 at a Walgreens. 
I talked to Chase again to uncover that this time the physical card was used like the last. I began to suspect they have access to my account. The employee this time assured me that someone must have stolen my mail. I ensure he has the right address on file and think me might be right. 

Then he tells me that the card still hadn't been activated yet. This even confused the employee, ""These guys are good"" was said. He recommended I file a police report on the matter.

Every time I talk with him, I find out one more characteristic we both have, even if it is something trivial and stupid.  
I strongly feel like I will **never** meet someone that special again in life, and this is my one and only chance to not die rotting in loneliness, but I still don't have any romantic feelings about him whatsoever, he's ''just'' my closest friend. Even if I did try to find someone like him, I would probably fail miserably because of my extreme anxiety with new people.

66,"I'm getting mixed messages. F[16]. One minute he's acting like a fuckboy, the next he's listening to me, being nice, and caring. It was spring break when we started talking. We used to know each other in elementary school and out of the blue he found me on Instagram and dms me after 8 years. He wanted to catch up. (We don't go to the same schools)

During spring break it was fun reconnecting after the years, until the end of spring break he asks for nudes. I  rejected him nicely and he respectfully backed off. Saying he was sorry and didn't realize that's what I felt. He continued talking to me the next day saying how hot I was. And how he enjoyed talking to me. We agreed it was hard to talk during school so I told him I'd talk to him during the summer.

Now it's summer. And I hit him up looking to see if we can hang out. It's been a day and a half and he already started asking for nudes. I rejected again... and he was ""it's all good"" then he went in saying when we stopped talking after spring break, he decided to wait for me, Because he liked me that much. He told me He didn't date anyone or do anything with anyone. I guess he was ""saving himself"" for me then he said ""I could see myself dating her""... after he is still very respectful that I don't want to send anything. But he keeps hinting that he wants them saying I have a hot bod and a great personality... He said that he really likes me and wants to keep talking but I can see he wants more. He's still talking to me. I told him about how guys just drop girls after they reject sending nudes. And he responded how if he didn't like me he would've already left. I guess I'm confused on what to do. I'm trying to be honest to him. 

[TLDR] idk if this guy likes me or not. We recently reconnected and he asked for nudes but when I declined he respected my feelings. He keeps talking to me but I still have this feeling he wants more. Need help on what to say or do in this situation. ",06Jun2017,1

i'm not saying I'm a good influence either, but since she's started hanging out with her new friends she has been skipping school, doing drugs and just a bunch of bad shit. i told some friends I could trust about how I feel about this situation and they agree with me on the fact that she's completely ignoring me and being a bitch to me for no reason.
I have done nothing wrong, and if I did I certainly would acknowledge and apologize. It's all on her, and i hate placing the blame but it's completely true. All I've done is been here for her during hard times, and what does she give me? nothing but bullshit.

The boss can't handle them either, they try to defy him every chance they got and he can't kick them because they sell extremely well. This was a 3rd red flag.

I were, at the meeting and the entire day extremely quiet, this was because I was mad that I didn't sell and I just heard my grandfather was at the hospital so I was sad and worried about that.

80,"I don't know if this right sub Reddit so mods please no ban but let's start..
(Dad out of the picture)

I am 14 (going to be 15 in July) not the greatest looking, Mexican and kind of socially awkward. Me and my mother live with my grandparents (teen mom, no insane income, and she needed to save money) and my mother has recently told me she will be moving during this summer to Wisconsin (we currently live in northern Illinois suburbs) but she gave me a option, to stay with my grandparents or move with her. 

This seems like an obvious choice but I will give you information about it. 

I have went to the same school district ever since kindergarten, and I have a pretty good solid group of friends, like I said we have known each other basically our whole life. I love this school I go to and I actually enjoy going to school. 

I have lived with my mom on several different occasions and she isn't exactly the best care taker, but it isn't really her fault. She works long hours and comes home like 6-8, and is drained of energy so she just gets fast food usually. But she also isn't the neatest and her room and the living room were often messy as hell. But she did what she had to do when people came over deep cleaned everything and I helped out obviously. 

Also my grandparents actually travel a decent amount for work and she said she would come down to their house and just drive to work everyday  (1 hour drive). 

Also my little brother is 4 and he is a riot and is usually a jerk to me saying he thinks I'm  annoying to just leave him alone when I am just sitting there watching tv lol. 

Grandparents are amazing, genuinely wonderful people they home cook meals on top of everything and are just time effective people. 

I am really bad at making friends, I am usually quite shy at first but once I get to know them I am talkative but that is it I have to get to know you. And I am scared I won't be able to make any friends. 

(Personal opinion) - I know this just is everyone around me bending over backwards for just me, and if I stayed for my school and to keep everything stable it would benefit me but hurt my mom. So I am pretty much set on going with my mom I am just hoping you guys find something I didn't really think about haha. It is hard even imagining saying good bye to my friends.

So I'm only 15 and I haven't been in school for almost 4 years...it wasn't my choice but I had to stop going after 5th grade because the school I wanted to go to wouldn't allow me to enroll due to my distance from it, them claiming they wouldn't have been able to provide transportation even though my mother was going to provide transportation for me. After that the only choice of school I had was the middle school down the road from my house at the time which was full of nothing but trouble including drugs, weapons, and many fights, it was also during a time where race wars were prominent there to the extent that they cornered and beat an elderly teacher to the point she was hospitalized because she was white. I wasn't a fighter at all and wouldn't have lasted in a fight even though I could've talked my way out of anything and always kept to myself which wouldn't have started much trouble, but still my mother didnt want me to go so I didn't. Instead she tried to enroll me in Virtual Homeschooling but it didn't work out the way I hoped, she makes up excuses as to why it wasn't working such as saying the books went to the wrong address and that they never emailed her back to let her know that I was enrolled. After that she stopped trying and is always saying she needs to try and get me back in school but she never does and always lies to people telling them I'm home schooled and gets angry anytime I mention not wanting to miss out on my highschool graduation and highschool experience along with scholarships for college. I partially find it my fault because I wish I would've made up my mind sooner and matured faster so that I couldve pushed her to get me into school or at least take it into my own hands and find a way to get back in.

I've been working at a group home with kids, for about a year and a half right next to home up until last week when I accepted a new job. The group home was a ton of fun. It was close to home, and I worked overnights, so that schedule gave me a ton of free time to invest in whatever I wanted to do. The only shitty part was that it was basically minimum wage, and it's not a job you can really climb in financially wise. There's no real future at the group home, but other than that, it really allowed me to live life to the fullest which i was grateful for.


Fast track to my new job, which I've been working for about a week, and I'm not too satisfied so far. It's about an hour and a half commute both ways, so I get on the road at 7am, and won't be back home till 6:30p.m, which then I go to the gym after. So i really don't get home till like 8-8:30, and by then I'm just pooped.


It's a really good job apparently compared to others (corporate). My job's easy, the people here are super friendly and nice, good vibe environment, and I can definitely climb the ladder for higher rates of pay. The only shit thing, is that I basically have no life. I love playing hockey, working out, and grabbing beers with the boys/hanging out, but with this new work schedule, I basically can't do any of that. I have no ""ME"" time anymore, which I really value btw. Everything is just super crammed, with me barely having any energy left over to truly get all i can out of the things i love doing.


So yeah I'm kinda stuck here. My friend's mom who works here got me this job (it's a temporary 2 month contract), so I'm going to tough it out until at least then, but after that expires, there's a HIGH chance i can get another job that's opening up around that time with better pay. But the problem still persists; I don't have a life besides the weekend. That part sucks ass. With the group home, it at least allowed me to have a lot of time with myself, and it gave me a lot of time to invest into doing things I love.

116,"Hello all,

This is a long story, so sit tight!

Backstory -

Back in late April of this year, I came into contact with a wonderful man through a mutual friend of ours.  We met in a party chat (we also kind of knew each other prior, since he joined us for a movie last year). The first night we met, we spent most of the night talking and playing video games together.  It felt like we just clicked.  We spent a good chunk of our time together online, until we decided to trade numbers.  We then moved to texting and spoke a lot about ourselves - the general things you would do with someone to get to know them better.  He has a two-year-old and He had recently just got out of a relationship, while I had just began to move on from someone I had chased after for a few years prior to him.  We decided to give ourselves a try and see where it goes.  All-in-all, it seems like we've been doing very well.  We've had our disagreements, but we've worked past them for the most part, I believe.  


Now -

The problems we currently have in our relationship, is that we don't see eye-to-eye on how a relationship should be.  He is wanting to literally rush through everything and start a life together like...now.  We've talked about the idea of moving in several times already, however I've made it clear several times that I wouldn't really be ready for him to move in with me for a while - especially with the kiddo.  We agreed that if we did move in, that the kiddo would stay with her biological mother until we were sure that I was ready for her to be introduced into our life as a couple.  However, lately he's become extremely pushy and pressuring me to allow him to move in with me.  To the point to where he's willing to basically give up on us if I choose not to.  His reasoning, is that he wants to start a life now and that he doesn't want to just keep ""casually dating"" me.  I've explained to him each time, that we're not casually dating and that it's normal for couples to not move in together for the first couple of months.  He just doesn't seem to understand my side and I've used every analogy and example I could think of to try to get him to understand this.  On top of it all, he may be bringing a friend into the picture too.

It's not that I don't want us to move in together.  I really do want us to move in together and start a life like that as a couple.  I just think it's too early and with past disagreements and arguments over things, I think it would be a huge waste of time if things were to not work out between us.  Especially with bringing a third person in, I just feel like it's destined to fail.  I know he really cares for me and it's not just something he's doing to get in my pants either - I just think his emotions are hijacking his perception on the reality of things.  It's like he's head-over-heels with me, which I'm fine with...but I need him to see reality too. 

Is there really any reason for me to try to keep us together and continue to try to get him to understand my reasoning?  Has anyone been in a situation similar to this before?  I really don't want us to fail, as we've both invested a lot into the relationship already.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  ",06Jun2017,1
119,"I recently went on a date with a girl, and everything went amazingly well. As we learned about each other, it became evident that we shared many of the same interests, as well as struggles, which for me is rare to find out on a first date.

I think she is beautiful. We have a similar sense of humor, she can dish out jokes just as well as she can take them, we both had to grow up faster than the kids around us due to our circumstances, and I get a feeling that she genuinely likes me for me.

But another part of me is pulling me in another direction. I'm basically worried about what other people think with regards to her looks. I think this may stem from my issues from my past as a kid, but I'm not sure. It's frustrating because I cannot point to a ""why"" and diagnose the reason, and try to rationally think through it. Then as I worry about not understanding why I feel a certain way, my insecurities grow exponentially.

Has anyone else felt similarly, or can anyone shed any light? Any form of advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

120,"Long story short, on NYE I went over to my friend and his wifes house. Her and I don't have the best history but we've been trying to get along. I left that night thinking we had all had a good night, a bit awkward at times, but there were times where we were all laughing and making jokes together. 

Then I don't hear from my friend for a month. It turns out that him and his wife are super upset at me because I didn't ask how her pregnancy was going. I get it, it was a dick move, I should have asked. So I apologize and let him know I didn't mean anything by it, I had been drinking and it slipped my mind. Really wasn't trying to upset anyone!! 

So, we don't talk for a few months because of this NYE thing, finally I call him. We talked, had a good conversation, everything seemed good. Didn't hear from him for another month. So I message him saying something along the lines of I'm sorry, we've been friends for too long to end this over this etc. etc. He messages me back and says he's busy, he'll talk to me soon. Work can get busy for him this time of year, so that sounds good. 

Then he calls me yesterday. Turns out he had his baby 8 days ago, and when I ask why he didn't tell me, he says it's because he doesn't think we can be friends anymore because I'm so mean to his wife. 

What do I do??? Obviously I'm super upset about finding out about his baby 8 days after it was born and don't think I deserve that. I want to be friends with her too but every time I try I get shut down or something like the NYE thing happens when I get made to look like a jerk when that's the last thing I'm trying to do. Him and I have been friends for close to 15 years and we've always been really good friends, he's as close some of my girl friends. I just don't know if it's worth me trying anymore.. 

Do I keep trying to get her to at least see I'm not an asshole? Or do I assume she's always going to see me that way and move on?

I used my teeth to rip open a no longer sterile band-aid.  There is blood and pain so I'm in a hurry and ruin a couple band-aids.  I finally get a band-aid open and using my wounded hand I press the band-aid on the counter to remove the adhesive protectors.  That gets overly complicated so I have to start all over.  

Finally I manage to get a band-aid on my finger.  The counter has blood stained trash.  There is blood on the cabinet, band-aid box, the paper towel, some drops on the floor and my shirt.

129,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to type this, but I have to get this out somehow and see if there are people that are more knowledgeable than I am that can help me.

*TL;DR: I've been having depressive episodes, I don't know if it is serious or not, and if it is serious then I want to get help without my parents knowing (18, in college).*

Hey guys, just kinda wanted to rant a bit and talk to people about their experiences and ultimately find out some valuable information to help me and maybe others.

So for a bit of backstory. My dad's side of the family (including him, my grandparents, and my half brother and half sister on that side of the family) has been pretty badly affected by mental illness. My grandpa was depressed and addicted to drugs, my dad was depressed, my brother had depression, and my sister depression and anxiety. So I'm pretty much screwed in terms of mental illness. Anyways, during second semester senior year ( like a year and a half ago) I started getting depressed. I basically had some major fallouts with people I cared about and went into a slump where I didn't do anything and such. It was pretty terrible. I talked with a school psychologist and she basically said I had mild to moderate depression and urged me to seek out some help with my parents. I did not do that for reasons I will explain very soon. I had this depression until around when college started and it became less of an issue. However, it was still prevalent and definitely affected my experience and what I did and didn't do while attending. Back now during summer, I've been seeing the symptoms more and more often and I realized that it's basically in full swing again, and here we are...

Now that you guys got some backstory, I would like to take a moment to describe my current situation, starting with why I didn't and will not tell my parents about this situation until I feel it is necessary. My dad has dealt with these things before (read above), but my mom has not. My parents are both big worriers, and they stress themselves out too much over things. If I told them about this, they would probably get stress heart attacks (I kid, but I seriously wouldn't want them to have to worry about me). Another reason for me not telling them is that I think mental illness is a burden and it can put a toll on the entire family. Since my mom doesn't know how to deal with mental illness, and my dad is working hard to support our family, I feel that it is too much of a burden on them to have to also deal with this. I will follow through with this unless i'm convinced otherwise that this is the wrong approach to the situation.

That brings me to talking about what I'm experiencing now. My depression is pretty standard from what I've read about it. However, I have ""bad days"", as I call them. Basically, I have days where I make countless mistakes and things keep on adding up until I break down and stop functioning for the rest of the day. To give a fake senario, I would accidentally say the wrong thing to someone, and then burn my bacon, then put bleach in with the colored clothes, etc. until eventually I just give up for the day on doing anything, which is when my normal symptoms like to say ""fuck you"" and make me feel like a piece of shit. This happens a good majority of days throughout the week, seemingly at random. 

A bit off topic but also connected to the ""bad days"": I think it's important to note that I don't really put myself out there too much and try new things and get involved. A big part of this is due to the building mistakes thing being so much more worse when there are people around and they expect things from you. I used to play soccer at an extremely competitive high school and club team, but I stopped when neither me nor my coaches could count on me for not making mistakes and then spiraling out of control. I don't do much anymore outside of work, gaming, and hanging out at my friend's house.

I'm definitely willing to try anything at all (again, barring telling parents unless I'm persuaded otherwise) to help myself get better. My friend (the only other person that knows about this) recommended that I talk to a therapist or counselor if I can, but I don't know what kind of options I have if I want this to not be known to my parents. 

I am extremely grateful for any response that I get and I'll gladly respond to all the messages that I can. Again, if this is in the wrong subreddit or whatever I'll probably delete it or link to the new page. 

Thanks everyone.

130,"I'm a business major and have always done well in math and management classes, which is what steered me to my selected major in the first place. I've always had a full time job while going to school, so my life has mostly consisted of cram sessions in between work for the last 4 years. As I was studying for yet another exam, I suddenly realized how much I actually hated my major. It never occurred to me that just because I was good at business related topics, doesn't mean I enjoy them or will find my career in that field meaningful. My job has always come first, so I never noticed how little interest I felt in my classes and attributed my lack of passion to just being a bit overloaded. This is my last semester of my bachelors and I've planned on starting my mba in the spring. But as I think of it, I already dread another year of pushing through subjects that don't interest me in the slightest. No one in my family has gone to college, so their opinion is always rather unsympathetic. They view me as another whiny millennial any time I speak ill of my studies. Even though I feel like this, I don't even know if I have any options left. I'm sure it's too late to change my major and I feel like there's a giant clock over my life telling me that I don't have much time left for choosing a career path before I get completely left behind by my peers. I know that's probably shallow and self centered bc I at least had the opportunity for school that so many people don't have, but I can't help it. My question is this: how do I even go about exploring other career options and should I just start over? I've been thinking about this for a week now and still have no idea. ",06Jun2017,2

136,"Hi everyone.
So he is the situation. During the Soviet Era, my grandmother received two flats from the Soviet Regime for her outstanding work as a director of something. Anyways, she has two kids, my ma and my uncle. She gave one of the flats to my mother and kept the other one as my uncle has drug addiction problems and lost a suitcase filled with valuables in a card game.

My uncle is now married, has wife and kids, and his wife is vicious. She is the stereotypical, money hungry, Eastern European cunt, using her children to manipulate my grandmother and my uncle. My uncle is using the kids to manipulate my grandmother even further. They really really want to get my grandma's flat and put a lot of pressure on her. She old and I am not sure how long she can handle it.

Now, my granny is currently living in Germany, helping my ma, my sister with her my nephew. She rented out the flat in Moscow and my uncle receives 100% of the money.

I am a cold hearted bastard, I lack human decency, and I have only a hand full of people I truly care about, and my grandmother is one of them. She practically raised me, so it makes me angry if a 75 old woman is crying on Skype.

I don't have the time nor the desire to travel to my uncle to Russia from the UK. He has kids, which means he has more leverage than I do. However, as someone who manages public perceptions, and with both kids trying to get into the public view, I could use my resources and skill to scratch their public image among their friends just as a warning shot to back off my grandma.

We tried talking and it never helps, my grandma offered him part of the flat and we all tried finding common ground. My grandma is a bit sentimental if it's about family, but she is also pragmatic, hence not giving into their demands, as my uncle constantly gives in and starts taking drugs when stressed out. We don't know what to do and I don't want to get on their level.

139,"Hyperacusis (sometimes called phonophobia) - a debilitating hearing disorder characterized by an increased sensitivity to sounds.

I went through several different jobs with my hyperacusis and have had an overall bad experience, it is summarized below.

Now I'm looking for advice on jobs suitable for people like me who are extremely sensitive to loud sounds.

My first bad job was as a farmer. I worked a lot next to a tractor, as every other farmer. Eventually I refused to work next to loud machines. This has made it very hard for my supervisor to assign work for me on the field, and he fired me.

Next I worked as a potter's apprentice. I was basically working for (almost) free, doing a lot of dirty work, but at the same time I got experience using the potter's wheel (which I used for at least 5 hours a day). One of my co-apprentices was a very loud and talky guy. After I asked him to keep quiet he became louder and more talky. So I bought earmuffs and just worked with those. However, he bullied me heavily for this and I had to leave the apprenticeship.

The next job was at a sewing workshop. I was the only man among many women. This job was nice, The women there treated me very well. I used my earmuffs there too because the women talked a lot between them (and some were very loud). This made it hard for my supervisor, as the whole room had to be quiet for the supervisor to give me intructions, otherwise I wouldn't have taken the muffs off. Eventually the supervisor asked me to leave this job.

Now I'm taking computer science courses, hoping to find a good job that I can do from home on my computer. I want to know if this is in your opinion a good plan, and whether there are other jobs that are suitable for some with hyperacusis like me.

At least, that's where it feels like we diverged in mentality. But, later he ended up getting into Harvard's graduate school. Now he's graduated, and while he says that he didn't feel the people there were smarter than anyone else, his actions say otherwise. I'd say for the whole duration of him being there at the school he's obviously started to look down on me. He will shut down every. single. one. of my ideas. There's no more coordination as it seems in his eyes I lack the overall mental stamina to produce a meaningful idea and it's starting to really get to me. He's practically shot down my ideas for the last few years, to the point of him getting frustrated and telling me to stop talking, which pisses me off beyond belief, as he knows.

Where I used to think our polar opposites could adhere together like ying and yang, allowing us to surpass beyond all means of our individual potential...he no longer really sees me as an equal. Where he is more analytical and driven by numbers, or factual proof towards the successful means of something. I am more whimsical in thought of ideas and creativity. That is obviously where he doesn't value me as much because he believes creativity is ""easy"" in a sense. I remember us discussing the creation of a video game and I told him I could handle the art creation, modelling, concept, etc you name it-- he could handle the coding(since he had experience there just like I had experience with art). He told me that was far from fair and that he'd be doing 10x the amount of work than what I would be doing. Now, I understand coding is a pain and a time consuming process but so is art and the development of levels, characters, design, and so on. That's just one example though.

153,"I've been working this job for 3 years and that damn bitch got me fired. I don't know why my parents even brought her lazy dumbass to my job of all places... She's if anyone should have been fired. What happened was all the build up of points and her. She starts everything, argues with me, the lies and tell on me to managers and it just finally got to the point where they told me one more thing and I'm fired... yet before she came I was being offered promotions...

What actually happened is she came over and asked if I could finish her work for her and I told her to go fuck herself and she pouted away. After maybe 10 minutes ""one"" of her fuckbuddies came over bitching to me about what I said to her and he tried to punk me. So knowing I had one chance left, I was just going to walk to the office and tell the manager. But my sister stands in my way saying why are you running asshole? And the guy pushes me, so I push him back and he hits the shelf and all of this glass jars of food fall over and break. They both run and the managers come and sees all of this. I tell them what happened and they make me clean it all up, then they fired me and the guy that ""I was fighting"". So despite what happened I'm gone and she still has the job.

To be fair, she does not deserve to work there, she barely works, she's literally so fucking lazy. Almost everyday at an hour before we get off, she stops working and disappear with one of her guy friends. Then there's times she even desides to miss days and leave after lunch and not come back because a guy took her probably to his house. She certainly doesn't come home so I can only assume what whorrific things she's doing. She took way to many breaks and worse they were almost twice as long as she was supposed to get. One day this dumbass guy that works with us but was on vacation went over to her aisle and started flirting with her, next thing I know, when I walk by, they're gone. I go back to working, maybe 30 minutes later, his friend who was waiting on him asked where he went... finally when it was time to leave for the night, this bitch finally walks to the back to throw away her trash and leave... And I'm just like... I can stand her or that other dumbass.

The worst thing is she doesn't even stay with one guy, she messes with a lot of them, she can't even act like she isn't sleeping around with them because she was walking with one if them and he was asking for a kiss. Then a few days later, she's talking to another guy and going home with him. I told my parents about it but they already said it will bite her in the ass eventually. But no, it bit me instead because of her own bullshit. My dad was kind of upset she got me fired and told her if she loses this job she's getting kicked out... but I doubt he was serious.

And really lately my sister has started doing drugs and getting drunk, she would come home at like midnight or later smelling like strong weed or so drunk she's laughing and falling over. My parents gave up on her and ignores it. My dad gets upset. But she used to even be at the job smelling like weed coming on my aisles bothering me and then older people coming and saying oh I'm just watching you work... but actually trying to see if I was smoking recently because it reaks... She has basically become the most shittiest person ever. Thinking about my only problem before is she wore short shirts and no panties showing way to much around the house and in public seems like nothing to how much of a trashy bitch she is now...

TLDR I was fired because of my sister's bullshit and I don't know what to do anymore... what should I do about this entire situation?

She had all my friends convinced that we were in a relationship and then she started talking to another guy over there in England as a joke. This guy was bragging to everyone that she wanted him and for some reason she talked to me about him and always told me she was flirting with him as a joke and everyone in school was in on it (which they were.) She got super upset when he told everyone in their school that he was just going to fuck her and dump her. I got mad at first because he upset her and that he was an insult to my gender but then I realized that this ""joke"" must have become quite serious for her to be upset. She never did anything with him and she is coming this summer here with plans to do stuff with me and Its just confusing me. On top of that my friends think we are dating and when I told them we weren't they all got super confused. Today I found out that the girl is still talking to said guy, and she immediately posted a snapchat story insulting him. I am so tired of this girl saying one thing and then implying another, she always says that I can hookup with anyone I want and that she wont get upset yet somehow I can feel the tension in her voice when she says it and she gets insanely jealous as soon as a girl shows interest in me. What do I do? I know I should let her go would be the only advice in this given situation but how can I deal with the jealousy? 

3. All of this has to happen the day before my Precalculas final and now I just cant sit and focus to study.

4. I am the skinniest guy you can imagine (it bothers me so much you have no idea) and because I got diagnosed with crohn's disease (as if my life wasn't shitty enough) Iv been having intense stomach pain and cannot eat more than 2 meals a day. 

I know some of you here have real underlining issues and I'm so sorry for making you read about my sad teenage life problems but I just need some advice. Theres really no one I can talk to and I want  an adult's opinion on what should I should do.

Please let me know,

156,"This is going to be long. There won't be a specific thing I'll be asking advice for, because my life is a clusterfuck. So I'm going to try to best describe my situation to the best of my ability.

I apologize if this isn't coherent as it should be. I've been up all night when I should be asleep because I work tonight at a job I just started and hate, but desperately need. I couldn't because my anxiety was telling me how I'm better off hanging from a tree. 

I hate that fucking job. It's a server/waiter and I'm literally the trash you see on /r9k/ Introverted, spineless and almost no socialskills. 

I need to get my life together. I'm trying, but I'm a piece of shit. The little dog turd you step on that was left by some asshole too lazy to clean up after himself. 

I'm a 23 (24 in august) guy who wasted his life away. A insane amount of time, opportunities and money thrown away because I am the literal embodiment of trash.  

I'm going to try to be as concise as possible because no one likes a shitty sob story. However it'll be one anyways because that's just my life.

I'm pretty fucked in the head. Depression, anxiety and depersonalization disorder. I've been in residential treatment facilities and psych wards countless times for suicide attempts and endangerment to my safety.

My parents were helping a lot. They were supportive and I appreciate them genuinely for it. However due to difference of opinions and culture(first generation, american- raised)? They  didn't believe in psychiatric medicine. They believed in exercise and a positive mindset. This does help, but try telling a suicidal kid whose only goal in life was escapism that.

After flunking out of community college for many years after I graduated from high school due to my own ineptness (I want to blame the mental illness, but it's just my own piece of shit self why) I applied to art colleges. Yes this is my dream, passion , blah blah blah, I'd rather kill myself than quit trying. Do or die. Literally. You get the point.

I got accepted into every school I applied to. (Humble brag). Though this isn't worth bragging about. People my age that want to pursue art as a career are already seasoned professionals. Van Gogh didn't start painting until he was 27. Hurrdurr. You are no Van Gogh, you piece of shit.

So within the first semester of art school. I tried to hang myself, hospitalized and ended up not keeping up with the already demanding workload and had to take a medical withdrawal. 

My parents sick of my shit cuts me off. They're tired of their failure son and tired of investing into trash. Can't blame them. I'm grateful they stuck with supporting this piece of shit as long as they did. This is where my current life situation comes in. I paid for all of this from savings working shit minimum wage jobs with help from my parents.

However, when I tried to kill myself the hospital bills and everything means no more art college. Now I'm at the end of my savings and just started a job that makes me slide razor blades across skin like ice skaters.  

Fuck it sucks being poor. I've been eating literally nothing but white rice and instant noodles for as long as I can remember. I'm pretty sure I have scurvy or some shit.

tl:dr piece of shit tries to hang himself and then realizes he was diarrhea

Idk. What advice anyone can give me from this incoherent ramblings. I can't afford professional help because I'm poor. I'm in debt that I ignored from trying to hang myself which is bad. etc. etc. etc. I'm sure I'm missing a lot , but I'm running on no sleep.",06Jun2017,1

I always want to text him and I haven't deleted any of the pictures I have of him. I don't really have any close friends I can talk to about this.

162,"Long story short, I really liked this girl for almost a year. We had several ups and downs as friends but it seemed that she still liked being around me. Lately her attitude towards me was turning toxic and she started being an a-hole. Things had went well after that and I actually bought her some shoes that she wanted because she couldn't get them herself. I had plenty of money so I bought them for her. She was happy, but later on things turned sour again after I asked her on a double date. 

Thinking that things were over, she started to come back in my life and be nice again, but when I started giving her attention, she started to become distant and am a-hole again. I still liked her but was keeping my distance for a couple of days as things were getting toxic. 

Our friend was having a graduation party and a few of my friends went. Everything seemed to be okay until I saw the girl trying to hit on my friend. My friend was standoffish but was intoxicated heavily at this point. My friend and I winded up working it out and said that he wouldn't hook up with her because of me and said that she wasn't his type anyways. 

Later on, my friend told me that the girl had told him that she liked him and wanted to go on a date but he told her no because of me. I felt good but I later on asked him if he really liked her and that he should just tell me because I found out through his sister that he told her he would date her if it wasn't for me. He again assured me that wasn't the case and that he was just being nice and letting her down easy. 

I was frustrated because of the situation with her because as I have tried to get away, she always winds up being somewhere that I am at, including some of my friends parties where they tell me that they did not invite her as she probably just showed up. 

Recently, I got a call from her asking if I could help her change her tire as the jack she was using was broke. I winded up going out there and fixed it, but since her friends were around and I was still not happy with her, we really didn't exchange words much. As I got done fixing her tire and started to walk away. She asked if we could talk later. I said yes and to hit me up. It's been almost a week now and she hasn't contacted me. A day after she remarked about contacting me, she winded up being at one of my friends house parties. She never went up and talked to me, but I never went up and talked to her. It bothered me to see her there and she was being friendly with some of my core friends. It was like what she said about contacting me went in one ear and out the other. I felt she didn't give a crap about fixing the problem or at least talking things out since we were close for a good while. 

I want to text her and ask, ""you wanted to talk?"" But some of my friends have told me not to and to wait it out till she does. I don't know what the term later means as it has been almost a week. I liked her and cared about her so I want to get some closure on this matter. She hasn't been the best person to me and some have said that she has treated me like, ""garbage."" It's hard for me to be myself around her since I was really into her previously. I feel like she is starting to only want me when she needs something. She called me hoping I could help her with her tire which I did as I was trying to be a good guy regardless of the past, but I feel like she doesn't even want to talk and that she was just saying that to try to make things, ""better,"" or showing that she, ""cares."" 

My question is that for closure, should I message her about the, ""talk?"" Or should I just wait it out. My curiosity has been running wild, but I want to be extremely smart about this situation. I'm just in a wired spot right now. Any advice would be appreciated on the matter. Thank you.

184,"Hello,

At work we have a new guy who is very talented and smart. He has an MBA (while I only have my Associates at the moment) but we both work in the same position. 

My issue/pettiness stems from him not giving credit. For example, I taught him some tricks with Excel and how to move columns around to make vloolups work. When I heard him explaining it to our boss and how he ""came up with a solution"", he completely left me out and acted like he figured it out on his own.

Similar thing happened when we received a call and had to direct it to the right person. I literally tell him who to forward it to but today he acts like he took the initiative and figured out who to send the call to.

Now he does great work. Dont get me wrong. But he is very sly. If he feels he can get away with explaining a solution to a problem as if he thought of it all by himself, he will. Meanwhile, I always include what others did and use ""we"" a lot.

Because of the Excel problem ""he fixed"" for example, some people sent more Excel stuff his way and he complained to me that he's not an Excel master. I jokingly said ""yeah that'd be me"". People send me enough other things to do that I'm glad he gets those requests now, but still...

Am I just being petty?",06Jun2017,1

188,"Hello fellow redditor I have a small problem,

I applied to a number of university programs with the common interest being environmental applications. 

The program I was accepted to was the lowest of my preferred programs and is a Bachelor of Arts in environmental studies :/ from what I've read online and others opinions on this program there are very few job outlooks and it is generally viewed as a ""future McDonald's employee"" type of program. 

I do think I will enjoy the program but I also want to know that my future won't be tarnished my holding onto a useless degree.

If at all possible, I want to focus on GIS, or becoming a surveyor. Would this program lead into either of those career paths? Or am I best to look into switching into a b. Sc in a related field?

I feel it's important to admit that I am dreadful at math, and I believe that played a large part in me not getting into my preferred programs. Thanks for reading, and any potential advice is welcome! Thanks.

He also entrusted me with what has truly been eating away at him for the majority of his life, that he is one of the 49% of male CSA survivors to have sexually ""acted out"" as a result of their abuse. In my research, I've learned this is referred to as sexual reactivity. I also learned of the above statistic.

My fiance molested his siblings from the ages of 10 to 15. It's a horrible thing, and how should one react to such a revelation?

I don't know what to do with this information. I don't know how to help or to comfort. I was caught entirely off-guard by this sudden outpouring of information. Of course I want him to get professional help, but he is only interested in making amends to his siblings, even if it is with his life.

He asked me what else he could possibly do to ease the pain of his siblings, who he abused from age 10 to 15.

Leaving out details for anonymity's sake, the situation has been addressed within the family, but he never revealed the identity of his own abuser, nor did anyone think to ask whether he had been abused himself.

I didn't sit silent, but I don't know how much of my reaction was valuable and what could be damaging.

204,"Some background. This is an office job and a sweet, sweet union gig. I'm off probation come august, problem coworker (cw) has been here for a year so she's all covered by that stuff.

I was hired into a new role. Part of my duties cover what cw does and part of it is expanding those duties to offer more service/times covered to give a better experience for customers. cw has handled this realm by herself for the past year and our boss did these duties when cw was out (vacation or such).

The original goal was to hire two of me at the same time, with the other person taking the AM shift and I the PM shift. The other person never bothered starting so I worked regular 9-5 and am now in my PM shift. I've been doing these duties ever since I wrapped up training, so it's been a couple of months but I'm having the same issues with cw and it's getting frustrating.

A customer request might come in hours before my shift, which means it's up to cw to handle it. Many times these are timely things, so by the time I come in I can't offer any help besides ""we're sorry things sucked a couple hours ago and have resolved themselves now,"" which is frustrating to the customer. I'm nonexempt (paid by the hour, need managers approval for OT/WFH) and cw is exempt (so she does these duties over the weekend and holidays because it's ""free"" to make her to do but would cost a lot to have me do it). 

cw is doing the duties while I'm on shift, so sometimes things get down doubly. Or she doesn't do anything, including during the period only she's on the clock. Or I need info from here to do something and she doesn't respond to me at all.

I've mentioned to our boss before in our 1 on 1s about some of these and she said ""work it out."" I've tried sitting w/cw and ask her to have some sort of hard time blocks of who's doing the duties but she blew me off.

My main worry here is that I'm the youngest person here in this organization and I don't want to cause animosity by being one of those DAMN MILLENIALS (everyone else is in their ~40s+). I also want to come out at work, which I'll have to do after probation but I don't want to complicate it by being thought of as ""one of those.""

Like I said earlier, I have a couch for the first month or two. Here are the cons: I'm moving to an expensive town (though less so than where I live now). Rent will easily be $800-1000 a month with roommates. The job market is tight in my state right now. I only know a handful of people in the town.

Pros: Living on the cheap enabled me to pay off my debts. I barely scraped by in college, but still got a bachelors degree. This would be my first time since I was 14 that I have been unemployed. I've been working government jobs basically my whole adult life, and I would be moving to the state capital, so the state is the primary employer. While I've never lived there, I've traveled for work and have some connections. 

Logistics: I have about $7,000 saved up for the move, in addition to what I can put away until the move and whatever I get back on the security deposit of $850 (but lets be honest, who ever gets the full amount?). The move would cost me $202 to get there with all my stuff. I know the town I'm moving to and can get around quite easily. I'm a legal assistant, but would really like a career change. 

Is my plan solid? Anything else I should consider? Should i nix this idea and stay in my current place and be miserable until I have an actual job lined up? I haven't applied for anything there yet because I know places there prefer to hire local.",06Jun2017,1

226,"So same girl, assuming you remember my last thread. We've been having a lot of fun and have been talking. We've been talking about what we'd have to do to meet up, and I believe the last thing we've agreed on is that she'd eventually ask her parents.

Now, I annoyed her last time I asked if she had (I realise I'm being an asshole for nagging, I've been apologizing the shit out of it), but she's always said it's fine and we're not on bad terms at all.

She said she would ask her yesterday if I stopped asking, and I stopped. So, fast forward, she's not told me what the situation is. I assume she therefore hasn't asked her parents about this trip. It's far away, and I don't know if they'd let her. But regardless, I'm really hoping we can eventually meet up for real. She's been saying she hopes that it'll happen, yet it seems she hasn't made an honest attempt yet.

I don't want to ask her again since I annoyed her the last time I did, but I really want to know if she actually does want to see me or if she's just saying that to keep me happy or something. I have no reason to believe from our chatting alone that she doesn't want to meet me, I'm just wondering why she's not made an attempt yet.

What is my next move? Do I ignore it and keep talking to her casually and hope she eventually asks them? Do I ask her if she actually doesn't want to see me? Her last message said she hoped we could meet, so I don't want to seem passive aggressive (or just aggressive) by asking her if that's what she really wants.",06Jun2017,1

230,"So, I bought a Razer Blade Stealth (2016) (yes, I know, not the best decision, but I wanted something portable with good construction and the Razer fit the bill.) a little under a year ago. Around 8 months ago I damaged the screen, and a few weeks ago I got around (finally) to sending it in for repairs. It is still under warranty but they're wanting ~$350 to repair it, plus a service fee. When I pointed out that it was still under warranty they agreed to waive the service fee but the screen replacement is still around $350. I was told by a friend that I should call and immediately ask to speak to a supervisor, but honestly I don't know exactly what to say and I'm hopeful that you all can give me some advice as to how to try and get them to lower this obviously overpriced repair fee. 

Edit: if I'm SOL than so be it, but I'd prefer constructive advice.

232,"Hello, I'm 19 years old and freshly unemployed. I was working at this job for close to two years, I stood up for myself a few times throughout the years which my employer wasn't too happy about. We got a few new hires that I had helped train. During this time there i moved out of my house and moved back into my parents to save a little bit of money. One week after I moved,  I was told to come in after work for an evaluation; I was supposed to get a raise so I had thought it was regarding that. I walk in and my manager says ""I'm not going to beat around the bush, but we're letting you go."" . So I handed my keys and shirt and did the walk of shame back to my car. . Before this had happened my girlfriend and I had planned several back to back weekend trips. And I lost my job a week before one of them.. Well, fast forward after the first trip, my car breaks down with a $3600 price tag to fix... I didn't have the money to fix it so I left it at my parents house. We went on the rest of the trips and everything was perfect. Well, right after the last trip we went on, she had sat me down and told me that she wanted to take a break; because I needed to get my shit together. 

That same day I went out and had two on the spot interviews, both for full time jobs that both seemed promising. 

I had been traveling so often I didn't have the time to sit down and apply to places. Well the day she told me that I sat down and thought to myself, how does one exactly have their shit together? 

I want to be able to improve on myself not only just for me but I want to improve for her as well. She's a huge motivator in my life and I love her to death, but I just am not sure exactly how to work on myself.. if that makes sense......

243,"I've worked part time at this daycare for a year now. I started last spring working 18 hours a week while going to school. When fall came, I was taking a heavier course load and struggling with an increasingly deepening depression. I'd never been open or close with anyone there though so I just said my course load was heavier so I needed to stop working but I wanted to still work school vacations because I do enjoy working there. In retrospect I should've just cut back to 9 hours but I didn't think I could handle even that at the time. Now it's summer so I'm working again, still part time because I'm taking a couple summer classes, which I think pisses them off because they have to find someone to cover the two days I don't work. I have trouble accurately reading social cues because I have social anxiety so they all seem negative. But every time I talk to my bosses they get very quiet and avoid eye contact, when usually they're very outgoing. They avoid talking to me if they can help it. In group interactions they laugh and joke with coworkers then go silent and look away if I speak. Do they hate me? What can I do about it? Should I explain that I had a depression episode, I wasn't just flaking or making excuses? I wish they would just be upfront about what they wanted from me instead of agreeing to my face but resenting me behind my back. I especially want to fix things because I need to use them as a reference for other jobs and because every time I talk to them I feel rejected and depressed afterwards. ",06Jun2017,1

However, after it occurred to me that they might have been trying to say that our cars had brushed against each other. When I got home I looked at my car. There is a scrape on the car from a prior incident, but within that scrape there appeared to be a smaller scrape that could be newer, as in from the incident today(I am not sure if it is new or old though). I had no idea that our cars could have bumped/scraped against each other because I did not hear or feel ANYTHING when I cut them off. I am only 16 and in drivers ed they told us never to interact with drivers who have road rage so that is why I ignored the person when we were next to each other at the light.

246,"Hey, just gonna write this out, and hope somebody reads it and gives me their thoughts. Met this girl a month or 2 ago at a college trip. We talked on snapchat, and we face timed a few times where she'd play the piano for me and sing, which she says she hasn't done in front of many people at all. Few days later she suggested that I take her to prom, and that ended up happening last week. The pictures came out beautiful. We danced the whole night. We did the couples dance, and after that the dj said for the couples to kiss, and we kinda looked at each other for a second, and she leaned in and we kissed. She held my hand throughout the night, and overall I went, We felt, like a million bucks. I was SUPER nervous before this, because i had just met the girl a month ago but everything ended up being awesome. 
  She didn't post any of the pictures to her instagram, which i understand because it wasn't exactly her prom haha. I got A LOT of compliments on bringing a hot date to prom, and a ton of people complimented her dress. After prom she gave me a tight hug, and said see you soon. To the disappointment of many friends, we didn't have sex which is that stereotypical after prom night, but she had to drive home an hour away.
 I uploaded another photo to mine yesterday, and before I did, I told her to come up with a clever comment. An hour later she commented something, and I said "" it took u an hour to just come up with that?""  And she replied with something along the lines of "" I didn't wanna comment, but I felt guilty"". She snapchatted me later asking where she got her comment from. I didn't get the reference at first, but I looked it up and it ended up being a lyric to a song by The Weeknd, who she knows is my favorite artist :) I definitely like this girl, and i'm not sure if she likes me, but really what I don't want, is for us to not be the same in college, or for us ( her in particular) to meet other guys right away. We don't live particularly close, and we have our own separate lives, but now i have all these beautiful prom pictures i keep looking at:( Her actual prom is later this month, and she said she would've taken me, but a good friend of hers ended up asking her. Now I'm thinking about her doing what we did, at her own prom, and having the possibility of having sex with someone. Anyway, i'm just really conflicted, and very obviously have a huge crush.

248,"*English is not my main language so if I seem incoherent I apologize* 

As the title says, I'm almost done with my 2nd year of college. Going in on my first semester I really thought I would do well as I had a good mind set and motivation to complete my studies. Little did I know at the time, my life would completely change (not in a good way) once I started my first semester. I've gained around 70 pounds in the last 2 years. My gpa is at an all time low with it being at 2.3. I'm still a virgin at 20 y/o. I find myself disgusting to look at, thus making me so insecure I can't talk to women (that I don't know) without feeling like I'm being judged because of my looks. Now, this is a complete change of lifestyle than when I was in high school. Back in HS I would actually get good grades, be relatively thin and find myself talking to girls. I'd struggle here and there but I'd manage to get through it. I can't say the same about college tho. I began studying Computer Engineering and since day 1 it's been a struggle. I've gotten F's and D's in various classes already and had to drop 3 courses in the span of 4 semesters. I'm definitely feeling like I'm not smart enough, which makes me think that Computer Engineering isn't the right choice for me, so I've decided to look for other options but I'm having a hard time. I've taken multiple tests to help me find another concentration but nothing seems to help. I have my parents constantly on my back because I'm doing so poorly. I second guess everything I do. I just recently got diagnosed with ADD, for which I've been given medication. It would probably help with my studies a bit more but I feel like I've hit rock bottom and it's impossible to climb back up. I've always had these expectations of myself and so far haven't gotten even close to them. I really need some advice to help me with my physical and mental health. I've already taken a few steps to turn my life around, but I really need an outsiders opinion on what they think I should do, since I've lost most of my close friends and find it embarrassing to talk about this to those who are still around.

249,"**edit (tldr): i've been playing the reserved role my whole life and it's turned into a fear of being myself, how do i deal with the social flack of doing this?**

In school I've always been a quiet kid. I've never liked attention, I kept to myself. I had friends, but still, around those friends I'd just be the one sitting back laughing and listening, cracking a little joke here and there. Even around my family I've been ""shy"" just because I'm afraid of being judged, and I have no idea where this fear came from. I guess I'm just some sort of ""social perfectionist"" and fear being myself.

I have a talent that's been gradually developing since my early teens. I know the limitless potential of both the talent, and where it can take me, and I know that if I decide to go through with it, I can't half ass it, I have to go all in. I just don't know how I will be treated by all of my peers. I don't know how to deal with being judged. What if I make some sort of blunder? How do I handle potentially being laughed at? Is there light at the end of the dark tunnel? 

I've erased all my social media since I've graduated high school (it's been 3 years). These days I only keep in contact with like 4 friends (that kinda know what my talent is, not to its full extent), their families, and some girls I talk to here and there that I'm not dating or anything (that I'd like to date, or maybe just lusting after. girls that have friendzoned me tbh) so I feel like for me to come out of nowhere and make this drastic personality change (to them, at least) would cause them to have all sorts of things to say about me and I don't know how to deal with it. And not even just my peers. I've always been afraid of becoming a meme and with the popularity that comes with my talent I'd be sure to become one sooner or later :/",06Jun2017,0
250,"tl;dr: i used to have a bunch of friends and now i don't and i want it to change because i don't want to spend my entire summer by myself. 

Hello! This is my first post on my anonymous account. I've made similar posts about what I'm about to say on my other one, and I don't want people to make a connection to this one.

So today was the last day of my finals. I'm excited that school is over for the time being and I can get a break, but I'm also not looking forward to it. I go to a small school (300 students 9-12) and there isn't really a lot of people to be friends with to begin with. Last summer/ the beginning of this year, I had a bunch of people that I was friends with and it was great! I had a great time and I was always happy.

However, as the year progressed, those 'friends' began to dwindle away. Soon I only had about two or three people I could count on. As of now, My last day, it's down to one. Which really sucks, considering I'm a very social person and I feed off of social interaction. It's gotten to the point to where I dread waking up because I know I'll be alone. 

I want to start fresh. I want to make more friends, I want to be happy again. It's not that I'm unhappy with myself, but it makes me happy to be social and with people that genuinely care. I want to reconnect with people that I used to go to public school with (500 a grade). Even talking with someone my age online would make me feel happier. 

How do I start making new friends? Where should I start? 

Lastly, I apologize for any bad formatting. I'm on mobile. ",06Jun2017,2

252,"So brief background here.  My daughter  bought two $350 tickets to Bonnaroo (a 4 day music festival in Tennessee, which is several states away).  She bought one for her roommate (who hasn't paid for it yet).  She and her roommate then decided they didn't want to go so decided to sell the ticket.  They don't ship these tickets till 2 weeks prior or something, so through a comedy of errors on her part, the tickets got sent back to Bonnaroo and can be picked up with her ID and original payment method.  My daughter also had a friend from high school who was going to buy the tickets but decided not to at the last minute.


My daughter would like to sell these tickets to someone on craigslist.  Her plan is to give the person a copy of her drivers license and cancel her debit card and give it to this person.  According to her this is the only way she will recoup any money.


Oh, and according to my daughter, her roommate isn't responsible for any of the money because my daughter is as fault for not selling the tickets because it was her friend who bailed on buying them.

253,"Short version : Bought a new home, sketchy neighbors, son was arrested. What do we do?


My wife and I just recently purchased a house and remodeled it. We are super excited as we are first time home owners. The home is in a fairly nice neighborhood, the only problem is our next door neighbors are the ones that no one likes in the neighborhood. I have never been one for passing judgement but something did seem off about them.


Their one son came on our property without permission and we were polite but asked him to not come over when we are not home (we know because he told us, he was looking through our window to see what we had done in the house). Then we started locking our fence as a way to say we like our privacy. He climbed the fence and came over to talk about something and was acting strange. He wanted something from our junk pile from the remodel. Anyway the other day the 32 year old son who still lives at home was arrested. There were two undercover cops and they had him in handcuffs while they were searching his vehicle. They later took him away.


My wife thinks he was in our garage while we were not home as things were in different places than they were before. The question is, what do we do? I looked him up and sure enough he does have a history of drugs, assault, and theft under his belt. Not only that but so does the rest of their family including the father. I realize now we should have asked around the neighborhood more before we bought the place. The few people we talked to seemed really nice though and made no mention of them when we told them what house we were looking at. My wife and I are going to install security cameras and a few other protective measures. I installed locks on the garage and eventually we will install a garage door opener. Any advice or experience I could benefit from? Thank you in advance.",06Jun2017,2

257,"Hello, first time poster here.

I'm having an issue here, and I still have a chance to fix it, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Any advice is appreciated! Be warned, there is a wall of text. 

So a little over a month ago I was hired at a Subway in Texas not far from home. The manager at the time actually alerted me to the chaos that might ensue, and the condition of the store before I applied. She told me that they needed leaders there at the store and I was happy to oblige. After all, it might lead to an early pay-raise/promotion. 

So I give her all my information, fill out the w4 and everything else. A week goes by; no one has trained me and I'm not in the system. I bring it up to the GM who hired me and she says she's working on it. Also, I forgot to mention I don't have any hat to wear. The only ones I have are for other food industry jobs and I was never given one. 

Another week goes by and this brand new GM quits! Ups and leaves. The DM hastily fills the position with an experienced worker who doesn't manage, typically. Or ever, maybe. Payday comes and goes, I don't get payed- I'm not in the system. I work for this new manager for a couple of weeks, never get trained, payed, put in the system, or given a hat. I barely know how to make any of the sandwiches and am not technically allowed to make any without something to cover my head. 

Now all of this time I've been asking the GM at the time everyday when I'm supposed to come in next since I'm not on the schedule and on my last day there she tells me she'll call me and let me know. She never calls and I don't bother going back. It's been a dismal experience. 

A couple of weeks pass and I drop in to get my check (if there is one) and they have a new GM- though the old one is still working there. They have no record of me ever working there, no check, nothing. I give them all of my info again, reapply, and this new GM tells me that the DM says there is nothing he can do about be not being payed ""it's out of his hands"". This all happens over the span of a few visits.

 This has been a crappy experience and I just want the money I worked for. I got the number of the DM and I plan on calling him, but I don't know how to go about it. I have a general sense of my rights, but nothing specific. I'm pretty sure all this is illegal? What am I supposed to say?",06Jun2017,1
263,"I met this girl in college and we were pretty good friends for about 7 years. We would hang almost every weekend, if not every other, and go out to dinners and talk on the phone. I almost felt closer to her than my childhood friend. August, 2 years back, we went out for lunch and I was not particularly feeling well. It hit me pretty quick, but I did not ditch out I just did not order food. I sat through even though I was uncomfortable. I think she felt weird about it for some reason. That was the last time I saw her. She had not reached out to me in awhile and she was very short with me when I text her. She ignored all my calls too. I finally asked her what the deal was and if I did something wrong. She replied that she could not deal with my anxieties and that she felt like everyone used her to vent to. She stated she just wanted some time alone. I was really insulted as I held her very high in my life and really felt she was one of my best friends. I deleted her from FB too.

I still think about her from time to time and always have the urge to text her and see hows she's doing. The only thing holding me back is my pride and realistically, I have always felt she should be coming back to me and owing me an apology-but I do not see that happening (especially since I took her off my FB, I am sure that sent a message). I had a dream last night about meeting up again and the dream was eerie as hell but I woke up wanting to reach out. What should I do here? I could use some advice. To be honest, I would rather not have friends who felt that I stressed them out with my issues but I am still confused by the whole thing.",06Jun2017,1
264,"So a couple of months ago I moved into a new apartment (mid-april ish). I had already paid aprils rent for my previous apartment. A couple of days before I moved, the now ex-tenant texted me about buying him out of his deposit (two months worth of rent), so I transferred him the money. I did not talk to him until he texted me last week. He basicly said that he forgot he paid aprils rent and would like half of it back. I've heard stories from my roommates that he was always kind of cheap and never paying for groceries etc. so I was kind of skeptical. I mean he took the time to tell me about the deposit but somehow forgot to mention the rent? Since he didn't mention the rent I assumed it was covered and I would just break even with my previous apartment. Had I known I would have to pay rent for the second part of april I could've just stayed at my old apartment. But now I might end up paying two weeks of double rent more than a month later! I feel like this is some kind of trick of his, trying to make a quick buck, just like I heard in the stories. 
An outside perspective would be appreciated cause I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

267,"So I am the new West Coast Logistics Coordinator for my DNA sequencing company. We gather our sample submissions by contacted couriers that work for us independently. Their routes are sent through them throughout the day via text. We recently came up with the idea of getting them company email addresses, but our COO shot it down. I really need some help with either an app, or software or just an idea! I need to submit complete routes to them after their cutoff times. I have access to their completed lists, but they do not due to ""security reasons""... If anyone has any tips or direction for me, thatd be great. I know FEDEX and UPS use a software with that maps their most timely route...that could be something. But that does not solve the transfer of their worklist to them. ",06Jun2017,1
268,"So recently my life has been spiraling out of control. I'm a college student who's GPA is barely hanging by a thread. I'm stuck at a dead end job, I had a large sum saved up until I was screwed out of all of it by a ""friend"". He has no intentions of paying me back. On top of that I'm struggling with a handful of addictions, the worst of them being alcohol. Also as of this week I seemed to have alienated the last of my close friends, and now I have no one to turn to. Please help me, I'm afraid of where this path is heading",06Jun2017,1
269,"So my husband has been a driver for most of his entire working life. We are still young. He's 32. I recently got a job at a Fortune 100 bank with great benefits, and they're hiring 5,000 people this year. It's a call center job and I joined with 8 years of experience under my belt. There's a ton of positions available and the call center is the easiest position to get.

My husband wants to work there too. He's been laid off 3 times from driving jobs and he's had trouble finding something steady ever since was laid off the second time. He's tired of doing manual labor and really wants to do something more stable (and indoors of course.) 

His resume right now is designed for driving job applications,  but no one is responding. Is it worth it to clean up his resume and play up his team working skills, ability to work in a fast paced, stressful environment and his customer service skills and expect a good response from this bank? 

Anyone else do a 180 in career paths? How did you do it without going back to school?",06Jun2017,1
271,"(Dentist) This was my second visit. First time with him. He was so abrupt and short. No explaining my problem, no nothing. Did the exam and asked when I turned 18 and was i don't know, I got the vibe he didn't care much for my presence and was not a warm and welcoming as the rest of the staff. I have never been asked when I turned 18 by any doctor or nurse alike, I didn't see the relevance. He damn near lost his marbles trying to get out the door as soon as he evaluated my xrays of my molars. Then as I was setting my next appointment he looked at me and literally ducked into a different room. My mom shrugged it off but I'm not certain he is fond of me, I don't know why, and maybe I should switch dentist.
I'm 17, which my chart obviously said along my birthday so why ask. I didn't understand that whole visit and left with my teeth still throbbing.
What is his deal, I don't even know him. Seemed to me he needed to return to school and learn manners, looks fresh out of dental school.",06Jun2017,1
273,"There is this girl i like, she is so unique and the thing is, i love her but i don't think she feels the same way i do, i've been depressed for a long time, and she makes me smile and makes me feel good, i don't know what to do, any advice?
