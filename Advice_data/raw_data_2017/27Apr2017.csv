1,"I'm (M 16) a sophomore, and just the floater in high school. Like good acquaintances in all my class, we have a good time but don't do anything outside of school. Snapchat 4 people. Score of 3000. Now my crush(F 16), who is much more popular, Snapchat score of 300k, is sorta trying to become good friends with me. It's really embarrassing showing her how unpopular I am and don't know how to explain to her how I feel exactly. Like she's inviting me to parties with people I don't know and asking what I'm doing over the weekend while the answer is always nothing. I hate looking like a fucking loser because when it's just the 2 of us it's chill but the social norms are rough",27Apr2017,1
3,"See, I am in love with my best friend, but I am just so god damn depressed and confused, and my life is a fucking mess.
 
I used to attend school with her, but I was a whiny bitch and went to another school. Some stupid religious school, even though I'm an atheist. Eventually, I got expelled, or as they put it ""Indefinitely suspended until proven not insane"". They thought I was gonna kill everyone. Anyway, I still talk to her and are other friend on Kik. These are my only friends. Because I'm an anti-social freak who doesn't want friends. On New Years Day, like right when it turns 2017, I get all weird and sad. I think I like her a lot. I tell her next day after big huge confession, really cheesy and shit. She says okay, we can date in High school. Next day, she says her mom found out and got mad because she is angry gook bitch. I think this a total fucking lie. I just forget about it, tell her its fine, and that I was just acting weird.

 Anyway, recently I have had fights with the two friends, because I think they are gonna hurt me, and that they are using me and abusing me. One friend sends their stupid aunt to talk shit to me over Kik, like wtf? Pick yer own fights bitch. Anyway, that leaves me with my friend (Her names Scarlett btw), so I yell at her, and she leaves in the middle of the convo, although it still said she received all of it. Later that night, at like 1 AM. She texts me, I stay up until like 3 or 6 AM. She says how nice I type and write, I write stories and stuff. I am loopy af, and I just apologize, because it was just one of my depressed rages. So we talk until 4, and I start getting all those feeling again, although I still had them since last time, I started looking back through the convo, and I saw all the chem we had, and I just kept thinking about how perfect she is. 

Then like a day later, we get into another midnight convo. This time she is talking about anime because she is a Weeb, she loves this Yaoi shit. Like gay anime and hentai. I ask about it to be nice. She gets all excited and asks if I wanna see pics, I say yes (never had a problem with faggots). She shows me a bunch of pics, I make a joke question, asking if she had gay porn on her phone. She then asked if I wanted to see hardcore shit, I said yes, not expecting her actually send hentai. SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO SEND A TSUNAMI OF GAY HENTAI! So I got fucking shocked but then had an idea. I like lesbo anime (Not much, because I ain't a fucking weeb). I ask if I can send Yuri hentai. She says yes, so then for the next hour we have a SUPER HENTAI DEATH BATTLE (that is what I wanna call it). I totally won, but I called it a draw to be nice. So this left we wondering, does she like me? or am I in the friend zone? 

So then days past. Then we Skype, and it is fucking awesome! We joke and laugh, and she speaks in her engrish accent because she is foreign. I am just so desperate to talk to her because just sharing a few words with her makes me happy. She is the only thing in my life that makes me happy. Sadly, she rarely replies, and when she does I have to reply instantly or else she goes away. I think it is because her notifications are off. So anyway here I am, thinking of the future and how awful it will be. Listening to the Sex Pistols and bitching on Tumblr. Thinking to myself, I love her, she is perfect, I want her to be mine forever. But I'm not fucking stupid because that is impossible. I hated the whole idea of love before I met her (okay one time before her, but that's for another day).Love is depressing and hard. It is not sprinkles and unicorns that cum rainbows. It is a depressing and desperate game. But I am willing to play it.  The problem is, I'm so scared and socially awkward. So just telling her is a horrible idea. 


Scarlett is just a bit older than me, she is an immigrant from Thailand, She came here about 7 years ago. She is Karen, a people from Myanmar and Thailand. She is insane about anime, loves murder and creepy stuff. Loves weapons and punk rock like me. Is incredibly insane, but so fucking cute and hyper at the same time. She will kick your ass if you piss her off. She is the most fucking adorable person I've ever met. 


Any Advice? Please I am desperate! The problem is, I'm so scared and socially awkward. So just telling her is a horrible idea. Most sites I have found list things I can't do. Because I just don't have the courage. ",27Apr2017,0

8,"Back in April 2016, my mum lost her job. She worked at a prestigious hospital and was let go because she wasn't 'happy' working there anymore when in fact, she just lost her father/I lost my grandpa. She has kept a book of all the jobs she's applied for - she worked as a medical administrator - and hasn't had any luck. 

She recently got scammed into thinking that there was a job offer for her, but it's just a fraud company. What can I do to help her? I've fixed her resume, brought her to places she could apply, helped her get her typing skills back up to what they use to be.

13,"At least they don't have to deal with the feeling, the honest feeling of being completely and utterly useless. I envy people who have jobs or go to school. Because they can.... I'm 22 years old and want to know what my life has amassed to? Well nothing. Do I have my own car? My own apartment? Half way done with school? Do I have any education or experience?

Even you reading this, with divorced parents that always felt useless, yeah enjoy that 9-5 job. Your lucky. I've applied to thousands and hundreds of places. For some reason no one will higher me. I've had a jobs before yes. And I'm not stupid on resumes or applications I know to show skills and good things I can do. I'm talking about... Everything being okay then bad now worse. What i mean I'd I had a job in January. I quit because of panic attacks about being critiqued too much. I'm not over sensitive either my friend would call me stupid because he can and I laugh. Anyway. After that it was down hill. Nothing, no one would take me. I considered school, government didn't approve of even a loan. Parents too poor to help or care. I tried staffing agencies. This is when things tool a turn from going down hill to rock bottom (for myself). I applied with friends with felt the same way. The kind of worst one of us got hired. We were happy for him but disappointed the awkward weird one got picked or that could have been just my feelings. Then it happened. I woke up wensday with some hope and energy (last week) I applied to a few places and staffing agencies. They told me to head over. I was about to then I thought about my friend. The second one in the group,the one on was more close to. I tried calling him to warn him of today, that I was going to get a few interviews, he could try and snag a few too. He was asleep apparently because when I showed up at his house and his mom let me in he didn't want to go. Too tired. I forced and convinced him, a mix of the too. For his sake. As we headed over and applied to all the places togeather we laughed and I felt a sense of hope we could get hired together. Until the next morning when he called me asking if I got the call about when to show up to the drug test and start Friday. I was confused, then he said hang up they will call you next. I waited patiently the call all day then it hit me. I wouldn't get called. They preferred everyone else but me. Let's just say my week hasn't been better at all. I'm depressed as ever.

23,"So I just put well over 700$ into my new computer upgrade. And while I'm pretty savvy with the physical part of building a computer, the technical side... not so much. So once I get everything in order I bring my computer over to my local shop to have him wipe the drive and install win10 and everything else to make the thing work. So everything's fine up until I go to pick it up. When I get in the shop he has it on the floor plugged into a monitor to show me it works. Ok it works, fine, great. Now this is the important part. I click shut down on the computer and it was going through it's process and this dude yanks out the mother f***ing power cable out of the back of the computer. Now all of this is kind of hazy (because honestly I was at this point) but I don't know if it was powered off before he yanked the plug out of the back. But anyways, I live around the corner so I walk back, immediately plug everything up (keep in mind only the SDD that I boot from and the CD drive is plugged in at this point.) and when I turn it on my computer is stuck in this endless cycle of repeatedly restarting rapidly and won't even boot to any kind of screen. I bring it back immediately and leave it with him for a hour or two. In a little while he tells me probably MOBO is fried, or PSU.. I happen to have a PSU tester that came with the thing when I bought it and when I plugged it in to test it everything turned on fine. Ok, so it's the MOBO. He then point's to this one plug that I have strung through my case (it's a wire that connects my front fans to a hub so I can manually turn the fans on/off) and he shows me that the wiring kind of stripped in it and it might have caused a short. And might I add I feel like I would have noticed if this cable had been screwed up before I gave it too him, I feel like I know my computer well enough. Anyways he says when I get the new MOBO that he would help me out for free with my case and he held up to his word, he seems like a nice guy. I RMA the thing and I get it in the mail last night and install everything properly once again. I plug it in today and what do you know it's doing the same thing. So I call him, and every single tech support I could and they all tell me the same things. Either the PSU or MOBO. So now I went and bought another PSU from Frys and gave it to him for him to see if could figure out what is going on with it, he'll be in touch with me tomorrow. What I'm posting on here for is advice on whether I should approach him or not about my suspicion that he caused my PSU to die on me (the thing was under a year old and ran at a load way smaller than it's max and worked FINE 10 minutes before I plugged it in at my house)? It was a stretch for me to buy the tech in the first place, but I could manage my money. Now it's costing me almost 150$ more at this point and I'm starting to get pretty bad anxiety from it (tech problems always do this to me). And if I do approach him... how should I word it?

So for the post month and a half I have been talking to this girl let's call her 1. Now 1 is a very boring and bland person with literally no friends at all. She's really sweet to me and she is very low maintenance. After about one month into me and her being friends I asked her to prom. 1 hates big surprises so I just asked her and she said yes. A week later I asked her to date to which she said yes again. Now me and 1 get along very well but she is just boring. I hate being that mean but that is the hard truth. So about 3 months ago I started talking to this girl let's call her 2. Now 2 is really sweet. She has a lot of friends and has always kinda been into me. I just haven't ever had the courage to ask her out and the low maintenance number 1 was super easy. So after a long talk with 2 about prom and all, she tells me she has no date and no group. The group that I am in which includes around 25 people, all do not get along with number 1. Also number one is upset she is even going in this group.

32,"I'm an 18 year old male who'll start attending college next August and I'm genuinely confused about this. I've never had even one romantic relationship, as all the girls I've been interested in have turned out to have boyfriends up until this point (hopefully this will change eventually but as time goes on all the girls I may find attractive will also have more time to meet new guys so I don't fucking know at this point), and the few girls who did express interest in dating me have been ones who take relationships too lightly for my taste and also quite unattractive imo, although they were good-natured girls (call me shallow or whatever but if I can't look at them and smile the relationship would just end up hurting both of us and I'm not desperate enough to do that).

During this time, I've never been one to seek relationships. I was too busy with schoolwork to think about it and most of the girls I liked I 1) Barely got to meet at all or 2) Knew of their existence for a while (when they were single) but only got to meet them through classes/friends once they were taken.

The most recent iteration of this problem that has followed me everywhere made me realize that things could've been much different if I'd just been seeking a relationship when I still had a chance with them, so I decided I'd do my best to actually seek out the people I'm interested in once college rolls around, though I am _deathly_ scared of the fact that all the girls I could be interested in will already be taken and I don't really have experience striking conversations but hey, at least I'd be more likely to get something done with this mindset.

Now here's the thing, I've posted about my problems in other subs before (with other throwaways) and read up advice on threads with similar issues, and there's one thing that keeps being brought up: ""You shouldn't be pursuing love, continue doing your stuff and the right person will come to you""

Now of course my life up until this point is a shining example of why this is absolute bullshit (I clicked _really_ well with the girls I did manage to befriend, before learning they were taken already), but if that weren't enough, here's what I'd be doing by just doing what I do: play videogames, watch anime, and study CompSci. The former 2 barely require interaction with other human beings in person (although finding another girl with similar interests would be the ideal scenario, problem is in my experience they tend to keep it to themselves even if they do like it), and the third is a mostly male career and even then I would prefer to date/marry someone with different skills to mine so we can complement each other and shit, I don't want to date female me.

So, what the hell? Am I supposed to sit around and _believe_ someone right for me will come eventually? Even though last time I did that I wasted so many opportunities and ended up with literally nothing instead? Or do I start trying to pursue girls, risking coming off as desperate and possibly losing focus on school/the things I enjoy doing the most in order to do other hobbies that I enjoy a bit less but imply more social activity?

I don't know, I am genuinely at a loss here. I am horrified of never finding an attractive girl (both visually and personality-wise) who _isn't_ already taken, and even more terrified of experiencing the despair of knowing things could have been different if I'd just started moving earlier, but everyone keeps saying that I just have to wait even though that _quite clearly_ fucked me over before. I don't get it, please help.

36,"My boyfriend and I live in a rural area where most people have decent amount of land and keep to themselves. I barely know the neighbors (theres only one couple we really see). He got a really small cheap house on a good chunk of land. We got a dog, a catahoula-pitt mix (blue merle), about a year ago. She got out to the neighbors a total of three times. The first time we cause her easily as she just wanted to play with out neighbor's dogs. The second she got away in the middle of the night to catch a cat. It woke up the neighbors (their two dogs went bezerk after hearing her outside), but they understood and it was not long. 

Both of those incidences were within the first 1-2 months we had her and were still learning. We have since built a fence which was completed when we had her for about 9-10 months. She has done really well outside on her own and the fence to the house is only about 20 feet. I do not leash her and she always follows me. 

On Monday I was bringing her inside when she took off and went after her after slipping on my shoes next to me. I got to my neighbor's house and he was standing at the garage door leading into the house (garage door was open) saying he had her IN the house. I had no idea how it happened that quick as their driveway is not that long (maybe 100m). I make a move to come get her and he says he will bring her out. He shoos me out and shuts the garage door to keep his dogs in. 

Then all i hear is cursing and blood curdling screams from his wife. I see them running around and yelling at my dog. I can't get into the house as everything is closed.

He screams from the FRONT door and I run around the side. He says ""I made a terrible mistake, she killed my cat, my favorite cat... I have to go to the hospital JUST GO"" and shuts me out of his house ... again.

There was blood all over my dog. I went home .. broken hearted. I told my boyfriend and we sat there ... stunned. I called a little while later offering anything we could. He called later that night after bringing the cat to the hospital NO BROKEN BONES NO PUNCTURE WOUNDS. The cat would live.

48 hours go by and he called me again - they kept the cat in observation at the vet for two days. He wanted three things
1) Whether I would pay the $1100 vet bill
2) What he should do if my dog got out again
3) How to keep her from getting away (""and how to teach her to listen"")

To clarify - he called and admitted her was wrong for letting her into the house. He did have pure intentions in making sure my dog was safe. He has had EXTREMELY limited interaction with her and knows she's a hyperactive dog in general. 

1) I told him I will being going to school in the fall and really can not afford this much and I would discuss it with my boyfriend. He has the audacity to ask ""when"" (Sept) and when he hears me stumble on words says I didn't mean to imply you COULD pay.
2) He should know not to let her in. Especially if he had cats. I STILL DONT KNOW WHY SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE.
3) This is an isolated and extremely infrequent occurrence that has not happened since she was first accommodated to the house.

I am beside myself as I can not afford it but want to keep peace with the neighbors. I have asked for proof of the bill; first and foremost. I discussed with my boyfriend and we want to offer 1/2 ($550) to cover expenses. I understand he had pure intentions and I do not want to be a shitty neighbor BUT he has been a bit condescending through this and he has admitted fault as well.

So I found out that this one girl likes me. I found out because I'm friends with her sister and she was telling me that her sister thinks I'm cute. Then her sister told me that she actually likes me. 

Anyways her sister and her friend have been telling me to ask her out. They keep trying to force it when I don't even know if I have feelings for her. I've been in 2 other relationships but those were never actually serious. This would be my first serious one. They told me that she was gonna ask me out soon but never told me when. Her and I sometimes make awkward eye contact while walking to our classes. There was two times She was gonna ask me out but the first they couldn't find me then the second one she was too shy. I don't know what to do when she finally asks me out. I've been trying to think about what to do and how I feel about her but I've been busy trying to get my grades up and I generally can't think of what to do. Can any of you guys give me advice?",27Apr2017,1

Like the other day I woke up in he morning to brush my teeth and I almost startled myself when I looked in the mirror. I could've sworn I was looking at a stranger. I'm afraid to look in mirrors now because it's all so freaky. Is any of this normal? Anyone else exprocned this? I don't what's happening, first the speech issues and now this?. Thanks.",27Apr2017,1

53,"My fraternal twin sister and I are very close (both f 18). We've grown up in a big family (my mum is the eldest of 8) and we have an older brother and sister. Our parents are fantastic, loving, kind and supportive. My sister has always been closer to our brother than I am, but that has never really bothered me. He is a fantastic older brother, he watches out for us and is always checking up on us.
 A few days ago I went to talk to her (it was about midnight) and I could hear her having sex. Honestly, this doesn't phase me at all, she tends to be a bit promiscuous. Our parents were out so I figured she'd let a guy in without me noticing. I went to talk to my brother and he wasn't in his room and I couldn't find him which is strange because I knew he was home and he never goes out without telling both of us. Later, I went to the kitchen, and I saw him coming out of her room.

I find that I can easily talk to multiple people about really heavy topics, but when it comes to light-hearted, over-the-table conversation, I refrain from talking because I either want to observe others talking, or I don't feel like I can adequately carry on a conversation about shallow things.

56,"Im a supposed to be a 1st year high school student,if im not studying overboard.originally im from indonesia and im studying traditional chinese in taiwan right now.the thing is im not going to taiwan on my own will.it's mostly affected by both my brother and sister who studied there.compare to both of them im literally useless.my brother is really smart and has a wide connection,my sister is always on top 3 of her class and really dilligent.while im just an average student back in middle school.so i think maybe this time i can best them in chinese langguage because they are going when they enter college and i enter it after finishing middle school.
I though i will be able to study just well here,but it's really overwhelming.at 1st i literally studied for 5 hours in dorm and still got 40-50.day after day and the teacher keep adding more and more material for the test,and we have test every single day.i can't handle it and im having a mental breakdown for almost 3 months and nearly commit suicide.now im on the 2nd semester and my grade is just as bad as it is.eventhough dorm's life is really fun im  feeling completely dead.we are javing class from 7 am till 8pm leaving me with so little time to do what i love most.my mother and brother told me that it is fine if you have to stay in langguage class for 1 more year.but i don't want to stay here anymore i want to call it quit after this year is over.im sick and tired of getting pushed and burned throught the height of my capabilty.i don't want to think about learning chinese anymore,i don't want to care about it,i don't want to give a shit about it anymore.

59,"I'm a college student and my girlfriend and I have lived together for almost 2 years.

I plan to (been planning this for a while) move to Kansas for the state Rural Opportunity Zone (ROZ) program which offers up to $15 in student loan repayment and waives 5 years of the state income tax. Since I'm leaving college with about 30k in student loan debt I believe I'd be foolish not to take this opportunity. I mean, it's *half* my student loan debt. I've gotten details, looked into places to live and work, and have got a pretty decent idea of how the plan will play out when it finally comes time to move. All that's left is to start making contact and actually execute the plan in February 2018.

There's one snag though. My girlfriend doesn't want to move to Kansas. She says it would make her miserable, and I believe her; She's lived in the same city her entire life. She's accustomed to the conveniences. She doesn't have a license or a car so unless that gets sorted before the move she'd be completely dependent on me for transportation, which neither of us like the idea of. Meanwhile I have a license, a car, and I grew up in a rural area.

Neither of us know what she'll do if I move without her. She doesn't want to go to grad school, she doesn't want to move with me. My guess is that if she doesn't come up with a plan she'll end up moving back in with her abusive mother. I think she's aware of that but just doesn't want to think about it.

I'm not budging on my position for moving. I'm going to go with or without her, it just hurts to think about not living together for an extended period of time (I plan to live there for 5-6 years). I'm also scared of the distance not working. I've tried it twice before 2/2 it doesn't work. 1st one cheated, 2nd one was tensions that tore everything apart. It's frightening to think about my longest and most serious relationship possibly ending for the same reason.

I don't even know what sort of advice I'm asking for here. Anything that helps ease my nerves I guess. Something to help convince her to move? Steps we could take to make her more comfortable moving to Kansas with me? Or should I just accept the possibility of separation?
Sorry for the wall of text. Thank you.

61,"     Posting here cause I'm not too sure where else to go. So basically, my girlfriend has been acting somewhat distant for about the past week, and I'm not too sure why. Oh and before I continue, I should mention that we're both in high school. By ""acting somewhat distant"" I mean rather than having the fun, playful texting conversations that we had not too long ago and all the way back to the beginning of our relationship, (We have been dating for a bit more than two months) I've noticed that it's more of a one sided conversation, with me doing all of the talking. She will often only use short responses that make it hard to carry on a good conversation. 
   Other than that, I've noticed that over the past couple of days she has seemed not like her usual self. We were texting on Monday night, and she told me that she was crying, so naturally I asked her if everything was alright. She said no, and when I asked her specifically what was wrong, she told me that she couldn't talk about it. I told her that was okay, and if she decided that she was ready to tell me what was wrong she could, whenever that may be. 
   Anyways, here's where I need advice. She has started snapchatting this guy again, who we'll call K. She and K had a thing for about a week several months ago, and that was that. I'm not too sure how or why it ended, but I do know that K, one of K's friends, and my girlfriend were in a car, when K moved from the front seat to the back seat and grabbed her thigh, and put his hand up her shirt. This was also several months ago. When I expressed my dislike for this on Monday during our texting conversation, she told me to ""Not worry about it"" and that ""It was fine"". 
   She knows that I don't like K, for many other reasons than this. I don't want to tell her who she can and can't be friends with, but I don't like the idea of her associating with K at all. We were hanging out today, and I noticed while she was holding her phone that she got a Snapchat from K. She flipped her phone over to hide it, I assume, which worries me. If they were just friends then why would she try to hide it? 
   My girlfriend has also told me that K will frequently tell her that he likes her, to which she responds with ""I have a boyfriend"", and he replies with ""Ok"", or something to that extent. This whole thing is making me very anxious/stressed, and I don't know what to do. What should I say to my girlfriend about this? I apologize if my formatting is off or if my thoughts are disorganized, I'm on mobile. Thanks in advance.

62,"So a few months ago, my best friend (let's call her Sarah) dumbed her ex (let's call him John.) She was just not feeling anything for him anymore, and just generally irritated by him. Understandable. Still, she feels like shit for a while, but eventually, she's over him. I had no idea about him cheating up until then.

Three weeks ago, I learn that John had cheated up to 6 times on Sarah. Not only that, all his roommates who are also friends with Sarah to a certain extent, know. At first I was like, there's no reason to tell her. They're already separated, and it'll break her heart for nothing. So I decided to keep it to myself.

But recently, they started fucking again. They both agreed they don't want a relationship, and just to fuck. And she's cool with that arrangement.

...Except she doesn't know the cunt cheated on her with 6 different girls! Should I tell her? God, how do I even go about telling her something like that? :(",27Apr2017,0
66,"So im gonna try to make this as short as possible, sorry if its not.

So a few years ago I moved from one end of the country to the other because I am a snowboarder/mountain biker and the mountain are the best in the country and by quite a lot. When I moved I knew i was not gonna go back home ever because this was my second time moving and I was done with the back home lifestyle.
 Fast forward 5 years and I have been laid off from my initial well paying job and have been struggling with money ever since ( for the last 2 years now). The town where I live is so expensive I can barely save any money every month ( about 200$ a month) and every time I have a bit saved up something pops up with my car or bike and then I start from scratch again. 

Where it gets complicated is here.
My brother lives closes to where I am right now and my parents are moving next month as well because they cant deal with not seeing their children anymore. My girlfriend that I met here and have been with her for the last few years decided out of the blue that she was moving closer to her family ( a couple hours from my hometown). Now my dilemma is do I stay here and struggle with money (its a small town there is not much job) but do the stuff that I love and be with my family or go back home where it is much cheaper to live and stay with my girlfriend ( we were planning on having kid soonish).

My personal opinion would be to move back home with my gf to try to get my life together but I am not sure I could live with seeing my fam only once a year or 2 year.

If you were in my situation , what would be your thoughts, how would you proceed with the pros and cons?

Everyone I ask just tells me to do what will make me happy but the thing is I got no idea which one will make me happier.

We have been together 6 1/2 years, married 1 1/2 and have 2 children ages 27mos and 5mos. He cheated on me a TON before we had kids and got married, but I always cared so much about him and could never walk away (I think because I didn't value myself). When I found out I was pregnant with our son, we were in a bad place and I was prepared to do everything on my own because I have a great job and support system and really didn't necessarily need him for anything. I never used the baby as some women do to convince him to stay by denying him rights or anything like that, he just decided he wanted to be with me and then we got married when my son was 7 months. We have had our share of arguments but never over money or taking care of the kids, etc. I've had a lot of post partum depression/anxiety after both pregnancies and know that I am sometimes not the easiest to deal with, but I have been getting myself help because I want to be the best mother and wife I can be. I never ever check his stuff, haven't in years, and he doesn't have a lock on his phone, but over the last few months I've been having a weird feeling in the pit of my stomach. Today, after looking through the computer history, I stumbled on his Reddit account and he was still logged in, so I went snooping a little. A month ago, he posted a response on the topic of ""what is something you need to get off your chest?"", to which he replied ""I've recently been cheating like a motherfucker... but it makes me happy"". After some more looking, he posted a question 9 months ago asking what he should do about another woman from his past he's always had feelings for that he hung out with recently but never got physical with, only cuddling. The few people that did respond surprisingly said to cut her loose because it's not worth ruining our marriage. Needless to say, I dug and found some awful dirt. I confronted him about it when he came home and he admitted to everything, that he hooked up with random girls maybe 6 times and each time was when he went out with his friends. The worst part is, I always felt on edge when he would go out with his friends because I know they are all cheaters, too. He apologized and said he made mistakes and will do anything to work it out with me... I just do not know what the fuck to do. I feel like if I stay, I'm a fool, but I love our family and thought he was my best friend. I feel so betrayed and don't even know what to do with myself.

73,"(trying to make this a vague as possible so I'm not traced back somehow lol)

I recently had a webcam interview for a digital media network and because of my passion to work there, I was certain I was overpreparing for it. Lo and behold, the interview was nothing more than asking general questions that felt more like small talk with a friend (""What are you doing after the school year ends?"" ""How are you going to get here?"" ""What stuff of ours do you watch?""), and never really dove into my own skillset, or why I wanted to work at the company. She asked about my own availability, and seemed reasonably excited about how early I ended school. She ended by saying that she wanted these interviews for the candidates so she could place faces to names, and we said our goodbyes. Because of the quickness of everything, my dumbass was able to ask a really good question about the position, but not ask about the steps following that interview. The company culture is extremely relaxed in comparison to other places I've interviewed at, so I've never had an interview that was so casual. What do I make of this? I can't sleep at night without thinking what I did wrong, why it was so short, if they liked me or not, or anything at this point to give me anxiety.",27Apr2017,1
74,"I was your average teenager.

I went to high school, had decent grades, then went to school for engineering. Then it started going down hill. I got kicked out of engineering (low grades) gained a shit ton of weight and my family life started going nuts. My parents are trying to start a new business and it's making me very anxious because they could lose everything. My dad would also randomly disappear (usually to go gambling) and wouldn't come home for 1.5 days. My parents fight, and my sister is 8. I'm concerned for her mental wellbeing. They're not abusive, they've never hit me or each other, but my dad would sometimes throw stuff and hurt himself when he's angry. It's heart breaking to watch. I'm turning 22 soon, and I want to help but I can't because I do school in a different city. I don't know what to do anymore. I couldn't even find an internship this year I'm drowning in student debt and everything I've tried has been going to shit. I'm in my 4th year of university but I still don't know what I want to do for a career. I'm scared that being kicked out of engineering means that I'll never be able to find a job. 

I'm very ambitious, I want to have a nice house, a nice car, and to be able to go on yearly vacations, but I'm scared that I'll never get to that point. I feel trapped and helpless. I wanna help my parents but they don't want my help, they want me to do well in school and would constantly worry about my grades and my future. I'm also scared of working part time during the school year, because I won't want my grades to suffer. My sister is my life right now, I love her so much and I want to encourage her to do stuff that I never had the chance to do. 

I've never been too scared to take risks, but ever since I got kicked out of engineering I've been timid. I feel like a failure and I feel like I shouldn't waste anymore time and money trying to ""better myself"". I feel like I should just settle for a minimum wage job to support my parents for a bit, but I also really don't wanna do that. I feel like I would be dead inside if I just worked at a min wage job for the rest of my life. 

In high school I got mid 80s to low 90s, but ever since then I've felt like a complete failure. I know my parents care about me, but this concern also causes them to worry, and get anxious. And I don't want to worry them, I just want them to be happy, but I feel like everything I do isn't good enough and this just makes them more worried.",27Apr2017,1
75,"So here's why I was wondering this...

During class I left 15 minutes before the class was over during my presentation, because I tend to be nervous for public speaking. I usually endure the nervousness, which I notice that I tend to stutter and seem very unprepared...but in fact I prepared notes before. But since I recently started smoking more, I felt weird today and was planning to entirely skip my part, but this urge of mine told me to go back and present. This urge happened right when I got into the door, and noticed everyone still in room, despite the class being over..So I decided not to make a fool of myself, and actually stay standing right next to the second to last person and present it. At that moment I felt like I fucked up. After the student ahead of me finished up, my professor asked if it was okay if I can stay longer beyond the class time, so I said that was fine. So I present my powerpoint to just my professor. When pulling the file up on the hip-hop powerpoint, he mentioned how I said I choose EDM for the 'get to you know' assignment during the beginning of the school year and the reason he choose my section, was because he thought I would like DJing, because he knew I liked EDM. And EDM involves DJing which is why he picked that section for me. He later mentions about accommodations to me and how I did so poorly on the test. His thought was.. because... [I scheduled a makeup exam bc I overslept on day we had the exam... and that I gave him a doctor's note for proof (photoshopped old doctor's note to new one)] ...that since I was in his office with just myself, and that there was a girl in the room playing the piano-- that he assumed because of my accommodations, I scored poorly on the exam which I did as a matter of fact. I scored poorly bc I barely studied. I didn't read the book, but briefly for 90 minutes I looked over the powerpoint and answered as many questions on the study guide as I can... I mean I tend to procrastinate on all my exams, I have a pattern for that. So I lied and said that because of the girl's piano playing during my test session, that I was not able to perform to the best of my ability. He sounded very sorry, bc this makeup was actually originally rescheduled, to another day for me. Reason being because he had to spend family time with his boys.. so anyway, I told him that it was truly the piano that distracted me and that was the real reason for my low grade. Anyway because he thought that, he felt like I deserved some extra credit.


So back story...

Back story: I have ADHD and usually I take adderall for class work. And I tend to live more in the future (because I am so driven for money), rather than the present. Anyway, I was stressed and was barely prepared for this presentation. So I decided to smoke some ganja which I recently have been starting to do for self medicating purposes (I don't just smoke to smoke..and those self medicating reasons are in times of very stressful situations, times that involve creativity where I have to a paper, or times of exams I find to be difficult). And I also took an adderall to help maintain my focus. I had about double my dose of adderall within a 4 hour period day. Anyway, so as I continue on my day's work ..things have been interesting after noon time (after my first exam of the day was over). So afterwords, I decided to head back to my room and self medicate to relieve some stress I have. So like 20 mins go by and everything just seems all better and I feel so much more in the moment. I'm far more social. I feel I can better observe body language and everything. I also feel like when I normally watch those 'wiki-how' how-to tutorials for any social situation really, is that I tend to not follow through because I feel I have the tendency to be a ""pussy"", not a no fucks given mentality. Currently high and writing this (this situation just happened)**


Unusual shit that happened today...

* A bee flew in my eye. Normally, I am aware of my surroundings always avoiding running into troubles.
* Had a deep conversation with my professor who thought I knew my shit and he offered me extra credit. Normally, I am quiet in class, but every so often I have small talk with my professors.
* People look different in my head. Normally, I am quick to analyze a situation and assume prototypes for objects I have seen before causing my observation to lack.
* I can better read people's facial expressions. Normally, I am quick to assume a situation of a conversation from another's point of view.. so I often times feel I am missing the 'icing' on the cake.
* I had a plastic thing in my sock... and its still there. Makes noise when I move my foot. Normally, I would figure out what was causing that and solve the problem so I can smooth rhythm.
* I was questioning my insecurities. Normally, I think about my insecurities and I research how to improve upon them, but I very rarely ever execute. While high though, I felt like I had the power to get rid of my insecurities, and If I wanted to work out and improve myself, I felt I was able too. While not high, I often say I will workout but tend to skip and give excuses.
* This girl I met at party...turns out she was in my class. And I noticed she as glancing at me a few times. I was far more aware than normal to pickup that she was showing Indicators of Interest (IOIs) with body language. I was truly in the present moment. Normally, I feel like I live in the future, and am constantly nonstop worrying about obstacles, figuring out ways around them.
* I could better analyze that my roommate had lied to me earlier, after I asked him if I could use his bowl to smoke out of. I asked him right before I left to take my first exam to leave the bowl out, and that he said alright he would and when I got back to the room, the bowl was not out in the room. He said he left it at his fraternity house, and that he forgot it. So I decided to make makeshift bowl out of a bowl, as I was doing this I asked him if he could get his bowl out so I don't have to smoke out of this makeshift bowl. He seemed worried after I told him I would just use the makeshift bowl, and he asked when I planned to leave. From my knowledge, he is a drug dealer, and sells various things. At the moment he has acid on him, and was saying how he could be fucked if he got caught, saying its like X counts of attempted manslaughter to possess this amount. So I told him about when I was planning to leave, and as soon as I left the room, I heard the door lock click. My assumption for him lying, was because after I smoked up a few days before (did the 'ol shower-steam trick), he mentioned how it smelled very dank (from the reminisce smell of the bowl) in the room and was afraid to get caught by the RA. Regardless if he has drugs or not in the room, the room is typically unlocked.. So essentially he lied because he was afraid I was gonna fuck him over this time with the smell. Normally, I would believe he was telling the truth.
* I could far better understand music. I feel like I'm complying to pop culture norms of what the artists are rapping about when I regularly listen to them. Normally, I listen to the rhythm and beats in songs. The lyrics are cool and such, but when I'm high it feels like I can fully understand how the artists have a dramatic influence on pop culture. For example the underlying theme in most music feels like it revolves around drugs, pussy, and money. And music feels like today that it is a huge indicator as to why young teen are focused is on this theme.",27Apr2017,1

80,"So I started working for this guy about a month and a half ago. I'm 21F he's probably in his 70s. At first I was just doing language tutoring but then he hired me to work and the money was really good so I accepted. He's never made any passes at me but he just kind of makes me uncomfortable. 

He seems to think I am always 100% available to him - like he'd text me the day he wanted me to work half an hour before he wanted me to be there- and often invites me places under the guise of work and then wants to go out to lunch or something like that, introducing me to everyone he knows, parading me around. Mind you he is married and I've met his daughter, who is 25. I recently quit the job but he wants me to continue tutoring him. When I told him I was quitting he seemed really upset, like wouldn't make eye contact with me AT ALL and asked if it was him, what could he do to change, would I be willing to come back after my life settled down etc. 

I'm uncomfortable with this but I'm not really sure how to communicate it because he's never done anything openly creepy towards me, it's just an unsettled feeling I have when I'm around him. How do I best go about communicating to him I'm not interested in working with him anymore?",27Apr2017,1

I really hate talking about myself in general, because I feel like no matter what I talk about it comes off as either bragging or annoying, since I am not insanely good at conversing to begin with.

I would rather just listen to people talk about things they like, or answer questions if asked most of the time.

What I do know

 * Tons of similarities in the design
 * In the senior design presentation they used the same animated video that the GrabCAD user made and called it 'THEIR' design
* They might have made some small changes but its 90% the same. 


I just don't want any backlash for reporting it and turning out that the it was okay-ed by the professor, which is highly unlikely. I was planning on emailing the professor and the dean, however, I am mainly worried about the possible backlash that comes back to me.


The senior design group who stole the design are not ready to be engineers and are not capable of being an engineer from what I've seen. I am just not sure what to do....

93,"Hey everybody, I am gonna be straight. I am a 22 years old university student with height of 6 feet. 5 years ago when I got into the university, I started having problems with how tall I am. Since almost everybody around is as tall as me, I wanted to be taller and began putting some 'things' inside my shoes and boots which damaged them but made me look 2-3 inch taller. Being taller was great but there were problems: My walking pattern completely changed and made me look like a disabled person with problems in the legs yet I was so happy with being taller that I didn't even realize how people see me truly. I was obsessed and even thought about height increasing surgery. Thanks to my parents, I've been able to fix my psychological obsession with my height and after 4 years, I got those things out of my shoes... At the beginning I felt short with being 6 feet tall and had psychological issues but those were the ones I have beaten. Lately I am suffering from back pains and watched a video about how high heels affect people: I think all those years spent with wearing those shoes filled and stuffed with 'things' to made me seem taller affected my skeleton system. I realized I can't walk in a straight position everytime. I am so scared. I think I will see a doctor but this scares me, too.

95,"I admit I have had some poor experiences with r/advice in the past so I'm using a throwaway account. If people decide to be cruel I'd rather not see the messages in my main Inbox every day. 


To put it simply...yeah...I failed university. And I failed *HARD*. I was diagnosed with depression and a panic disorder, my Father In Law died, I broke my leg, I didn't make a single friend, I was the victim of a sexual assault and my parents broke up. 

Then I had a work placement through the university where I was harassed and bullied by the woman who was supposed to be helping me. At one point she yelled and swore at me so loudly people from other *floors* came up to see what was going on. There were even times the bullying got...physical... But I'd rather not discuss that. 

 
It all came to a head when I tried to kill myself. I was on suicide watch for a week. I missed all my exams and the last two days of placement and couldn't get a redo. My friends and family helped me through and I got therapy.


But all that isn't really the really important bit. The important bit is that I failed and in the end I believe that's ultimately my fault. I should have tried harder and gotten help earlier. Before I officially dropped out I was put on academic probation my grades had plummeted so badly. For the first year and a half I was getting 7s and 6s. I left barely scraping a 3.


All of that is now in the past. It hurts to write about but the truth is I actually feel *miles* better now. I get regular exercise, I eat healthily, I make time for hobbies. I stopped taking antidepressants a year ago and haven't felt a need to take them since. I've started a small business and I have a really amazing job as a nanny, which I *adore.* 


I love kids and I especially love watching them learn. I think I'd really like to be a teacher. I keep thinking about it. I keep asking teachers ""what do you hate most about your job?"" to see if I can hack it and I think, with the way I am now, I can. I think it will be difficult, sometimes feeling impossible, but I also think with hard work I can do it. I'm currently doing some volunteer work as a tutor in English to get a feel for it and I'm really enjoying myself.

But I'm really worried my past mistakes will work against me. I'm concerned if I do choose to pursue this I'll be immediately turned away because of my shockingly low grades. 

Is this even remotely realistic?

97,"Hey guys. when I left high school at 19 (stayed for an extra year) I decided to not go to university for several reasons... The main ones being a few paralyzing anxiety issues and just generally having no idea what I wanted to study...

Well 4 years have passed and i'm now coming around to the idea of getting an education... My parents couch isn't exactly ideal and i'm starting to get feelings of guilt and regret for not going and feel like this is the time I should be going if i'm going to go at all.

Problem is i'm 23 and it's been 4 years since i've even touched homework or typed an essay. Due to that, my motivation to get work done has gotten really lax and... I know it's lazy to say... But even just the thought of doing an assignment fills me with dread since i've been used to doing no work for 4 years... I don't even remember proper essay format, how to type a thesis, etc etc... All the important stuff you learn in high school to prepare you for college/university, i've now kind of forgotten due to the amount of time that's passed, and i'm really worried that due to that, i'll crash and burn if I go to school. 

I have a feeling that maybe I can re-learn that stuff or it'll get jogged back into my memory once I get back into an educational environment, but nevertheless it's still a worry. 

What advice would you have for me to prepare before I go to school? Should I pick up a continuing education course at a community college to get me back into the groove of doing course work? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

I'm also a little ambivalent about what to study... I lack the motivation and drive and, quite frankly, the smarts to go after a STEM field degree... But that leaves me with arts/humanities degrees, which interest me! But which as i'm sure you all know, people have said are utterly worthless. I just wonder if it's even worth it to go if I know I wouldn't succeed at a STEM major and would get a degree that'll land me right back where I am now. Especially important since if I go, i'll be graduating at 27/28 when I really need to be getting a serious career...

So yeah, any advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you :)",27Apr2017,4
98,"I'm looking for some advice with regards to my Dad who has been on a downward spiral for some time and refuses to be helped. Anybody who has any advice to offer or has been through something similar, your input would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for such a lengthy post but I feel I have a lot to get off my chest and I want to give as accurate a portrayal as possible. 

When me and my sister were young, our family was as perfect as you could wish for. Mom and Dad took great care of us and were really great parents. My Mom is a teacher and my Dad had a brickwork company. We were fairly affluent, went on nice holidays and lived quite comfortably. In the summer holidays I would go out to the building sites he was working on and do some labouring to earn some holiday spending money. I loved that he was the boss and I had so much respect for the way he ran the company and seemed to understand every facet of construction. 

In 2007, when I was 16, the main contractor he worked for went out of business, refusing to pay him around £20,000 that he was owed and forcing him out of business and our family into debt. Since then, he has been on a downward spiral that seems to get worse each week. 

Almost overnight we went from comfort to struggle, as my Moms paycheck went into paying for everything the family needed as well as numerous legal costs, mainly from people who worked for him demanding payment, he ended up losing more than the initial 20k. He had a spell on benefits before taking a teaching job that was nowhere near as well paid but steadied the ship. 

Around this time, I was 18 and starting out in work myself, contributing what I could to the household. My Dad's behaviour became more and more erratic, nothing too crazy, but his personality was noticeably changing. He was becoming more and more difficult to be around, or to have a conversation with. Where once he was quick witted and switched on, now he could only talk about himself and would do so for ages at a time. A few years ago when my sister was at Uni, she called my Mom to tell her she'd won a local award for a piece of art she'd done, she put my Dad on the phone and he started with ""Well, let me tell you about my day."" He didn't even realise her good news until my mom told him a few days later. His dress sense changed completely, the smart shirts and trousers were replaced with those cheap, gothic patterned hoodies and jogging bottoms. 

He'd always had a couple of beers in the evening, but all of a sudden the alcohol started to really effect him, his eyes would glaze over and he'd become almost impossible to understand, my Mom challenged him on his drinking and he had a few months completely sober before one night walking up the road after dinner and coming back with a bottle of wine and drinking it, when questioned, he began to get quite standoffish. This became the norm, where he would say he was going to stop drinking, or stop drinking in the week, or only drink light beer, or only drink with meals, and every time would last a few weeks before going back into drinking five or six beers and half a bottle of wine. Throughout all of this, he was still up and off to work the next morning so as far as he was concerned, it was no issue.

Fast forward a few years, I'm 23 and in a steady relationship with my girlfriend. My sister is also in a steady relationship. My Dad is still in the same job, and I am now earning more than him. I am basically self sufficient and pay my own bills. My mom refuses to take money from me for living in the family home, but I pay for the family shopping most weeks as well as do all the cooking. My parents are still feeling the financial effects of the business going bump, but my mom is the one paying most of the bills. My Dad is spending most of his money on ebay. Mainly tatty jewellery and old CDs. The rest goes on alcohol. Whenever she calls him out on it, he becomes very defensive and complains to me and my sister about how she has no right to tell him how to live etc. etc. At this point I realise that she is rapidly losing patience with him. She starts going out with old friends and she loses a lot of weight, she starts to dress better and has more confidence. Though my Dad is only 8 months older than her, she now looks ten years younger and he looks ten years older. She tells me how when they go out with old friends as a couple, they are embarrassed for her as he gets drunk and his droning, self centered stories go on and on. 

Last year, me and my girlfriend moved in together. My sister was already living with her boyfriend at this point. Within a month, my Dad calls me to say ""She's left me"" I am not shocked but I'm upset, and I know that things will probably get worse from here. My mom moves in with her mom for a few weeks and my Dad stays in the family home. Six weeks on, as me and my girlfriend are going to bed, I see on facebook that he has posted a suicide note and immediately phone an ambulance to his house. Me and my girlfriend go into the house and the ambulance crew are already working on him, we follow the ambulance to the hospital and the majority of the family join us there. After an hour or so, we are allowed through to see him, we ask him if there's anything he wants and he says ""another bottle of pills"". I look down at him, he's drunk and he's wet himself. He looked pathetic. 

The next day I speak to a doctor who tells me he hasn't taken anywhere near the amount nor variety of drugs that he claimed to have. He is discharged to the care of his mother, and we visit the following night where he is calling it ""a blip, everything is fine now, I feel much better.""

I call him out on this, I write a letter explaining how selfish it was to essentially falsify a suicide attempt to make my mom feel bad. He shrugs it off and tells me that I can't begin to understand his pain. In the following months, my sister, still shaken by the events, distances herself from him and only speaks to him once every couple of weeks. I stick around for him and tell him he needs to go to counselling. He goes for three weeks and tells me he's cured. 

The family house has now been sold and he's spending his share of the money like it's going out of fashion. He fills his new flat with needlessly expensive technology that he doesn't know how to use and never will. He's going to the pub every night and getting drunk, but because he doesn't suffer from hangovers, he's still able to get up in the morning and go into work, he is a functioning alcoholic. When his other family members raise concerns with his drinking, he decides that he won't speak to them anymore. 

At the beginning of this year, me and my sister both lost our jobs. Her when the shop she worked in was broken into and all ""Keyholders"" were fired. Me due to the company I worked for downsizing. My Dad has been generous and I feel bad that I'm not in a position to refuse his support. Deep down he is a good guy but he has so many demons. 
In the past few months, his facebook page has become an echo chamber of his declaring ""Life is shit"" and ""I hate myself"". Whenever his friends comment or try to help, he replies with how getting drunk will make him feel better. Any objections are met with ""It works for me!"" I actually attended a few AlAnon meetings some months back, but found them overly religious in tone and also, he is a functioning alcoholic rather than a violent or malicious one as other people described. 

I'm not even sure that I love him anymore, he is so far from the man who raised me. I do care about him massively, but his constant moaning and refusing to make any positive changes, is taking it's toll on me and my sister. When we speak to him, either in person or on the phone, you know it's going to be depressing. Recently, he has started saying that he doesn't want to live another five years, which is horrible to hear your Dad saying. I'm worried that if I break off contact with him, I will be abandoning him in much the same way that the rest of the family has and he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death. At the same time, he is so resistant to any form of change and even those that he attempts, he goes back on within a week or so.

So that's my issue, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

103,"I'm sorry in advanced for the length of this post, I feel like I have alot to say and don't really have anyone to talk to. I'm currently 22 and have been struggling with social anxiety disorder and depression for as long as I can remember. I feel like I'm clueless when it comes to how to interact with other people.

I've been in a slump ever since the end of my freshman year of college and havnt really done anything with my life since then. I've failed out of college twice now due to my lack of motivation, social anxiety and addiction to video games. Frequently I am caught in a bad mentality that I am smarter than everyone else however I constantly feel stupid due to my social ineptness. To confront this I use video games as an escape to the problems that plague my everyday life. It's very hard to resist the urge to sit in my room and game 24/7. I feel very comfortable when gaming. Socializing with others online comes extremely naturally to me. I transform into a pretty talkative person when completely comfortable and that's somthing I really like about myself however, I rarely can reach that state of comfort around people in real life.

I believe a main contributing factor to why I'm not comfortable in the real world is my apperence. My checks are littered with an extremely bad case of acne as well as scars from previous outbreaks. My most shameful feature is my teeth. I have always been extremely lazy about oral hygiene and I'm really starting to regret it. 
I have reached the point where I have had enough. 

I currently have a burning desire to improve myself as a person. I figure a good place to start would be delvoping a good personal hygiene routine, the issue is I don't really know where to start. I'm completely clueless when it comes to ""common sense"" topics such as personal hygiene. I really just need a list of x, y, z daily tasks that need to be done so I can follow it. I honestly think I just need a ""Being a Person for Dummies"" book if anyone has any of those lying around.

110,"This is my first post here, so I'm going to try and keep it as straight to the point as possible. 
A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with depression after having a breakdown over being sexually assaulted. Around the time I was getting counselling, I began hearing the voice of my abuser in my head. I would constantly hear him say that I was a dirty girl, something which he had said to me growing up. Thankfully, after persisting in treatment and going on medication, I no longer hear that voice, but months on from my recovery it's still impacting me. 
It sounds stupid, but a few days ago, I was in the kitchen eating some fruit when a  family member joked that the way I was eating was disgusting. (I was chewing too loudly) Even though it was a joke, it still got to me hearing someone say that I was disgusting to the point I was very upset and didn't feel like facing college the next day. It's not just being called it that seems to get to me either. If I feel I'm not clean enough or don't look my best, I get paranoid that I am being judged and well up inside. It makes me feel unsafe if I don't look well enough and makes it harder for me to get on with what I need to do in everyday life. Even after getting out the bath I don't feel any cleaner.

I made an appointment with his principal to see what we could do at the school. I asked about his IEP, she told me they had exhausted his IEP, and then I asked what we could do next, to which she replied ""We have no idea how to challenge your son anymore."" Well, thanks.

130,"TL;DR - need advice on colleague mentoring a casual worker who reports to me and has been shortlisted for a permanent role with our company despite performance issues. Panel member may have conflict of interest. 

This is X-posted to r/AskHR 

Just looking for some advice on how to proceed with an ongoing issue at work (going for just over a year). It is quite complicated, but will try to simplify. Sorry in advance for the length.

Context - I am a manager of an events team, working in an open office with the marketing team. We work closely on the majority of projects. There is a marketing manager who manages his team within the same office. Total team members is 8. The marketing manager (MM) and myself have previously had a very strong working relationship and I previously worked under him before I was promoted 2.5 yrs ago. The causal worker is a junior (final year of uni).
Recently the MM has been distant, unreliable and having long unexplained absences from work 3-5hours at a time which is v out of character. 

Over the last 12 months...
- performance related issues were flagged with casual worker. Asked the MM for some advice as I had initially recommended her for a marketing role later down the track.
From this I decided to monitor and schedule a meeting to discuss performance with the casual. (Accountability for tasks, reliability cancelling/late for shifts etc) 

-  Casual worker work suddenly becomes model employee (lasts for 2 weeks)

- These initial concerns were also discussed with HR and we discussed options of rostering her out or performance managing her on a plan.

- Casual worker mentions in passing that she is V interested in a marketing role which is not yet available and her wording suggests she may believe she has the job (or is a V good candidate).

- I have a frank discussion with MM and ask  him if he has been speaking to my casual worker regarding her performance and if he had promised her a job. To which he responds that he has been mentoring her outside of work (she's interested in marketing) and had not promised her a job but felt she might be suitable for future projects. I was displeased/shocked but did leave it at that.

- I meet with MM a month later (after I take leave) to express my disappointment regarding the mentoring of my casual. To which he basically says nothing. 

- Casual workers shifts are reduced over Xmas period (as planned) and the next shifts she is asked to be available for she writes one week out stating her mum won't let her work as overseas friends are over. This is noted, MM is also made aware. 
The following day she contacts (after rosters are completed) and says she is available again. Shift remain as rostered but  she's put on call. 

- MM and casual worker seen out together often (music gigs, coffee, festivals)

- Recently I was not asked to be on the hiring panel for a new marketing position and not involved with short listing which has never happened previously. The position works on all events and event promotions. 

- Casual worker was shortlisted and interviewed despite performance concerns 

- MM is listed on resume as referee for our organisation and is on the interview panel 

- I have not been consulted at all regarding the shortlisting and became aware through another colleague. 

- There is a new GM &amp; HR manager. I disclosed some details to the HR manager just unexplained absences as well as MM mentoring employee. GM is unaware. 

Any advice/thoughts you can give is greatly appreciated. Happy to give additional details if needed. ",27Apr2017,1
132," So, the quick story here is that we just got a dog. I've had dogs most part of my life (30 years plus), but when we got home with the dog i instantly got a bad feeling. Regret. We have two kids at two and five. I work from home and my work is naturally suffering from having a puppy at home with me, but i should have thought of that before we got the dog.

So when we get back from the pond i got the flue. So now I'm actually thinking of faking an allergy to return the dog to the breeder. My two-year-old had some itching in his eyes but probably not allergies.

So i went to the doc on Monday to get a blood test, hoping it is positive. I've read you can have positive allergy test without being allergic.

The thing is, that I'm still considering telling my family it turned out positive even if it doesn't. I'm guessing my wife can't get my medical data anyways, and if i ask her to return the dog she will probably be more upset than if i just tell her i have allergies. We've agreed that we cant keep a dog if any of us turnes out allergic.

How shitty is this of me? My kids seem to love the dog, and my wife seems happy. We've only had the dog for less than a week, but I'm the one stuck with it all day :(

We have quite big financial issues and im working as hard as i can to get us out of debt, and the dog takes up a lot of time i prolly should spend working. The fact that i threw out my back sunday doesnt help either.

I welcome any and all advice",27Apr2017,2

136,"I (26M) have a wife and 2 kids am a year and a half out of college and worked all through college because we were surprised with our first while the wife was on birth control.  I won't ever complain about that because I love our son and I have family who really struggle to have kids, but it creates challenges.  

With that background in mind,  I got my degree in construction management while working as a project engineer for a small company.  I liked the work but my position was modified to accommodate my school schedule.  While I did like that company I decided to take a job in my hometown when I finished as opposed to staying with the company.  

My first project was on a data center build, and anyone who knows data centers knows that they get built ridiculously fast and the testing required for the equipment is quite extensive.  I was assigned to the commissioning team and loved it.  Only problem was I worked more than I ever had in my life including a couple 27 hour shifts because of test failures on equipment that needed to be fixed to meet our deadlines.  It wore on my family and once we finished the project I was approached to work for a family friend building high end custom homes.  

I worked for them as a laborer before I went to college, and they hired me on as the quality control warranty guy.  Well 3 months in and there are 3 less project managers than before and I am put in charge of finishing their homes and performing the rest of my duties.  It has been a year since I started and I am still not super confident in my position but feel like I'm doing a decent job.

The short of it though is that I have worked commercial construction (3 years) and residential construction (1 year) and I look at the top of both those ladders and I am not sure, based off what I have experienced and the stresses related with construction, that I want to climb up that ladder.  I also think it could be me learning to grow up.

137,"Have never posted to this sub, so hopefully I'm in the right place!

My partner's family have a house they want to rent to us that meets all of our immediate needs in terms of increased space etc on our current place/ garden etc.  They basically need us to rent this house so that they can buy another house so it suits them for us to do so.

A few weeks ago when the idea was still at the possibility stage, I was happy enough with the idea of renting the house but reluctant to rent from family etc and my partner said we didn't need to make decision too quickly because it was still just an idea that probably wouldn't come to anything.  Anyway, now the thing is moving forward and the family member who owns the house has started laying down excessive rules governing where my pets can sleep, monthly inspections, what we can and can't do with the house (that are more excessive than our current private rental) and I noped out at this stage due to the these red flags.

My partner then went back to the family member to inform her that I didn't want to go ahead, who then said she wanted to speak to me directly to sort out any issues.  I had already made my mind up and my partner made this super clear, so was a bit disappointed that she's now wanting a 'meeting' in order to talk through issues etc.  I feel like she's completely disrespecting my opinions and I don't want to meet her (particularly with all the family present) because I feel like it will just be her pouncing on me to make the 'right' decision.  I'm totally at the point of not wanting this house and yet still feel like somehow I am the problem and that the family are going to turn against me because of this.

Not sure how I should proceed, really don't want to meet the family because they can be quite persuasive and don't trust myself not to get pulled into a situation I can't get out of.",27Apr2017,3

143,"A number of coworkers have been assholes since I started this job, but two in particular have been getting under my skin the past two weeks. They're technically ""team leaders"", but I've been told in the past that we're all the same level at the company.

In the past, I would just ""deal with it"", not say anything, and eventually people would just... stop being assholes. For whatever reason, I usually get along with people, so it's rarely an issue.

However, this one coworker, my own ""team leader"" is about to push me into ""exploding"" (by which I mean, yell and curse, and probably quit or get fired).

144,"Every now and then I wonder if there's something wrong with my personality or my appearance, but I don't really have problems socializing (even with new people) and I get a fair amount of attention from the opposite sex.

However, I am pretty shy when it comes to making moves and I am also usually oblivious to people making moves on me. I think it's stemmed mostly from being an ""uncool"" nerd in middle and high school. These days people pin me as ""cool/elegant/intellectual,"" but on the inside, I still feel pretty insecure and it doesn't help that I constantly feel the need to hide my sexual inexperience. 

Pretty much everyone that I meet assumes that I have a ton of sexual experience because I don't turn red/freak out when they talk about sex and I'm reasonably good-looking, but it's actually the total opposite and on the inside I'm fervently hoping no one asks me about my love/sex life. Another part of me also feels like it's selfish to confess your romantic feelings to someone if they don't feel the same way and you'd end up losing a friend in the process (people say this doesn't happen all the time, but I've seen it happen to everyone I know who's ever confessed their feelings to someone who doesn't return them).

There have been times when I've felt very empowered about my single status, but lately I haven't been able to feel very happy about it at all. I've tried online dating a few times, but most of the guys I've met are either extremely awkward (as in I didn't know people could be so awkward until I started online dating) or they're kind of douchey and are more interested in hooking up. At this point I've just concluded that I suck at assessing people based on their online dating profiles. The dating that I've done with people that I've actual met IRL has been far more successful, although that's only been twice and it seems incredibly difficult to meet people once you've graduated college (unless you're into online dating, which I am currently taking a break from).

These days I feel like I'm running out of time and the next guy I'm attracted to is going to be totally turned off by the fact that I'm a virgin and have no relationship experience whatsoever. I don't feel like I'm immature, but I understand that I also haven't been in a relationship before and there's no telling what might happen once I'm in one. I've considered hookup culture, but I'd rather lose my virginity to someone who actually cares about me. I don't have any religious hangups and I understand the appeal of hookup culture, but I know I'd feel a lot better about having my first time with someone I could be emotionally vulnerable with.",27Apr2017,3

I understand that (in the US) I am technically protected by certain equal opportunity employment laws, and PTSD is a recognized disability for which I have plenty of documentation, but the fact is that it still feels very personal, makes me incredibly anxious to have to explain myself, and I really just want to work.

167,"My mother, who is a cat lover--truly, she is--moved recently to a different state. For years until then she hasn't been allowed to have a cat, and so her and her child (my youngest sister) were very excited to live in a place that allowed cats.

Because they're a bit on the poorer side, however, they called me and asked me to buy them a pet from the shelter. They rushed there to get a kitten they saw on the shelter's website, but when they got there, the kitten was just being adopted. Instead, they adopted a cat that was less than a year old while they were there. I paid for the adoption over the phone, no big deal.

Immediately when they brought the cat home they realized there were issues. The cat, while sweet in its own way, bit and clawed if you tried to pet it. It's not an asshole cat, exactly, just a rough player. One of those cats that gets overstimulated easily, you know? I do want to stress this cat is less than a year old.

A few days ago, my mother messaged me asking for a new cat for my sister's upcoming birthday. I asked what would happen to the old cat, and my mother said she would either take her back to the shelter, or find a good home for her on Craigslist. They just want a sweet, pet-happy cat that won't bite or scratch them.

I'm torn about this request. On the one hand, I do understand. It's not fun having a cat that's over-excitable, and I have grown up with cats that grow into true assholes--it's not fun. 

But on the other hand, it doesn't seem fair to the cat, who is--again--less than a year old. Most importantly, though, I don't want to teach my sister that lives can be traded like used cars. In all of my life, through all of the cats I have had (several--in the teens, maybe?), I have never given one up to the shelter or someone else because I didn't like it. It does not sit well with me to aid in this kind of flip-flopping.

And if I buy them a new cat but they keep the original one, there's no guarantee they'll get along, and there's nothing like a a tiny apartment filled the hisses of cats who don't get along.

But.. I do want my sister to have a cat she can cuddle with. I don't want her first ever cat to be one that may put her off of cats forever.

So, my choices:

1. Refuse.
2. Buy them a cat, on the condition they don't get rid of their current one for a test period. If the current one still doesn't get along with anyone after a certain amount of time, they can give it to the shelter or Craiglist her.
3. Buy them a cat, and they get rid of the current one immediately (or at their own leisure, at least).",27Apr2017,1

183,"I think being a doctor is so boring I want to slit my wrists sometimes. BUT I hope to find a way to make it more interesting. 
 
Some context:
I’m from Italy, here you become a doctor after 6 years of University out of high school. During the first 3 years you study biochemistry, biology, physics, anatomy, physiology and not much else, I actually enjoyied them. My 4th year I was in Erasmus, having the time of my life and starting to go to the hospital, but not much. My 5th we started going to the hospital more often (you don't do much in Italy as an undergrad anyway). I'm finishing my last (6th) year, and it's downing on me that I might have messed up by not leaving early following my gut instinct. 
I started the degree because I wanted to be a doctor and even if I was uncertain when I started, I kind of forced myself into it thinking that I would love the job as I would have helped people, studied the human body and thinking that becoming a surgeon would be cool. I had wished I would be the kind of person who would like to become a doctor.
Over the last years I realized I can’t force myself, but maybe I can still find a way to adjust the course of my career so that I end up liking it, or maybe I'm scared because I don't feel like a doctor and in a few months I'll be one, or maybe I really messed up and should have done something else.

My problems are:

	1. I feel like the job is 99% routine, it doens’t really involve much brainpower. It involves memorizing a ton of things and then applying them (of course being a good doctor is difficult, because you have to be good with interacting with patients, to diagnose them properly and fast and to treat them well and to memorize all this stuff. I’m just saying I don’t like it)

	2. The interaction with the patients are so superficial it’s terrible. You treat them/or even worse only a part of their disease (es the orthopedic operates you, the fisiotherapist afterwards will take you and another orthopedics will check you in a couple of months. At least this is how it works in public hospitals in Italy) and then send them on their way. The burocracy is enormous.

	3. Again, it’s not intellectually stimulating. Even if you impact your impact will be on few people, whom you won’t establish a relationship with (in 99.9% of cases), it’s not like you’ve discovered anything, you’re just applying knowledge that others have discovered.

The solutions I devised are:

	1. Can’t do nothing about number 1.

	2. Once I’m done with specialty open a clinic where I dictate my own rules. Or becoming a psycotherapist, thus following properly few people throughout their lives. These solutions solve number 2, but do nothing for the others.

	3. Trying to do some basic research, but for this I would have to move continent most likely, and I’d like to stick to Europe even if I’m not dismissing the idea, another hurdle is I have 0 experience in this regard insofar and pay sucks.

	4. Holistic solution: changing field completely. I’ve always loved math and tech, I love behavioural science and politics (but I would avoid trying to get into politics, maybe becoming a journalist would be interesting)
Should I start over another University?
Should I do an MBA and go into consulting/business/tech/whatnot? (that is mentally challenging and rewarding)

185,"I got a job a few months ago and immediately developed a thing for my co worker. He is not my boss but in a more senior position. He's married. He caught me looking at him a few times so I'm sure he knows I like him. 

Lately, though, he's been acting weird. He mumbles when I ask him if he needs any help. He also would ask other members of my team by NAME but never asks me for assistance. I got really sad and began to ignore him ever since. I think he senses that I get sad by this. He avoids me now and continues to ask help from other team members except me. He is doing it repeatedly I believe it's on purpose. He also still stares at me from afar. 
I'm trying to get over it but it hurts me. What is he trying to prove? I have never approached him nor did anything inappropriate.

Does he hate me? How do I get over him? Please help.

187,"I have a certain kind of fear that I experience frequently, and I was wondering A) if this is normal; and B) if there's a known solution?

Basically, I'm afraid of doing things I'm not good at.

Now, hold on, I know an obvious immediate answer is ""well yeah you'll look like an idiot, so it's a fear of humiliation by proxy.""

But the thing is, I'll experience this fear even with totally asocial activities done while I'm completely alone.

Here's an example.

I want to get better at Photoshop. Why? No pragmatic reason, at least on a conscious level. Maybe there's a desire to become a graphic designer buried in my subconscious mind somewhere, but I'm a pretty introspective person, and I can't see it.

Now here's another thing about me and Photoshop: I suck at it. I don't know why but it's just not my forte. The logic of how different features create different effects on images just isn't coming together in my mind, after owning a copy for like 2 years.

As a result, I actually feel a very subtle fear when I attempt something in photoshop. Actually, maybe 'fear' is overkill... Perhaps 'queasy apprehension' is more accurate. But I think the feeling is a sub-set of the 'fear' category, if one of the mildest ones.

The feeling is like... It's just an anxious feeling of wanting to resist doing the thing I planned to do. Fear is usually tied to a threat, but in this case, the feeling seems to be coming from nowhere. I'm a good enough self-observer to know that 'sucking at Photoshop' is what I'm afraid of, but what deeper motives is that linked to?

I can think of a few possibilities, but I can't really choose between them.


* Fear of loss/wasted time.

If you really suck at something maybe part of you thinks ""well this isn't my forte so doing it is costing me worldly benefits."" Like my brain knows at some level I don't excel at this, and therefore equates doing it with lost income. But if that's the case, then why don't I fear doing things that are just blatantly unproductive, like drinking?

* Misperception of risk.

Basically, the part of my brain that regulates fear can't distinguish between things that have real world consequences and those that don't. Unless I'm taking a purely recreational approach to something, my amygdala behaves as though it's the equivalent of learning to drive a car.

* Ego related fear.

Basically, fear of humiliation, only it's my own judgment I fear not that of others. Instinctively, this is the explanation that ""feels"" most right to me. But on an intellectual level it just sounds so weird. Your ego is so sensitive it's scared of ITSELF? It's one of those psychoanalytic things that makes people get all defensive and insist ""that shit doesn't work on/apply to me,"" like when people talk about how advertising influences you. If this is the root of my fear, then boy, I better hope I can find a good therapist, because this one's gotta be linked to some weird ass trauma.

Anyway, just my thoughts. Anyone else experience this? Have other theories? Have scientific evidence that answers the question decisively?",27Apr2017,2
188,"I'll start with my dad; When I was around 3 he left his job to pursue his own business, over the past 17 years he's had multiple construction based businesses that have been kinda succesful but we're still very lower middle class. He works at least 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. His employees are mostly illegal ""cash in hand"" people that have criminal convictions and are kinda dumb, these people usually last around 6 months each and he has around 2 at a time. He talks to his sister and mother once a year on boxing day and see's his childhood friend about 3 times a year (despite the fact that he lives 10 minutes away), and that's it, he doesn't ever go to the pub, he doesn't have any hobbies, when he's not working he will stay at home and search the web or go watch a movie with my mum. Occasionally he'll interact with other people, usually parents of my friends or people he knows that he has bumped into, or on holiday we'll meet people on a tour and he'll try and talk to them. I feel awful saying this but he is really unpleasant to talk to, every single thing he says is said in an incredibly condescending tone and I can see the person he is talk to getting quite offended. Also, his idea of a conversation is talking at the person for as long as possible without ever letting them speak and interrupting them when they try to do so- this is not an exaggeration at all, he will literally speak at the person and invade their personal space non-stop until the person leaves. He is also extremely unfunny, and not in a corny ""dad-joke way"", he steals lots of jokes from comedians (who's style is kind of offensive and arse hole-ish, jimmy carr, sean lock, frankie boyle etc), which results in awkward chuckles and silence and the people (who he is making fun of) get upset.
Now to my mother: She moved to England and met my dad who's shes been with since they were both 22, she doesn't have any qualifications but has been working in schools, warehouses etc. When my brother and I were in primary school she didn't work and used to pick us up and talk to the other parents there, she made a small group of friends who would get together a few times a year and she would go for walks with a few of them. She mainly became friends with the parents of my friends. When my brother and myself grew up things changed and we didn't need to be picked up from school, have sleepovers, or do play dates when the parents watched. During this time my mum would stay at home where she would watch tv or go on the computer (she is really quite lazy, even though she didn't work the house was always really dirty and messy), and maybe once or twice a week she would go on a walk with her one friend, Beth. Then she got a job in a school which she quite enjoyed and made another friend called Anna who she spent some time with. When mum left the school to work in a warehouse, she would meet up with anna and beth a few times a month. However 3 years ago they both moved to different countries, and I am not exaggerating, she has not met up with anyone since. She works 9-5 at a warehouse where everyone else is young and polish, and she gets back and watches tv or goes on the computer and occasionally goes out for meals and movies with my dad. She does occasionally talk to other people like sometimes parents of my friends, or people she's bumped into and she is very very awkward. She is perfectly nice and polite and not condescending or unfunny or nasty (like my dad), but she is really quiet and has nothing to say. My dad's friend had a party for his 55th birthday a few months ago, there was around 100 people there from his work, family, hometown, current town etc, and she milled around the party and introduced herself to groups but did not say a single thing when she was in these groups. Actually, we were in a group of around 6 and she tried to contribute to the conversation by saying something about butlins but she stuttered, and trailed off and it was very awkward. Whilst she is very shy and quiet and seems quite weak around other people she is not at all around us, I try to talk to her about doing things or maybe even going to the doctor for anxiety help but she gets so unbelievably angry and insulted each time. Both my parents think that there is nothing wrong with them and that ""this is just what adult life is like"", but surely to not have any other social interaction or meet up friends for years on end is not normal.
My dads work has winded down and he does have a lot more free time on his hands so they both do have time to do things. When my brother, mum and dad and I go out for meals it's so awkward because my dad is so horrible to talk to so me and my brother try not to engage him in conversation, and neither of them have anything to say. We went on a 4 day trip to france last month and it was absolutely awful, my dad is really really unpleasant to be around so no one (including my mother) likes being around him. And I can't carry the conversation with my mother forever.
I get so upset about this all the time, they are good people, (even my dad, but he has just forgotten how to be normal after bossing around dumb morons for the past 17 years), when my brother and I leave home permantely (he wants to move to new zealand and I want to live in either London or abroad), they will have no one and will be so bored and unhappy all the time.
Can anyone relate to my situation? Or offer any advice or hope?",27Apr2017,2
189,"Hi all, I'm 17 and about to go into my senior year. 

I've been in concert band since 8th grade and marching band since 9th. I'm very musically inclined and I've taught myself a few instruments. I can switch between and play three for my band, currently. 

Last year band was just not what it used to be. There was a lot of stress, less structure and discipline, encouragement to kids who probably shouldn't have received it yet. I know that sounds harsh, but the years before, our director would throw bottles and scream. It scared us into being good. This year he was just soft, so then the student leaders seemed to try to compensate, which basically caused it to explode from the inside out. It sucked really badly. Our show sucked, our playing didn't sound all that great. We made it to state finals (a tradition, 12 years in a row now) and got a low score. It was ridiculous. 

The band is also extremely rigorous and time consuming. Practice is from 1:30-5:00 pm Monday through Thursday. On Friday, we have a football game to attend. On Saturday, we have to go to competition. Sundays are our only day off of band, assuming we don't have a parade or another competition. 

I got a job between last season and now, so you can see my dilemma. I'm afraid that if I tell them I can only work after 5:30 (gives me time to get from the field to workplace) and only days I can work bigger shifts are Sundays, that I will end up getting fired. Even if I don't get fired, I will take a significant decrease in my pay check, making it much harder to save for college. 

I also have friendships and a relationship I don't want to sacrifice in favor of band. During band season, between practices and homework, I have barely any time. I have to choose between having an hour to myself or seeing my friends. It puts strain on relationships and makes it difficult for me to have friends outside of the activity. 

I'm torn because I'm very musically inclined and I love the experience, but it's getting harder to ignore how much time and effort is put into this. It's absolutely thankless. Nobody gets rewarded, thanked, or praised. I got complimented on my playing once last year. Once. After switching instruments and memorizing the entire show (we are not allowed to have music on the field). Some of the kids get favorited and groomed, and get praised constantly by the director, but I'm not one of them. The director doesn't  like me. I'm not sure that I'm willing to keep giving so much time, effort, and money to an organization where no one appreciates me. My best friend, the only other tenor sax player, is also moving away. So I'll be the ONLY tenor sax in the band. I fear that I will be walked all over without her there, as she would often stick up for me with our section leader. I'm afraid I will be lonely and bored. She's kind of the stick that's broke the camel's back and made me wonder about quitting. I have no other close friends in band. 

Before anyone asks, I can't do another option. It's either marching+concert or nothing, because our school is small. I can, however, enroll in a music class at a near by college which will be for one hour on Mondays and Wednesdays. I'm not sure which is the better option 

TL;DR - Band takes up 1:30-5 pm Mon-Thursday, Friday evenings, and all day Saturday. I don't want to cut my work hours bc I'm in senior year and need to save $ for college. My friendships/relationships outside of band are strained due to the lack of time I have to speak to them. Also, my only close friend in band is moving away. ",27Apr2017,0

I left that job, when an old supervisor offered me a position at another warehouse,jobC, that was smaller but was growing as big as the current warehouse I was at. That was my main reason for leaving, so I could learn more, and grow with the company. That company,jobC, ended getting bought out, and I was let go.

198,"I [34F] have been married to R [32M] for a year and a half.  During this time, he cheated on me with 4 women. 2 from Craigslist, 1 women that was an ex of his, and another women that was a co worker of his.  Needless to say. Our marriage has been rough.

A little background, I'm an accounting major and currently go to a meh school that isn't really a targeted school for accounting firms to hire from. Not to say that they don't but it's not like UCS material. Just like ever major your GPA matters a lot when recruiting with these accounting firms. My GPA is pretty average its sitting in the 3.5 to 3.7 range depending on how I do this semester. 

I've been fortune enough to have an internship with a firm this upcoming summer which is exciting. However after I complete my internship I have the chance of getting a full-time position for the following year once I graduate. Depending on the firm they usually take most of the intern class (last year I believe they took 10/15 or 11/15 students at my firm). I can't help but think I'm going to be one of those 4 students that don't get a full time position. 

My grades right now are very shakey, I essentially have to get 90%+ on my finals to pull A's in two classes. The only thing that sucks is that the material in one of my classes builds off each other and is only getting harder. Im unsure if I can even pull it off. On top of that my mentor says that not enough to stand out from the crowd and my full time offer dwindles if I do pull B's. 

I keep trying to convince myself that not getting full time isn't the worse thing but to me that's everything right now. How do I even change this mindset? It's all I've been thinking about at night and it stresses me out.  

This sounds more like a rant but I do want on advice if someone found themselves in a similar situation.

My situation is, I have a really good bond with one of my flatmates and I am unsure whether or not there is anything else to it. She does a different course than me but we both have similar backgrounds, very working-class and we have that in common. We both know the same things also, and we both enjoy the same things (mostly). Saying that, she is in a long-term relationship with someone who is also studying in another part of the country.
What I like about her is her friendliness and welcoming personality. She is really warm and when I see her I do smile. If you go on my profile, you'll also notice that I haven't had the best of years and I am going through some terrible depression at the moment. She, however, is a rare bright light. When we go out to places as a group, it is often me who looks after her or is just by her side mostly. I know that she doesn't want me to live in September (I am transferring) but she also doesn't speak about it much. I really care for you, but I've no idea how I feel.",27Apr2017,1
220,"Hello Reddit. I was recently accepted into two of my top choice colleges and I cant decide which one to go to.

College #1 is a super selective liberal arts school with small class sizes (~1600 students) in a rural environment. They are currently ranked very high and it would definitely be a reach school for me. My brother also goes to this college.
After visiting the college, I found that I enjoyed one of the two classes I sat in on, really enjoyed the professors, but did not feel as if I fit in with the students. My parents really want me to go to this school. 

College #2
College 2 is also a small liberal arts school (~2500 Students), however it is ranked much lower than College 1. They are in a suburban environment, and I personally loved the campus and the professors when I visited, however I did not get a chance to interact with any current students. 


If possible I would like to attend a college in a more suburban area with smaller classes, however I also want to get the best education possible. It has basically come down to whether I should go to a college where I do not fit in as well, and personally did not enjoy when I visited, however I get to live near my brother and get a good education OR go to a college that I personally loved, but would limit the amount I get to see my brother and may not provide the best education. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",27Apr2017,1

Earlier this year his grandmother, who essentially raised him and who he referred to as his mom, passed away. It was both expected and unexpected. So essentially the two most influential women who raised him will both be gone for mother's day this year, and for the first time he will not be able to call or celebrate with them.

I've had my experiences with creeps before, but there is a new one that I am dealing with now. I don't even know his name but he's in my last period study hall. I have this period every other day and we usually go to the library since my room is right next to it. I usually go to the back computer area to do my work or watch youtube or stuff like that. There are 2 sections of the computers, the right side and the left side. For some reason today, I chose to sit on the side with ""creeper"". Earlier on in the year, he would try to talk to me and ask what grade I was in and stuff like that, normal I thought. So today when I sat there he started to make small talk with me. I am notorious for being ""too nice"" to people because I don't want to appear rude or whatever, so I just answered him back. At first, I just thought he was being nice as a friend type of thing. He told me to sit next to him so I was like yeah...whatever. Later on, he told me I was pretty and asked to hold my hand. This is where the alarms in my head went off. It was weird for him to ask to hold my hand when we literally just started talking 10 MINUTES AGO. I was just like umm..noo. and he was like ok. But then he put his phone number in my phone and asked me to text him and I said I'll do it later (hell no). The whole time he seemed very awkward and ""off"".. he was just weird. Idk what to do now since I know I won't have to see him for much longer since we're about to graduate and I don't know if he'll be angry at me on Monday for not texting him back.

It started as general discomfort in my throat and mouth, and then escalated to pain with swallowing, fatigue, upset stomach, and swollen lymph nodes. I made an appointment with my doctor and she took a swab of the back of my throat. 8 minutes later, she told me I had tested positive for strep throat and prescribed some antibiotics. (1000 mg.) 

At first the antibiotics seemed to work: the swelling in my lymph nodes subsided and the pain in my throat lessened. Then suddenly, the awful feeling in the back of my throat returned after the fourth day. It felt and still feels like I have tons of popcorn kernels stuck back there. Also, my gums/mouth are irritated and I rinse and gargle with salt water every day, but the results are only temporary. 

Now, after I've just finished my course of antibiotics, I'm starting to get a sore throat again and runny nose and my mouth is raw in many areas.

243,"I have spent today listening to one neighbour playing his music at such an insane volume that I can't watch tv or listen to music in my own house, _across the street_, because it can't compete with his noise.

In self defense, a downstairs neighbour has begun blasting his own music.

I am very prone to headaches. I have one now, because of the noise. In addition to that, I work from home, and can't take meetings because it sounds like I'm at a party (I cannot exaggerate how loud this is). My SO, who was up at 4am for work, is trying to catch up on sleep, and can't.

I am at my wit's end, here. I cannot begin to convey how much this behaviour is affecting us, our sanity, stress levels, and life in general.

I used to go hide at a friend's house in the country sometimes, to get away from here, but she's been super busy, and I hate to pester her. I cannot get away from the noise.

The obvious answer is to move, but we can't - we keep going to see apartments, but we're competing with hundreds of people, and we haven't been able to secure a new place. To be clear, we've been trying to move for a year and a half. We have excellent references. I do not understand the problem.

The city will issue a warning in a few weeks, if I complain, and then a second a few weeks after that, but I go in person. Twice. The third letter to go out is a fine, but he'll just laugh it off, and not pay it.

The police come, but the music is always mysteriously off before they get here, so they think nothing is wrong, and it's just some crazy lady making problems.

I took video of how loud it was, but unless someone wants to talk to me and see the video, it's not going to help.

I'm losing my mind here. My heart won't stop pounding, my head hurts, and I feel sick.

I just want to quietly exist, and not bother anyone. I don't understand the kind of mentality that insists they are doing nothing wrong when they're interfering so much with someone else's life. When they're asked to turn it down, they laugh, curse me out, and tell me they'll beat me up if I bother them again.

2: she saw me, cornered me and wouldn't let me leave. She started grabbing onto me hard and asking why I hurt.

269,"I am currently going with treatment, and I don't feel depressed, or suicidal, in fact sometimes I feel so good that I want to share goodness with other people... Then I despair, because I realize everyone's life is sucking HARD...

Example: first myself, I am 29, live with my parents due to not having money to live alone anymore, no relationships (not just lack of SO, but I don't even have close friends, or reliable business connections), struggling to find work.

Then some of my college acquaintances (not really friends), are almost all unemployed, all of us have crushing debts (me included), some are unemployed AND have kids.

Many people I interact with also have parents dieing on them, usually due to cancer or old age, frequently these people STILL depend on their parents (like me), so I know people that are using 50% of their time to try to find any money, and the other 50% visiting hospital while their parents die, and then they somehow figure where to pull some more 10% to try to play games online or something, but end depressing everyone by complaining that when their parents die they won't have anywhere to go, having no job, and no income, and noone to care for them, and no parents income (since they are dead).

Or some of my older female 'friends', that found relationships, and careers, and now are freaking out because when they finally decided to have babies, it is too risky, or they flatly can't (one for example got sterile while she was 35).

Or younger 'male' friends, that have terrible lives in general, and also feel hated, they are hated for being male, for being white (even when they aren't white, see Brazilian university quotas controversy, where guys that have real black ancestors are not allowed quotas for looking too white), for being heterosexual, for being unemployed, for being 'young irresponsible gamers', and so on... And then when they try to find relationships, no women want them, because all they own are huge debts.

Of the around 200s people of my age I know more or less of their lives, I think only 20 own a vehicle, only one own a house.

Many don't have college degrees, despite going to college, because here in my country internship is mandatory, unpaid internship is illegal, and companies don't have money to hire interns, so they never finish their degree because they never find internship...

And the list goes, and goes, and goes... basically everyone I know are acting as if they have no future, I had people tell me they wanted to suicide, and I couldn't find a silver lining in their lives to convince them otherwise, they literally have no future, there is no housing, no money, no children (and the ones that have children are worse for it), no relationships...

In fact I see a dreading amount of people confessing they wish World War III actually happened, they want to see the world burn and turn to ashes, hoping that out of it something for them might maybe rise.

I feel fine, but I also feel I have to shut myself from the world, become oblivious and even more lonely, every time I interact with someone of my age, all I get is barrage of bad news, or fake good news (like some guy that posted on facebook he relaxing on a very nice pool, and later I found out he was an waiter at the hotel that has the pool, a very badly paid waiter at that...)

Maybe because my social circle is more educated than the rest of my country I am not seeing a drug epidemic or suicide epidemic yet... but only 'yet', the amount of suicidal messages are slowly increasing.",27Apr2017,0

Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE middle school. Ok, so let's back up. Last year I had 4 good friends. Unfortunately, my best friend (who I owe for helping me get into this group a long time ago. It's a long story.) went to a private school this year. The other 3 have changed so much over the summer. Now all they do is gossip and talk about who likes who. What confuses me more is that they gossip with these people that they absolutely HATED last year. I honestly could not care less about that stuff. At first I tried to fit in, but with the 4th quarter starting I decided I was done with that crap. I had these people that were in 5th grade with me that I was sort of friends with, so I became (and still becoming) better friends with them. This is working pretty well, but I feel like I have a lot of ok friends instead of a few good friends. In conclusion, There are two questions/statements I want you guys to answer. Sidenote: I have minor depression, mostly because of loneliness.
1: Should I go with the people that i know better but don't share my interests? Or the people who I “fit in” with but don’t know as well?
2.I just want help about my social life in general.

273,"If anyone here can just provide some insight into my situation, I would be more than grateful.

I don't have a lot (read: any) real experience with dating or formal dances or anything of the sort. I have a group of friends with which I am comfortable with, and while I'm friendly when approached I would rather not do the approaching. 

Anyway, I should start from the beginning. I've had somewhat of a crush on this girl in my grade, who is funny, likable, and loves music and theater like me. We've done shows together, and we've grown closer as a result. However, the catch is that there is a VERY high chance that we will be the lead romantic roles in our play next year. As such, I don't want to ask her to something like homecoming if we receive the roles. I don't want her to think that I asked her out/to homecoming as a result of our roles.

So, best case scenario, I want to ask her to this year's prom as a friend, and then maybe end the night by asking her out if it goes well. Worst case scenario, we go in a group of our mutual friends, no attachment to each other. Should I ask her as a friend? As a date? Not at all? Any advice at all will help me out a ton. 

TL;DR: Wanna ask friend to prom as friend, without ruining potential future as couple. Help?",27Apr2017,2
275,"My parents are doing fairly well for themselves I think as they are remodeling their home from the foundation up.  The way they are doing it that they are only demolished half of the house so they continue living in it and then will move to one side to demolish the remaining side.  I just found out today my dad is falling behind on some loans he took out for my sister's education.  I personally am barley able to pay my own bills and my sister is in the beginning of her career so we both can't contribute to my parent's loan.

Dad asked me to call them to see if they could reduce it but they could not and I haven't told him yet because initially he was told they *could* reduce it to $400 but after giving them a second call about not receiving an email about the forms he's suppose to fill out I found out FedLoans could only lower it to $963 from $1063.

I'm angry and sad that I can't help them and my sister is struggling on her own.  I'm not sure what to do..

278,"For my entire life, I have had to live with the daily struggle of procrastination, disorganization, trouble focusing, being distracted easily, having trouble getting school work done on time, and fidgeting. I also have some other struggles that I am forgetting to list. I have always had trouble in school. I can get really good grades if I really tried, but I cannot seem to focus enough to achieve that. I know I have stuff to get done, but I cannot seem to bring myself to complete it. It's either I don't even know where to begin or I will start, but not be able to focus long enough to get work done. I have trouble focusing in class and get distracted by the littlest things. I have trouble sitting down to study extensively for my tests. This is not just at school. Whenever I am told to complete a task at home, I cannot seem to get it done. I realize how much it would benefit me to get this done, but whatever I do, I just cannot bring myself to complete it. This affects me so deeply on a daily basis, and I cannot handle it all anymore. I want to do better in school. I want to get my work done. I just simply cannot unless I am really motivated. When I was younger, I was not involved in many clubs and sports, and had teachers that motivated me to do well through fun classes and easier material, so school was a bit easier for me. I was really motivated to do well, and I can only achieve something when I am motivated. Now, my classes are harder and less fun and I am involved in more extra curricular activities. I am really creative, so drawing and singing are my passion. I sometimes hyper-focus on things I have to get done for my drama club and choir, and have a hard time focusing on my schoolwork. I want to do well in school, but I get discouraged because I cannot focus, and there is no possible way I can focus. I wish I could learn easier and focus better, but I simply cannot. I have trouble staying on a schedule, and need things done a certain way for me to be satisfied. For example, my parents are strict about me completing my homework by 9;30. I have told them that I cannot function like that, and my homework is never completed to the best of my ability because I usually just do it the following morning, but they still make me do this. They do not trust me to get my homework done on my own, so that really stresses me out. I cannot function on a schedule like that. I used to stay up late to complete my homework at the last minute, and it was so much better for me. I actually completed all of my homework! I don't know what to do anymore. I am stuck with this daily struggle, whether it is ADD or not. I amp planning to go and see if I am right and get a diagnosis soon, but I don't want to talk to a doctor for nothing. I think I identify with this disorder because I have most of the symptoms and have struggled with this my whole life. I want to get on track with my work, but all of the ""help"" I've been given has been putting me through more stress! Does this sound like I have ADD? How can I focus more?",27Apr2017,1
281,"1.) So I've already boiled a big pot of water and let it cool off, then put a container of it in the fridge. It tastes funny though, is that normal?

2.) I saw online that it's apparently okay to shower and wash your hands with tap water that hasn't been boiled, and that boiling water is mostly for water you plan on ingesting (including brushing your teeth), but what about eating food with my hands? Will eating a bag of chips after washing my hands with tap water get me sick? Should I just keep a jar of already boiled water in my bathroom for hand washing, as inconvenient as that sounds?

3.) How long do these notices usually last? The message I saw told me ""until further notice"" but I can't imagine boiling water for both drinking and washing everyday for more than a few days. What's been your experience?

4.) What's the worst that could happen if these methods fail? I saw in a FAQ that it's mostly concerning for babies and for people with weak immune systems. I eat healthily for the most part and try to exercise at least a few hours every week. Am I still at an immense risk?

I've always been sort of a germophobe and learning that my own damn water is trying to hurt me makes me a little paranoid. Hopefully I'm just overreacting. Thanks for the help in advance!",27Apr2017,3
