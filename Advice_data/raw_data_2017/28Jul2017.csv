0,"It's been a year since I decided to take a year off and improve and discover myself and I feel I've improved a lot and now I just want to return to school and finally do something with my life.

The problem is that right now I feel like I'm not doing anything with my life and I wasting time. I'm currently not working but I was working right up to this June, so I want to take some time off and just enjoy my summer. But the issue is that ever since I've found success in losing weight (over 60lbs in 3 months) my supposed group of friends started showing their true colors and abandoned me. So honestly right now I'm not working, but not having issues with money. I wish to try driving Uber and meeting people when I turn 21 this august. And I have no friends to hang out with.

Everyday I would feel like I'm wasting my life, and that even though I've improved myself it just feels like I'm just being a useless person being at home. I just want to get out and do stuff and meet people. I have hobbies that I do everyday such as learning guitar and exercise but I can only do those things for about 4-5 hours a day, then I run out of things to do, and I get the feeling that I'm not doing anything. I constantly feel I want to meet people and I'm at that point where I wish I can go back to school already.... but school is still a month off. Is it weird I want to go to school?

Is there a way to get rid of this feeling of uselessness? I really want to get out but when I do theres only so much things I can really do, without any friends",28Jul2017,0

1. The survey takes a minute or less. 
2. There is a good sum of money in it for me to get response rate up to about 10-15 surveys per week.

4,"Hi all,

I am an engineering student in the US currently between my junior and senior years. Over the past few months, I've had what I consider to be a very successful internship at a small company. I like my bosses and my coworkers, and I think they like me. My boss has been strongly hinting that he wants to offer me a full-time position after I graduate (he's already asked me if I'd consider staying on with them rather than go back and finish school - to which I said that I would rather finish my school first).

Here's my problem: I would like to apply to other positions to see if any other options open up between now and graduation. I don't think I'd be unhappy if I did stay with this company, but there are a few cons to staying and I want to see what options might open up.

So, how do I ask my bosses for recommendations while also keeping the door open to returning next summer? I'm concerned that if I ask them, they'd consider that a refusal of a full-time position.

What do you think? I'm still learning corporate etiquette, so I may be making a bigger deal out of this than I need to.",28Jul2017,1

8,"My husband and I are currently in Southern California. We hate everything about it, but we have a lot of family and friends here. We have 3 young kids who are very close to their grandparents and all of our friends. My in laws drive me crazy but I'm very very close to my parents and sister. 


We have an opportunity to move to Oregon (our dream state) and my husband would have a much better job than he does now. We would be able to buy a nice home in a nice neighborhood, and in my opinion it would be a much better place to raise our kids. If we stayed in southern California we would likely never be able to buy a home in a safe area.

I feel moving would be the best decision for the kids and my husband overall, but it would be super hard for me. Should I just suck it up? ",28Jul2017,2

In 5 years, I'm going to move out. That pretty much means I have 5 years left of my parents. I only have 5 years left of the energetic people that they are and living with them until I move out and who knows when I'll see them again. The next time, it's probably  going to be when they are older and have lost their personalities. 

And then the one day they die, and I never hear another word out of their mouth again. I'll never communicate with them, I'll never ask them any questions I had.

22,"So there's this guy, let's call him John. We started dating 4 years ago. We dated consistently for 2 years until we ended things because we had a lot of issues. We have been on and off since then, however. I keep going back because I can never find anyone who makes me feel the way he does, and I know that's insanely cliché, but it's true. 
This April, we started talking again. He apparently broke up with this girl he was dating for a month or so, and claimed that he missed me. Things were going pretty well since then. However, he wanted to keep us a secret, claiming that it would stop any drama from happening between us. I agreed and like an idiot, fell in love completely again. He would only be willing to see me once a week, but kept talking to me enough to make me feel like we were together. He said that once we went back to college he would tell everyone. 
Well I just found out that he has been dating that girl that I thought he broke up with. They have been dating the entire time. And he just blocked me on everything. I tried telling her, but when I messaged her she blocked me too. 

I just feel so stupid. I feel used and alone. I don't know what to do or who to talk to, so now I'm here. I wish that I could make him hurt like he hurt me but I realize that I can't, and I was being played all along. How can I get over this?",28Jul2017,1

25,"Not exactly sure where to start with this. 

I just graduated high school, and I have no plan set up for college of any kind. I could have gotten into college, my grades were good enough, I had straight A's up until my last semester / last two quarters of Senior year where I began doing cough syrup regularly and just stopped caring about my grades. Even then, I still held mainly B's, with two A's, and one C+. I never really thought my grades mattered though, because for all the praise they got me, I never learned a damn thing in high school. I honestly felt like high school was the biggest waste of my life, but the outside world also frightened me immensely. I chose not to apply to college because I didn't want to gamble my entire financial stability and future on a degree which might not get me anywhere. No matter what advice I get here, I will tell you, I do not want to attend college AT ALL unless I know for a fact that it can be paid for with no loans or student debt as a result. I would pay for it out of pocket, if I must. But even so, I feel like college would be just as big a waste as high school.

I managed to pick up two part time jobs, but I quit one of them just today because the work environment was just not for me. It was at a restaurant and I'm just not the kind of person who can work in a fast paced food service industry job, especially at a register which is something I'm not good at to begin with. Not to mention the fact that I heard my co-workers talking behind my back multiple times, which angered and saddened me beyond possible belief. I was probably going to get fired soon anyways. My other job is completely different though. I work as a stock clerk and unload cargo, organize inventory, pack away product, and stock shelves. I'm actually really good at this job, despite my skinny body build, but my manager cannot give me that many hours per week. He has talked about giving me more hours though since he is impressed with my work. So, for the time being, I've been looking for another second part time job as a stock clerk (since I know I'm good at that) to help fill out the rest of my work week so I can get a steadier stream of income.

My parents threatened to kick me out of the house by October if I can't find a steady, decent stream of income. I've been wanting to put aside some of the money I make for music and surfing lessons plus gear, because I feel like my entire youth was wasted on focusing on nothing but school and other frivolous pursuits. I did do snowboarding for a while, and I don't think I would need lessons for it again, so I was thinking about getting back into that once winter rolls around.

Recently, I've begun attending church (by myself) as well because my future has grown quite hopeless. I've never been religious before, and I've lived most of my life as an atheist, but my nihilistic and amoral worldview has ceased to provide answers for me. Especially considering that I had to turn to the church after I contemplated suicide, seriously, for the first time in three years.

I guess the problem I'm having is that I'm at a complete loss for what I want to do with my life. I have no long term goals, I'm not exactly sure what the extents of my strengths are, and I don't have any connections to any industries, companies, or businesses. If it was up to me, I would just move to California and snowboard, surf, and play guitar all day but I'm sure that's more or less what most people would want out of life.

Not sure where to go, where to turn to. ",28Jul2017,10
31,"Like I said, he's the sweetest guy I've ever met. He's the only one who talks to me at work, he isn't uppity like everyone else at my job, and he gave me free rides home when my car needed repair. 

   I appreciate it but 2 months ago, he asked me if I'd be willing to meet him somewhere outside of work. I said yes because I wanted to spend time with him outside of work to strengthen our friendship. However, towards the end of our date (for lack of a better term) he said ""You're pretty cool, Cici. It may be weird to say but you could come over to my house for the night if you want. My roommate moved out so I've got a bed for you. I've got some old shirts if you want to sleep in those.""

   I told him respectfully that I was really wasn't comfortable doing that and that I wasn't looking for a relationship.  Every week since that date, he's been flirting with me. He's touching and rubbing me on my neck, he's playing with my hair, he's buying me perfume (We work at Bath and Body Works so we get discounts. He used to buy it for his sister), he kissed me on the forehead and cheek twice and when I tried to get my phone from him playfully, he bit my ear. I don't want to lose him as a friend and I can't quit my job because I'm living paycheck to paycheck at the moment. I'm so confused. I don't know what to do.

34,"My friend met this guy on a dating website where men pay women to go on dates with them. The guy offered her $100 to meet up and they agreed they would discuss each other's terms for daddy/sugar baby relationship. She is 18 he is 45. 

She had her friends drive her to his house where she met him for the first time and they went inside because he wanted to make her a drink before they went out for food because she couldnt drink in public. They ended up staying at his house talking for a few hours about what they each wanted and they both had agreed this was to be a relationship and he would not be paying for sex because that is prostitution. He had offered to pay her $2000 a month to quit her job and spend time with him.

He then asked her if she wanted to go upstairs and makeout. She agreed. They went upstairs and began kissing and he began trying to take it further to which she tried stopping by telling him ""no not on the first date"" and ""maybe we should save this for another time"" to which he kept persisting they should and continuing on anyway. She told him she wasnt going to have sex with him until their relationship had furthered and she gained more trust from him. He proceeded to place $1000 in the pockets of her pants claiming he would send the other $1000 through paypal once they met again the next day as he had requested. He then continued to advance onto her. At this point she began feeling very uncomfortable. She kept reminding him she would not have sex with him but her persisted in other ways. he stripped her after she had repeatedly asked him to slow down and through fear and intimidation she allowed for some stuff to happen. They did not have sex though. She would not let him.

So then her friends were back to pick her up and she left with the $1000. Before she left, the man expressed how he did not mean to come on to her like that and that he wanted a real mutually beneficial relationship with her. He told her he still wanted her to quit her job and be with him. She politely said she would figure out what is best and get back to him and left.

After that she decided he had made her feel very unsafe in the way that he did not respect her wishes as to not advance onto her like that. She blocked his phone number and deleted their messages.

The next day before noon she had received a text from an unknown number claiming to be someone who worked for the man that she had met up with. He claimed her worked for a collection agency, but not your typical licensed bond agency and that she should know where he was going with that. He also claimed that there would be no need to communicate with him unless he is told by his client that his challenge had not been handled.

My friend is now feeling very threatened and scared. what are her best options for reporting this and keeping herself safe? 

Will she get in trouble? Would it be more hassle for her to report it and hope he doesn't come after her or just give the money back? What complications might she run across if she were to decide to report it and if he were to fight it or threaten her? Or does it sound like a load of shit and she'll be fine? ",28Jul2017,28

From what I gather, he was a really good employee for a long time - got promoted to assistant manager very quickly and held the position for a year or so, but had one slip-up and slandered the establishment and was immediately terminated. He put in a good word for me before the whole thing took place though and I like to believe I made a good first impression with the staff there when I originally dropped off my resume and application in person a month back (also before he got terminated) - but I'm a little worried on how that might reflect on me.

So how do I approach handling the topic of his termination and my relationship both with him and the situation? Do I try my best to deflect any knowledge I have of the situation or do I explain that I understand the  circumstances and reasoning behind his termination and assure the manager that I ""won't make the same mistake"" as I now understand what they value and what they won't tolerate from their employees?

48,"Hello,

Just recently, I was having a conversation with my friend that gave off some serious moral implications. I like the guy, I really do. We've been friends for 3 years, and he's my best friend. I'd hate to cut him out of my life or anything. However, this is making me have second thoughts. 

Basically, we were having a conversation about a guy who slowly burned cockroaches with molten lava on video, and then he proceeded to upload it to YouTube. I asked my friend's opinion and he said he, himself, ""would love to do it."" 

I also asked him what would happen if he saw a burning dog, (in relation to the previous conversation) and he said that he thinks that dogs aren't important to society. He continued by saying that he wouldn't really attempt to save it unless he could assure his own safety by 100%. 
But he would find the burning, ""cool,"" and ""enjoy it."" (In his own words)

I was appalled, obviously. I didn't expect this. This is some incredibly crude behavior that completely shocked me. He didn't sound like he was kidding, and I repeatedly asked him if he was just messing around. He kept stating that this was what he thought, and he couldn't believe I was putting a dog's life on such a high scale. This is somewhat comparable to other conversations we had. Such as him saying he hates his dogs, or constantly complaining about people with different opinions than him. 

Should I be concerned? What can I do?

School starts in less than a month, however we were just informed that one class, Engineering for you Digital Future, is not going to be available and everyone who wanted to take it has to choose something else. We have a teacher whose taught it for years, and a lot of kids including me were really looking forward to this class, as the teacher is great, and this would be one of the final classes in the engineering academy at our school. 

My counselor told me that the reason they can't offer the course is that it was not approved by the Texas Education Agency, or TEA. I don't know why, and my counselor isn't telling me much more than that. I don't understand why though, as again the teacher has taught it for several years, and its been pretty successful. Emailing my teacher himself, he said that there doesn't seem like there's much we can do, except that he will try and discuss it when he gets back in. So I figured I could try asking Reddit, to see if any of you guys can tell me what I should try, or if I can do anything at all.",28Jul2017,1

Okay, so I have severe anxiety and I'm falling into depression and starting to show patterns of OCD. I have very low self esteem and I can't look in the mirror without feeling completely disgusting. Now, I have recently found that I gravitate towards abuse, wether it be physical or emotional, and I have even come to need it, if not I will abuse myself (I'll starve myself and then binge eat, I'll go for as long as I can without sleep, I'm filled with negative thoughts and often fall into self harm). Now I was never hit or yelled at when I was a little kid and didn't grow up in an abusive environment but still I often hang out with people that are mostly emotionally abusive (there have been a few times we're it got physical). Now I need to clarify I DO NOT enjoy it, but I need it. Please help. Sorry again for the length and I know the problem is kind of dumb but I really need help.

57,"I started seeing this girl and found out that before we were a thing she was sexually assaulted. I was friends with her at the time but didn't know it happened until months later. Basically she hooked up with this guy after a party I believe and then they fell asleep in her dorm bed, presumably naked. They didn't have sex that night, she is a virgin and I believe expressed to him she was not interested in having sex with him. However, she woke up in the morning to him attempting to have sex with her and she told him no and he kept trying as she pushed him away until he ejaculated on her. 

She told me that he didn't realize that what he did wrong and was upset that she said she did not want to see him again. I know who the guy was and saw him around campus quite frequently last semester. (this past spring) 

She is very upset about it still, obviously, and cannot stop thinking about it. She feels like it is unfair that he doesn't even realize that he traumatized her so badly and wishes he knew that she is very emotional now. She understands it isn't her fault, but thinks since he doesn't realize what he did was wrong she could have tried harder to prevent it. She also feels scared that she will push people away by talking about it too much and hates feeling sorry for herself about it. 

Is there anything I should tell her? I have offered her options like seeing a therapist, but does not think she would be comfortable talking to a stranger about it, plus doesn't want to burden more people with her problems. If it happened earlier in the year is it too late to seek legal action? (I don't believe there is a statute of limitations in VA for sexual assault) Also, if there is no evidence is it possible to seek legal action? She is very embarrassed about it so she probably wouldn't resort to legal action, but is there anything I can do, say, or recommend for her? I have never been in a situation like this before and I am not sure I am being helpful to her. Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks Reddit :-)

I felt very close to him and very comfortable around him. But then one day, like a switch was thrown, he started acting distant and cold towards me, but didn't shut me out completely.

He does still ask me to help him repair his car, but he no longer hangs out with me while I work.

I felt more in touch with reality.

75,"A couple years ago I really enjoyed watching TV series and anime series, but recently when I think ""I'd like to watch a TV show/anime""
I just don't really feel like it, ya know? I kind of feel like it doesn't really appeal to me anymore. In a way it's starting to seem a bit childish, in a way. I start to realize how simplistic and pattern-based a lot of shows and animes are, and I just kinda feel like my fire for watching shows and anime blew out. I also think of other things that would seem more appealing for me to do instead, for example, it seemed funner for me to write this and hear some of your guys' opinions on this, because tbh I don't know how to feel about this xD.

I was thinking it COULD be a good thing, maybe my interests are healthily adapting in a better way, but at the same time I was thinking maybe it's not a good thing, I feel like maybe my imagination is diminishing, or maybe I'm starting to become too serious, or dry, and bland. I kind of categorize fiction into something that isn't practical to some of the more important things happening in the world, I think that's it, it's a matter of practicality, but I don't know if that is a good thing or bad thing.

Ever since I learned about some of the more dramatic real world events and issues that are going on, and I realized that one day I could be someone who positively affects those events and issues, my dream was to become really smart and wise and good willed to do good in this world. I want to be a leader of the people that they can look up to and rely on and trust. I want to take the negative in this world and reverse it, to oversimplify it.

Anyways, that is partially what drains my motivation to watch things. But like I said, I have a bad feeling that it might be a bad thing. Maybe I'm becoming too stern. I feel like I WANT to continue to enjoy watching these shows, but it is kind of starting to seem like, ""why would I do this? I should be doing something else instead."" I guess it's starting to seem useless. 

What do you think? I want to hear other people's opinions. I'm asking for advice and help because I feel conflicted and I don't know what to believe, and maybe other peoples ideas could steer me in a direction I agree with or influence me with what they think.

So I'm moving back to college in a few weeks and I just learned the name of my roommate, figured I'd check him out on Facebook to see if I could get a decent idea of who he was before we met, or maybe start up a bit of a convo so we already knew each other before we met up. I go to look up his name and I was honestly surprised. The guy looks like he's in his late 20's or early 30's, and based on his profile he has a wife and 2 kids, one of whom is a toddler today(the most ""recent"" pic was from 2015 and one of the kids was a baby so I'm just making assumptions).

80,"First, context. Will try to keep it short:

 * Never felt real commitment since I always was capable of get excellent grades without too much effort nor having to study as most had to.

 * Got to School A, one of the best of the country in Computer Science, but dropped since I felt uncapable of keep the work because I had to commit myself to do so. It required more than just passing by or listening to the teacher. That was at 18.

 * AT 19 got to school B and to Software Engineering, but it never felt fulfilling nor hard at all and could pass very easily.

 * Got depression by being unhappy at school B, then dropped School B and realized it was not my thing at all. This was some months ago.

 * I'm going back to School A where I strongly think I can be happy with it since it fits me more (love maths and cs).

nbsp;

Now the problem:

 * I'm feeling insecure because I tried to read some math things and could not focus completely on it, while before I was able to do so when I was passing by in my way at high school (at 16-18).

 * I don't know how to solve the focusing problem, thus I feel scared about going back since I will need to do so. Today is July 28th and I will go to class at August 7th.

 * Strangely, I can focus on videogames pretty well. I can even focus on TWO at the same time (Summoners War (at PvP) and World of Warcraft/LEague of Legends) without problems and excelling at both. But for reading focusedly it's a whole new world.

nbsp;

What do you recommend me to be able to focus on the right stuff? The only commitment I felt has been through raiding at wow. Thanks in advance and btw I'll go to a therapist (again, went when I was depressed) to check this too but wanted some feedback about this (in fact it was kinda hard to focus on writing this at the little text box of Reddit, I had to open emacs on console and maximize it to make it easier).

81,"I was just let go form a temp job.  This happened several days after getting a mostly glowing review (which included being told that I have done the job better than anyone who ever held that position before) with a minor criticism about my attitude.  It seemed like I was coming across as being exasperated over the phone with coworkers when I was really busy, but the people I work for are really rude and snappish whenever they are tense...I didn't think it was a deal breaker.

I was let go today because I ""didn't seem happy at the job.""  I was shocked, to say the lease, I had had several interactions with my boss that seemed to have gone really well, and I was really trying to be mindful of how I was over the phone.  I did complain with one of my coworkers about some travel plans I was making, because they were really complicated and I was having a hard time finding decent flights.  We always had little complaining sessions about the travel planning, but I didn't think it was a huge deal.

I am going to go in tomorrow and try to talk to my boss.  Does anyone have any thoughts on how I can fix this with him?

85,"For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with annoying, often even exhausting, nervous habits. At least that's what I've been told they would be called... I've also been told lots of others have them. Thing is, I've never actually met any of them. At least not like I have them. Then again, everyone I know wouldn't necessarily be aware they're something I deal with, myself. But let me explain...

My nervous habits (""NHs"" for the purposes of this post) aren't totally involuntary, like Tourette's tics would be, for instance. They're more like biting your fingernails, if you basically HAD to bite your fingernails... I'm sure there will be a person or two who can at least identify with the idea of NHs, but I'm hoping to find out if anyone specifically identifies with, what I believe, may set mine apart from most's, and the subsequent reason I'm posting this query. 

My specific brand of NH-disease is that I have so many different NHs! And they start and end in completely random and desultory intervals (as in epochs of months to years at a time). I'm talking everything from those listed in the subject line, to like, exhaling forcefully to expiration... stuff that doesn't even have a word to define it 🙄... So as an archetype: I can have a year in which my go-to is jaw-clicking, and so I jaw-click exclusively when that urge to NH hits, and then it'll disappear for 6 months and I'll have practically no urges, then, out of nowhere, I'll start needing to blink quickly OR grind my teeth OR forcefully exhale OR any combination of those simultaneously, and that will be my NH arsenal for the next year, then they all disappear for 3 months, then, jaw-clicks make a return, with squinting in tow this time round! *Sigh*... it's gotta be exhausting just reading about it, no!? And so this is so on, and so on, and so on, for every year of my 30 that I have functioning memory. 

Luckilyyy, they most all can be done in a discreet enough manner when in public to satisfy the urge AND not grab the attention of everyone around me, thank the fkn lorddd, and since they're much more like biting your nails than a Tourette's tic, they can be intermitted when necessary. 

I just want to know, what are YOUR personal experiences with YOUR personal ""nervous habits?"" Do you even call them that? Has a doctor ever told you anything about them? Do yours hide well? I'm dying to hear from someone else because it's just not something you really get to talk to other people about...",28Jul2017,2
86,"What I'm about to say is not ""nice"" but its the truth and I want some honest feedback about it which is why I'm bringing it to reddit. 
My parents divorced when I was nine and it was my mother, sister, and I until we moved into a new house with my grandmother. So before my grandmother I was raised very lasize fair and given freedom to do whatever I wanted most of the time. My mother doesnt know how to say no. I was spoiled, messy, rude, and unfriendly.  I would stay home all the time to play video games, read, draw, and be by myself most of the time. I became very anitsocial.

Then my grandmother came along and she was the complete opposite of my mother, very demanding, bossy, cruel, arrogant, and ugly. I felt sick when I had to spend time with her. Everyday she would remind me that I had no friends and was an ""unpleasant"" person. 

So now I hate her and I can't bring myself to look at her. She is the ugliest person I have ever met (inside and out) and people say I look like her (yikes) but this resentment is getting to me. 

TL;DR: Please give me advice on how to forgive someone who bullied me all my life, who is still in my everyday life, and is just an awful person.

I sometimes get the feeling that I might be exactly like her which may be why I hate her so much. The things you hate in yourself, you hate in other people. So maybe that's why.

I am looking for honest feedback here.

91,"First of all, do not say or even accuse me for abusing my pet. I have no time for those over-sensitive animal-lovers who think even scolding a dog is ""abuse"".

I need some help on this; I have a small dog who has small dog syndrome and gets overly excited when seeing other people. I was walking my dog just the other day, and during that walk, she was misbehaving, so I had put her in a submissive position till she calmed down, which is rather embarrassing, because she throws a tantrum when she doesn't get her way. Because of that, it would seem like she was in pain, when she wasn't.

Anyway, at one point, this lady came out, and she started accusing me for abusing my dog. She even had the audacity to say I was holding my dog by the neck, which I wasn't at all. Of course, I tried telling her that I was submitting my dog, which she completely denied, and said I was hurting the little thing (she was having a tantrum because the lady was walking her dog, and my dog hates other dogs). At that point, I kept saying ""whatever"" at her while she was making threats to report me for animal abuse.

Moving a couple days later, the crazy lady confronted my family about it, and in short, she offered to help on how to train my dog properly, or otherwise she was going to call animal control and have them take my dog away. All because I was submitting my dog for misbehaving. While I appreciate her concern and offer to help, I'm going to reject it, because of her accusation and denial to understand what submission even is.

It may have not been the best tactic in that situation, but I was sure in hell not abusing my dog! And I'm certainly not those kind of people who would let my dog go crazy and attack other dogs and people. I'm not sure what to do. What would happen if I somehow came across that crazy woman again?

Recently, i just went to Korea to stay at her mom's house for 9 days with her. Before that time she came to us one more time to stay at our house for couple of days to see my family and her family in person. From there, i took her some places to show around where I lived and also talked. When she went back home, we stayed in contact. Her personality was adamant the fact that she needs to feel to get married as soon as possible because of her friends already getting married plus culturr surrounding it. During long distance, she would always ask approval by asking me if i loved her, which I indeed say yes. However, during that time I couldnt comprehend why she needed to hear that constantly. I have told her countless time that i dont think of any girl but only her. Also the fact once i first saw her, my thoughts about my dad setting up a blind date was changed because not only she was pretty but also seemed to be a genuine person from the inside. She's 27 by the way. And i'm 23. I also told her that we shouldn't rush things and if we care our relationship, we should just put it on auto pilot. I told her that you shouldnt be caring what your friends doing by trying to replicate their lives or be pushed to get married just because you're korean lol. I'm korean too however my korean isnt perfect but we understand enough to get our conversation competently. She later agreed to it. However when i visited her korea 5 months later, she would give me a completely different answer. Asking me when should I propose to her? Also she would be complaining about how i never called her alot during those times. I'm guilty as any man who just reads a girl's message and dont reply right away. Nevertheless, there are times when im busy and i know she's busy so i dont want to burdern her with texts and calls. Like i said i told her to take our time with it. I thought she was cool with it but i guess not. Anyway long story short, i decided the fact lets get married since i had enough interest in her to the point i want to be together with her. So we decided to get wedding rings ahead. Cost about 3500 in usd there in korea. The problem is my dad did told ahead of time that he had a budget in mind if we ended up getting like promise rings, which around 500 each for both of us. I told my dad about the news during my stay there. He was furious for not letting him know ahead of time or asked his permission. Also we worked things out and i guess the real reason he was upset because his older brother (my uncle) was in the hospit for critical condition during my stay in korea. Both of them were really close. Her and her mom felt bad because they thought i got trouble with my dad so decided to pay back for the rings in cash for me bring with me back home in exchange for the rings. However i decided to keep mine since i still loved her so she only gave her payment for her ring which obviously refused many times but she kept fighting me and she would feel more comfortable that way. Also day when im about to leave back home, she tells me unsure of this relationship and needs personal time to think about it. I told her yes in a mature manner but i asked her if i can message her from time to time not regarding her answer. She said yes. When i came back to united states, 5 days has passed and she calls me and tells me she wants to end it. Keeps telling me i would find someone else better in korean. I was very upset but i told her ""alright"" in solemn tone and just hanged up. After that incident, i was very depressed. I was consumed with anger, frustration, and sadness inside of me. This was also happening the same time thst my uncle finally passed away. I got to see him one last time in the hospital before he was officially deceased from his coma. 2 days later, i decided to send back my wedding ring and the gift she bought for me when i visited her there which was a $300 credit card holder wallet. During that time, it seemed a rational decision just to send it back. I know it was a quick and stupid decision because honestly i still loved her. Days later she calls me again. It was a typical conversation on how you been doing and all that. 10 minutes later she asks me about the ring. She asks me if im still wearing it and still thinking about her. Knowing that i was fucked, i tried explaining to her that i send back the rings however the only reason i sent back was out of frustration because of my recent uncle passed away. however she didnt understand that and kept telling me that you cant ask forgiveness for what you done since you made up your mind. However i feel lile she did the same thing by testing me with that high school bullshit of testing our love. But hey double standards right. Not only that, there was an incident that happened my stay in korea. There was a big bee in the room that i staying in. I was trying to find it still or swat it. Then the mother walks in. And as soon she opened the door, the bee stung her chest right away. I guess when i came back to the us, she complained to my dad that i didnt protect her from that. After that, my dad told me about it. I was confused why she didnt bring it up? Just to let you know, her dad passed away during her college years so shes very protective of her mom which i understand. Nonetheless, the fact she made that comment about me to my dad was very disheartening. She acted like i didnt want to protect her mom but what way could i prevented that. I mean i could have told the mom to not come inside but i didnt hear her coming in. Anyway after that incident, i called her 12 days later because she went out of country by then. Also same with me. I told her that we should try again but she just told me that she doesnt want it. I even told her that i would go to korea again just forgiveness and put the past in the past. Yet she still said no. Although i was upset, i couldnt understand her motives still after her answer. This is because she tells me that shes very depressed by seeing the rings everyday and the gift that she bought for me. Also she made numerous statements to me she's not a gold digger and was very adamant to repay the rings. In addition her family is wealthy so she doesnt need the money. Plus she also told me would i feel upset if i send back the gifts that i bought for her when she stayed in the us. This is because i was expecting her to send everything back. Yet 3 and half weeks passed and still nothing in the mail. Is this because i said i was going to go korea? Is she testing if im going or not? She knows i start school again around near end of august. She said no to me though. Im not sure is this is another test. What do you guys think?  ",28Jul2017,1
103,"I'm an 18 year old guy turning 19 this year and I graduated high school in May. I've lived abroad nearly my whole life even though I'm originally Canadian. I've spent my last 12 years in a country in Europe called Macedonia and I studied at an international high school doing the IB program. The whole purpose of me taking this program was to give myself better opportunities to get into college but unfortunately I made the decision to take higher level maths, arguably the hardest subject in the program. Unfortunately because of this I ended up getting a really poor grade in the subject (2/7) although I did very well in most of my other 5 subjects. I am by no means undermining the fact that I could have done better, but the course was seriously too much for me to handle and the fact that I had to leave the country at a crucial point of my senior year due to my grandma passing away made my life really miserable regarding HL math. I wanted to drop the subject when I realized I couldn't handle it due to the amount of work needed to be semi decent in it but it was too late for me to do so. I intended to study in Canada as it's my home country and I intend to live there and my parents are completely against me studying anywhere else. I had applied to multiple universities and received a few conditional offers and had already made plans to go to the University of Western Ontario but today I got an email telling me they are withdrawing my offer due to the 2 in math. So are all my other offers. So now I'm basically in a position where all of my friends are all going off to college all around the world with far worse grades than me (in Holland for example they only require you to pass the diploma whereas in Canada they set conditions specifically for required math which is my worst subject)  and I'm stuck here with no job (I can't work in Macedonia due to certain laws), no driving license (also can't get one here so I'm basically stuck home in Canada my house is in the suburbs) and no options for the future. This is seriously soul crushing as I feel like the countless hours I spent working on my assignments and studying the past two years (the IB is a two year program) are for nothing and I failed my only goal. My parents are staying in Macedonia until December so I will be staying here doing nothing while everyone else I know is studying and experiencing the college life. Making the situation worse, I also have to say goodbye to all my friends as we are all going to different parts of the world. I seriously don't know how I'm going to handle it. Any help would be appreciated.",28Jul2017,1

A couple of months ago my perfume wasn't on the shelf where it usually is, i thought it was strange so i looked all over the room for it. That was when I realised my brand new pack of earrings had all disappeared, the pack was still there but the earrings had been taken off. I decided to ask my boyfriends mum if she'd seen any of it and later that day she found out that his sister, let's call her Mia, had ""borrowed it and left it on her desk by accident"" - however she denied having the earrings. A couple weeks went by and I was looking for my shorts and couldn't find them so I decided to look in Mia's room. As i walk in i saw her purse was on the floor open and I picked it up and all my earrings fall out. 

Fast track to 2 weeks ago, I went camping for the weekend and came back on sunday. My hairband had broken so I went to borrow one of hers as she has millions and told me to help myself. As I was taking one out the packet I notice my brand new heat protectant spray sitting on her windowsill. 

2 days ago I went in there and saw my bronzer in her makeup bag and yesterday I found my highlighter and lipstick hidden under her duvet. 

Every time I spot one of my things in there I do take them back. Her mum has talked to her about it but she doesn't change. I can't lock my door because we don't have a door on our room and I don't have time to be hiding all my stuff before I leave for work.

121,"I recently brought the experience of Python apps to a department that has never had someone who can code before.  I saw several instances in which these apps could help the department out so I told my boss I could make them and they definitely bettered the department.

My boss just had her yearly review in which she presented my apps as her own ideas/development.  She even literally put 'coded by [her name here]'.  

So I guess at her review one of her bosses asked her to show how they were done to an exec.  So instead of having me show them my boss wants me to teach them just how to maintain/edit the code.

On top of this my boss has always been super strange in how I get assignments (as one of my apps does automation for the department).  If she gets a request she will BCC me on emails and ask that I do not reply directly to people who want it done, rather go through her.

So my boss wants me to do some overtime where I show her how to do it but I'm totally frustrated that I was given basically 0 credit for this so I just want to let my boss go to the exec training with no idea of how to do any of this.

God where do I begin? Okay. So we've been best friends for what, almost 3 years? And when we first started being best friends we were part of this group in school who liked fictional books and emo-ish/ punk-ish bands like Harry Potter, The mortal instruments, MCR and all that jazz. Of course, I still like those things but the group separated the next year and we went on to different groups and stuff, but Ivy was still my friend because we were on the same bus. So two years after the bookworm/emo group thing, which is now, we are still what she calls best friends. This was also the year that I finally realized what she was doing to me. I consider myself a very nice person to the point where it’s hard for me to say no unless I really can’t do it, and it seems to me as if she unconsciously takes advantage of my niceness. All she has to do is to say “insert my name, water.” And I would let her drink some of mine which now I think is actually pretty rude. All she has to do is to tell me to do most anything and I would most likely do it. She's said so herself that ""She's so nice you can ask her to do anything and she'll do it"" saying as if I'm a pushover. She hasn’t told me to do rebellious things except for that time she asked me for the items in a test I have and she hasn’t taken, and that got both of us into trouble when the teacher found out. Now the thing about Ivy is, she claims to have depression and has self-harmed because of a loss of a family member and some other issues. My parents don't really like her because of the incident, saying that she's a ""difficult person"" but also that I should be there to help her, be her friend, and at least keep her from committing suicide(which she had thought about before).

125,"I was living with some friends from August of 2016 to March of 2017, but I got accepted into a program to study at a school in Japan so I had to find someone to take over my lease, as the lease is for one year.

 I was always a good roommate, I did the dishes, helped out around the house, respected the rules we had set. We had fun living in that house together, but I decided to take this opportunity I was given, so I chose my one ""friend"" to replace me in the house. Let's call him X. I had always known that X was a little on the wild side when it came to partying, but he was eager to move into this house so I thought it would be a good fit. My former roommates asked me about X's character, and I told them what I knew. X had been to our house plenty of times for parties and hang outs and had never proven to be a problem. I was still cautious though, so I made sure to give X a firm layout everyone's expectations of him as a roommate, which he seemed to understand and willfully complied with. It was just common sense I thought. I vouched for his character, and made sure everyone was comfortable with him moving in. I trusted X 100%, so I guess that was my first mistake.

Fast-forward several months after I left, and the roommate I was closest to messages me saying that my replacement, X, was smoking in his room in the basement, which I had specifically warned him not to do because the way the house was set up, his room was directly below the neighboring units, and the neighbors were not very friendly. If anything, I had especially warned X to be respectful of the neighbors to avoid any problems. My roommate continued to complain that X had not respected my expectations of him, and that all of the other roommates were blaming me because I had assured them of X's character. This of course made me feel both like an idiot for trusting X, and even worse because now I am responsible for this. I sent X a message saying that I was getting flak for his behaviour, and he apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. I didn't hear anything for a few more months.

Yesterday my roommate that I was closest to sent me a long message which said, ""Ok. So I hate to break the news to you
But I think we have to kick X out of the house. [Roommate 1] and [Roommate 2] has raised concerns that he's still smoking in the basement despite us giving him several warnings. And they're pissed at you, especially [Roommate 1] because you told him all these nice things about X and how he'll be a good roommate.
And for this one I understand his concern, he has been an absolute shitty roommate, we have a house showing tomorrow and he just leaves fucking ashes in the basement bathroom. So idk how to proceed on this because I agree we've given him more than a reasonable amount of notice not to smoke in the basement but clearly he hasn't listened. It sucks that it has Come down to this but you've definitely fucked us on this one. [Roommate 2] is afraid that his US citizen status is in jeopardy if X gets him in any amount of trouble, and I don't want to get any shit from this either."" 

I feel like an idiot, and I am ashamed that I trusted X. I could never have expected such a level of incompetence from him. I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I CAN do because I'm so far away right now. I don't even know what to say back to my roommate because I feel like such a moron for trusting X. 

Does anyone have any advice?

in Macedonia there are no waiting times and you can get braces pretty much within week. But i can't stay here for year or 2 because of the visa.
ortodont also said i have to come to get them checked every month and its always better when the same doctor starts and finishes the job, because the results might be different.

For me teeth are really important and i would want to have the best results as possible.

Also staying in another country for month : I dont even want to go back to Estonia because i would have same stress again with people around me.

If i get braces in Estonia i would be stuck there for 1-2 years which i don't want to do.

Right now my plan is if everything works out : ill stay in macedonia for 2 months and then move to Bulgaria for year or 2 so i can get my braces done there. But at the same time i always wanted to have braces and i would love to get them as soon as possible. And also i don't know if bulgarian ortodonts have huge waiting lists like in Estonia...
its so tempting to get braces today in macedonia so im already ""progressing"" but damn visa issues :(

Taylor and I each have dogs. They are smaller dogs, both rescues.

Mine can bark sometimes but he is generally very good about making it outside to go to the bathroom and very well behaved a vast majority of the time. 

Taylor's dog was a dog who give birth in a puppy mill and she is very needy and requires a lot of care. 
Taylor went through a bad break up, has been going through a lot of mental health issues and illness and can't take care of her dog properly. I try really hard not to judge and I do everything I can to help her out - I suffer from mental illness too - but she doesn't seem to mind if her dog poops or pees in the house ever. She used potty pads for a while and still uses them in her bedroom (because Liz and I complained about them being in shared areas), but her dog will still habitually poop or pee in the bathroom, kitchen and living room that we all share. 

We have tried to talk to Taylor about this several times. She refuses to take her dog out because we live on the third floor of the building. She instead gets very defensive and upset and gets angry with us for not understanding what she's going through. Liz stepped in dog poo TWICE in the kitchen of all places and I have stepped in poo and pee before as well. She also tries to blame it on my dog who has very different sized poos and pees and the ones in question are definitely not his. 

What's worse is that Taylor is the only person whose name is on the lease and she considers it ""her place"" with us being her tenants really. So she doesn't seem to understand that we think we have a right to a place that is not fouled by dog urine or shit and takes personal offense to it when we talk to her about it. She even told Liz that maybe she needs to move out if she is that unhappy with it. To be honest i'm unhappy with it too and she knows that. If she made Liz move out, I'd go with her.

134,"So to recap, Ivy(not her actual name) aka my so-called best friend takes advantage of my niceness to the point where I once got in trouble for it. But until now I still let her do it because of my can't-say-no thing.

Continuing, this year I started to dislike her even more because a) She keeps on complaining about crushes, boys and stuff, yet she complains about wanting to have good grades and being a better student. Like, come on if you want to get high grades set your priorities straight and actually study instead of complaining about it and focusing on whatever love life you actually have...?! and b) She would ask me to wait for her so we could go to the bus together because she has duties, and I wait for 10-15 minutes. But when she waits for me, she actually doesn't and flat out leaves me after five minutes because according to her, ""she's impatient"". Of course I forgave her, I mean I'M PATIENT,  AND SHE ISN'T WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO??? Now to THE THING, the thing that's eating me alive. A few days later, I didn't wait for her simply because she didn't ask me to, but when she arrived at the bus she was mad because I didn't wait for her. It was like the time she started crying for some reason, and she ignored me for two days and called me stupid just for doing this funny bit, all because I wasn't there to comfort her that day. Oh I'm sorry I didn't know that friends are EXPECTED to do that and are supposed to be the only people helping you, not that I haven't spent the past two years trying to help you.  Anyways on the more recent thing,I said it was because I didn't see her and she didn't ask me to. But she said something I will never forget for the worst reason, ""I didn't even do anything to you yet you do this to me?"" at least that was the English translation. I felt very angry and frustrated because I remember all the times she took advantage of my niceness, the times she bluntly said some mean things to me that she never took as seriously as I did, and the times that I needed someone to talk to but she was never there for me. I thought that she would only cross the line if she said I wasn't a good friend and forgot all the things I did for her. But as my sister said when I told her this, she's already way past the line.

I just can't feel the friendship anymore and I felt like I spent most of it giving more than receiving. To Ivy it probably doesn't mean much, but this is eating me alive. I used to question if it was because I was just too sensitive, but I think we all know the answer to that. I want to let go of it and that we would just be those friends who meet in the bus and stuff. But I just can't get myself to do it. She still has her issues and I feel like it's my responsibility to be there for her because it seems like nobody else could. And I'm pretty much stuck in the seat beside her in the bus, so really there is no escape. I'm stuck in this lion cage until she moves to another school in two years and I'm set free. I don't wanna risk telling my parents either, but I feel like I should. I just want to worry about my grades this school year, is that too much to ask? ",28Jul2017,1

Some of my earliest memories from primary school are me arriving into school early and standing in the line refusing to walk around the school yard until my friends came in because I felt like I would be watched and judged walking around on my own. I could never stand up and speak in front of my classmates despite knowing them all well. I was reluctant to take part in all sports that weren't individual e.g. Soccer, basketball, tennis etc, all those team sports because I was always worried I wouldn't be able to play right or I would be hit with the equipment etc. I dreaded group projects with a passion or whenever we were told to ""pair up"".  


I never really thought much about any of this as I grew up because I just thought I would grow out of it, I was just ""shy"". However, now I'm 18 and I feel this is even more prevalent in my current situation. I avoid eye contact at all costs with most people unless I'm completely comfortable with them. I hate going into shops on my own because I constantly feel like I'm being watched and judged for doing something wrong. I feel like I can't function like a normal person in social settings and I feel like everyone is picking up on it whenever I go out. I blush easily wherever I go and if anyone begins speaking to me I completely freeze and don't know what to say back, I can feel my face flush and suddenly it's like all eyes are on me waiting for a response. Usually when I respond it can come across very cutting because it's panicked and I'm afraid of having to continue the conversation. 

A couple of weeks ago my mother took me grocery shopping with her for the first time in years and a similar experience happened whilst we were at the checkout. Her friend was working and he began to talk to me and I shut down the conversation immediately and just blushed. When I say I feel like my mother doesn't help this it's because whenever something like this happens she will usually bring it up as a ""funny story"" to family members and friends and if only further embeds the idea that there's something wrong with me and only makes me more self conscious when I'm in public. I said this to her last night and burst into tears as I did but she just reacted angrily saying I need to grow up and she wouldn't mention me anymore. 

It's gone beyond public situations too. For the past couple of years I've noticed I've isolated myself completely for reasons unknown. I don't reply to texts at all, it feels like a chore and I feel like I have nothing in common with anyone. I cancel on plans last minute and I constantly apologise but repeat doing the same thing. The only people I reply to are my best friend of 6 years and my boyfriend. Neither of them have negatively influenced me but it's just such a challenge to reply to anyone else and I'm always on my phone? I just ignore messages, I don't know what's wrong with me or why I do it. 

TL:DR; I think I have social anxiety and my mother isn't helping as she brings up how I act in public as a punchline for guests etc. I can't bring myself to reply to texts and I don't know what's wrong with me. How can I overcome this/ not feel so overwhelmed in public?",28Jul2017,2

139,"Should I bring a friend with me to Disney? 

My family and I are planning on going next year...We have been there twice, but it was a while back (i.e. When my sister and I were young enough to not remember ALL of Disney) further more, Disney has added SOOO much since we last visited. Given the long span of time between our last visit and next year (14 yrs)  Disney will be pretty much new to me so I am in no place to be an expert or a tour guide for my friend-But I know the basics and enough about Disney that there wouldn't be any kind of problems like getting lost of something... 

Aside from that, I want my friend to experience Disney World...She has never gone in her life, and, under given circumstances, probably won't ever be able to...Her personality and likes/dislikes match a lot of ours, so there won't be any kind of clashing-Diet, preferences, or religion wise...But, on one hand, that still doesn't mean that we don't have ""slight"" differences. But by no means severe enough to cause fights or disgruntled feelings. 

I just have felt such a desire to do this...After having a conversation about Disney and hearing how she would feel in Disney; my heart broke. It made me think back on how I got to experience the magic as a kid, and all of that other wonderful stuff in Disney. Secondly, I feel like she deserves it so much...Due to some things she has been through and is  currently dealing with. 

But here comes the selfish part of me, I guess...I want to make sure I'm not ""over romanticizing"" the idea, and I would want to consider how my family would feel. We are all very close to my friend, so it isn't like it's one sided...But as I always say, everything has its pros and cons.  

Since (as I stated previously) it has been such a long time since my family and I have visited Disney, we'll want to experience it to its fullest. And now we'll have to, in some ways, make ""a way"" for our friend. And not to mention, the possibility of (maybe whose to say?) doing some things in Disney that she would want to do that we could care less for. Lastly, it's an added expense. 

Then again, I do feel that it would be mostly a grand experience. Sometimes I think we are all selfish as human beings and would rather have things ""all to ourselves"" and not have to ""put aside time"" ""make an effort"" or ""share wondrous things"" with our friends...(haha I'm by no means trying to put everyone in the same category as me, I just got this from an insightful video-about how needy people aren't a problem). 

Anyways. Long story short, have any people out there had similar experiences? (Have been saying that word a lot lol) with bringing a friend? Was it good? Bad? Did anything go astray or not as ""planned""? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and for answering it. Sorry if anything is confusing in this post, sometimes I do a bad job writing my thoughts down! XD

141,"Life so far.

	First off, I will not be stating my own name and obviously this is a throwaway account. I will be calling myself “B” from now on.

	Ever since I was little I’ve been treated different, and I honestly don’t know if that sounds cliche’; as well as acknowledge that throughout this I may come across as naive, and again, I apologize. When I was born, my Father was a police officer in Northern California and my Mother a former Meth-Addict now reformed army personnel. Yes. This is my reality.

	My earliest memories are of living in the Avenues of San Francisco at the age of 4. My Mother was very tender at that time and that’s really all I can remember, I was the only-child of a rich white family in the City. I’m also told that from birth to about age 3 I really bonded with my Father’s Parents which is crucial later on.

	My Parents divorced at age 5 due to my dad’s early onset of clinically-diagnosed fibromyalgia caused him to get addicted to opiates. This is where it gets interesting. My Mother puts in divorce paperwork. My Father is devastated and goes to rehab so that they don’t fully go through. 

With dad in rehab, my mom forges my Father's signature on the finalizing documents and somehow gets the Lawyer to accept it without my Father present. There is however one flaw in her plan, but perhaps she saw it as a mere hiccup. The court date was set for after my dad got out of rehab. 

Dad is out and I’m just happy to see my dad, having not seen him in over a month. She says she going out with a friend and has my dad watch me at her apartment. “Where was she going?” The Alameda County Courthouse.

	My dad doesn’t show up to court. My mom gets mostly all his money in the bank and an investment property in Reno, NV. After this she fully separates herself from my dad and moves in with family in Orange County, CA and I go with her; my dad, left in San Francisco to deal with the shit.

	All statements up to this point are pure fact. I want you to observe them from a neutral position, this being the way that I view my very own life. I’m sure this this won’t be hard for you.

Years 6-11 “Elementary”

	Don’t like how long this is getting, so I will highlight the only 3 significant points of these years.

	In school I was the straight up outcast. Teachers and students alike had pure hatred for me. Thing is, I don’t hold it against them. I was a shit head. However, not in the typical sense. I just had unpopular opinions and preferences. INB4 HIPSTER. Seriously though, if you’ve been reading this far you must believe me a little bit.

	My mom starts dating and reproducing with a degenerate, pedophilic, Mexican Man. For financial support.

	The last thing to highlight is the tension growing between my dad and I, against my mom. They never spoke, their hatred flowed through me like a current of electricity. It stung.

Years 12-16 “Secondary”

	In middle school I discovered love, but that’s not necessarily my point. You need to know where my heart was during this period. Creative, Illustrious, Weak, Lovestruck, Fragile, and for most of this period, Broken.

	There are only 2 main things that need to be highlighted in these years. As devastating or liberating as these points of my existence may seem, I’m am honestly neutral in my response to them occurring in real-time.

	I became very creative at this time, and this of course led to rebellion. I would rebel against my mom at whatever chance I could. Like I said previously, I’m not cruel in my discomforting of other people. Only this time, I willed it.

	In my rebellion, I run away to live in Hawaii. As it turns out, between the divorce and my dad’s disability discharge from service, my Father managed to become quite rich. He knew of my frustrations and was ready and willing to help me.

Years 16-18 “Present”

	My mom ends up calling the cops on me for less than a joint of ragweed. So in her attempt to get her son a record, her son ran away. I took a GreyHound bus from Southern California to Sacramento. I then proceeded to fly to Hawaii (Island Unstated).

	My mom is getting worse. She flew her a year after I moved, uninvited and unannounced, and rang my doorbell for 2 HOURS STRAIGHT. The family of hers that I talk to agree with me and this is what makes me emotional about it. Instead of trying to connect with me, she tries to barge into my life and control me. This may seem HELLA EDGY from the surface, but I assure you the numerous other details and events in my life could explain my personality better than I ever could. But I can never disclose that information on here.

	Thanks for sticking through. Much love. 
	I never really used my name,
	~B

142,"I'm sure you guys get this one a lot, but here goes.

I do have friends in high school. I like to think I'm fairly popular about these parts. I get along very well with the student body and have my own large group that I hang out with, both at school and outside of it. I go out often.

But I feel lonely as hell.

I guess the problem with teenaged friendships (in high school, at least) is that they're incredibly shallow - you band together over a couple of shared interests and nothing more, a friendship forged in nothing but proximity and desperation to not be alone. The same goes for dating in high school - you date because they're nice to look at and you both like to ski, but the relationship offers very little depth beyond that. You realise you don't care about these people at all.

I guess my ""friends"" are more like playmates than real friends at this stage in my life, I don't really have anyone I share a ""wavelength"" with and feel lonely as a result.

Something I've been craving over the years of my high school career is friends I actually care about, I guess. Friends who are compatible with me in the long term, with whom I share more than just surface interests - beliefs, values, goals. I crave a friendship in which both parties understand each other in a deeper sense, one where you can be content just being in the same room as them and taking in their presence on a lazy Saturday afternoon.

I wonder if that's possible in high school.",28Jul2017,1
143,"So my brother three years again met a girl and knocked her up before he actually knew the woman.

In this time my brother did not move out with his family. It appears that they are trying to make every excuse to not move out possible. In addition to my brother acquired a dog against my parents wishes. My brother and his wife have not trained the dog. She is hyper and a large animal who doesn't know how to not jump on people.

Last week Marla jumped on my Mom who has very bad back pains. The dog knocked my mother down whilst watching my nephew who also was knocked over and my mothers weiner dog was basically sent flying.

Now my mother was screaming for him to come help her but he straight out refused to get out of bed.

148,"Hello Reddit!

Im usually a lurker but today I wanted to seek advise. 

I am sharing an apartment with 2 other people, we will call them Dillon and Paul. We are renting a three bedroom apartment. Dillon is in charge of Gas/Electricity while Paul is in charge of cable. Our lease ends August 1st. Dillon decided to move out early on June 27th because he wanted to move into his newly mortgaged condo. Paul moved out early on June 15th so he has his girlfriend could move into a new place together. This situation left me as the only tenant left in the apartment. 

Paul, the roommate in charge of cable, decided to split the last months cable bill evenly. Dillon on the other hand decided to charge me fully for the month of July because since I was the only one living in the apartment, I should be the only one liable to pay.

Although he makes a point, I told him that their premature move outs are no different that a roommate leaving for vacation for a month and electing not to pay utilities because they were not there to use them. The only difference was the timing of the one month absence. Further, Dillon did not let me know in advance which alters the payment plan (spliting evenly) of our good faith agreement. Also, whenever I use the AC, it powers the entire apartment and rooms that are not mine (since Im renting one room of the 3 room available) so the bill will be about the same as months past.

154,"Are there any lone wolves/anyone out there that can give advice on what the best way to spend time with yourself is? I've had a problem with hating myself,  getting too attached to and constantly wanting validation from others . For this reason I end up caring about people way more than they care about me. So I would like to know, how could I make myself happy by myself without relying on anyone else? 

Sometimes when stuff happens during my day, I always feel the need to share with someone, for   example when I'm excited or worried etc. ,but no one seems to care.  How can I be satisfied with just keeping such to myself rather than being like ""oh I gotta tell x,y and z about this""? I tried keeping a diary but it still does not take away that urge. Maybe it is because I don't value myself enough so I also need others to be happy for me to validate it. As such when i am worried, I look towards others to comfort me. How could I comfort myself without relying on anyone else? 

Finally, sometimes I really feel the urge to talk to someone, just about anything that isn't small talk or shallow. This mostly happens at the end of a long day or during times when I'm on the train, bus etc. just wanting to pass time. During those times what should I do instead? I tried for example, reading books  but It just feels forced when I am not in the mood. Should I just condition myself to get into the habit of it? Furthermore. to tend to this loneliness I recently went to friend subs on Reddit and tried to talk to people...and yeah, helped for a while but it's not a long term solution. The people I met from there just talk to me when they have problem or are bored. 

Also incase it is brought up, yes I do have hobbies but I can't be doing those 24/7.

159,"I'll start with the biggest issues first, and make my way down. Or just list the ones I have on my mind now and remember the others as I go on.

When it comes to things I love, things I would normally be excited to do, like watch a movie or play a favorite game or something, I find that I just don't care anymore. It's never based off of the quality of the event; it could be as simple as watching a YouTube video or listening to the radio. Or, it could be as big as not wanting to watch a DVD box I just bought. (If I do end up getting myself to watch it, it's usually just because I bought it, and I would hate to waste money. It's an obligatory motivation, not one I made myself.)
It takes me, literally months, to finally watch a reccomended show. Shows are my thing. But now it's like pulling teeth. It's a miracle for me to sit down and play a video game anymore. 
Going out with friends is something I do out of obligation, and is what I kind of make into a self healing process for my motivation. I try to let thier motivation motivate me. Sometimes it helps.

Sometimes my sense of caring goes out the window completely. I call them grey moments. Basically, I'm not happy, or sad, or anything. I'm just a thing that sits there and doesn't do anything. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I get terrified. Because I know the normal me would want things and do things, but this current me doesn't care about anything. It's a weird, scary state of mind to be in. It feels very dangerous, and I hate it. Because at the time, you feel like it will never go away. But you don't care. Yet the thing in the back of my mind, the part of me that knows what normal me is like, knows that normal me is terrified of this possible outcome.

Overwhelming pessimism. It's really, really hard for me to get on the optimist side of realism. I'd like to consider myself a realist, but I always tend to lean towards a pessimistic outcome when the object is about myself. I assume friends are busy, people are more important, and that situatuons will be much harder than they are going to be. I often assume any bad situation I'm going through isn't hard at all and that I should just be completely fine with any bad thing that happens to me, if I even allow myself to call it a bad thing in the first place.

The future seems bright when far away, but bleak within a months distance. Somewhere within me I always assume that the grand expanse of my future is going to be way better than now. But every day, the next day or the next week, just feels pointless and uneventful. I feel like nothing good can come out of the future that is close to me.

Even when I look nice I don't look nice. I can't convince myself fully, even though evidence by others and obvious looking demands the answer that I look fine, is there. And then when I look normal or less than great or tired or anything negative, I chop myself up to looking like shit. It's just automatic. 

I feel like venting or asking for help is selfish. I kind of even hate writing all this down. I'm assuming the responses are going to be either reprimaiding of my overexageration or taunting of my way of putting it. I assume the worst is going to happen. 


Usually my crutch of logic-ing the shit out of everything can hurdle most of this. But it's exhausting. I'm not sure if there are other ways of dealing with it. And I'm not sure if this is actually what depression is or if I'm just seeing this all incorrectly.

162,"I'm 23 and currently am staying with my uncle because I had to leave my mother's house again.

The first time I left, it was in the heat of the moment. I accidentally left the back door unlocked and as punishment my mother took my house key, telling me I was going to have to wait on people to let me in and out of the house now because I was so irresponsible for leaving the fenced in backyard door unlocked. I left for four days and came back only to have to leave again two days later.

My mom asked me about a $6.00 movie I rented off of direct tv, before I came back I had given her some money and before that I was giving her $100 a week I didn't think it was that big a deal and I jokingly said ""I already paid you for it"" her response was to get in my face (23 year old again) sticking her fingers in my face and threatening to punch me because I was so disrespectful.

TBH she does stuff like this to me all the time, forcing me to be home by midnight or I would be locked out via the screen door, or threatening to break my fucking fingers off because I turned the thermostat up 2 degrees....I told her the truth 'I hate you' and I'm only staying here because I have nowhere else to go.

She took my house key (again) and told me to get out. I left and went to my uncles. I thought everything would be okay there, I work all day so I only come back at night, and his only rule is to clean up after myself.

Last night he had to have a conversation with me because I borrowed my aunt's charger base to charge my phone (left mine at my mother's) the phone was fully charged, I just needed the base to charge my phone. But the fact I didn't ask first could have started something according to my uncle.

My family harps on me over petty shit is my point. I'm 23, I work full time, no kids, college degree, no boyfriend, I'm not trying to live like the rest of my cousins which is why I try to listen to people but lately I'm starting to see the shit they lecture and 'remind' me about (they say they are trying to help me) just doesn't make sense.

Not everyone is as laid back as me my uncle told me. My uncle borrows money from me regularly, still has yet to pay me back, but when I mentioned it to him I was wrong. Their are certain parts of his life he has to hide from me, nobody can tell me anything because I have an attitude. I take stuff too personally. People are trying to help me not hurt me.

I call bullshit on all of that. It's like their so damn bored that they look for shit to complain and harp on me about. People can cross my boundaries and take advantage of me but I return the favor and I'm wrong. I take stuff too far, but it feels like because I'm not letting people run over me or questioning why they can do it to me but not to them I'm in the wrong.

163,"I'm 18, and I have 2 paths in life that I'm interested in taking. But I don't know which one is the better decision. Both are drastically different from one another. So it makes it very difficult to ""do both"". 

My first one, is the down home. Family man path. I've always been a laid back, down to earth guy. And growing up my role model was a hard working in the factory, true family man step father. And while I lived with him and my mother that was probably my favorite part of my childhood. The only time growing up that I felt like I had true family. So that's one path that I'm interested in taking, I already have 1 foot in the door to this path because I landed a great job in manufacturing, as an apprentice, right out of high school. 

The 2nd path is saving money, then buying an rv/camper van. And living nomadicaly. This appeals to me because after living in that real family situation, I moved with my father and ended up moving around a lot. Which gave me some insight on the beauty of different places and people. I'm also very curious about visiting new places and experiencing new things. My grandmother always tells me she wishes she went off with her hippie friends when she had the chance, cause they all traveled the country and did cool things while she stayed back and raised a family. If I go this path I'll constantly be moving around living in my rv/camper. Getting new experiences every single day. It will be exciting, and exhilarating. It makes me happy to think about because it's like an adventure every week. 

So these are the two paths I'm having a lot of trouble deciding on. Because I feel if I choose path 1, I'll be happy. And it will be very meaningful and from the heart. But I'll regret feeling like i never did anything exciting or cool with my life. And then I'll feel stuck, And like I'm kinda boring. 

If I take the 2nd path, I'll gain those experiences and adventures I crave, and I'll feel true freedom. And it will be amazing for a while. But I worry that after a while I'll start to crave a home life and then have to put in a lot more hard work to start all over again from the bottom, instead of taking the early start I should have.

Social media, everything digital stresses me out. It adds extra stress to my anxiety and depression, when I feel emotions that weren't even mine to begin with.

174,"TL;DR Basically, I want to make more money annually and work somewhere that I have the option to move into higher-level positions. 

I've been working, happily, in the public sector since 2013.  My annual salary is okay for the area I live in, and my benefits are good as well, but nothing that can't be matched in the private sector. I like my job but there is no room for growth.  I work in a rapidly growing field with no shortage of available jobs that I am qualified for.  

Recently, one of my colleagues brought up that his wife just gave her employees each a large bonus as a thank you for working out some new, big contracts.  I asked if they were hiring software trainers and he said maybe, then gave me more details on what the benefits were like - company paid phone, company paid car, starting salary that is $13k+ what I make annually now, regular holiday bonus, etc.  So... I sent their HR department what was basically a cold-call cover letter and resume asking them to keep me in mind.  Within a day I had an email back saying that they were reviewing my resume, looking to expand their training department, and would be in touch with me.  I feel a little shady about it and I guess I am looking for some more outside opinions and advice.

My anxiety was horrible, my family berated me when I'd tell them I hated it, and I thought of suicide daily for a few months. Finally, I quit. A bit later I moved out to be with my gf. My anxiety/depression were still bad and I was hospitalized a few months later. After that, my family became more supportive and pushed teaching on me less. I still beat myself up for getting my degree and going into teaching. I regret it every day.

My partner is more concerned about me getting a job to pay my student debt and my personal bills. Which I understand. I'm now looking for a job, but my skills are very specific and my anxiety makes getting any job hard. I worked in a call center because they were there only ones to call me back and I will after a month. I tried to stay but being called ""stupid"", ""retarded"" and getting yelled at all the time triggered TF out of my anxiety. I was recommended I work I'm jobs like FedEx or UPS, jobs where I don't have to talk to people. They're great for the short run to avoid me going into collection it further debt, but I would like to find something that I like.

Unfortunately, I don't know what to do now with career paths. I grew up really anxious and not really learning a full skill because I was hyper critical. Drawing? I suck at shading and look Mary did it better. Baking? My father would say he didn't come to the US so I would have a low wage job that was hard. Those are some examples.

I attend a reputable school and have a good GPA, but I'm getting sick of doing the work (even though I study what I want to study, and no one is forcing me to). I've also been stuck at a boring retail job for a year now. My life rotates around school and retail. Nothing else.

Every time I try to improve my life in some way, I run into some sort of roadblock. Want to go out with some people? Can't, you got to study, or friends are completely booked. Want an unpaid volunteer position? Send emails and resumes, no one gets back to me at all. I genuinely feel like my passion for life has been sucked out of me, because I can't seem to open any doors of opportunity.  Some days, it feels like the universe is just barring me from everything. I feel like I'm wasting my youth. Worst part of this is that the best family members can say to me is ""But all young people go through this."" They don't seem to get what I'm trying to say. Then, they turn around a call me lazy because I apparently don't leave the house enough (I would if I could). The last two years of my life have been so unfulfilling. 

Has anyone else ever felt this way? What have you done to break out of this cycle? I'm tempted to start seeing a therapist, just so I have somewhere to go every week. I'll be doing my next college year as a part-time student, but I'm worried that I'll just be stuck at home doing nothing.

I lost my part-time bar job at the start of July and I have been looking for legal work ever since (entry level paralegal work) but I cannot find any. I have sent hundreds of applications off (LITERALLY) and every single one has been a rejection, I've had 2 interviews. I have a good law degree and have worked my ass off for it. During my studies, I worked two part-time jobs just to keep myself afloat. Why do I deserve this?

I've also out of desperation tried applying for part-time work again to no avail, most will not take me on now as I am ""over qualified"". I have one month left in this student accommodation before I find myself homeless. I cannot turn to my family for help, they're all extremely poor, I grew up in relative poverty and have worked so hard but at this moment I seem to be about to re-enter it. I also cannot go and live back home; it's simply not an option.

I have no possessions to sell other than my laptop, which I need. I have looked into selling it, however. I wouldn't get much. 

I had to put my masters on hold and take a 'leave of absence' from studies because I owe £4,000 in tuition (£2,000 already paid.) 

I have a credit card bill to pay too. I have had this credit card for a while and use it responsibly, I have always paid it on time and have built a good credit rating... however this is now about to get obliterated it seems, because I can't pay it. The minimum payment is about £50.00. My phone bill is £36 and I don't know how I'm going to pay that either, that will hit my credit rating too. Even if I paid both of them, that's £86 of that £228 gone, and it'll need to be paid again next month.

I really don't know what to do. I've never had financial issues like this in the whole of my adult life, I've always had an income. I've always had to work for everything I've got and I just don't know what to do.

I cannot rely on state welfare because I am still classified as a full-time student as I am on leave from studies, I therefore cannot claim anything. I can't rely on any friends for financial help either, they just would not do it.

On top of all that, it sucks seeing all these rich people in the news day in, day out, whose pocket change would wipe out all of my financial problems. Oh look, Jeff Bezos was the world's richest man for a day - how nice.

201,"Hey everyone. I'm just going to get right to it.

Background: 
I joined the RAF as soon as I turned 17 because the job I was going into (Sat comms, IT and some Cyber Sec) looked more appealing than raking up debt at Uni. I wanted to get paid while I learned a trade and gain experience and qualifications for my IT portfolio to benefit me in the future. 

Fast forward to now:
I've been in just over 4 years. And I'm not enjoying myself at all really. The social side of it is nothing like advertised, the people I find myself surrounded by hold very different philosophies than me and don't seem to enjoy things I enjoy. A result of this is that I often find myself alone more than I find myself in good company. 

I'm 350 miles away from home (about 6-7 hour drive away) which has somewhat killed away some relationships of my friends there, and it's incredibly expensive for me to even drive back to see family so I rarely do.

Other things are making feel like I need to leave, such as complete and utter job dissatisfaction, my boss is.. let's just say I don't see eye to eye with him. 

As much as these negative points are urging me toward leaving (I can, but would have to wait a year before I actually get out) I still feel like doing so could potentially be a bad move. This job pays very well. I've a lot of disposable income, I have the chance to get very good job experience in terms of network management and security. Free dental, healthcare, lots of leave to travel. 

I backpacked through South East Asia last year and had the best time of my life there and it feels like since I've got back it's really shook me how unhappy I am in this job. I think all it comes down to honestly is the fact that I am scared to leave. Scared of the unknown and the potential failure, not finding a job, embarrassment at potentially moving back in with my parents.

So I am flying from the UAE to USA (LA) which is a 17 hour flight in exactly 3 weeks, and I am PANICKING. 

I have done this flight many times before. I've actually been flying since I was 15 days old. At least twice - four times a year.

I was never afraid of flying until I turned 18, when I was in a passenger seat of a car with my best friend driving. She crashed and rolled the car, I felt lucky to walk away with no scars, not even a scratch. I felt fine afterwards and resumed as normal, but slowly I started to become afraid of planes, then trains, boats, buses, everything that moves now basically. 

I now get so scared on planes, I sweat profusely, I cry, I scream even. I truly believe I am going to die (I know, it may sound ridiculous to some of you, but honestly). I can't control it. 

I have tried drinking myself into a coma, I have tried prescribed drugs (xanax, valium), and I have tried some therapy. None of it works. My adrenaline is too high once I'm on the plane, I am wide awake, alert, and in flight or fight mode except I can't do either of those things since I am trapped. 

I have also gone out of my way to become knowledgeable on how safe flying is, how it works, the statistics of how unlikely it is a plane even crashes. But even knowing all of these things, it doesn't help. 

I have missed great opportunities to travel before because my fear consumed me, I have had panic attacks on the way to the airport and missed my flights. I have even cancelled vacations last minute because I could not bring myself to do it.

So here we are again...  I've got a 17 hour flight within three weeks and I'm started to have the usual nightmares and panic attacks before bed thinking about the flight.

I really, really want to go but I'm just terrified.. the last flight I was on to the US had an emergency landing in Iceland (wtf my luck), and then on the way back severe turbulence. I just about had a stroke then and there.

Does anyone else have any advice or tips on how to deal with this crap? Or is anyone else extremely afraid of flying and have advice on how they handle this stuff, what works for them, etc?

218,"It was hard to give this a proper title. Here is the low down.

My girlfriend is the manager of a bakery. She hires people, and she fires them.

Our roommate is one of her employees. They are best friends. They party together, drink together, and do friends/roommates stuff.

Anyhow, my girlfriend is leaving the bakery, and she has been tasked with promoting somebody from within to taker her place. This is an extra 20 thousand dollars a year in salary.

She has worked for this company for 4 years, but most employees just come and go after a month or two. The one with the most experience besides herself is her roommate and best friend. She has been there for two years. The next closest is a woman who has been with the company for 6 months.

Obviously, she should choose her roommate to take over the job. She is by far the most qualified. However, instead she has decided to choose the woman who has only been there for 6 months.

Her reasoning is that she could not possibly hire her roommate for the job knowing all the bad shit she does. Now, here is the thing, the ""bad shit"" she does is not that bad. No drugs, barely any alcohol, just standard stuff a 25 year old woman would do. My girlfriend on the other hand, does way worst things. She drinks way too much sometimes, and its not uncommon for her after a few two many drinks to go streaking in the streets.

The point being is that she only know these personal things because she is friends with her roommate. If they werent best friends then she wouldn't know anything about they types of guys she dates, or her family problems, or any of that. She doesn't hang out with the other woman outside of work so she knows nothing about her personally, so there is nothing clouding her judgement.

In conclusion, her roommate is the more qualified person for the job, and she isn't getting it, just because my girlfriend knows her darkest, dirtiest secrets.

I don't think this is right, because that is also a two way street. Her roommate knows all of her darkest secrets as well. These should not be taken into account when deciding weather to promote. Also, she's leaving the fucking company...WTF does she care? Help your fucking friend.

Anyhow, I tried to talk her out of this, but she did it anyhow. Then she told her roommate that she didn't make the decision, that it was the owners call. But it wasn't. I was there. My girlfriend had the discussion with her manager on speaker phone. She literally asked my girlfriend who do you want to give the job too, and she answered, and that was that.

This has made me hate her. She is a terrible person, and I've already broken up with her over this.

My question is, should I tell her roommate about what happened? Should she know that her ""best friend"" is not actually her best friend?

My girlfriend is still trying to get back together with me. We were living together, so her roommate was also my roommate, and we also good friends.",28Jul2017,2
220,"My boss intimidates me and i loathe her because of it, but she also has trouble understanding what i say, english is her second language.

So i want fridays off so i can participate in my College's intramurals, and i'd be happy to switch it with one of my two days off. also from Friday until Monday i work 4 consecutive days and have to go in an hour earlier than i'm supposed to to help (which i think is unfair considering i had a summer class right before work to worry about).

However there are some issues:

* right now i'm the only one who can work a certain position, until the new hires are trained for it.
* One of my coworkers can't work friday for sure in her position, so they have to train someone else for it. and our other coworker is kind of reluctant to learn it
* no one really likes working there, it's a lot to handle

I also really want to leave, and i do want to leave by at least the beginning of September, unless i find another job, because i'm moving the last week of Sept and want to enjoy myself for at least a month. Getting fridays off would make working there more bearable so i get my time to socialize and play sports, and might convince me to stay until i move. How can i ask my employer for fridays off without confusing her. i'm thinking a note asking for fridays in september. And i have to ask her soon before she starts the 2nd half of the August schedule.

225,"Please read the whole post before you form an opinion on the matter. Thanks.

Yesterday I told my therapist I had been having suicidal thoughts recently and I told her what they were and made it clear to her I didn't want her to tell my mom. She wasn't too into the idea of not telling my mom because she considered what I told her serious but seemed to be ok with respecting my wishes. 

However I was fairly paranoid about her breaching confidentiality after I left the counseling session because I had heard a fair few stories of counselor's telling the parents of their client what the client said behind their back. I was half expecting a phone call from her, my mom answering it and her saying she needs to talk with my mom about me. 

Well, the next day just as I was afraid of, my mom looks at her phone and there's a call from my counselor saying she wants me or my mom to call her back. As soon as my mom told me my counselor wants either me or my mom to call her back I knew what it was about. 

My mom gets ahold of her and my counselor says she needs to talk to me. My mom hands me the phone and the first thing she says to me is, ""Are you freaking out?"" Which struck me as quite odd. What reason do I have to be freaking out? Anyway just as I thought, she wanted to tell my mom about what I told her regarding my suicidal thoughts because she told the manager about what I said and he said she should tell my mom. 

The whole time I talked to her on the phone. she acted as though I was gonna kill myself tomorrow. Which is not true at all. 
What I told her was I was having moments where I felt very down in the dumps and thought that it could all end so easily by committing suicide and that if I were to do it I would overdose on pills. I made it very clear to her that I had absolutely no intention of carrying out these thoughts and never seriously considered them. They are only ideas that come from being depressed. Nothing more. 

Other things she said in that phone call was I ""wasn't making any sense"" by being so strongly against her telling my mom and she said things like ""I know about depression and suicidality"" and ""I just want to help you before the depression takes over"". As well as things like I'm a ""depressed person and depression isn't about logic"" or something to that effect, implying that because I have depression I can not be logical. 

I felt she was very condescending. Like she's the one with the degree so she automatically knows what I'm thinking and she knows what's best for me and I know nothing because I'm depressed and depressed people are not rational or logical. She talked about me as though I was gonna kill myself at the drop of a hat and I told her that's what I felt like she was saying and that wasn't how I felt at all and she said ""I'm not saying you're gonna kill yourself tomorrow, I'm saying you might want to relieve the sadness"" which in my opinion is the same thing except it is implied I will kill myself tomorrow or that I'm very suicidal rather then it being explicitly stated. 

In the end. I couldn't fight it. However I had told my mother after she told me about the voicemail my counselor left on her phone that I was pretty sure she was looking to breach confidentiality so my mom knew what was coming when I handed her the phone. My counselor told her I had a plan to kill myself and that she wanted my mom to get rid of any medications available to me. 

My mom wouldn't have any of it though, thank god, because my counselor had played this ""she's so suicidal, I think she might kill herself"" thing before. What happened was she wanted to put me in this school meant for mentally ill youth and she thought it would help out and it would be a lot less stressful then regular school. I told her I was perfectly happy with regular school and that I wanted to work toward getting back to attending regular school and not change schools completely. She did the ""I know what's best for you and you don't"" thing that time too. She said that someone as young as I am can't make those sorts of decisions (though there are only voluntary admissions to the school and if you didn't want to do it they couldn't force you). She pressed me to go to it and wouldn't take no for an answer to the point where I was so stressed I broke down crying. Later on she called my mom telling her to ask me if I was suicidal. Which just like the ""are you freaking out"" thing, I don't understand why she would think that, I never told her I was feeling suicidal at the time and I wasn't feeling suicidal at the time. Anyway I explained to my mother what I had told my counselor the previous day and that I was not seriously considering carrying out any of the thoughts I had and the logical thoughts always drown out the irrational ones. My mom took my side and thought that the counselor was over reacting even before I told her how it really was because again, my counselor's pulled this shit before. 

Now to explain the suicidal thoughts I had told her I had been having:

I told my counselor I had periods of time where I thought life was not worth living, the world was a shitty place, and that I feel somewhat hopeless in these periods of time, I also think things like it would be so easy to end all my suffering, just OD and it's all over. I told her that if I were to get to that point where I just wanted to die my method of suicide would be to OD. 
However I would never consider carrying that sort of thing out, I never have considered it, and the power these thoughts have over me are very small (though my counselor thinks otherwise). As soon as these thoughts pop into my head I immediately get other thoughts like ""think of all the things you wouldn't get to do. Your goals, hopes and dreams would all be gone"" and ""think of your family and friends. They'd be devastated"". Those logical thoughts automatically make me think ""Fuck no. I'm definitely not ever going to even think of doing any of that"". So long story short, those thoughts I told her I had been having are no more serious then my friend saying that if she were to kill herself she would jump off a building. They're just hypothetical situations and thoughts that come when I'm going through a bad day or hear of something that makes me very sad. These periods of time where I feel this way last from 2 hours to 4 days at the very most, and I always just get over them and move on. Now I will say this again: I never have and never will seriously consider carrying out any of the suicidal ideas that enter my head when I am having a bad day. The thoughts are very weak and again, as soon as I get any sort of thought like I previously stated I get that is irrational an negative that comes from depression another thought immediately comes up right after the previous one that is logical and positive that drowns out the first thought. I am NOT suicidal and I will NOT kill myself nor am I considering doing it and I feel my counselor completely over reacted. I can understand breaching confidentiality despite the protest of the client if the client said they are seriously considering killing themselves or that they will kill themselves but that just isn't the case here. I am not feeling like doing either of those things, and I never have. I know there are cases where the counselor is required to breach confidentiality but by the sounds of things she did it purely by the advice of her manager and her own choice. I don't think she had to. She has lost all my trust and will never get it back. 

I care so much about her doing what she did because she spun it to look like something it wasn't and that pisses me off and I consider what I told her about the thoughts I had to be a very private issue that I didn't want her spouting off about. I told her that but she went ahead and did it anyway. 

Am I just being emotional and irrational just like she said or does my argument have merit? Was it really right for to have done was she did? I just can't help but feel like what she did was a violation and very disrespectful. Especially how she made it twisted it as though I told her I had a plan I was going to carry out. Very angering. This could very well be nothing but emotions though so was she in the right? Give me your opinions.

And sorry about my angry ranting and rambling. I'm just really peeved is all.

227,"I am a smoker myself,  trying to quit and am making wonderful progress.  The problem is my mother who also is a smoker smokes in her room,  i smoke outside a couple times of day when the baby is asleep or is being watched by her mother.  I have begged her to at least keep her door closed when she does it so the smoke doesn't linger in shared areas.  She doesn't even make an effort to go outside or close the door.  In these summer months i understand not wanting to be in a closed off room with no ventilation. I feel as though me trying to compromise with her and the effort of trying to find a solution is falling on deaf ears.   She smoked as far back as i remember,  long car rides,  in the house,  in every situation. She had a cigarette in her hand as my wife walked down the aisle.  I also understand that people make their own choices but feel if she had been more aware of her actions while i was growing up i would be less inclined to smoke as i got older.  I don't want that to be the case with Layla.  I don't think i would fight her as much on this if i could see she was making an effort.  If she is in fact trying,  i can't tell.

241,"so, about three months ago i broke up with a guy i'd been dating for 5 months. i almost immediately regretted it and now realize it was pretty much all due to my anxiety/insecurity. we'd had a few weeks of tension/conflict, he pulled away, and i was certain he was over it and wanting to break up. i also noticed him following a girl he could only know from tinder (later confirmed) on instagram, which triggered me and made me think he was going to start seeing other people without telling me (i know, this is on me-- if you are snooping around like that, you're going to find something).

after a month of no contact, i got in touch with him and told him i'd regretted the breakup every day. he said he missed me and thought about me a lot. i asked if we could try again and he agreed, but said it would have to be a 'fresh start' and not go back to the tense dynamic we'd ended on. and, he still wanted to be free to see other people. 

we started seeing each other again, and i've been acting pretty horrible-- asking endless questions about what would have happened had i not broken it off with him (he said he wouldn't have broken up with me, that he'd been down to keep doing what we were doing, and was waiting to see if the tension would cool off); trying to get him to be exclusive with me again, and give the relationship another shot. he said this was what he was doing, giving it another shot, but that his freedom is really important to him right now (he had been in a long relationship right before we started dating) and that he can't make any promises for the future. he won't tell me an exclusive relationship isn't possible in the future, either. he says he likes me a lot and wants to keep seeing me but understands if it's too painful for me.

i know this sounds really, really bad. but i'm sort of perversely encouraged by how he's stuck around no matter how crazy i've acted. also, he's jealous of me going out with other people, too. neither of us has had sex with anyone else yet, and have agreed to tell each other if/when that happens. i keep saying that the only outcome i can see is that he'll meet someone else and want to date them exclusively, but he says that's only one possible outcome. and, a few weeks ago he made me a present to congratulate me for getting into a prestigious writing residency. 

he had me meet his brother when he came to town. they're on a monthlong backpacking trip rn, and he said if i hadn't acted like i did (ie crazy) since we got back together, maybe i could have come along on part of it (which SUCKS). i know he does like me, and he knows i want a serious relationship with him, but i feel like this might be a losing battle. i just can't get over how the initial breakup was my fault. i consider it the worst mistake of my life, giving him up like that. it consumes my every waking moment. i am totally obsessed.

is there any reason to stick around, seeing him non-exclusively, and hope we can go back to what we were doing before, or is it too messed up at this point?? ",28Jul2017,1
