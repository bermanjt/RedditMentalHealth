3,"Going to be a bit to read.. TIA for any advice!

So as stated in the title, I'm a 22 year old virgin. I've been shy most of my life and then really have never been motivated to pursue a relationship. I don't know why. Part of me gets nervous of what my parents will ask/think of it, idk. That's not the point.

So, I've been on Tinder like many single guys, for a while. Say about a year. Probably two weeks ago, I matched with this girl (Call her Amanda). So we've texted over the last couple of weeks and for some reason, unlike any other prior tinder matches, this has gone really well. We've really enjoyed talking with each other through text, and snapchat.

We've been trying to plan a time to meet, and tomorrow afternoon ended up being the answer. Originally, we planned a movie date, but because of some other problems, we are planning on hanging out at my family's beach house, where we will be alone. 

Throughout the course of the last few weeks, we've talked about various sexual topics, and I've mentioned I'm rather inexperienced, but I don't believe I've fully said I was a virgin. And by virgin, I mean the furthest I've done is kissed. Based on our conversations, I would imagine she is more experienced though I don't know to what degree. 

Like I said, this is our first meet. We've flirted a bunch over the last week so it almost seems like this could be an expedited process. I am not sure if I should bring it up and be forward with her because I don't want her to assume I think I'm getting laid before we even meet. Though, I don't want to look useless and not be prepared to properly work with any of her advances.

Should I tell her my worries? Just play it cool and hope for the best? Anyone experienced, give me an idea of what I should do/expect. Please feel free to ask for more questions. 

TL;DR - Meeting new girl alone, not experienced sexually, and have no idea what to expect or how to prepare.",12Jul2017,1
4,"Hi, I had no idea where to find help so I thought ""Why not ask people online for help?"" so here goes.
Some time ago, a friend of mine met some guy online. Apparently things were going well for them, to the point they developed some sort of romantic relationship. Things were fine until he just stopped answering her. No texts, no calls and he even stopped updating his facebook page. Now she's really depressed because she has no idea of what might have happened. And looking for him at his home is no option since he lives in the USA and we live in the asscrack of México :P .

8,"7 months ago my girlfriend cheated on me, and I didn't find out til a week later. Broke up with her. Didn't think anything of it. Problem is, I had sex with her a few times within that week of not knowing. Still didn't think anything of it.

Fast forward 7 months to today, I got an anonymous message on Facebook from a woman claiming to be the wife of the dude who cheated on my ex. She said that my ex gave him chlamydia and now they both are being treated for it. I haven't noticed anything different with my body in the span of those 7 months, no symptoms of any kind, (though TBH I'm unsure of the symptoms anyway).

Should I believe this person? Or should I ignore it. Nothing is really wrong with me and I don't have health insurance so going to the doctor would be hard.

Tldr: someone messaged me claiming that I have chlamydia. Don't know what to do.

9,So my dad recently gave me his old wall safe and the combo. He hasn't opened it in years and forgot how many turns and what way to spin it. It's an old safe and above the dial it says KEEP/SAFE. The top left corner it says AFTER DIALING COMBINATION PRESS HERE TO OPEN. And it has a little red dot. I have a pic of it if that would help but It doesn't even have a serial number on it and I can't find instructions anywhere on the internet on how to open it.

11,"My boyfriend and I have been together for six years. We have a three year old together. I love him beyond words. We're a family and I'm trying so hard to make it work. There are some things about him that deeply concern me though. 

I'll start from the beginning (at least from the beginning that is relevant). In the beginning, I cheated on him a few times. About five times in different ways within the first three years of our relationship with my most recent ex. I hate myself for it and I don't think either him or I will ever forgive me for that. I won't go into full detail about all of that. I just figured if I was going to tell you guys about his faults I should start by saying that I was the first one to fuck up. Side note: I've been 100% loyal to him for the past three years. 

Fast forward to now/the last couple of years. My boyfriend blames my mental illness for me getting upset with him and uses it to invalidate a lot of things I say. He insists on being in charge of my money. All of my direct deposit from work goes into a joint account and most of the time when I check to see how much money is left most of the money is gone but he can still spend money on groceries and what not. He calls me bitch more than he calls me by name. I've lost contact with most of my friends. He doesn't like me talking to my mom about our relationship because my mom doesn't like him. He gets way too angry when I make any decision ever without asking him first. I could go on, but I'm not trying to write a narrative, just trying to give some back story.

Fast forward to now, as in within the last few weeks or so. We live with his family, as in his mom and grandma. We've lived here since our son was born. His grandma has Parkinson's disease and recently she's been in more pain and needs help with more things, like standing up and what not. My boyfriend has been doing much more than just helping her with these things. She yells for him across the house to fetch things for her, wakes him up early in the morning to do things for her, stuff like that. When he's at work she magically can do all of these things on her own. It's amazing. There are two things about this situation that bother me a lot. One, he has a son who could be getting all of this time and attention but instead he's being ignored. Not that my boyfriend is maliciously ignoring him, that's just what's happening as a result. Two, she's beyond ungrateful. I haven't heard her tell him thank you once. Not once. It makes me sick.

As I mentioned, I have mental illnesses. They have been really affecting me lately. A lot. It's scary. But because of this situation (with my boyfriend's grandma) I've kept it all to myself. I've mentioned it to my boyfriend a couple times but he's not as concerned with me as he is with his grandma so I've decided to just keep it all in my head or whatever. 

Here's where the advice comes in, because I'm at a total and complete loss here. I have briefly mentioned to him that he needs to pay more attention to his son and that his grandma doesn't need as much as he's been doing but the result was bad so I've decided not to talk about it with him at all anymore.

I can't live like this. My son doesn't deserve this. I absolutely dread coming home from work every day. I cry in the shower (sorry if that's dramatic or whatever) because I can't show my feelings. My head/mind is fucked up. I'm miserable. It's to the point where I'm asking complete strangers what they think I should do, because I have absolutely no idea and anyone I would ask that I know wouldn't be able to give me non bias advice. Someone, please give me advice. 

Thank you.

12,"Before we got engaged, my fiance (male) and I '(female) had been together for two years. We've been engaged for about a year now.

When he asked, he just sort of came into the bedroom of our (then) old house and asked holding the ring out, not really kneeling or anything. I said yes because I love him.

I have not said this to him, but when I look back on that memory, I get sort of depressed... I was secretly more excited about the proposal than I am about actually getting married, lol. The house he asked me to marry him in I felt trapped in and was the center of a lot of terrible and somewhat traumatic memories (thankfully we have sinced moved). 

I guess I just need help moving on. He means the world to me and I can't imagine marrying anybody else, and becoming sad over this (a year later!) seems silly. I feel like I shouldn't be upset and that this isn't a valid reason to be depressed over. But for some reason I am ""stuck"".

15,"Ok so Im not sure where to go with this so I'm just going to leave it here.
A little back story...
About 7 months ago I decided I wanted to move an hour and a half away from my hometown. I immediately started looking for a job in my to-be area. After almost 5 months of no luck, I became antsy and decided I'm going to just make the move anyway with the idea that I can make the commute to my, then-current, job and not hate my life in doing so. I was wrong. I almost immediately realized that I needed to find something more convenient.
I decided to quit my full time job and put all my time and resources into finding something local. I figured in the mean time, ill get myself a dinky part time job until something comes up, that way Im at least getting a paycheck. That's when I found ""Gas Hole"" (is what we'll call it). A very successful local gas station/convenient store franchise in upstate NY.
I fucking hated ""Gas Hole."" I hated it so much that I put my job search on overdrive. I would be on indeed in the middle of my shifts just sending out my resume for literally anything office-related at this point (I was a bit spoiled with my previous office job and wanted to go back). One day, as I pulled into ""Gas Hole"" 10 mins early to start my shift, I came across a job ad on indeed that I recognised to be a company not even a mile away from my apartment so I applied and even called the company to let them know I applied. I ended up walking in to work 5 minutes late because I was given a quick phone interview AND scheduled an in-person interview! FINALLY!
Now, I knew from the ad that I was a bit under-qualified for the position in question but, I put my bullshit pants on anyway and proceeded to GET THE JOB!
Here's the part where I need help. My boss is an older guy and does not know the next steps to take to handle the growth of his company. (To put things in perspective, the company doubled in sales in the past year from 600k to 1.2m). Ive been given the task to pretty much create a new database for the company using outlook office 360, peachtree, and anything else that I suggest really. He trusts me and for that reason I really want to deliver. What are some ways I can organize the company? How do I manipulate outlook 360 in the simplest, most efficient way. Everything I do and every procedure I put in to play ill have to teach my boss who again, is older.
Im only 2 days in now so I've only done some minor things such as created some share folders but even that I am worried he wont remember to use it. Im hesitant about starting a system and then finding a better way to do it later and just wasting time. My goal right now is to make an internal system for the company employees to follow. Somewhere everyone can enter/see notes, find their work schedules, etc. Peachtree handles the client database so ill worry about that later. Literally any ideas would be really helpful.",12Jul2017,1

17,"I decided about two years ago that I didn't believe in the teachings of my church so I have been sort of drifting, not making a scene with my family, but not believing what they believe. 

When I was a child, there was a sense that death was not the end and we would all meet in heaven but I stopped believing that when I stopped believing in the tooth fairy. I just don't believe it. Now my four year old brother died, and last week my sister attempted suicide. My parents believe (and I think my sister believes) that her high needs Autistic son is her punishment from God for being a rebellious teenager, even though she's outgrown those days, married and is living a good, clean, moral life. Her life with her son is very, very difficult and I feel like she's going to die any day and I don't want to live without her.

My grandmother just died and I feel this sense that I'm next. I'm young and healthy, but I just feel like any moment any one of us could die, and the sense of fear that I have over it is making me actually sick. I've had the runs and nausea for weeks. I've seen a doctor and had blood drawn, and when they didn't find anything wrong with me, (I've had other symptoms, headaches and such) they just said I'm fine, but I think it's all down to stress.

I feel so extremely, overwhelmingly stressed. I'm seeing a therapist but they are focusing on my family abuse situations, which are really not the problem.

I've had a previous job in retail which included some admin work - replying to emails/updating spreadsheets/telephoning customers etc. I'm very computer savvy so am confident in my ability to pick something up quickly.

I thought the interview went great and in the rejection email I was told I interviewed really well and they liked me and it was a tough decision for them but they went with someone with more experience. 

I just feel like my lack of experience isn't getting my job applications noticed by employers but I've also applied for numerous internships (paid/unpaid) and volunteer work to build my CV and never heard anything back from those either.

I've had people look over my CV/job applications/personal statement/cover letters since I was paranoid I was going terribly wrong somewhere but everyone has given me positive feedback.

23,"A couple of years ago I began bumping into a lady (we'll call her Annie) almost everywhere I went. We both studied at the same college, attended the same church, joined same committees etc. Eventually we became casual friends and began to meet for coffee, shopping etc and this slowly became a regular thing. 

Gradually I began to notice that her mental health issues were actually quite severe and found out she has borderline personality disorder. She is constantly seeking out attention and creating drama, usually in a negative way, has no respect for privacy or boundaries and most disturbingly will deliberately initiate verbal and occasionally physical altercations with random members of the public. She has openly admitted to standing on someone's foot And tripping people up and I suspect she was behind a recent local hate letter campaign. She is known to police and has a criminal record. 

My fiancé and I are planning to get married soon and have kids. I also have my career to think about. I realise I've been very naïve. I no longer want to have this woman in my life, I don't want her meddling in my relationship or job and I certainly wouldn't feel safe around her if I was pregnant. 

However, she is resisting my attempts to back off. If I don't respond to her call within a couple of hours she will text me, then email etc, gradually becoming more desperate and bombarding me with messages. I have explained I'm much busier now, which I am, but she does not understand or respect this.

 i cannot cut her out or avoid her completely as we live near each other and have many mutual friends and acquaintances, but I also cannot continue friendship with her.

I would always come first. I want nothing more for him to be happy. So we ended our relationship. It was fairly mutual but more on his part. I was and still am devastated. It ended on good terms and he told me there was always a chance we could gey back together. What made things worse was a few days before we broke up he told me he was starting to have feelings for another girl. Nothing happened between them and the girl cut him off after he told her because we were friends. I was really hurt and haven't forgiven him for that. After our break up he started hanging out with more. He has never lied to me so I don't believe anything happened between them.

We actually saw a few months ago that we had a nest on the corner roof of our balcony. It looks like a beehive. It's not very big but it is noticeable. I honestly don't know how we never noticed it before. We've lived in this apartment for about six or seven years now. I don't know if it was there and we never noticed or if it happened after we moved in. We barely use our balcony so we never noticed it before. The bugs keep getting in and we don't know if they're coming from it or not. We keep the balcony door shut now cause everyone we open it they get in. We rarely see bees so I don't know if there's any in it or not. My sister just wants to spray it or knock it down but I am wary of that. We're scared to go out on our balcony cause it feels weird knowing it's right there. The bugs might not be coming from it but the real issue is the beehive.

42,"So I am a guy in college right now.  I am in my fourth and final year at school and I had a quick question.  I have never really been great with girls since I lack confidence a bit.  I have a good sense of humor when I am feeling confident however.  Freshman year, I met a girl that I really hit it off with.  We had a couple classes together and would occasionally talk. She knew I liked her and would come up to me to speak.  I remember after the first semester she said something to me like you better not forget about me next semester.  This was like 3/4 years ago now.  So the following semester we hung out once which was very awkward (I was feeling pretty nervous and not confident).  After that we texted occasionally but since I was very unconfident, I could take a very long time to respond, never really knowing what to say. So the following years went by and I made no attempt of reaching out.  I ran into her maybe twice in those years.  Now it is my final year and I keep hoping to run into her.  If I ran into her I would hope to see if she wanted to hang out sometime.  If not I could have closure..  So from a college girl or guys or anyone really's viewpoint.. how weirded out would you be if someone like me from years ago sent you a message seeing how you were.  I may not run into her so I was wondering if it was at all an option. Or should I just move on?  I tend to over romanticize things (I had a crush on my seventh grade girlfriend for like 6 years......)

52,"Currently moved to Denver from Texas. I work at a Domino's. The pay is almost doubled what I'd usually make elsewhere but in tips...from driving around...

I recently came out a supervisor position interview today for a college bookstore and I even got heads-up from a local sprouts (I recently worked there a year and a half) that theirs availabilities open. The good news! Is that these positions pay a good bit above minimum wage and one of them is full time. PLUS they'll be above clerk jobs so I like that.

After crunching numbers I'd realize I'd be afloat financially but nothing like Domino's. But that's not my passion. I just took it cause my roommate convinced me it was that much of a struggle here. And I kinda see where he comes from but once I saw his expenses I undertood. And he is a big spender and likes the job. Me? I enjoyed my hourly rates work cause I was more involved. Plus I'm not even crazy for the money cause I spend that on weed like everyday.... I figured on my off time it'd be perfect to study up for PT certificate or maybe a liquor license so I can have a side hustle that I ENJOY.

Guys, would you rather stay for the money or take it up a little extra sweat with other positions? I still ask myself everyday if this job is for real and the smell of pizza and dirty uniforms is really pissing me off.

53,"Anyone who takes the time to read this, I appreciate it. It's kinda all over the place. Likely typos.

My girlfriend and I (together ~2.5 years now) have just finished undergrad as of a couple months ago. Fortunately I landed a job right out the gate about a 40 minute commute from my hometown- I'm living at my parents house rent-free, and helping the folks take care of everything as they are getting older. My gf however made it into the graduate program at the same university and is currently living on campus, soon to be moving off campus into a nearby apartment with a roommate (who in my opinion is a kinda 'meh' person). 

Anyway, as our last semester was coming to a close she confided in me tearfully that she didn't make any real reliable friends in college and that she won't have anyone to connect to. I told her that she shouldn't worry and that plenty of people don't find their best friends in college and she's going to meet plenty of cool people at work/graduate school. She is truly one of the sweetest and magnetic people I know so it came as a shock to me that she felt this way. I'm her closest friend and we don't even spend that much time together. 

It definitely hit me now that she's right- she doesn't have that many people to talk to, at least not people her age she can really bond with. She's hours away from her home state where her best friends are without any affordable means of transport, as well as a loaded academic and work schedule. I live a -not awful, but significant- 2.5 hours from her by car. Between my long work day, my various extra obligations, and my familial duties, I've found it's not only inconvenient but also really expensive to visit her especially considering she doesn't drive, the train is not cheap, and parking in the city where she lives is a nightmare. 

I've visited her once this summer for just a couple days, and while it was great I don't see another visit happening in the near future. I try and stay in touch over phone and facetime but I'm really the worst at keeping in contact, even with people I love and enjoy- I find it exhausting and stressful to even send texts sometimes and enjoy my alone time, as I'm usually saturated with interaction day to day. I've made a habit of calling/texting every other day but she works late (like past midnight) and I get up early. I'm exhausted when I'm at work because I feel this immense pressure to be there for her. But it just isn't sustainable. Phone calls end in her tears often.

I've been trying to encourage her to get out and meet people by picking up a hobby or something to expose her to new potential friends, or reaching out to people she doesn't normally get to hang out with but are around her. But she doesn't make a lot of money and like I said getting around without a car for her is hard. She doesn't like asking for help/ feeling like a burden, so I try to assure that she's always worth my/ other people's time.

Another thing I'm concerned about is that she's banking on me moving back the area we went to college and finding a job there. I'm going to do my best to once I can focus all of my energy on a job search- I already have an interview lined up. But soon I'm going to have loans to pay off, a car to pay for, groceries to buy, etc. and adding rent to that is really going to put a dent in my quality of life and freedom. The job I'm at currently pays well enough that I can be financially prepared for the future, and I also have to look after my parents and the house since they can't do it alone.

I feel like if I didn't love her I would throw in the towel on this relationship because of the stresses and pressures I feel tugging me in different directions in my life are clouding my judgement and making me feel like my choices aren't my own (p.s I have an incredibly guilty conscience and tend to make one-sided sacrifices whenever people ask). I'm not even 100% sure about my career path. I feel like if I'm away from her I'm abandoning her. I know she would never intentionally manipulate me, but this whole idea of moving from has got me fucked up. I don't know what other advice to give her and I don't know what to do on my end. I think emotionally I can manage long distance but I can see it really tears her up. Either decision I make I feel I'm abandoning someone, whether it's my parents and friends back home, or my gf and friends in the city. Any input would be great

**TLDR: In 2.5 yr long distance relationship, and gf is in grad school, having hard time making friends and money, although she works. I'm working near hometown + living at home with parents rent-free saving up to pay loans/ other life expenses. Living away from home would be big pressure on me and my family financially.

Recently she s met this girl and suddenly she s hanging out with her. She s changed all of her profile pictures so that they are of this new girl and her. She stopped inviting me to events and to her b-day parties (It really hurt to see the pictures on her Snapchat and not even know she had a party or anything). We used to do everything together and now it s like I don t even know her anymore. I finally found out that she was dating a guy and kissed. She told me that she didn t tell me because she thought that I would make jokes about them kissing (I m not that shallow and it is ridiculous that she thought that about me). I talked to her after that and told her how much she was hurting me by not talking to me or inviting me to hang out with her anymore and she apologized and said that she would invite me next time but today she posted a photo on facebook saying that they are such great friends and that they are soul sisters.

56,"My boyfriend and I went to the beach last weekend. The drive to get there can take as long as 6 hours due to traffic and bathroom stops. We stayed at the beach from Friday night through Sunday afternoon. 

One of my former co-workers now lives in the town next door to where we were staying. He and I worked together at the same movie theater in my hometown until I graduated from college two years ago. I've since added him on Facebook. I enjoyed talking to him at work, even if he sometimes seemed depressed or only had depressing things to say. I thought he was funny and intelligent, and that he was dealt a bad hand in life. He seems to have had an abusive father and only a few close friends. He's now in his early 30s and I'm not even sure if he's had a girlfriend before. 

We weren't super close, but like I said, I enjoyed having him around and we've kept in touch in superficial ways on Facebook. 

When I was driving into the beach town the other day, I remembered that he lived nearby and told my boyfriend that maybe we could get lunch with my old co-worker sometime. I dismissed it after that since we only had two nights, two half-days, and one full day to spend at the beach and we hadn't been on a vacation in a long time. 


Yesterday, after posting pictures of the beach trip on Facebook, my old co-worker commented on one of the pictures and said that he was sad that we drove right by and didn't visit. I haven't responded yet since I don't want to hurt his feelings. He has never been a mean person, but I do feel that he is a bit bitter in general due to having had a hard life, and I felt this way before this happened. Things have been kind of stressful in my life and I really just wanted the weekend to be for me and my boyfriend. I felt that his comment was a bit presumptuous, but I also felt bad since I had remembered that he lived there and thought we could have lunch sometime, but just not that time because I hadn't planned for it. 

I'm not sure how to respond to him, or if I should at all. Suggestions on what to do would be appreciated.",12Jul2017,2

69,"Hi,

As the title states, I am an introverted person, maybe even a little socially awkward. I currently work in Marketing and it's definitely not suited for me.

Ideal Work Environment: 
-Freedom to work from home whenever I want, OR 
-to work with a small, intimate group of like minded people 
-I despise commuting to a drab, corporate office -Freedom to choose the kinds of projects and people I work with

What I Enjoy: 
-Being creative 
-Problem solving 
-Creating/building things (even though I work in marketing, building a website at work was fun for me, I got to build something people actually use! I also enjoyed working on film projects with friends in school, I loved the camaraderie and excitement of creating something we were proud of) -In school, I always loved working on projects (usually creative) or essays and sharing them with others

Wildest dream: 
-Animated movie director 
Realistic dream: 
-Start my own small design company and work from home

Current situation: I feel listless at the moment. I do pretty boring, mediocre work, and I don't feel like it makes an impact and it's not something I get excited about. I also feel like I am in a extroverted field, and I see myself as a creative introvert. My self-esteem and self-confidence are not holding up to well these days...

73,"When my half sister was a teenager, my dad touched her breast. She tried to tell my mother but she did not believe her because she was notorious for lying(Note: I was a baby during this time) So she completely cut herself from the family. 

Years later, my dad confessed to my mother while he was drunk what he did to my half sister, and she kicked him out of the house and vowed to never get together with him again. This was when I was ending middle school, and that is when I started acting cold towards him and not wanting anything to do with him because I felt disgusted.  Years later, while I was in highschool, my mother tried to make various attempts to convince me that I should visit him in Los Angeles to try to reconnect with him, because her reasoning was that he was still my father. I told her how I felt uncomfortable being around him because of what he did, and she told me that he has changed and that he is not like that anymore, despite them still being separated at the time. 

So I would go to Los Angeles to visit him and I could tell that he was trying his best to connect with me, take me places, and buy me whatever I want, and he never done or said anything suspicious towards me. However, I still felt uncomfortable and still acted cold to him, but to a lesser extent.

Many people in my family abused alcohol and other substances, and I grew up associating all mind-altering substances with very negative things.  I used to have a genuine fear of being around people who were drinking/getting high, to the point that I would become visibly anxious and want to leave if this were happening, but I've gotten better over the last decade and can now enjoy myself around people who are drinking, etc.

For the past 5 years I was in a relationship with someone who felt very similarly about drugs and alcohol.  However, a few months ago I began dating someone who drinks recreationally, sometimes smokes, and very occasionally gets high.  Other than this I really like him and we get along very well, but every night before he goes to bed he wants to have a beer or two, and it provokes a feeling of disgust and anxiety in me every time.

I feel really bad about this.  I know I'm being irrational--he's not an alcoholic or even getting drunk around me, but I still find this habit really anxiety-provoking.  Every night we're together I hope he won't drink, but he almost always wants to and it's gotten harder for me to avoid sounding judgmental or like I'm asking him not to.  He never drinks any alcohol stronger than beer, and I know he drinks beer almost as a hobby.  I don't want to ask him to give that up or change, but it really does cause me negative feelings every time I think of it.  The other night and again earlier tonight I couldn't stop thinking about these things and basically freaked out.  I know this isn't sustainable.

I have two close friends. 

The first I've known for several years. We dated for a few of those, broke up and now we're friends and live together as flatmates. He's helped me through situations on occasion and can be supportive, but a lot of the time  (especially lately) he's been easily angered, emotionally abusive and manipulative. I still consider him a close friend and expressing that us hard when I also know how bad he can be towards me... he's sided with others who have bullied me and told me to ""just get over"" my problems (which include issues with my abusive mother). Losing him would be hard, because I've known him so long and don't really have many close friends.

The second friend I only met recently. He's been great at giving me advice and helping me come to terms with a recent diagnosis I've had. There's not much to say about him, except he has given me great advice and helped me see things a bit clearer in some circumstances. He occasionally makes jokes in bad taste, but he generally means well and he's kind of fatherly.

93,"I do not normally recruit advice from strangers, but I really don't know how to handle this.  I will attempt to not muddy it with too much detail.

Quick background: After a long and frustrating few years, I've finally gotten my GED and my driver's license; there were legislative changes in my state within the last decade that screwed everything up for my unusual situation as a minor and I fell through the cracks, but it's done now!)= I also exited a soulcrushing relationship and suddenly I can think straight again.  I am a legal adult.

This brings me to my current status: I am now looking at what I'd like to do for college, and I'm also looking at working for the first time now that I can provide the ID legally demanded for employment.  I do not live alone; I live with my mother who is the sole household income, and I handle all the household chores and handling our pets.  But doing the chores doesn't get bills paid, and while we're doing okay, we are in that precarious state of ""one hospital trip = up shit creek without a paddle"".  Also, there is absolutely no savings for my education, so while I qualify for some aid, I'll have to probably make up a significant chunk myself.
The logical conclusion, of course, is that I need to find work.  Both of us working will nicely cover some small debts we have and I can save up what I need.  I have no oppositions whatsoever to this and I am ready to go full steam ahead.

The problem is that despite all of this, I can't seem to get around my mother.  When I talk about either finding work or my future education, she just sort of... shuts down and won't say anything until I change the subject.  No words of support, even.
This is really confusing to me - but I think she's having a hard time with the idea that I am adulting now, which is understandable.  But there are other red flags with her mannerisms that indicate, to me, that she does not think of me as an adult capable of doing adult things despite my willpower to do so.

Okay, fine, whatever - just do it anyway!  That would be the logical solution and a very simple one.

But the problem arises that when I think of doing so, I get the impression it will be devastating and heartbreaking to her to let go.  And because I love my mom and I have no other serious grievances with her, I don't want to see her hurt.  And just like that... this nice shiny new spine I have just disintegrates.

All of the pieces are laid out before me.  I'm in a good position now.  I have ambition for the first time ever.  This roadblock is so simple because it is just a matter of ""do it anyway"".
Why, then, does my willpower vanish on this one issue? Am I just a coward who can't stand up to mommy? I can deal with literally anyone else - why not her?",12Jul2017,2

I can't afford a new driver's license to replace the one which was lost/stolen for a few days, but if someone *has* stolen (or found and then proceeded to steal) my wallet, they could use my driver's license to reset my checking account PIN and steal my paycheck.

I'm currently unable to make transactions with my bank; no debit card, no license to prove my identity... and no way to pull out the money I need to get a new license to prove my identity to my bank to cancel my debit card and issue a new one.

98,"Two years ago, my mother had a brain anyeurysm and had to get coils. She wound up not really having any huge side effects or changes to her life after she recovered. Only thing noticeable was she’s been losing her memory and physical strength.

She’s a heavy alcoholic, and last year around July, she started hearing voices only when drunk. BWe live in a two family home with us as the landlords, so she believed she heard our tenant’s mother threatening to burn the house down, or talking to police about how my family does drugs, etc. At first I believed her, but I started listening in silence to see if I could hear our tenant talking and my mom would insist the tenant was speaking, but I couldn’t hear a thing. The walls in the house are paper thin as well, since it’s an old house so I’d have definitely heard the tenants. Meanwhile my hard at hearing mother can hear them. It got so bad to the point that while I was away in another state around this time last year, she took a hatchet to my tenants front door, trying to break it down. I wound up convincing my cousin to bring my mom to the hospital, and then a psych ward. Unfortunately psych wards can only keep patients for 72 hours unless they show signs of being a danger, and naturally since the hospital didn’t give her alcohol, she didn’t hear the voices. They wound up releasing her last year after treating her for a UTI, and claiming that would have caused the voices.

Anyway, it’s happening again. And around the same time of year as well, and I have absolutely know idea what to do this time around. Help??

TL;DR: Is it possible for a brain aneurysm to have side effects of hearing voices in the summer while drunk?",12Jul2017,2

103,"Hi /r/Advice! After asking for an opportunity to get experience for future graduate school applications my professor assigned me to work on a brain-computer interface (BCI) project and I feel a bit overwhelmed with questions.

First, context:

* I'm an international student (from Central America) studying in Asia in one of the best universities in my field (Engineering). 

* I just finished my second year of a four year bachelor's program and recently took a course with this professor (Signal Processing) where I did pretty well (taking into account the class was pretty basic)

* This professor's research is focused on control systems, signals processing, unmanned vehicles and similar stuff up to what I know.

* As of right now I would like to get a Master's but I'm still not sure if I would prefer a life in Academia or Industry. My long-lasting interests include Nuclear Energy (fission and fusion), Signal Processing, Computer Simulations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (not sure if this goes together with the previous one) and Artificial Intelligence.

Second, the situation itself:

* I was supposed to meet up with the professor one day to talk more in detail about the summer research project but I fucked up big time and got late there then he had another schedule with someone else and so he told me to send him an email and that he would get me into contact me with a senior student. 

* This senior student explained to me the basics of what he had been researching on (Brain-Computer Interfaces) and explained to me how it was not until recently that they got a kit from OpenBCI to actually do measurements and experiments but he plans to spend his summer doing an internship and later on he plans to focus on another project.

* Now, he told me he would give me some information from his research but after leaving for his internship he has been unresponsive. I just got a book and some general ideas of what should he thinks I should read about.

* The professor explained to me that in the lab everyone does a part of the job. In this case my job or immediate goal would be to design a method to use the device to control vehicles by using brain-waves.

Third, my problems: 

* My senior was the only person working on this project. Up to what I know no one else knows anything about the subject (AFAIK). He told me to learn Machine Learning and even though I have a basic programming knowledge I feel a bit overwhelmed. I have seen multiple comments  with differing opinions that suggest to either read a book or take an online course, which language to use (Python, Matlab, R), the math prerequisites (Linear Algebra?) and the more I read into from where begin the more confused I get.

* I ended up taking the book (Brain-Computer Interfaces Principles and Practices by Jonathan Wolpaw) he left as a reference to start from. So far, it has taken me two days to go through three chapters (around 60 pages of a total of 400) and without understanding the contents fully. I try to summarize the basic ideas but if we go into details I feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of topics covered in the book (neuroanatomy and neurophysiology which I have absolutely no previous knowledge about ignoring basic high school biology) and my sluggishness in going through the chapters.


I am wondering if anyone has any experience with being a similar situation before and if so how to deal with it or any recommendations in general for academic research or this subject in particular? (How many hours should I work on this/ Is it ok to work from home when I am not doing experiments or should I always work at the lab? / How can I make the best of my time in there? /Is it worth to invest so much time into something that I may or may not keep working on in the future? Or any other suggestions would be useful). hanks a lot and sorry for the wall of text.

105,"I'm currently working in a strange environment: a large not-for-profit facing impending redundancies. I work in a fundraising capacity.

A colleague and I joined the team 3 months ago and identified several areas for expansion and improvement that would drive income/awareness in line with the company's goals. In conversations with my superiors where I have offered suggestion or innovation, I have been told that I am trying to work 'above my level' or that these things have already been attempted and so it isn't worth pursuing again. I have left these conversations feeling disheartened and of the view that 'if it didn't  work before, it's unlikely to work in future'.

I'm conscious that there are several factors at play: certain individuals with more influence would have been able to get their ideas pushed through; people are worried about their own job security and the organisation I work for is hugely bureaucratic and frankly huge.

What advice would you give to someone trying to create a positive change in the above-mentioned environment? Have I found the wrong cultural fit in terms of an organisation? Should I take a certain number of risks or do I keep it moving... I'm concerned I don't have the presence and forcefulness of certain individuals to get ideas pushed through.

110,"As the title suggests, I am having trouble choosing the path. I went to school to be a video game developer, finishing top of my class for programming. I got hired on as a part time developer and soon after we all got layed off. Seeing how crazy the video game industry can get, I decided to go towards health care. I joined a company as a contract developer and stayed on for a year. After my contract they offered me a full time position as a QA Analyst. However, the job was much more than that. I was requested to build an automation framework, build the QA infrastructure and all user stories, use cases and test cases (we had none). It was a lot of work, I am still working on them to this date. I have had 0 help regarding this position, so I am basing my efforts and accomplishments off of the internet. 

Recently my job has opened up a developer position. I requested to interview for the job, but I am at a loss as to what I want to do.

I like QA, in the aspect that I have a lot of freedom to do things. I have no one over my head telling me what to do, and everything I do regarding the job is ""my baby"". My manager said that the QA position will open up better opportunities in the future for me in this company. He said that in this QA position, I will move up faster, but a Developer position it will be much harder.

I am mainly concerned for my future. Currently I make 44.5k a year in Kingston Ontario. I work 50-60 hours a week because of all the work I have to do. They have told me they ""want"" to pay me more, but can't.

The Developer positioner has me working with HTML + Javscript + CSS + .NET + SQL + Azure + some other languages.

If I were to leave the company 5 years down the line, what looks better. The QA position, or the Developer position.

114,"I have a long distance relationship with a guy living in the Philippines. I met him this summer, and we became instant friends and were overall attracted to each other. We want to be with one another, and have often confessed our love and yearning for each other. We have a kind of romeo and juliet thing (except less dying and less tights) where my family hates his family, and hated me always going to see him. I only saw him when he passed by the yard, and we just continued talking on messenger despite everyone in my family simply saying ""Don't talk to him""-but no reason why. 
After I left the Philippines he always talked to me before class or during breaks. I loved this small gesture of always finding time to talk with me. But suddenly its all different, talking 3 times a day for hours became 1 single text or nothing if I didn't leave a good morning message. He told me he is very busy because he has to clean the classroom in the morning, but that's it. What irks me the most is that he says he's busy but is still going on Facebook same time we usually talk and is either posting pictures or adding new friends. He hasn't even checked the message I left him, which they're usually just ""good morning! have a good day and stay safe!"" (Basically). Its not like he has a job, it's just school, church, or archery. I'm thinking, ""atleast check the message when you're obviously online instead of ignoring it"".

118,"
OK, so i am sorry i cannot make this short however i cannot td;lr it as you will not understand all the details to make a fair comment,
i am typing this on my phone wo i will make spelling mistakes also my spelling is shit. 
I am 15 and from england (year 10 and grade 9 for you Americans)an i am dairly sure i am suffering from depression. I come from a relatively
well  off parents. This being said i mean we are never in debt or strugle to pay bills and shit like that but i am not spoilt.

I am pretty fucked up right now it is midday and i have not have anything to eat for like 15 hours cus i dont feel like it. I just am regretting 
and feeling shit about all the bad things i have done in the recent past. 

Someone told me to post online (not family but i know them irl)
because firstly i am nervous to tell anyone in my family and if i were to go to a help person irl they would take me to the police because i 
have done illegal things. Now you probaly want to know what i have done. I am really good with tech stuff like for example: I am an android genious; i know 
a lot about internet layers and protocols etc I also have good developing skills in C# (Unity) Web dev in CSS and HTML. I am also very interested by hacking 
and what most of you know of as the  deep web. The deep web is not actaully what many people think; it is full of shit, people have this idea that the deep web is
the same as the darkweb when infact the dark web was just a phrase created by the media to label dodgy stuff that was on the deepweb. The deepweb being something that 
you cannot access through standard browsers. Due to my extended internet knowledge i was able to get past the typical drug and fake FBI honeypot ""hitman"" services-
the websites that are mostly on the hidden wiki. 

I was until a just a few days ago going into the marian trench (some of the deepest layers of the web, the kill
cams and redrooms). These places are littered with hackers, and iI am lucky, I am lucky I stopped because i know if i stayed in that reallym any longer i would have 
been a victim. I was careful i used a VPN ontop of the one built into tor browser and i unabled all scripts except for html. What i saw was what fucked me up,
and unfortuantely i got used to what i saw. Let me give you an example: At nightime in wahtever fucked up place this was some thugs went and (whilst being watched
live by over 700 people) killed a homeless man in a tragic way. At first i was shocked, but after seeing many of these gore videos it was just the same repeated event
i soon tried to find the worst gore possible to see how much it would shock me. Bestgore.co(//m) was a sight on the normal weba  regually visited.

After seeing my friends reactions to these videos i knew i was not normal, which was ok for a while until something else dawned on me. I suddenly felt personally responsable 
for all of the deaths i had seen. Couldnt i do something about this i just sat there and watched this people die in front of my eyes. I should have called the police immediately.
But for some fucked up reason i didn't. 

Without me realising i think my bad actions had a personal effect on me, i have started getting depressed and things i used to enjoy such as gaming i no longer enjoy.
It has a real effect on me socially, i mean i am not exactly good socially but that is annother issue. For some reason i get random mood swings for no reason in which
i do no want to do anthing, if someone talks to me in these i will get angry at them for no real reason. Also my sexual motivation has litterally gone, which is one 
of the features of depression apparently.

sorry, i cannot reveal all the details here for personal and security reasons if you think you can help please PM me and i will say more on any part.

If you read the whole thing i am so grateful, please leave a comment below i will reply fast and i look forward to getting out of this situation

125,"About 5/6 weeks ago I got promoted to manager of my team. I previously had a close friendship with two of my colleagues who I now manage. Neither of these applied for the job. They encouraged me to apply for the post initially but friend 1 became less supportive on the run up once I had submitted my application 'I think you would be quite serious' etc - odd comments speculating how I would handle the new role.

Since commencing the role there was a grey area where friend 1 told me information as a friend during a work break that later become relevant regarding their work patterns. This was shared confidentially with one member of HR as a basis to look out for their health and wellbeing and wasn't noted and was kept confidential. I sought advice as I've never managed people previously and needed guidance. No negative consequences ensued for that friend as a result of this conversation. This would have been info I would have obtained at a future point anyway in a review meeting. Friend 1 felt betrayed and has been frosty since. Friend 2 sided with them and acted similarly. I tried explaining my reasoning but friend 1 wasn't accepting of this.

Friend 2 began to be more aloof. With both friend 1 and 2 the majority of any decisions / delegated tasks I've made have been met with negativity, moaning, muttering overall despite any please, thank yous, explanations of purpose of the task or training offered. I've been as fair as I can be and always offer positive feedback and thank the team for their work. This is also with me consulting the team wherever possible. The remaining team members I manage have been quite positive in contrast.

I've gave them their space, I've tried to test the water with small talk but this is almost unanimously met with one word answers or stilted conversations. They have stopped saying hello and goodbye to me at work too and don't acknowledge when I say this to them either.

Now friend 2 has unfriended me on Facebook. Friend 1 has invited me to a pre wedding celebration event for friend 2. I feel like a line in the sand has been drawn and I'm clearly not a welcome guest at friend 2s wedding anymore. 

I've met friend 2 and their partner multiple times outside of work, they've came to my home, their partner specially selected food for me for the wedding to fit my dietary requirements. I feel hurt I've been unfriended and by the general behaviour in recent weeks. I would like to think we could have had a conversation if they felt so wronged by something to send such a clear message.

Do I bring up with friend 2 about not attending any of these things? As their manager I feel like this might not be appropriate. I want to tread carefully but I also feel like I owe the friends partner an explanation at least. If it were up to me I would have liked to work through these issues but I do get the sense that whatever way I behaved these friends were looking for an opportunity to drop the friendship since my promotion.

I met this guy who I instantly clicked with he's my absolute best friend. I love him to no extent and I'd die for him. I've known him for 2 years now. 

So the time came when I felt it'd be a good idea to introduce him to the girl I was madly in love with. Needless to say, huge mistake. He fell for her, she's a model and she's good at acting like the most amazing person on earth. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks and they meet up and she only talks about having sex. I told her before they knew each other that I wouldn't have sex before marriage and she went from ""being in love with me"" to ""I don't want to risk our friendship with a relationship and she is too scared to fall in love right now"" in the space of 2 days. So I can see who she really is, you don't see it until she wants you to, because all she wants is to fuck and duck. Don't give her that, then it's tickets for you. So Anyways, they meet up and she breaks his virginity and now he tells me he's madly in love with her and her with him. 

I said she shouldn't contact me because I don't want toxic people in my life and people who'll lead me on, let me fall in love with them and then not hesitate to shatter me. I've forgotten who I used to be because of her, I've already got depression and anxiety so I really don't need shit like that.

2 weeks after I stop speaking to her, and then I see her from a distance. I started to freak out and having a breakdown because I really missed her, she was my first love after all. My friend convinced me to talk to her, and after a thousand ""no's"" I finally caved in and spoke to her. That very night I ended up having my first ever panic attack, and it scared the crap out of me. I haven't spoken to her again, I blocked her on everything from instagram, to Facebook to whatsapp. I don't care how immature that sounds.

But now the problem is, that this guy is currently the only person who is keeping me going, but she is slowly tearing him away from me by speaking ill of me behind my back, saying I'm a toxic person and how her family hates me. Interesting fact, her family members constantly tell me they love me, so I don't know who's lying there. All I've ever done is be nice and I'm the only person that was ever there for her when she was down and feeling bad. I always comforted her and helped her get through her most stressful times, but she's that quick to tell him I'm toxic.

I love this guy, and I'm scared of losing hi

The business has been doing well and he has about 20 guys that work for him. However, because it’s a blue collar job, he doesn’t have incredibly high qualifications for his workers. He just wants them to be able to do the manual labor tasks and be presentable in front of customers and show up on time. Unfortunately, a couple times a year, he will have some guy get caught smoking weed on the job or someone who will get into an accident with his truck or have someone who will be caught by a customer not doing work and then report false hours. He gets mad but he acts as he should and fires them for things like this and sends them their last paycheck when it is due. That is what he did with this kid. The kid got his money, but he is still retaliating for being fired.

A little background on the kid: He’s 19 years old. He’s friends with my brother, which is why he got the job in the first place. My brother is 17 and really doesn’t have his priorities straight, but he hasn’t acted out on social media like the kid and his friends. 

What happened is that, after being fired, the kid posted on his Facebook to tell his friends to leave bad reviews on the businesses page. (My sister, who is friends with the kid, showed us and we have a screenshot of it.) All within 24 hours, but most were posted on 6/10 between 5pm and 9pm, a bunch of reviews appeared on the businesses Facebook and Google review page with 1 star ratings. All of the reviews who actually left comments don’t talk about the service, they just mention that the boss is a terrible person. Many of the ones on Facebook use vulgar language. Every single review on Google matches the names of people who reviewed on Facebook. Every single review submitted with a 1 star rating in that time period has a mutual Facebook friend of the kid that was fired. (I don’t think it matters, but I also noticed that every reviewer is under the age of 22, which I believe shows that they are not customers.) On top of that, the kids began leaving comments on any other reviews that gave the business good ratings and harassed the customers.

We submitted reports to Google and Facebook to have these removed, since you can’t delete them. I have only spoke with Google, and since reviews are considered freedom of speech, and none of the reviews have personal attacks, just profane insults, they will not remove them. I imagine the same will go with Facebook. My parents are seeking legal help. When googling what to do, I saw many other comments of people who experienced similar things with exes or angry old workers and were frustrated by the fact that they couldn’t get rid of reviews with lies or no comments.

Is there anything else we can do to remove these reviews? As vengeful as we’d love to feel against the kid, he’s an idiot. All of his friends that mindlessly follow what their friend wanted them to do are probably just as dumb, and we can only take pride that we are older and more well off than they are. I know this is considered cyberbullying/harassment but I also saw that other people mentioned that most courts don’t feel too strongly about social media against businesses. ",12Jul2017,3

 So the plan was I go out to this club tonight, party a bit, get drunk and then try to get with that girl but the guys I should've went out with cancelled on me and so the girl group I hang out with asked me to go with them, so now I'm kind torn, I want to go but I'm worried that if I go out with them and if I'm the only guy there I'll be more like the role of a feminine male friend than a dude that the girl I like might get with but that might be my insecurities acting up.

152,"How big of a deal is workplace harassment?


For a little over a month now, I've been dealing with a co-worker who is flat out trying to make my life miserable. I've noted several off-handed remarks, a general lack of communication from her in regards to work or otherwise, and a negative attitude &amp; physical approach towards me in general. Additionally, what I believe to be passive-aggressive attempts to undermine me at work. I have documented it all.


There have also been public (via social media) posts vaguely directed at me regarding work and the workplace. I deleted everyone from work off of all social media accounts (or so I thought), and I (regrettably) made a Facebook post that said, ""There's always an office bitch."" one afternoon after I was completely fed up. Keep in mind, this is the first and only thing I've done to ""retaliate"" in some way thus far.


I deleted the post the same day, as I thought more about it and realized I had posted irrationally. I've got a threshold for bullshit, you know!


However, apparently this co-worker had noticed I deleted her and was stalking my page to find anything incriminating. Not a day later, I was approached by management regarding my own Facebook post, and because it was so vague, I was given a warning. Now, at the same time, this gave me the opportunity to broach the subject with my managers about the behaviors that had been going on which led to my thoughtless Facebook post. They acted professional but understanding with the last word being to let them know if things didn't change for me. However, it was understood that the meeting was to reprimand me. Then they brought in the co-worker for a discussion of her own, about the same I presume.


Fast forward two weeks, and everything has been quiet until today when she made a Snapchat post with a quote about being a victim and her comment with it said ""ooo, I've got your number girl!"" I strongly believe this was meant for me again, but I'm trying not to be irrational and paranoid.



I let my supervisor know that something came up with her again, in very few words. Then, I received an email from HR with an ""ethics communication acknowledgement"". It directed me to a website where I can file an anonymous complaint about unethical behaviors, conflicts, or uncorrected errors.


I presume the company is giving me the opportunity to show my documentation regarding all of these happenings, but I am a little worried filing a complaint formally might backfire. PLEASE give me advice. Should I continue doing my best to ignore her and suffer in silence? Should I file this complaint? 


It has a drop-down menu for your ""issue details"", and there's a slot for ""harassment"". As I clicked it, I suddenly feared that claiming harassment is a HUGE deal, and I don't know if the things this co-worker has been doing to me are worth getting myself mixed up into a legal situation. For reference, I work in a corporate law firm.

Since typing the above, I've got my hands on a little more information-- I can defer my enrollment for quite some time and still keep my application, which solves that problem for now. As some people also suggested, I *did* look into local shelters, but I am not in a very good area and they couldn't help me. My family may be served an eviction notice soon, and be that the case, we will have absolutely nowhere to go and I will still be running the same track, just without even the hope that my step dad can vouch for my residency. We do not have family or friends aside from my step dad's sons, and they aren't in the position to house us if push comes to shove. At the same time, our unemployment case is being contested by my step dad's really awful ex-boss, who already was robbing us of a ton of benefits in a physically demanding job. Not having the money coming in from that is precisely what is nearing us to an eviction notice-- we're on food stamps for the time being so that aspect isn't too bad, but it doesn't do much when we have no place to stay.

We have no form of health insurance, no recent doctor visits...hardly anything. All I have to my name is my birth certificate and two expired (dependent) military IDs of which I am not certain they'd accept either at the DMV or at the Social Security office since they are no longer active. I think I can apply for a student ID through a third party, but I know for a fact that the DMV rejected my transcripts since it's online/out of state and I'm also, as stated in the original post, pending-graduation. 

I'm at my wit's end. I can't stay with distant friends because not only would it mean leaving crucial items behind, but it would void any work to get an ID-- with regards to my step dad signing for me unless said friends would be able to in his place. We're working on selling the only real furniture we have and I fear for my very old cat, who already hates moving as is..

I don't know what to do.

**tldr;** I do not have a Social Security card or an ID or any documents to work to get them-- the local shelters are no help. My step dad lost his job and we may be evicted soon with literally no where to go. Not sure what to do.",12Jul2017,1

161,"Hello, first time poster here.

A little backstory. Earlier this year I was having issues with the transmission in my 1999 Subaru Outback, which was given to me as a gift by my late grandfather about 7-8 years ago. I brought it to a local transmission shop, who quoted me between 2,500 and 2,800 to fix it. It wasn't worth it to me to fix, so my mother sold me her Volkswagen Tiguan -- she was planning to buy a new car anyway and knew I needed a more reliable car. My fiancee's mother offered to buy my Outback as is and fix it up so her younger daughter could learn how to drive. I made her aware of what had been fixed/replaced recently and what needed be fixed/replaced. She offered 300 dollars for the car, which I accepted. I have signed over the title and the car is off my insurance.

As it turns out, the final cost for the transmission repair ended up being a few hundred more than the original quoted price. I found out today that the car is back in the shop again, and it will take another $600 to fix. I'm at a loss because I feel like I sold them a money pit unknowingly. I offered to refund the money that my future MIL paid for the car because I feel like it should be put towards the repairs of the car. I paid nothing for the car originally and I feel like I'm profiting off her. She declined my offer, saying that she bought the car as is and that it will all work out. My fiancee has told me that she's just saying that because she doesn't want to screw me over.

I'm caught in between a rock and a hard place because while I genuinely want to refund her money, I also want to respect her wishes. What should I do? I'm marrying into this family next year and I don't want it to create tension between me and her family.",12Jul2017,2
163,"Hi guys. I have been working in the same company for 3 years now. I started at one position and after one year moved to a different one (similar to previous one, but at the same time quite different), so I've been doing similar tasks for about 2 years now. 

With time passing I've been given a bit more responsibility etc, I'm kind of leading my two peers and in direct everyday contact with the (foreign) customer. 

In general when I'm doing my stuff things are ok - there is no super rush, I'm not really having never-ending list of tasks that have to be done ASAP, I have time to get long lunch etc. There are things that are boring (of course) but at the same time you get some interesting (challenging) stuff from time to time. So there is time to be a bit chilled if you're having a bad day and at the sime time it's not super soul crushing due to work being so dull. 

The thing is that from time to time something goes wrong (either my/our fault or simply random stuff happening) and there is this guy that ALWAYS escalates problems and makes them seem super big. He's very aggresive in his communication at this point (""what is THIS SHIT that I found here?! What the fuck were those guys thinking"") and this makes me quite nervous. He's a senior to me, so I'm not really in a position to tell him to shut up or something. I'm not sure if I could tell someone 'well, this guy should put his thoughts into words a bit differently, maybe not yelling at people'. 

I think that if I were to look for a job it probably wouldn't be a problem to get one for the same paycheck or something. But is it worth it? I work with really cool people (other than this one dude), the hours are flexible and paycheck is good. If I change job maybe I'll be in some super stressful environment (no way to be chilled on a bad day)? Or maybe is it more of an issue about my reaction to these events?

165,"Hi everyone,

I am a high school student who started an internship about 2 weeks ago. I am enjoying what I do and having fun learning, but I don't know anyone and I haven't made any friends (or acquaintances).

My work environment is pretty quiet. There isn't much noise and its nearly silent most of the time. When someone speaks or makes noise, everyone else can hear them. As a result, I shy away from making conversation. Normally people are at their desk and I don't run into many people often (although I get up only to go to the bathroom since I don't drink coffee). 

There are undergraduate research students that work over the summer too, but my desk is positioned away from most of them. I sit next to two undergrad girls, and we have small talk and say hi to each other, but I don't get invited to go to lunch or anything. I just sit at my desk and eat (a step up from the start of my internship where I just skipped lunch). At the same time, I haven't asked if I can join them at lunch, because I am too shy. I never initiate conversation, I only jump into their conversations occasionally.

I am also the youngest one here as an incoming junior in high school (the undergrads are at least 3 years older than me), and I'm also very short. I feel like I don't belong there since everyone is older and more knowledgeable (I enjoyed programming until I got too busy to pursue it as a hobby, so now I feel like I'm not smart enough for this internship). It's also a new environment for me since I'm used to school and have never worked in a real desk job before.

This lack of communication is making me really lonely and bored (because what few friends I have from school are all out of town or busy). I wanted to become more assertive and sociable at the start of this internship, but I don't know how to do that anymore. I am enjoying what I do, but I dread going to work because of this.

For the first 1.5 weeks I was extremely busy, so I had to work nonstop, but now it has slowed down so I finish my work and have some time at the end of the day to spare. I don't have any work to do so I just sit there and play on my phone for a while. I don't have an excuse anymore. I want to make some friends.

I also want the most out of this internship, and that includes connections and increased social skills, but I can't get that if the only person I talk to is my boss/advisor. And I don't have a partner or a group, so I don't have anyone who I have to talk to. I don't need to talk to anyone, so I just don't. I feel like I'm missing out on a big part of this experience.

What do I do? What is allowed in the workplace? How do I make friends?",12Jul2017,2
172,"Fortunately, my car is still under factory warranty, and everyone seems fairly confident that it's something to do with the transmission (even the Ford dealerships, which also confirmed I'm still under warranty).

The bad news is that the only Ford dealership able to get me into a shop is going to be nearly 2 weeks out. I have a 30-45 minute commute every day, which means there's no uber'ing to work, and probably can't find someone to take me to work every day.

I called my insurance, but they said they only provide a vehicle if it's ""external damage"". They would pay for insurance on a rental, but not the day-to-day expense.

Now, on that last note, because my car actually *does* have ""external damage"" from an accident a few months ago. I haven't had it repaired yet, because the damage was purely cosmetic and I have a $1,000 deductible, so was planning to put it off until I was financially in a better position (and yes, the insurance is totally cool with that, I even confirmed as much today).

I'm wondering if I *could* have that repaired at the same time (the rear quarter-panel mainly, some damage spread out elsewhere). Although, I believe my insurance only covers rental for up to 2 weeks, and the previous damage alone was quoted to take roughly 14 *business* days (and I have no idea how long the transmission would take to fix, if they can even repair it at the *same* time). Even if it bled over the time that insurance would cover, I'd certainly rather pay for 4-5 days for a rental car than 2+ weeks.

I dunno. This is all making my head spin. I still have a shitton of work to do, which thankfully can be done from home, but I don't think my work would be so understanding to let me work from home for several *weeks*.

180,"I have an unusually severe latex allergy. My first big reaction was to a balloon at a birthday party. Shortly after, I started having reactions after eating out at restaurants. My allergist realized that I was likely reacting to latex particles shed from gloves used in the kitchen. My family called every restaurant I had a reaction at and, sure enough, they all use latex gloves in their kitchen. 

Latex is pretty much everywhere and I have done my best to deal with it. I can go without halloween face paint and latex body suits, but it's kind of frustrating to have to call restaurants ahead of time to ask about the latex situation. I live in Chicago and have found that 7-8 places I call out of 10 use latex or hang up on me because they misunderstand and think I am accusing them of not using gloves at all. It's also impacted my social life since I usually have to decline invitations to dine out with friends or demand that I pick a restaurant that I know is safe. Financially, a $50 dining experience has ended up costing $5000 in hospital bills on more than one occasion. Not trying to have a pity party... I have a great life all-in-all and have found ways to manage like bringing my own food to a restaurant where my friends are dining so that I can eat with them. Most restaurants are okay with this once I explain and show them this picture of my face http://imgur.com/a/jNic9.

Arizona, Rhode Island, Oregon, and Boston have passed legislation banning latex in restaurants, so I know there are other people out there with the same problem. I've wanted to find a way to bring this issue into the light, but I am clueless about where to start. I would appreciate any and all advice on raising awareness about this issue. I have had people tell me that it affects such a small minority of people that it's not worth trying to do something about, but as I learn more about latex allergy, it seems that the more people come into contact with it, the more likely they are to develop an allergy. This means kitchen workers are also effected. In fact, one of the initial reasons that hospitals stopped using latex was that they saw a higher rate of latex allergy in children that underwent multiple hospital procedures. 

Sorry for the lengthy post. Any advice is appreciated or if you think there's a more well-suited subreddit for this post, I would love to know as I am newish to reddit. Thanks!

184,My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year but we've only been having sex for about six months(my own personal reasons). I've noticed a monthly pattern that before my period he's all over me. After my period it's usually 1 - 2 weeks when we're not having sex with one of those weeks being the week of my period. Is this weird or something that I should be concerned about?

186,"Hello /r/Advice!

First of all, I've been trying to find a subreddit to post this to for a while. If you have an idea where to ask this, please let me know. If this is the wrong place let me know that too and I will remove it.

I am a 21 year old man that have had a tight foreskin all my life. I have been to ashamed to bring it up with anyone during all these years.
The last time I was at my doctors office I brought it up and was sent to an urologist. He said that I need to have my entire foreskin removed because just removing a part of it might leave really bad scarring and heal kinda ugly. So now I am scheduled to do a complete circumcision in the middle of August.

Is there anyone here that have been trough this same thing and know what changes I can expect? I am really nervous about it and would like to get my mind at ease about it. Does it itch a lot? Is it going to be uncomfortable, and for how long? When can I start having sex again and will I lose sensitivity?

Would appreciate if I could get an insight in how it's going to affect me, thanks in advance. And once again, sorry if this is the wrong place to post.",12Jul2017,10

I HATE this town with a passion.  It's farmland, too rural, zero culture, and boring.  When I finally moved out of that town 4 years ago and into a city townhouse, it was one of the best days of my life.

Moving back to the farmland now puts me in the position of driving 1.5 hours back to my city job only twice a week and the remaining 3 days are work from home days.

192,"I have worked very hard to get where I am. My parent's generation squandered a lot of opportunity by not going to college, using drugs, etc. They weren't wealthy but they were solidly middle class, but I grew up poor.

We're not white, either, and we live in the US, so there is a component of needing to toe the line and not be too uppity in certain social situations. But you also can't be too humble, or someone will think you are the maid and just give trash to you or ask you to get them a drink.

My kids have started to really absorb the attitudes of some of the children around here. They leave things on the floor, they leave their things around the public areas where they have lessons, etc. They don't always say please and thank you. They don't ask politely and if there is a mob instead of a line, they join it. They sulk when asked to help out (I don't expect a smile but sulking and pouting are out of line).

I'm frustrated and worried that I'm sacrificing my own life and health for nothing. I want to give them health care, education, and opportunity, but I know from experience that all that is worth nothing if you have a terrible character.

I have tried to explain to them that they can't act like that, that they don't have that level of privilege to be rude, uncouth, sloppy and just plain lazy.

They don't get it and it comes off sounding like I don't believe in them which isn't true. Or that I'm insulting their friends, and that's not true either, if you don't have to say please because you have cash more power to you, I'm not judging, we just aren't there. We can't just try drugs and expect no consequences because daddy will pay bail. That's not going to happen.

My working-class friends' kids don't act this way because they can see consequences every day. The well-off people I know don't worry about their precious kids because they know it will be fine. The people like me are few and far between and I don't know how they are managing it.

I asked her if she wanted to get a drink, and so we went to a fairly uncrowded bar and just talked. She seemed shy so I had to ask her all the questions and stimulate conversation. Things went well and about a week later we went hiking together, we had a better time as she seemed to open up more, and we had Chipotle after. She mentioned during hiking she loved pasta and bread so I took her the following week to an Italian restaurant, and again things seemed great. She laughed and smiled and it seemed like a genuine date. I'm not a very emotional guy so I guess I haven't been showing I'm interested? Idk.

199,"I'm not sure what to think or do. The man that I absolutely loved, the one that I truly believed was the one for me suffers from GID. Don't get me wrong I am completely supportive of him, I hold no judgement or resentment for being with him. In fact when I found out, I didn't care I wanted to be with him for who he was not who he thought he had to pretend to be. But he does not, and says that he cannot have me around like that. (At the time we were starting to live together) He said having me around caused too many problems, and feelings of anxiety and jealousy. Which I suppose I can understand. So after three years, and a lifetime of future plans, it ended. Just like that, with no warning. Sometimes I find myself very selfishly wishing this hadn't happened and that he and I could still happily be together, but I also know in my heart that that isn't right. At first, it was hard for me to get over the fact that we were talking about marriage, and having a family when this happened. But I want him to be happy more than anything. And as much as I wish that happiness included me in it, I can accept that it doesn't. Now I just want to be there to support him. He has had problems in the past with his family, so he does everything he can to hide it from them now. I can see him making himself miserable with anxiety, and guilt, and even shame. When I believe that he has nothing to be ashamed of. I think he is this amazing person, hell he helped me through so much myself. He's not the same happy person he was just a few months ago. And I hate to see him like this. I want to help him so badly but I don't think he is believing anything I say, if I am even saying the right things. I know a lot of what he needs only he can do or give himself. But I want him to at least know that I am here for him no matter what. Because I will always love him, and he will always be the one who took my heart. Even if in the future I end up having a family with someone else. I will be that person to stand by him and support him through anything and everything, and I will be that person that stayed there through it all. That's what I want to be. The friend that he can depend on for anything. And I truly mean anything. I would rather be in his life as his friend than not in his life at all. 

I'm not quite sure what the point of all that was. It's been weighing on me and I just needed to get it out there where someone who understands might be able to hear.

Also, I exaggerated when I told it. It actually sounds worse than it was, don't ask me why I did that either because I couldn't even say.

203,"I'm taking a summer course and have to share a room with an extremely annoying guy 3 years younger than me (he's 17).
Unfortunately we both ended up in the same friend group so every time I want to hang out with people I like I'm stuck with him. Now the others don't dislike him like I do, but they also don't know him as well as I do.
These are the reasons:
One night when drunk he insulted me in a way that hurt deeply. I don't usually get offended easily but what he said to me was by far the most hurtful thing that anyone ever told me in my life. However he apologized a day later, saying that he was just angry that he couldn't get into the club because he was underage and was taking it out on me.
Another thing is that he completely changes his personality when he's in a group of people. When I first met him he seemed like a nice guy, but now he acts extremely cocky and overconfident with a lot of ego. He makes jokes that aren't funny, and talks about how he's so strong and a ""pimp"" and how all girls like him, and tries to hit on the girls in our group.
Also, he really likes to gossip and talk shit about other people we know, and makes jokes at their expense when they're not around that he takes way too far.
Finally, he's completely desperate to fit into the group. For example, if he's with smokers, he starts smoking even though he knows that it's bad for him. He also comes from a very religious family but most of our group are atheists, so whenever we talk about religion, he insults and makes fun of religious people in a very mean way (even though his own family, and I think he himself is religious).
I do my best to be nice to this guy, but the more time I spend with him, the more irritated I get. Unfortunately none of my friends sympathize with me. They excuse his behavior on him being 17, saying that if anyone else did it it'd be wrong, but because he's the youngest, it's kind of cute and OK. They think that my own behavior is the unacceptable one because I'm apparently not nice enough to him.
I guess maybe if he hadn't insulted me so badly before I could tolerate the rest but now with everything together, he really drives me crazy. So I'd like to know, do you think this is normal behavior for a 17 year old away from home for the first time or am I right to be angry?",12Jul2017,2

I'm male 21, and she's 21 too.
For the sake of privacy, my name is, say, Dolph; and hers is Emma. 
I met Emma through a social networking site in July 2016, and we got to know each other by exchanging text msgs. We later exchanged numbers and continued communicating. I initially started to have feelings for her, but then I realised it was just platonic affection, as I'm kind of a loner, and don't have nice friends. Later, she began to like me a lot, and after around a 2-3 weeks, she said she loved me. I said I didn't feel the same about her, and that my love for her was platonic. 
It's a really long story from there till today (July 12, 2017), but to summarise; she's deeply in love with me, and over the course of the one year, I've tried to develop feelings for her, yes, you read that right. I actually tried to, because I knew, or at least, I thought I knew that I'd be happy with her. The platonic love and care was always there, but nothing more, yet I somehow tried to see past it, and I told her that I felt the same way about her too. This happened around 1-2 months back (note : a lot happened before that, but I'm sticking to just this much. If anyone's eager to know more, I might consider writing in detail). 
Bottom line, I backed out around 2 weeks ago. 
I feel terrible, and I totally accept that I did terrible things. But I never EVER intended to hurt her. I was just stupid in the way I did this. All I can do now, is make sure I don't repeat such a thing ever again. 
I pray that she'll be alright. I know I broke her heart. I care about her so much.

They're offering $9/hr start with a $1 raise pending completion of a bit of computer learning AND at manager discretion. They're offering 28-33hrs per week and according to everyone in management, it's not hard to move up in the company.  The insurance they offer is a plus, but I won't be elligible for a year.

On the other hand, there's a state park hotel nearby that has offered me a position at the front desk during the day for $9.85/hr to start. The hours are mostly set at 30-35/week, but there are no benefits and moving up depends on lifers transferring out or retiring, which rarely happens. I enjoy talking to clients and working with people in that type of environment, but unfortunately the clientele is mostly elderly and the other employees don't seem to have much personality.

The plan was only to stay with one of these 2 positions until I can finish my web development training so I can do what it is I really love or until a better offer comes along, but neither one seems particularly suited to me over the other and I'm out of time...I had orientation at Walmart this morning and got my smock and everything as an official employee and the hotel wants me to start tomorrow when I'd be at Walmart otherwise.

I was banned for life because an employee thought I was impersonating a ride operator at the park. So I was asked not to come back on private property  with my family, They revoked my gold season pass and sent me the check in the mail a few weeks later with a trespass letter saying I would be arrested if on private property.  I'm just a customer who waits in line like everyone else when little do I know how to oporate a roller coaster. It was a completely un called for when they sent me to customer serviceI and gave me A life ban scentance.  
All right guys! This all happened during one of there most buisest days ever on a weekend on September 11th of last year. Me and my family were enjoying a nice day at the park in St.Louis me and my sister were waiting in line to ride BatMan it was about a 1 hour wait so we decided to just stay in line keep in mind this is ealry afternoon anyway we were about to enter the station when we saw two security guard s walking to check if everyone was ok and if we needed water most parks don't do that i Believe  Anyway they said that this is our most buisest we have ever seen the park and exceeded over capcity the park can hold with guest i think he said somewere over 26,000 people there that day. So they said to me and my sister please remove yoursellves from the que please and come with us to customer service your in big trouble! I was shocked like what did i do wrong i didnt talkt to any guest i didnt know I didnt bother anyone. As we made our way through CS They were asking me why i was trying to impersonate a ride oporator and why i was wereing a blue shirt. I told them this is Sonic The Hedgehog he is not a DC charater he belongs to the Sega of Japan and America deal with them! They went on about there guest safty regulations and how i broke the law under oth. If any of you decide to visit a Six Flags Park beware of what type of shirts you plan to take. This all happened because of a stupid shirt from Sega. If i was wearing A lets say for example A Cradle Of Filth aka Death Metal Band from the 90's shirt thats really offencive then I would have understood the ban policy but Sonic seriously? Even other guest were concerned and saying how is his shirt A Six Flags employee shirt it's from a cartoon series on tv thats not DC related or employee related so I'm wareing A BatMan shirt does that make me a criminal too?Everyone was angry at the situation and some even started leaving due to their stupitity so again if a mirical does happen of them saying sorry i'm gonna have to say do to you display of public humiliation i'm not going back to either one of your parks. So remember always ware apropriate clothing at all times while visiting any Six Flags Park. I want to hear feom you guys what are some better and safer parks to vist this summer?

I have been taking classes on and off for the duration of my time with Starbucks, but haven't been able to settle on a direction to go in so I've been content with my job at Starbucks until recently. 

Upon moving to the bay area, I found out that my pay was being dropped $1.50/hr due to it being a different market (That's a whole separate issue.) I've realized that it is time for me to make a change and find something better for me in the long run. After putting in numerous applications to place after place, it looks as though I'm going to have two offers on the table. The first is T-Mobile. I've done three interviews with them and I am expecting them to call me later with information on starting my training. The pros that I can come up with for this job are as follows:

* The earning potential of an hourly plus commission job
* Top of the line benefits including a discounted phone plan
* Growth potential within the company
* Commute mileage is reimbursed (you'll see why this is important in the cons section)

* The store I would be going to itself can be anywhere from a 45 minute drive to an hour and a half, depending on the traffic. 
* I would not be able to transfer closer to my area for at least 6 months, depending on availability of course
* Full-time hours and commission sales are not guaranteed
* Retail job

The other job that I am in the process of interviewing for is for an assistant property management position with an apartment community. I was very fortunate to have gotten an opportunity for thanks to my girlfriend's mother who works for a job placement company. I have completed one interview already and was told to expect a second interview and background check to follow. The pros of this job would be:

* Much closer than the T-Mobile job, 30-45 minute drive depending on traffic
* A *steady* income with good benefits
* Potential to turn into a career in property management
* A much more consistent 9-5 schedule that aligns almost perfectly with my girlfriend's schedule

Cons...

* Not as much earning potential
* No prior knowledge of the property management field, so no idea what to expect or if I'll even enjoy it
* Never worked in office environment

The most important things to me are a livable wage, a consistent schedule, and career growth opportunity. I never thought I'd be in a position where I'd be torn between two jobs. This decision could very well decide how the next 5, 10, 15 or so years of my life go, so any outside perspective on this would be greatly appreciated.

222,"Hello r/advice! I'm feeling a bit stuck. 

So here's some context:

I'm 20, female, and going into my junior year of college. 

I started college with the dreams of being a game designer, and specifically searched for colleges with a game design program. Ever since I was a child I gave been fascinated with games, their artwork, their mechanics, everything. I would read gaming magazines and blogs like they were the Bible. I *adored* games, and adored them even more when I was frequently hospitalized between first and fifth grade. I would use games as an escape, and I would often play a game for so long that I would know it inside and out. 

I started college two years ago for game design, and for the most part I enjoyed my time. I loved classes where we discussed the mechanics and logistics and history of games, yet I was never good at classes that required programming. I've always loved art, writing, and drawing from a young age, so whenever it came time to create games, I would be the artist or the writer, but I would never touch the code. In classes where I have to do code, artwork, level design, music design, all of it on my own, I often fall behind those who can program but can't draw; I'll have a beautiful non-functioning mess while they have a basic looking functioning game of squares and rectangles. 

What I'm looking for advice on is if I should switch majors, or if it's too late for me. I'm heading into my third year, I'm already registered for classes, and I've already established friends within my major. However I can't do it all, despite seeing others around me being able to do everything just fine. Am I doomed to be a one trick pony for game development? Is it too late for me to switch to some kind of art major? Should I switch to a ""real job"" major like business so accounting so I don't end up jobless and in a bunch of student debt? What should I do? ",12Jul2017,1
225,"So there's this girl, and I fell hard for her almost two years ago.  After asking her out on a date last year, she declined because she wasn't looking for a boyfriend and she was in a bad place mentally/emotionally.  However, afterwards I behaved rather horribly.  Cards on the table, I was an absolute jerk to her.  I can blame that on many things (peer pressure, my therapist telling me to give off the impression i would rape her nicely in order for her to be attracted to me...), but I took full responsibility for my actions.  I apologized to her this past spring, saying I was a jerk and made her uncomfortable and that I really messed up and wanted to apologize.  Since then, things have been better between us, and she's gotten a lot more comfortable with me.

After being away at college for a year, I've tried everything to forget about her: overloading myself with multiple activities, classes, and jobs, finding other girls, blah blah blah.  But nothing's worked.  I've never felt this way about someone else before, and I'm at the end of my rope.  I want to ask her out, to see if maybe we can try again seeing as we're both in better places now.  But I don't want to lose her completely if that goes south.  She's going to school six hours away from me, and so I'm running out of time. 

I guess I just need advice.  What should I do?  Should I forget and move on, or should I try to actually do something?",12Jul2017,0

227,"For some background English is my main language. I have spoken it for as long as I can remember. However my mom is from Pakistan she grew up speaking Urdu and from a very young age and so she wanted the same for me. However for as long as I can remember I really didn't see the point in it or learning any language for that matter other than Arabic since I used to be a Muslim (I stopped taking Arabic classes when I was eight and so I forgot and now that I am a Christian it brings back memories I don't like even hearing Arabic.) But a year ago I was listening to Hello Internet #7 where the main focus of the episode was about foreign languages where one of the cohosts called CGP Grey said that if English speakers have to learn a foreign language then they should choose a language that not many people know and so there will be a high demand for that language or something like that. A few months later I was in the gifted and talented program at my school and we were reading a book called Number the Stars, a book that is set in Denmark (that book has negative connotations in my mind since I didn't like working on the gifted and talented project for it) but while the author was describing the Danish countryside I said that it looked beautiful and so I started to think more and more about learning Danish in high school when I presume it is compulsory to learn a language. But in May of this year I got a girlfriend and she knows Greek. So I felt I should do something about this language thing sooner than I expected (I don't remember my reasoning beyond that) so I decided to act on this Danish thing. So I downloaded an app and I remember a few words (hej,  Hej Hej, tak, Velbekomme, lægger and Dansk) but I left that at that. Between now and then I learned a Polish curse word (kurwa) and a French curse word (putain.) Now I am wondering what language would be most valuable to an English speaker.",12Jul2017,3

I want to ask her out, but we've hardly known each other and I feel like she sees me only as a friend. We talk a bit  in class and in texts but it's mostly about school and I usually have to initiate it.

I have been searching for an actual job for the past 2 months. The only call back I have received is for a part time job at a department store making 8 bucks an hour, 12 hours a week. I'm not sure If I want to accept it or if its okay to keep waiting for something more reasonable to come along. My last job was over $10 an hour. I have to pay about $2,500 out of pocket each semester for school so I'm afraid this job won't cut it but I don't want to seem lazy or like I don't want to work by declining it. I don't have many bills at this time but still need some money. I'm also afraid to accept it because it will reduce my availability for other better potential jobs.

I dread the idea of being a controlling partner, but my girlfriend has this old friend who has outright stated to ""just not like me"" when we met. Fine, whatever, don't care. But when being around them was unavoidable, they were just dickish -- trying to cut me off, passive aggressive mocking, that kinda silly shit. We had our own unproductive convo about that but when I saw it was a lost cause i just cut my losses.

But my girlfriend still hangs with them sometimes. She points out their social skills are kind of low and maybe we just are too different to understand each other.

237,"The main problem is that my number is on Google, Craigslist, and my website.  It's both my personal and business phone because I'm a DJ.  I answer every call I get because it could be a client.

So, I think it's the same company calling me each time.  They've got some very realistic robo-callers that even say they're not robots when you ask.  One is ""Ashely"" from Uber.  I got pissed off and yelled at the computer to fuck off one morning when it called me, and it responded that I'd be added to the do not call list, but it called back a few hours later.  At that point I just said yes to everything the computer asked, got to speak to a represenative, and politely told them the system is incredibly obnoxious, waking me up in the morning, calling multiple times per day, and I'm absolutely not interested in what they're selling.

The second is ""Robert"" from some job company saying I recently applied to one of their jobs.  I've applied to one job recently at a place I used to work at, and I know beyond any doubt that it's a blatant lie because not only have they called three times, but the place doesn't use any system even remotely like that.  I tried going through the process with Robert this morning, but said no when it asked for my email.  This made it hang up on me.  When I called back, it was a different message along the same lines, and said that I could contact customer support by emailing ""customerservicein2014"" at something dot com.  I haven't done that.  But IDK how to reach an actual representative over the phone.

How can I stop these fucks from calling me?  Ashley hasn't called in a day so I think maybe they actually did add me to the do not call list, but Robert is still calling and I can't block the number because it calls from a different number each time.

238,"Help. Me and my old friend wanted to be roomates/housemates. We found a two bedroom basement apartment leased by the owner.I moved in after a few weeks and she moved a few weeks after me.Since i was alone in the first few weeks, i asked my boyfriend around to help around the house (fixing things and whatnot).She saw him in my room and told me to ask permission first before i invite somebody in.I do understand that she might not be uncomfortable with him because she never met him before that.

As Time pass by,she met a kid in her work and broke up with her old flame. The kid started staying in the apartment while i stayed more on my bf's pad than mine. Because i juggle alot of stuff outside the apartment (parents,bf,long shift work,part time school,hobby and gym) I never realized when the kid started moving in until after a few months they said that he will pay 1/5 of the rent since he doesn't have a room anyway. 

One of the evidences that he stays there were the used condoms that got mixed up with the garbage that was eaten by wild animals. (When i told her that we never used one because i have bcp, i never saw another one again. Oops)

After a few more months again she told me she is pregnant.She keeps on asking me if my bf was asking me to move in with him.She also have passive aggressive comments about my stuff, food and slowly crowding our common area (putting large baby things in the really really small dining/kitchen area).She even said that she was considering asking her mom to come in our apartment to help her with the baby (understandable) but when i asked her where would her mom would sleep she pointed the small couch beside our garbage can and said she'll make a makeshift room. 

Since my boyfriend knew about my ordeal, when i asked him if i can move in with him. He gladly said yes. I already told the owner when i paid the rent and i was planning to tell her too.Bf told me i could do it 2 weeks before i move out because they never cared about me anyway  - (i disagreed because i wanted them to be financially ready if they are welcoming a baby ) turns out he's right. When i told her she said they were planning /trying to find a right word/moment to tell me that (like what? To ask me to move out? That they will move out? She left the phrase very vague). 

I'm slowly moving my stuff to bfs house and i'm now following his suggestions. I will definitely get every little thing in this house. 

Did i do the right thing? 

I heard a co-worker who went the same thing that it was awful on first years and annoying on the following years after because she was the non paid nanny for the baby and the baby would always wake her up with cries on her workdays. And now the kid would always mess up the common room and breaks her furniture. 

Did i do the right thing? If you were in my position what would you likely do?

239,"I am currently enrolled in a PharmD program that starts this fall, but I don't know if I want to do it. I feel with all my heart that I want to be a physician, but I also feel that ship has sailed. A couple of times through my 2 undergrad years I made the decision to switch, but then I thought about my soon to be wife, she wants kids and a family ASAP and just waiting the 4 years for pharmacy school is hard enough for her, let alone the 6-7 she'd have to wait if I attended medical school . 

I am now, again, doubting my decision to just go with the pharmacy degree and be done with it. I have absolutely zero doubt that I would be successful in either program, but I've vested so much of my time into pharmacy (currently 2 pharmacy tech jobs that I've had since I was 18, now 21, and all the fees, study, etc.) my family and my fiancee would be furious at me for making them bear all the weight that comes with the intense schedule that comes with med school and being a physician.

Is it something to worry about? I've never seen any bruises on her, but obviously if there's a threat of violence it's still worrisome.

If I should intervene, how do I go about it? Do I speak to my other friends and see if they've noticed (they'll probably say I'm overthinking it)?

Do I speak to him? Do I speak to her? I don't know her nearly as well and have never been in her company without my mate.

253,"So for some context; I knew my boss had basically been flirting with / texting all girls who worked there that were around the ages of 17 and 18. Hes 40 and at the time had a wife and 3 kids. I was at a coworkers wedding about 3 years ago and I was fucking hammered. 

I was getting with this girl well call Doris, and she got a message from him that was sleazy, like I said I was hammered so I don't really remember exactly what it said. 

However I ever so bravely offered to reply, A memory that makes me cringe to this day. I took Doris's phone and gave him a load of shit calling him out on his ways with my mighty youthful knowledge of everything and gave it back to Doris. (Doris never had any repercussions from this) 

So now I'm back at that job again over the summer before I go back to university again and the boss I sent the text too hasn't got a clue I sent it, but I've grown to respect him a lot more as a person and realized that the text I sent was uncalled for and I didnt know the shit that was going down with his home life at the time. The other day I had a couple mates I work with come chill and they brought up the text just in passing conversation, l shat a brick immediately but soon realized they had no Idea I sent it either. They were saying how angry he was about it when he got it and he's been trying to figure out who it was for ages. They pinned it on this other guy who doesn't work there anymore so he never got fired or anything, but I still feel like I should tell my boss it was me and apologize, however I'm also worried this will cause unnecessary tension as I think he's pretty much forgotten about it now.

Sorry for the mammoth read Im just having a dilemma right now and would love some advice from Reddits utopia of knowledge, but here's a cheeky Tldr anyway

TLDR: Sent boss angry drunk text, doesn't know it was me, found out I was wrong to do so, do I apologize even though he's probably forgotten it?

255,"So, I graduated from college in 2014 with an art degree, got my art-related dream job in mid-2015, but got laid off in early 2016 due to the company closing. Luckily, my family owns a business, so I've been able to work there while I've been actively looking for another job. I've been getting interviews, but no offers. I've also been working at a grocery store since March, but the job is just a ""job"" - definitely not a career - and doesn't pay well at all. I'm very much looking to get outta here as soon as another opportunity arises.

Well, a friend of mine reached out to me a few days ago offering me an admin assistant job at her family's small health-focused business (small as in, it's my friend, her parents, and another assistant). The job pays much better than the grocery store and offers typical full-time benefits, but doesn't offer health insurance, which will be a big deal when I get kicked off my parents' insurance next year. They'd offered me a similar position about a year ago, but I didn't take it due to similar reasons I'm about to explain...

There are two things holding me back from accepting her offer: I'm not sure if I would find the job very fulfilling and I don't think it's what I want to do long-term, and I'm currently in the process of applying for a job that I'm VERY excited about that I feel I am very qualified for (we'll call it ""Ideal Job""). Ideal Job is accepting applications for the next two weeks, so interviews probably won't even begin until August, and who knows how long the interview process will take. My friend would like to fill her position she offered me as soon as possible.

My ultimate goal is to find work at a non-profit or a government job, which Ideal Job is (not really interested in art anymore as much as I was in college, although Ideal Job would tie in to my degree in a few ways). Normally, I would accept the job I was offered and bail down the road if I ended up getting Ideal Job, but I know this family very well - some of the nicest people you will ever meet - and I'd feel terrible accepting the offer if I know I'm willing to jump ship shortly after getting hired should a better opportunity arise. At the same time, I can't really say, ""I'd love to accept your offer, but I've gotta be honest...you're kinda my second choice.""

I know my friend's family would like someone to work there for least a year. Well, I'm going to be 26 in October, and so many of my friends have already had 2 or 3 jobs out of college that align with their career goals. Imagining myself at 27 no closer to my goals career-wise is very depressing, but I feel like I'm not in a position to be picky with jobs and I should just accept the job I was offered and see what happens. Regardless if I get Ideal Job or not, I do plan on continuing searching for a non-profit/gov job.

258,"I met a girl awhile ago on an outing with school, we talked for awhile and made friends somehow through my terrible social anxiety. We continued to talk on snapchat and Facebook. We were getting along really good and I was learning more about her and I was going to ask her to meet up some weekend to do something. 

The problem is she stops talking to me mid conversation a lot, we would be talking and then she will see the message and not respond. I thought maybe she forgot the first time but now it seems like to much of a coincidence to not be intentional. I really like her and want to talk to her more but when she stops talking to me it makes it hard. I don't think she dislikes me because we are going to a school ball together.

Maybe she doesn't like me anymore and wants to cancel going with me. I asked her a few times if she wanted to meet up to do something and she ignored one of the messages and was busy the other times. She also said she would text me when she was leaving to go into town but she never did in the end.

Is the friendship hopeless? Have I done wrong something to make this happen?

262,"I have recently been promoted to supervisor for a residential home care service. I work alongside one other employee on my scheduled hours. The employee who works with me does nothing and I have had my fill. I have received consistent complaints about her prior to working with her and I am now understanding the issues. It's been 2 months or so now and nothing has changed. 

The issue at hand is that she simply does nothing. Our services include bathing the clients, changing their soiled briefs, meal prep, medication administration, feeding the client if necessary, diabetes injections, basic house keeping....the list continues. Basically, everything you would do for an infant who is severely ill. 

The location in which we provide services has 3 clients. They are each full care and require utilizing a Hoyer and such. Between all 3 clients, I do everything by myself. I never receive any assistance from her even when she is prompted. I will ask her to change a client and she will claim she did. When I go to check behind her...the client has feces all over themselves and their bedding. If I ask her to bathe a client she will take them into the restroom, stay in there for roughly 10 to 15 minutes and say she showered them however when I check their hair..it isn't wet and they still smell of body odor. 

I have attempted to correct the situation myself and she sees me as a friend instead of her supervisor. I am not the type the supervisor that gives demands in a harsh way and I give chances, maybe more than I should, so maybe that is why she sees me as a friend. 

Tomorrow, my supervisor is stopping by so that we can do an in service, which is basically a contract stating what she needs to work on as a staff member in our home otherwise corrective action will take place. I have anxiety about this as I've never had to do it but it needs to be done. I am not sure how to start the conversation or how to word what I want to say in a professional manner. Any suggestions? 

Should I compose a few key points of things I would like to see her work on? Should I create an outline for all of us to have so that we are on the same page?",12Jul2017,1
263,"So I'm in a foreign country for a few more weeks and a colleague of mine and I have been hitting it off for a few weeks now. We always manage to find each other around the office and ask dumb questions, yada yada yada. But I managed to ask her out today. She did say maybe as work is quite stressful and she's just not sure she has the time this week, but I wanted to do something for her as she's done so much for me. She's made me feel comfortable in a foreign land, less lonely, helped me with the language, and has just saved me from awkward situations with other people and my bosses. She's the romantic type, flowers, compliments, romantic dates, the whole 9 yards, so I wanted to write her a letter, just kind of saying how I know this week is stressful but I would to get to know her more out of the office and if she needs anything to just contact me, nothing too major. Is this a good idea, or is it just dumb and I'll ruin what we've built so far?

TL;DR: girl and I have hit it off, obvious interest from both parties, work is busy, we want to hang out after work but no time, write her a letter?¿?¿",12Jul2017,1
265,Further details/thoughts! It's a very small wedding (~100 people). I'm assuming that the wedding party will be at their own table  and I'll be seated separately from my boyfriend. Normally that wouldn't be a problem since I'm close with his parents and relatives but they'll also be busy with the celebrations/photos. Any advice on how to best deal with this? I'm an extroverted introvert so these events are a hit or miss for me in terms of talking with strangers ,12Jul2017,1
