2,"Hi I'm 16 (male) and my mum found a condom (not used) on my bedroom floor and wants to talk to me about it. There's also a box of them but I don't think she's found them. I have them because me and my girlfriend are planning on having sex, but I can't tell my mum this because she's like a really strict Catholic. So do you guys have any believable lies I can tell her as to why I had the condoms, because at the end of the day, the truth will hurt everyone more. A small lie is better than a painful truth.

5,"I've always been discouraged from leaving my house. Throughout elementary and middle school I couldn't go to any of my friends houses or to any after school events. Every time I made an attempt only resulted in fights between either me and my mother where I'd be talked into not going or my mother and my grandparents where I'd be told they couldn't do it and I had to just stay home. By the time I reached high school I just rarely asked because every time I did they said no. I've never gotten to regularly interact with people outside of school. Problem is, I graduated high school in 2015.

I don't have any life experience to speak of. I've never dated, honestly never kept up a friendship, and I usually spend my days in one of two rooms in my house. I rarely even go outside. I know we all joke about it on reddit, but I genuinely go weeks without setting foot outside my house. I barely talk to people that I don't live with.

I have a shit ton of anxiety and I don't have a lot of contact with the people who were my friends in high school. I'd like to make new friends. I'd like to be able to get out of the house. I'm starting to get to this point where I'm afraid of the outside world and I don't want to be. It feels pathetic to say, but the only things keeping me feeling like life could probably still be worth living even though I've wasted like a fifth of it are r/wholesomememes and fanfiction. Otherwise I'd have eaten a bottle of pills a long time ago. 

The worst part is that while I currently work from home, my family expects me to be able to just get a job and be fine doing it. I freak out trying to talk to cashiers, I barely get any exercise, and I can barely handle leaving the house three days in a row. I barely even do things *in* the house.

Can anyone please help me? I want to get my shit together and actually have a life, but I'm not sure where to start. I just kind of feel really alone.",13Apr2017,2

My supervisor then pulled me into his office stating i was stirring up drama and a disappointment to him because i was trying to cause discourse in our department by talking to this person. I tried to say that wasnt my intention and he said i was bullshitting him. He went on continually insisting i have no right to talk to this employee and that that employee in particular is a problem starter and i knew that, which i said i really wasnt thinking about any of that and didnt really know that but my boss doesnt believe me, i tried to explain he literally asked me what happened and i told him. He said i should have been embarrassed of my errors so why would i share it. As i said above i literally was incorrectly charged. Wtf?

8,"Lemme clear up a few things first. We're both 17, seniors in high school. Obviously, I like them, a lot, and I've told them this quite a while back. They don't want a boyfriend right now nor have they ever had one, but they said quote ""That doesn't mean never"" and have remained good friends with me since. Anyway, moving on.

Me and her have been talking quite regularly (almost everyday) for about a year and a half now, but we've known each other for probably close to three years. I only know them online, but, as I eventually found out, they only live about 45 minutes from me. (Which I think is driving my mind to think a relationship could actually work, as opposed to people I've met online before that have lived in different states or even countries) Anyway, point being, we have a strong two-way connection, and ultimately, they're what makes me the happiest in my day to day life.

Unfortunately, by them being my major source of happiness, I think I depend on them far too much. And, as a result, when they're away or busy or hanging out with other friends, I begin to get extremely anxious and jealous. As I'm typing this it's actually happening, she has a couple of her friends over for a sleepover and as a result has been gone since last night.

I know it's wrong, but I can't stop myself from dwelling on it. Especially since one of their friends (who I follow) posts videos on their Instagram Story, which serves as a constant reminder. It's a big problem, especially because I know she doesn't feel the same way about me. When I hang out with my friends, I pretty much know for a fact she doesn't get upset like I do. 

What can I do about this? I know its an unhealthy behavior, but I don't have anyway to stop myself from developing such an attachment to them. I've talked to counselors about this, nothing has worked. I try to distract myself, but its only a matter of time before I remember and start overthinking again. I even started taking anxiety meds about a week ago in hopes that it might calm some of these (and other) anxious feelings, but so far it hasn't done any good. As you can see, I'm at a bit of a dead end here. If any of you have some suggestions I would greatly appreciate it. 

TL;DR: I'm in love with someone I met online, and because of our strong friendship, I get extremely jealous when she hangs out with her IRL friends. I know its wrong, but I don't know how to stop it and would like some help from an outside source.",13Apr2017,1

15,"Throwaway account for saftey.

A opportunity has come up (due to another unrelated court case I am a witness for) for me to report and charge my abusive ex. He was extremely abusive to me.

He did a number of things i really should of reported at the time. Pysical, mental and sexual abuse. From.. locking me in cuboards and the laundry room for a up to a day, hurting my cat infront of me to make me cry and then punching me or slamming my head into the wall for crying about it. He strangled me when angry, suffocated me ""for fun"", and got angry at me when I was upset, saying he was just joking. He would often force himself in me anally, however I never said no and instead cooperated with him because I was too scared not to but i would be crying the entire time (so idk if that counts as rape or not, but close I think) and I was very, very sore after. He would chase me with knives, he found it funny because I have a phobia of sharp objects and it would cause me to have panic attacks, he loved that. He would starve me for days because there wasn't any food in the house, and when he felt like eating he had to grab ""just"" a sandwich or something else he ""hated"" and so because he wasnt able to enjoy his food I wasnt aloud ANY. I lost alot of weight, I was pale and sick all the time. He forced me to come to the bathroom with him and then smell his faeces from his toilet roll he just wiped with. Whenever left a room he would hold me by the throat and tell me he'd kill me if I told anybody what he did. He enjoyed doing all this to me which is what disturbed me the most, half the time he wasnt even angry, he just loved doing this stuff. One time when I was giving him oral he pissed in my mouth and laughed when I chocked and gagged, again passing it off as ""just a joke"". He liked to be able to control me and got off on knowning he could get away with anything, so he cut my side slightly and would hold my waist under my top whenever we were in public so he could pick at the wound and cause me pain in plain view of everybody and know I couldnt say or do anything. One time I ended up with a UTI that was very bad and I needed medication however he hated that i got ""drugs"" and he didn't so he took all of them every day, of course this meant my UTI got worse and i eventually ended up in hopsital with a kidney infection.

All of this has completely and utterly messed me up mentally. Its been YEARS and I still have nightmares most nights about it all. I've been way way way to terrified to report any of this in the past.
I feel like I could maybe be brave enough now this chance to report him as arisen, But the issue is I was around 13 at the time (I am 21F now) and he was 15, so he was underage and i don't know if he could get in trouble still for anything he did when he was still pretty much a child. Also it's been so long I don't know if they can even charge him, it's not like I still have brusies I can show or anything, and I managed to gain my weight back.

Also he is very dangerous.. everybody who knows him belives he is a pyscopath, He abused animals all his life, he never feels any kind of remorse for ANYTHING, and loves causing pain to living beings and people. He molested his younger brothers, and he has an explosive anger problem, and got taken away from his mother because he pretty much tried to kill his stepdad with a knife. I've had girls come to me after being with him for a few months telling me he did the same to them also, so he's still at it. This makes me want to report it more, but also makes me even more scared...
basically.. can much actually be done if I pressed charges at this point, or would it be safer to just leave it? I have no doubt that if he got let off for it he was be SO angry at me and come after me. Im in the UK.

Thank you for reading, sorry if this is all over the place, I'm very stressed atm.

tl;dr: Very abusive ex from when we were young. He was only 15 at the time and could come after me now. Unsure if is it too late and/or unsafe to press charges.",13Apr2017,3

24,"Hello all,

A bit of background: I am an early 20s male relocating to the Los Angeles area for school. At the time of writing, I have about a month and a half to leave home. I have always been serious when it comes to my goals and aspirations, and consider myself very levelheaded and adaptable. I know LA like the back of my hand, and also understand roommates are necessary here probably more than most other big cities.

It is worth noting that I have friends and family in the LA area that I have the option of living with for a finite amount of time until I get on my feet. 

For about six months, I have been hyping up to one of my best friends the idea of moving to California for more opportunities in our respective fields (I am a GIS student, he is in radio/media promotion). However, I have lately realized that not only do his and my ideas of living in an apartment differ, but also that he may not be the ideal candidate to share a space with in terms of financial security and general privacy/ambience. This is nothing against my friend, I just believe him and I are on a different wavelength of seriousness in this entire endeavor. I have saved almost all of my cash from months of working to transition, while he remains passive and claims he will have x amount by y time, which I do not believe will be the case. We recently both got back from a trip to LA (stayed with my friends in the area noted above) but I honestly felt a growing dislike towards his entire attitude. One of my options is to bring my friend with me, stick it out, and lease an apartment in my name in LA for the benefit of more privacy and being able to call it ""my place."" The downside to this is that I'm more than likely going to resent my friend and his lifestyle, or he may not be able to put up his end of the rent every month.

On the other hand, the student rental market is always hot and I think it'd be relatively easy to find a room in LA. The shared apartments will be in nicer areas, closer to my school, and contain more amenities. The obvious downside of this is less privacy and the risks associated with living with practical strangers. However, I am leaning more heavily towards this option every day.

If I should head out on my own, how do I let my friend down easy and explain that this is my life decision? If I bring him with me and rent my own place, how do I manage life with a former friend/roommate?

Thank you all in advance.",13Apr2017,1

32,"Some background info first.
I am a teenage girl. A boy, who I will call K, goes to my school and started talking to me a few months ago. Things escalated and it became obvious that we liked each other.

Skip to around two weeks ago. By this time, I had lost interest in him and believed he was in a relationship with someone else. I said I was done talking to him, blocked his number, and I thought that was that.

The next day I had dozens of missed calls, and he messaged me through another app saying he was going to kill himself. I freaked out and texted him nonstop asking him if he was OK. He answered with, ‘’finally, you answered.’’ He told me the day before he tried to kill himself, but was caught before he could do so. I was so frantic I couldn’t stop apologizing and crying. He said it was OK, but I was still hysterical. 

For the next week, I felt dead. I couldn’t muster up any energy to get out of bed or talk to anyone because of what I had done. Eventually, I started wondering if he was telling the truth. He was completely fine after that, and when school started again (after spring break, this was all during break) he was his regular self. Even though I was starting to see some holes in what he said, I still believed him.

Now, I know I shouldn’t be talking to him because I shouldn’t be stuck with someone I don’t want to be with. I’ve tried telling him I don’t want to talk to him anymore but it always ends with him saying he loves me or asking me how I could do that do him. A few hours ago I told him, gently, I did not want to talk anymore because of what’s going on in my life (I’m having personal issues, and I feel worthless because of him.) He kept saying stuff like he could help me get through this and how we could be together. By this time, I was exhausted and ready to sleep, so I told him so and then ‘’went to sleep.’’ A few minutes later he said, ‘’please don’t lose interest, I don’t think I would be able to live with myself.’’ This isn’t the first time he’s said something like this.

Does anybody have advice? I don’t know how to get out of this whole thing with him because I’m scared if I flat out say I don’t like him and that he’s making me feel like shit he’ll try to hurt himself. Am I a bad person because I don’t really feel guilty for what happened because I partly don’t believe him? Even though I don’t believe him, I would never risk him hurting himself by saying that.",13Apr2017,1

I was molested twice as a child so becoming sexually active was very hard for me in the first place (it was hard for me to trust).

Later, I found out that he told his best friend, his best friend's brother and a female friend who was ""like his sister"" (I hated her, which he knew. They don't talk anymore but that's another story). I ended up forgiving him and he swore to me that he would keep it private from then on and not tell anyone else. 

My boyfriend and I share passwords for all our social media accounts. I logged into his Snapchat account tonight out of boredom and saw that his sister had sent him a Snapchat (she lives in another state). I decided to read their messages and found out that he has told her ALL about our sex life. What we do, what we don't do and how ""good"" it is.

I got extremely upset and I was very hurt. He didn't want to talk about it because he told me I was overreacting when all I wanted to know was why he couldn't respect the fact that I wanted our sex life kept private. I asked him how many other people know and he told me that he ""tells anyone who asks.""

I feel so disrespected. I don't know what to think or do. I'm so very hurt. I have asked him over fifteen times to keep our sex life private and he couldn't.  Should I stop having sex with him? We aren't talking right now...

I have to pay around 7k each semester for room and boarding, so I need to save around 14-15k total for my first year.

The real problem I'm having is how I'm going to be able to be independent in the very near future. The college I'm going to is six hours away from home, so I plan on staying in its state during all breaks (so year round.) Not only will this add more financial difficulities into the situation, but I think my parents will be hurt by my decision to not return home (although it isn't personal.) I know that if I decide to carry out such a plan, I will have to consider:
The cost of renting a place. 
The cost of utilities, necessities, food, etc.  
Possible transportation costs.  
How to budget my money between college and personal life.  

I think it is a lot to take on, however I've always been a very independent person and I think if I have a better sense of how ""living in the real world "" is, it won't be impossible (or maybe this is not a realistic plan at all, I really don't have any idea..)

My girlfriend who I had been with for 4 years went through hell taking care of me and become more frustrated everyday with me. My outlook on life darkened and and I realized my chances getting hired on a fire department were non existent with the back injury. shorty after I returned to work, I Was offered a position with the county and hoped things would get better, however things continued in a downward trend. My girlfriend left me shortly after. I ended up weighing 350 lbs.  I'm bringing home $1900 a month, which is the highest wages iv ever made, but I can't seem to get ahead. Every month I barely can pay all my bills, I don't eat out and can't afford to have a social life.  All my friends either moved across the state or started a family the last year and quit talking to me.  i have started to turn to whiskey to help get me threw the nights and weekends.  I dred the weekends and count down the hours until I clock in Monday morning. My job is the only thing I have that keeps my mind from dwelling on my situation.  I decided to put my health first and started focusing on losing weight and I enrolled in school this term to finish my degree.  

I'm having a hard time finding a Reason to continue pushing on, any advice for me is greatly appreciated. I am NOT suicidal and this is a throw away account to protect my main account 

I'm just tired..

52,"A little background: I've had long hair since I was about 8 or 9. I didn't care when people called me a girl; and I just really liked having long hair. Since I've had long hair, all of my friends have been basically trying to force me to get a haircut because it's not ""normal"". Even to the point where when I had a friend sleeping over he would debate to himself mentally if he should cut my hair or not in my sleep (this was a few years ago, he didn't admit this until later (he also doesn't sleep over at my house anymore))

Well it's never really bothered me, but up until recently it's just been kinda a burden on me. Everything I've always done has been ""different"" from the society of my peers. I listen to 80s rock/metal, I play guitar, and I'm always the one that stands out, that's just how I am.

The reason I like my hair is because like I said I've always been different, I think it's interesting, I love the way it feels, I love my curls, and I've just loved it in general But having a lot of people beat me down kinda sucks.

So yeah I know it's just hair but it's just kind of a part of me.

TL;DR: I don't want to cut my hair, but it seems everyone else wants me to",13Apr2017,1

My problem is I'm so full of guilt I don't let myself enjoy anything. I feel guilty about taking a day off, about spending too much money on food, about basically everything. I go through periods of being hyper-religious, trying to 'atone' but it doesn't seem to get anywhere. I think at least some of the guilt comes from a difficult childhood, the rest is just a response to my own erratic and selfish behavior (see next paragraph)

However, I'm naturally just a really hedonistic person. I crave new experiences, sex, excitement, not drugs but occasionally cigarettes and alcohol, consumerism.

It's like an unstoppable force meets immovable object.

What I'm doing right now isn't working. I still over-indulge. Which makes me hate myself more, and feel even less worthy of normal enjoyment. Which makes me crave the extreme stuff even more.

My main reason is he chose to move in with me, our Dad (owner of the house) and my cat. With that, he knew my cat was an indoor cat and was not de-clawed.

My second reason is we never discussed any preventative measures to insure that the cat would not claw his couch. We didn't cover the couch to prevent any attempts by cat to claw the couch.

My third reason is he never had the repairs made and presented a bill to me. He expected me to find someone to reupholster the couch for him and pay for it. In the meantime, 2 years and 10 months later, the leather has continued to peel off and is almost completely gone.

My final reason is the only reason he moved in with me and my Dad is so he could rent out his own house (a block down the street) for a profit. His mortgage states he is not allowed to do so because of a grant he received to help with the down payment. He is not a licensed renter. He is collecting rent under the table illegally.

92,"Hey all. Like the title says, this is my situation right now and am in need of advice on what to do. I'm really sorry beforehand if what I type is about to be really incoherent and here is some background of how I let myself get to this point.

During high school, I was never one that put in too much effort into school, but enough that I never skipped class and turned in almost all my assignments. I never knew what I wanted to do, but decided to go to college because that was what everyone including my parents decided was ""good"" for me (went to one of those schools where everyone fought over class rank and the common thought was anyone who doesn't go to a 4 year after high school was an idiot).

Freshman year went well, I had a minor mess up in a math class but then retook it and got an A and ended up on the honor roll. I started to be a lot more reclusive though, and in retrospect I should have realized and done something about it sooner.

Sophomore year started off okay, until I missed a few lectures of a class and started being too scared of going back so I ended up only going for exams and lab sessions (where the teacher would not be there). I managed to pass the semester, but second semester of sophomore year was when shit hit the fan. I started missing a lot of classes, had a lot of insomnia and narcolepsy issues (I couldn't sleep at night, and would fall asleep even while standing up during the day) and barely eating anything. Around this time the stomach problems I had before worsened due to it and I ended up going to the school clinic and eventually got an endoscopy outside of the clinic for issues related to it. My grades tanked because I was never in class and I ended up going to the counseling center because at the time I had no idea what to do. My family had no idea what was going on and I did not want to tell them about any of this. Eventually I got diagnosed with dysthymia and major depressive disorder which also branched out into anxiety. I started taking meds and was able to withdraw from the semester and appeal to go back to school Junior Year.

First semester of Junior Year went well at first. I was on medication and forming habits to get my act together and was really doing well with not missing classes and getting everything done, until about 2 weeks before the semester ended where the only word I could use to describe what happened was relapsing. Again, I could not get out of bed and basically all the problems I had the semester before came back even worse. I ended up having to do an incomplete for 2 courses because I missed the final and am currently making up in my current semester in college. Talking to the counselor started helping a lot less too because she seems to think my problems was the school's workload when it is not and I started lying about my situation a bit. For example, I told her I was going to class sometimes during the last weeks when I didn't.

This semester was by far the worst in that my insomnia, fatigue, eating, and head is just really messed up. It started off okay, with me going to class until I got too sick and then ashamed to, and then to just feeling too sick to. The last time I went to anything in the early afternoon was to a psychiatrist appointment about a month ago and I ended up sitting by the road on the way back to my dorm dry heaving because I was too nauseous to keep walking. I missed a counseling appointment a month ago that I still haven't made up and keep postponing my appointment with my psychiatrist after that as well. The prescribed sleeping aid I got only made me extremely tired, but didn't actually get me to fall asleep and as of now I'm falling asleep around 8-9am and waking up in the late afternoon. 

My parents still have no idea that this is happening, and I know I have to tell them sometime before the semester is over that I failed out. I want to tell my mom first, but she is out of country receiving treatment right now and I really have no clue how to break it to her. She and my dad still thinks I'm going to find an internship this summer and always thought of me as ""the smart one"" in the family and I have no idea what their reaction would be. I've tried telling my mom I was depressed in high school once, and was dismissed because I didn't act like any of the patients in the psych ward when she worked at a hospital back in the day. I think telling my dad first would be worse because of the two he is really pressuring me into getting an internship and jumpstarting my career. I'm also terrified of telling them any of this as pathetic as that sounds.

Outside of telling my parents, I am thinking of working somewhere a bit to save up some money and at least get some order back in my life and then going to community college to get some credit hours. Are there anything else I should look into or anything I should keep in mind? Sorry to sound really overdramatic throughout this entire post but I just feel like I have wasted all my time up to now. Not only with choosing to go to college, but for always being too afraid of messing up that I end up doing what I am told to/is accepted that now I really can't do much less figure out what I want.

94,"I never graduated college, haven't taken a single biology-related class, I consider myself pretty lucky to have been working FT as a Microbiology lab technician / analyst for 10 years. I make 17/hr.  I started at 12. They trained me for everything on-site.


I'm debating moving to Portland for the nature, the hiking, the mountains, etc.  But I hear it's really hard to get a job there, and companies use the demand as leverage.  I'm worrying maybe all the perks I have at my job might all go poof somewhere like that if I did get one lined up.  So I think I need some advice, see post title.


&gt; My favorite things about working here:

- 24 days of paid time off per year, can be used for vacation or sick leave, or cashed out.
- Mostly unsupervised, boss walks through the room a few times a day
- boss has become much nicer since I started
- Can play music
- lots of free food or snacks daily
- Company matches 6% of 401k contribution, no holding time
- nobody is a pain to be around, those that are don't last
- monthly party for all, free food and cake
- usually decent xmas party.  Pirate's adventure, cosmic bowling etc, open bar.
- Supervisors are all nice and joke about upper management with us
- Relatively constant and predictable workload
- can leave early some days
- no harsh penalty for being late 5-15 minutes, some employees are late almost daily.

&gt; The bad, in my opinion

- On extremely busy days there is pressure to work fast, can get into trouble for too much overtime even if working as fast as humanly possible. (rare but everyone agree's it's BS when it happens)
- They take forever to address non-priority concerns, or never address them.
- Upper mgmt doesn't like to spend money on prevention, only in response to equipment breakdown.
- Mgmt doesn't like to buy high quality office supplies, some stuff comes from dollar store, scissors, etc.
- Politics: you can't complain about problems nobody else ever complains about, or you single yourself out and it can be used against you.  We just decide to not make waves.  HR is best friends with boss.


Yes, I love this job.  I just feel like I'll regret it if I live here forever.  How in your opinion, does this stack up with the norm?  Should help me decide whether or not I want to leave this place.  If I left and came back, I would start at the minimum pay again.  If you think my job pro's are more than worth staying, maybe I should settle for just vacationing to prettier outdoorsy places.  I burn too many of my PTO days at home...

96,"So I've been in high school for almost 3 years now and I have never had a boyfriend or any guy who showed interest in me. My look is sort of such-natural and earthy which I am happy with. Now, I feel like my life is stagnant and boring. I would imagine that it's just a pick-me-up to have someone think you're cute. 

So I'm wondering if I should start wearing makeup or something. I don't want to but I feel like an outcast. I don't really want to wear it because I don't think I should change who I am on the inside for the sake of trying to gain recognition from mean high school juniors. ",13Apr2017,1

I know highway is statistically the safest road, but i get nervous at the thought of having to watch my rear for faster cars or motorbikes.

102,"Hi, I came here in hope that you could give me some advice. I have some issues with my family. 

I take it shortly.: I have a feeling like nobody except my brother doesn't know me like I really am. I don't remember when they said that they like/love me the last time, and also I don't remember the time when I would confide to them . My mother thinks she knows me best. All family thinks that I am so shy an no-communicating. That is because I can't even talk normally to my parents without feeling like I am talking to a wall or anxiety that they would not care. I don't know how to describe it but I have like a block which I can't move away. I think that it should be parents who in the first place should manage to have a healthy relationship with their children. It seems that they did not catch my biggest mind progress and they think I don't care about anything, that I don't think about anything and they have this stupid allusions about it. Mistake is for sure also on my side but I can't do barely anything.

I can't complain about material things, food, warm, water, They drive me everywhere I need. I appreciate how they managed to be able to give their children those things. And I should show them that I appreciate it more. But I still miss them as a family. I have great friends but I am a human and it hurts me that I don't have this relationship with them. Of course there are some good times what we have but it's not many.

And the last thing. My mother is short tempered and addicted to cleaning. So if I do everything they ask me for I don't hear anything about it but when I do just a little thing badly it is my end. So I try not to argue with her about this cause I won't do anything with who she is. But the thing that hurts me that they have for many years those stupid allusions about my weight. I am not fat, I am not skinny. I have boobs, butt, hips, thighs. Things my mother doesn't have that big. Last time we argued she told me why I am eating again, that I should look on myself, that I am like a fat pig, I need to lose weight, I need to do this and that. When I told her why she is to me like that she started yelling that I should not complain that she is shopping with me everything I want and punched me in the shoulder. Next Day she wrote a text message that she is sorry that was nice but she was saying the same things just with different words. I just feel I am  never good enough for her and she can't accept that I am not like her.And  the text message just shows our bad way of communication. My dad is very passive about this and more calm.


I already told about this my closest friends but I need an opinion and maybe advice of an adult. My brother thinks pretty the same about their behavior. 

So I came up with this.: we now have a school break for 5 days  and I have a good relationship with my homeroom teacher and I have trust in him. I am probably one of his brightest students. So I want to write him an email about this cause I need an adult mind with experience to listen. Do you think it is a good idea? I also don't want to ruin my relationship with him cause he is one the people I appreciate.

103,"In recent years I've really been wishing that I had darker skin. Some of my very light skinned/biracial friends have expressed the same desire, but it's a bit different for me, I guess. My parents are from Liberia. Over there, I'd be considered fairly light, but in the US I'd classify as fairly dark. I'm around the shade of Gabrielle Union, but I really want to be Lupita's color at the very least. I think part of it is an identity crisis thing. I love my African heritage, and I know that dark skin isn't a requirement to be considered ""authentically African,"" but I look at my grandma who has deep, dark skin, speaks her tribal language, and I want to be like her. My maternal grandma who I never met was also very dark. I also just find dark skin to be gorgeous, and not just when it's photo shopped, airbrushed, etc.

I've thought about tanning or even using those melanin injections, but I'm afraid it's making a mockery of blackness somehow, though I'm not sure how. I guess I'm afraid of fetishizing the whole thing. I also know that being darker comes with its own challenges, and that I'd be appropriating that experience.",13Apr2017,4

110,"Hey so here is my story. I am currently 19, and about to finish high school after 8 years in a few weeks (in my country you can start it at 5th grade so it takes 8 years). And it was hell. My classmates are obnoxious, immature and malicious. I am normally a pretty shy guy and don’t like being in the centrer of things. And they are alpha males who always find a victim. And I was their victim. I was bullied and being called „gay, faggot, lifeless cunt” by them on many occasions. And I did not know how to stand up for myself. I had the options to change schools but I was too scared that it would just repeat itself.
My family and friends outside school are very supporting. So, I know there are people who want to help me and cheer me up but I honestly don’t know how to. Because I am crushed. Being labelled something I’m not, for 8 years, really crushed me. And I don’t think anyone at school knew or cared how badly it made me feel. After being called that constantly, you go thinking, what quality in me does make them think that I am that? I barely ever talked there, so what in the world makes them think that I am one? I never hurt them any way shape or form, but I was bullied with it BADLY. My self confidence is a 0, I’m scared of what people think of me, and often feel very down. 
There are moments that are better though. I have the best brother-sister relationship with my sister ever. My best friend who I talk to on skype everyday lives 1000 kms away from me but I’ll go to his country in 3-4 years for a master’s degree in university and stay there for a few years, and we both can’t wait to have our best friend live in the same city. So things are better sometimes. But I feel like all of this collapses sometimes when I walk into a classroom with them. In a few weeks -hopefully- we’ll never see each other again and I’ll have a fresh start in university. I just hope it won’t repeat there that’s my biggest fear. So I ask you all, what do you think what should I do to make sure university doesn’t turn into hell for me again? And to boost my self confidence somehow? Because most of the time I just feel like I’m a 0 who just ruins everything and doesn’t deserve good things.

112,"Posting from a throw away...

I met my gf about 6 years ago. About a month ish ago she told me she wasn't happy anymore...I was dumbfounded. We worked shit out but she wasn't the same. I was a complete idiot and didn't appreciate her, I wasn't a bad boyfriend...I didn't do anything bad but I just never did anything great...I just never matured. She's 3 years older than me. 

Anyway when I met her she was with someone. I had previously cheated on a gf and we told each other we wouldn't do that.

When she broke up with me she told me it wasn't for anyone else, and I truly believed it. 

She broke up with me, officially like 3 weeks ago.
I cried; i fucking begged I'm not gonna lie I showed so much of me trying and saying that I would do more and for her to just give me a chance.

She said she did it because she wanted to be alone...that she went from relationship to relationship. I finally said ok...and told her that I would accept the break...as long as we could eventually get back. Stupid I know. I said I wouldn't take her back tho after she has been with someone else. To that she got all crazy...she was like well you can't do that we're not together and this this and that. I thought it was kinda weird how she got super defensive but kinda shrugged it off.

We have a kid together...she's 4. We were supposed to go she her, she's currently with her mom. But she insisted we do it on my days off because she was ""tired"". Being the lil bitch that I am...I agreed in an effort for all of us to hangout. 

Not gonna lie I stalked her IG story and she posted a pic of bfast like really nice bfast at a questionable angle. And then her in the city...and finally in someone else's car. Me hoping for the best I was thinking she was hanging out with one of her girl friends.

I got off work late...I was on IG and started getting nosy. I start looking at her recent followers and I click on some random dude. First picture...nice bfast....second picture the city...and the last picture of him holding her fucking hand.

I freak the fuck out and get all macho ape shit. I call her and confront her. Turns out he's  a friend that invited her on a date....I go wtf it's been like 3 weeks? And she's like well he's just my friend nothing happened. Why were you holding his hand? He grabbed it and took a picture...I just thought it was cute and agreed.

I got drunk as shit cussed her out and that was that.

The next day she texted me and apologizes and agrees it was way outta pocket. I questioned everything and she said she was a fool for doing that, and that she really didn't think much of it. She says the dude ""understands she doesn't want to be in a relationship and that it'd be best for her to just stop talking to him"" I fucking eat it all up cause I still fucking lover her and just brush it off I guess. 

My weekend comes...we grab my daughter we bring her back to my place and my ex spent the night as well. It was awesome with a few questionable moments I guess. She was super secretrative with her phone. We ended up drunk and having sex. It was honestly good. It felt fucking great having my family back even if it was only for 2 days.

The next day we took my daughter to the park and she was all cuddly and shit and kissing me. I for sure thought we'd at least slowly ease our way back. 

I drove home that night...I got drunk and started looking at the dudes page. He posted like 3 selfies. I looked at the likes and my ex didnt like any of em. I had a huge fucking smile over that shitty ""win""

2 days passed...no contact...I spark something up and she immidietly regressed on her ""path to being alone...that she wanted to be single and wanted me to be single. I didn't say anything and then go on his fucking page again and there she is liking and commenting and all the fucking pictures.

I can't fucking deal with this, my entire life had been with her. I met her when I was 17 and now I'm 23 moved from NY to FL to be closer to her family and now I have fucking nothing. I'm still out old apt...I'm moving out at the end of this month. I don't know where imma go. She's living with one of her coworkers not giving a fuck about me or my daughter.

114,"My friend ""alex"" is a very successful lawyer in a smallish city in a conservative area. A few years ago, his childhood friend died of a drug overdose. A year later, his friend's sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Alex, being a loving, successful person, gave his friend's sister a large sum of money to cover her cancer treatment, as friends do. She and her husband had to quit their jobs to care for her, and her parents almost went bankrupt paying for her treatments (she's in her mid-late 30s). After 2 ½ years of this terminal cancer, she's still alive.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, where my friend started getting calls from random ""agents"" talking about a ""lawsuit"" he is involved with with this woman. He's never been involved in anything legal with this woman. He then starts getting calls from journalists and high govt officials about this ""lawsuit."" Meanwhile, this woman is calling him telling him she's being scammed, not to EVER talk to the journalists or the agents, and that she's got it under control.

It becomes clear to my friend that she and her husband are the ones scheming, but for what is unclear. The current ""lawsuit scam"" is for over $15 million, but we aren't sure what PRECISELY is happening there. We are pretty sure she never had cancer, and we think she's under the influence of her husband (yes i promise one day this will be a Lifetime movie).

Her parents know nothing still. She bankrupted them and is probably trying to get more money from them as we speak. To make matters worse, her dad was just diagnosed with REAL cancer. The woman is always with her parents now; she and her husband live with them. 

Alex practically grew up in their house, so the parents and sister know him very well.

How does my friend maneuver a meeting with the parents alone to let them know all that is going on? This woman and husband are always at their house, and we are afraid of retaliation if they find out Alex is aware of their fraud and is telling the parents; i.e. if Alex sends an email or letter and it gets rerouted to or read by the scammers.

Tl;dr - my friend Alex is being scammed by a childhood friend and needs to tell his friend's parents, whom this woman is also scamming. However, she's always with her parents and is probably intercepting all communication. How does he get into a meeting alone with the parents without her knowing?",13Apr2017,4

I am a mechanic and a car recently came in for a leaking sunroof. Nice and easy job, just take an air hose and blow out the clogged drains and send the car out the door.

Well this one was a little different in the fact that I am 90% sure that I found drugs in the car.  When I opened the sunroof from the inside, I reached up to see if there were any leaves so i could take them out first and get them out of the way. Well instead of leaves, I found some baggies hidden in the lining of the sunroof that were blocking the drains. Inside of the baggies was some white stuff i am pretty sure is crack.

The main question that I have is how should I report this to the authorities because I work for a small independent shop and I don't want to affect the business by potentially having several cops looking over the car while customers are walking by. I have access to the name and number of the owner of the vehicle and I have put the baggies in a safe place along with several pictures of the baggies in the sunroof.

Thank you guys in advance. If you have any questions just feel free to ask away.

118,"I'm one of 4 siblings, all similarly aged. One of them is diagnosed bipolar but other than that there's no history of mental illness. 

The issue is one of my brothers, who we (siblings, not parents) regularly talk about because some of his behaviors are creepy at best and genuinely concerning at most. He has a past history: when he was a preteen, of being ""curious"" with at least 10 of our young relatives both male and female. None of us experienced this, but cousins/nieces/nephews did. The specific details never got told to us but it involved showing his penis to them and making them take their clothes off as far as any of us know. He went to therapy, apologized, never molested anyone again. Still, he's never been allowed to babysit or be around young children at family gatherings. It's never spoken about but clearly an unwritten rule.

What we talk about is the fact that he shares shit on Facebook that makes us all uncomfortable. Lots of anime related stuff and most of it is lolicon, or cosplays of girls that clearly look underage. Whatever, he has no social skills, but my sister went on his Tumblr the other night and accidentally clicked his likes to immediately be bombarded by anime C.P. incest. We're talking hentai drawings of a 12 year old character fucking an 8 year old character. We scrolled down together and that's ALL there is. It's all anime, sure, but with the knowledge that we have it makes me genuinely worried. I don't know if we should just ignore this, talk to him, talk to our parents or what. Is it just a fetish that we shouldn't be worried about?

121,"So in July of last year, my parents moved me from my home state to a completely new one where I knew nobody and hated everything (a very conservative, Bible Belt state that goes against everything I believe in or have an interest in). So I tried my best to adjust to the people, weather, and basically just tried to cope with the cards dealt to me. My mother was able to keep her old job but she works online from home, so now she has very little contact with actually human beings with the exception of my dad and I. In short, my parents drive me absolutely crazy in every sense of the word. If I had to explain everything, this advice plea would essentially be a book about my parents poor judgement and bad parenting tactics. Really, I have no independence. I am allowed to go two places; school, or my only friend's house, who lives three doors down from the school. As of late they also put a tracking device on my phone and have restricted when I am allowed to drive my car. A week or two ago, I was in desperate need of going to the store (which is less than two miles from my house) as I had started my period and I had nothing to use, so I was essentially free bleeding. My mother's answer? ""Wait until your dad gets home.""
I had to wait for two hours for him to get home, and I OF course bled all over some stuff, which my mother yelled at me for as if I had done it on purpose. They're constantly verbally abusing me and always scrutinizing what I say. A few days ago they told me ""You're a child and therefore have no right to any opinion."" and, my favorite, ""You deserve to live in a house where your parents beat you.""
They're always doing or saying something to limit any freedom I might already have, and I'm so incredibly sick of it.
Basically, they're the reason why I'm always so depressed or angry, and I can never get away from them.
So, now my birthday is fast approaching in a few months and I want to move out as fast as physically possible. I will still be in my senior year when I move out, as I am a junior now, but I'm already looking at apartments near me. I have a restaurant job, but with waitressing your source of income isn't always stable and they will not give me a solid paying job. I live in a very small town so this is really the only job available to me unless I drive 30+ minutes away, and there is no guarantee I will find anything there either. Somebody, please give me some good advice on this, I need to move out.

She's known the whole time. 2 weeks ago I had a breakdown, a knife attack I'd been a victim off had just been finished in procedures and I'd hadn't been looking after myself. Two weeks ago I sat on the edge of a bridge and seriously contemplated falling off. I've ripped my left arm to ribbons and generally haven't looked after myself. I called her that night, she was on a date so I wouldn't tell her even though she asked me to talk. We spoke the next day, I told her everything, even after asking her if it was alright to do so first. She kept in contact for a few days, promising to do something the next day ect. Then three days in, I got nothing, then nasty messages calling me out as I'll or nuisance. I didn't contact her until Sunday, asking to go out shopping before our weekend concert at my flat (student) in London. She flat out refuses, even though it was her idea last week that I was following through. Calls me out as not normal and weird,makes out she didn't suggest it.

I leave it for 4 days, made the most of the sun and Snapchat to make it look like I'm doing a lot, and in this I've felt really better.

To give you a quick overview I dropped out of university due to menta health issues (undisclosed to my parents) they know about the depression but they don't know it caused me to leave uni. Since then I've simply paid my way using savings id earned before going to uni.

I don't know how it's happened but that was a year and a half ago and they still don't know, as far as they're aware I'm going to be graduating and the day I have to tell them I won't be, im terrified for.

Despite all of this going on the money I'd been supplying myself with has of course run dry, I wasn't aware how close I was to running dry due to closing my eyes to almost anything important including my finances. Now my final rent payments due and I've only got about £350 to my name. 

Enough is clearly enough, I need help. I've thought I could fix these problems and get back on my feet but somehow the years have gone by and I've just done nothing Reddit. I can't remember the last time I did something to benifit myself. I'm terrified if I don't right now then I never will.

So I'm making this post, I don't even know what I'm looking for really, perhaps some kind words of motivation, perhaps a kick in the face and a dose of reality is required. All I can say for certain is I'm pretty scared  of the future right now and anything anyone has to say will be better for me than me hiding again.

My dad travels out of town 4 days a week about 3 times a month and every single time he's away she has a meltdown and I'm left to deal with it. She also hates her job so that adds to her meltdowns.

I'm living at home with my parents [F19] and it's driving me insane. I love them dearly but I don't have enough space and it's partially because of them that I broke up with my bf who I can't forget and still love madly.

138,"So I have been working at this company for about 9 months, and I met this guy, let's call him John with whom I gradually started becoming friends. After several months of getting to know each other, two weeks ago he finally invited me to hang out outside of work. We went to a party and when he took me home he told me that he appreciates me a lot. I told him I was glad to find a new friend after my best friend ghosted on me some 4 months ago. He replied that he would always be there for me. In general John is a good guy, we are similar in a lot of ways, and our senses of humor match just perfectly.

Now, there's this other colleague, who is under his supervision, who is an incredibly troubled person. He is always whining and complaining, wants to do as less work as possible and doesn't mind screaming around to get what he wants, even to his own boss. Our CEO already decided he is to be fired, but to this days he is still here. The excuse is that a replacement couldn't be found.

Lately, John has been going through a lot at work. As he is the Operations Manager of the company, he is overworked and has a lot of weight on his shoulders, on top of that, he has been fighting a lot with the chief of the Sales department (with whom he had a relationship that ended a bit badly), as she is strict with his employees and he sees her demands as unreasonable. I hang out with her and her friends (one girl and one guy) daily, since John prefers to go home for lunch, and I also became friends with them. However, up this point I was siding with him on that one, since I can see that she was actually being a bit catty with them.

As a result of all this stress, John's health is deteriorating. Two days ago, he had such a fit of rage that he started feeling pain the vesicle. That afternoon he left work because he had to go see a doctor, who told him he needs to rest for three days. Also, a lot of people are complaining that John is constantly in a bad mood and having a bad attitude with people in general.

That day, John asked me help with notifying the drivers with the pick ups of the day (we're a courier), so, me being always willing to help a friend, I accepted. When I called the problematic colleague to let him know that he had to take a bigger vehicle instead of his motorbike to do a pickup, he complained that no one had told him about that, but he accepted going there anyways.

Just 5 minutes later, I receive a call from a customer who wanted another ""big"" (three bags with pillows) pickup, so as I had just spoken with the problematic one (the pick up was at his zone), I told the customer that we would proceed with the pick up. Then I immediately notified it to our Whatsapp group. It was 17:52. Pick ups should be requested until 18:10, mostly because this guy is always whining about the pick up times because ""he always have to leave work late"". Usually I call him to make sure he is notified, but this time I just left the message, as all drivers are to pay attention to that Whatsapp group to learn about their pickups.

Come 18:25, this idiot calls me angrily complaining that I didn't let him know that he had to do the other pick up. I replied that I left a message in the group early enough, but he claims I sent it ""late"". I told him the time that I sent the message, but he just continued screaming, said ""dammit"" and ended the call. Whatever.

As the minutes go by, he starts writing a lot of shit in the Whatsapp chat. He called me a ""moron"", an ""idiot"" and was saying to everyone there that ""I suck balls"" because I didn't ""do my job right"" (it's worth to note it isn't even my job, just a favor I did to John)., and he kept writing about me nonstop for half an hour. On top of that, it was raining heavily, and he also blamed me for it, saying that it was all my fault. 

I had to leave early because I had to go to school, but the  following day my current best friend, who also works there, told me this dipshit was angrily looking for me (I don't want to speculate, but this is indicative that he possibly wanted to even phisically attack me) when he returned to the office, and, surprisingly, that he, who had been complaining so much about the rain, was suspiciously with dry clothes, as opposed to the other drivers who were wet.

Going back to that night, John's intervention (again, he is his boss), is very limited, almost null. He just said ""why do you have to insult him"", ""look at the time he notified you"" ""just leave it there, instead of writing so much you should be going back to the office"".

But instead, he writes a long wall of text to me saying that he told me a million times that I should be careful in coordinating picks up, that I have to always make sure that an appropriate vehicle is available and drivers are informed, and that until that coworker leaves we can only bear with him.

I replied that if things had arrived to that state, then I would stop collaborating with him with the pickups. He replied ""OK, then you won't help me anymore"". I tried to say that I wanted to make clear that I always had helped him very gladly, but he interrupted me saying ""stop it, leave it there"", and I said ""I don't think it's fair that you get mad at me"" and he replied ""I'm not getting mad at you"".

He also said that, despite being ordered by the doctor to rest for three days, he would come to the office yesterday, as ""the office will fall apart if he is not present"" (in honor of truth, that's mostly accurate). 

Now he comes, and when we greet he gives me a very warm handshake that lasts many seconds, but this time he just let go of my hand very quickly. Also in the afternoon, after lunch break. When leaving the office, the idiot colleague was there, standing by his side, so to avoid saying goodbye to him (he had tried to greet me that same morning as if nothing had happened, but I ignored him), I said goodbye collectively and... John didn't reply.

Two days have passed since the incident, and I still didn't hear anything that indicates John called out on this guy's behavior. Keep in mind he is his direct boss.

Right now I am shocked, John even told me once that he considered me his second best friend. But friends are supposed to stand for each other. I was devastated after my best friend stopped talking to me for no reason four months ago, and I was happy to be finally finding a new friend. I don't want a moron to come and take this all away from me.",13Apr2017,1

145,"There are several friends in my life who, at some point or another, were really great friends. There's L, who was a crush of mine in College, we had so much in common, and after College before she moved away, we kept visiting each other. Now she's about 2 hours drive away, I don't drive but she does, but whenever I reach out to her, answers are short and it feels like an uphill struggle. I've invited them to my wedding, and gave them six months notice of the date in advance, and they're still ""unsure"" if they have plans or not. I can't help but think they're just considering whether I'm worth the effort.

Then there's S, an online friend. We used to spend a lot of our game-time together. We'd talk over VOIP and be in howls of laughter, but every time they'd move onto another game, they'd completely forget about me. We're still friends on Facebook, I still have their VOIP details, but every time I initiate a conversation, nothing comes from it. I'm either blanked or given short, terse answers. I've tried talking to them about this before, and they've said they don't feel negatively about me, they just don't talk to their friends much if they're not sharing an interest.

Even my oldest friend, T, whom I've known for nearly 13 years and will be serving as my Best Man, I speak with him once a month if I'm fortunate. He's different in that when we do meet up, it feels like our friendship is picked up from where it's left off. But then we part company, and I never hear from him until the following month.

I know some friendships drift apart, and I have cut ties with people before. But I feel too ... reluctant, to give it up and do it for these sorts of friends. The natural thing would be to try and talk to them about it, but I don't want them to think that I'm a needy person, or have them just agree and say ""yeah, you're not worth the effort to be friends with any more."" I have such positive memories with these people, and to lose them would really tear me up.

I've considered doing something to give _me_ closure, so I can step away and take something useful by writing them a letter, explaining my feelings, my actions and saying farewell. Then burning those bridges. It would be cathartic, and protect me from the truth of their feelings for being so distant. But ... I don't know.

153,"So i just started a new position at a University as an advisor. I had left a position as a high school teacher because of emotional issues I was experiencing--anxiety, depression, and even severe alcohol abuse (all of which I have addressed with my physician and counselors). I chose to leave teaching in hopes of finding opportunities for change and financial stability, since that lifestyle was negatively impacting my marriage.

When we moved and I started this new position, I felt great, and I initially thought things were moving in the right direction. However, recently, the demand and management style of my supervisor have caused my issues with anxiety and depression to erupt, and I'm starting to experience the same issues from before. I'm afraid these issues are more personal and possibly neurological, but I still want to to whatever I can to change. I am also considering applying for a position as an Instructional Designer with another company, but I'm concerned about how my recent change--and desire to change again--would reflect on prospective employers. 

My current boss has no idea that I am struggling with anxiety. She is a good boss, but her management style results in constant negative feedback with very little positivr reinforcement. While I am aware that my anxiety stems from my tendency to criticize myself heavily (even when there is nothing to criticize), the anxiety still results in fits of crying, depression, and nervousness.

I don't want to give the impression that I can't handle this job, but I don't want to let these issues continue or get worse. And I can't leave because of the financial need.

158,"I was wondering what you all thought of the idea of this startup and give me some advice.  The startup is based around charitable donations.  The only difference is that instead of taking $200 and donating it directly to the foundation of your choice.  We take your $200 and put it into an investment account you have set up.  Now each year we take the earnings that the $200 makes and donate to the charity of your choice.  Also, since our company is technically a charity as well your initial $200 investment would receive a tax break as well.

The idea behind this is that your investment will keep donating throughout your lifetime.  Now instead of getting X% back on your donation that one year.  You now get X% back on that $200 donation for X amount of years. 

Donations could even grow overtime.  Say you want 1/2 of your gains to be put back into the account and 1/2 to be donated.  Now in 10 years your $200 could be $300.

161,"Hello all,


Thank you in advance for any help. The title kind of says it all. I'm thinking about taking a 2-3 day break from my gf of 2.5 years. The main reason behind this is that unfortunately, I find myself resenting her a bit. She's recently moved in about 2 months ago and her negativity is really getting to me. The negativity isn't a new thing but I think living together has expanded upon just how much there is. She just seems really unhappy a lot of the time. I understand that it's normal and healthy to feel unhappy but unfortunately it's having more of an impact on me than I would like.


I think what bothers me the most is that she's often upset about what I would consider common and that I've clearly illustrated to her don't bother me. Things like her appearance where she has informed me that society defines her as a certain way and it upsets her that it happens. I always try to be supportive of her and let her know how much it doesn't bother me and how I am empathetic to the fact that my feelings aside, she still feels this way. I really am empathetic too, I take time to listen to her often.
But I must say that after awhile, I feel as if I'm punished for the way society makes her feel and that makes me unhappy. I've told her about it a few times and she says that she'll work on it but I always find myself back at the wrong end of her unhappiness. I think when we first started dating, I would always just take it as normal relationship gripes and let it roll off my shoulders as not that big of a deal but the more she does it, the more it makes me sad as well. I also find myself running into the problem of continuously telling her this and then having her feel like she can't open up with me anymore.


I've thought that maybe I'm trying to solve her problems as I've read that in relationships this will often happen when the other person just wants to vent. I proactively have avoided doing that but this is more than just general complaining. I must admit that I dislike most of her general complaining too because much of it seems minor. However, the bigger problem that is really bothering me is feeling like I'm being blamed for society's perception of my gf. It doesn't seem fair. Again, I've told her this but it doesn't seem to be good.
This is what's brought me to my thought that maybe a weekend away from her will be a good idea. I'm really scared at the prospect of us breaking up but at the same time, I'm finding myself more and more unhappy. I guess I know that if I tell her this, there's no going back and that there's a chance that after I've had no contact with her for 2-3 days, I may realize that I want the relationship to end. That's scary to me but I'm not sure what else to do. We live together which makes things tricky but I think I'll be the one who goes away to a friend's house or something for a long weekend after I explain some of these issues to her.
I've been mulling this over for a few weeks now as we hit a down point but of course the last day or two, things have been really well. I feel like this will shock her which again, scares me but at this point it seems like a good option.


Any advice towards this plan? Or towards my viewpoint of my situation? I don't want to come across as insensitive to her needs but at the same time, I guess her and I have different ways that we vent and sometimes I have trouble assessing hers without it hurting me.


TLDR: My gf seems to project some of her unhappiness about outside things on me and it's having an impact on me.",13Apr2017,5

163,"TL;DR - How should I approach (if at all) my employer to ask for, essentially, a raise to account for cost of living due to voluntary relocation.

Long version:

My family and I are voluntarily relocating from city A to city B in order to be closer to relatives &amp; in-laws.  The company I work for has locations in both city A and city B, and was happy to accommodate a transfer request between locations. However, the cost of living in city B is substantially higher than city A, and my base salary is below market in city B for the job/role I occupy (same role I'd occupy in city B). Also, my employer has been unable to find anyone to fill the role I occupy in city B (I suspect because they are low-balling the salary offer).

Given that I am relocating voluntarily it seems obvious that my employer is under no obligation to offer a raise, however the increased cost of living plus the fact that I'm filling a long-vacant spot in city B seems like it might be grounds for a conversation regarding compensation.

How should I approach this? Is it reasonable to ask for more money, or might I be better off asking for moving assistance or something similar?

Happy to provide (some) more detail if needed.

165,"We're newly weds.  My wife was living with her parents before moving in with me a couple years ago, and was largely dependent upon them financially, even after no longer living at home.  She's always had jobs since we've been together, but they don't pay well or offer benefits.  She never seems to stay with a company for more than a few months before moving on.  I feel for her, because she's at that stage in life where one is expected to have found some sort of purpose or direction, but she's always stuck with jobs that she sees as beneath her abilities/potential.  This is something I've never had to deal with as i knew out of high school what I wanted to go to college for and eventually what career field to work in.

I very much want her to find that sort of direction, both for the financial stability of our marriage, but most importantly to give her the pride and self-worth that she deserves.  I have a hard time broaching the subject because she is very self-conscience about it and is already disappointed with her own situation. She was a licensed beautician after high school, but quit that after a year or so because she was not a fan of the back-biting and gossip in the workplace.  She's held a lot of retail positions, gotten licensed to sell insurance, and took classes for a couple years for court reporting (which she sees as her dream job/ultimate goal).  

Right now, all she really wants is a job that can provide benefits (paying for her own health insurance out of her paycheck means about half of the little she makes each month goes directly to insurance), and leaves her with the flexibility to resume court reporting classes online at night for the next couple years.  She doesn't want to work nights or weekends since those are our only opportunities for quality time together.

So you get a girl, you know you're her rebound but hey atleast we're both having fun and the best part you got a new best friend. Turns out you low-key start liking her but you're being considerate coz she's just been through a rough breakup. You're still dating her but plot twist she's dating another guy too. He's doesn't give a fuck about the breakup so he proposes, she accepts. You're pissed off but it's not anyone's fault.

Throughout the class, even during individual work, my group and I are chatty and talk about a variety of things. But the one quiet person never jumps into any conversation, ever.
Yesterday before class I said hi to him, and he said hi back with a lot of enthusiasm, which took me aback. We talked for a bit, before I shifted my attention to the other people around me. Once my attention and focus of conversation was no longer centered on him, he stopped speaking.
Do you think I should try to talk to him more, and pull him into the group conversations? Or should I let him be? 
I've read, mostly through reddit posts, that introverts like to listen to conversations instead of participate. So I don't really want to force him to speak if he isn't comfortable. ",13Apr2017,1

180,"I've been with my boyfriend for 10 years now, since I was 18. I always knew he was an alcoholic, I met him in treatment - I had an eating disorder but I'm fully recovered now, though I do suffer with anxiety still.

I lived with my boyfriend for about 7 years, but for the last 2 and a half we lived apart, because he relapsed very badly with gambling and alcohol, with continual usage for months. Ever since he's been sort of on and off the wagon relapsing every few months. As mentioned, he also has a gambling addiction and has lost thousands gambling, but this doesn't seem to be something he's done in the last couple of years or so.

I'm really struggling to know what to do, it because I sort of feel like my life is on hold. I want to be, and I am, independant. I earn my own money, it's a relatively good salary for my age, it is enough to live on and enjoy life to some extent. He doesn't work, he's been unemployed for most the years that I've known him - which is a real shame as he's extremely educated and had a really lucrative career in advertising.

I sort of feel like I'm at the point where I want to have children and settle down and buy flat like other people my age, but I feel like I cant rely on him.

I do feel guilty because I do love him. He is thoughtful, kind, loyal, funny. I really do love him, but I just don't know if I can cope with this anymore. It would be unfair to me to make out like he's never been there for me, or supported me. I have anxiety and panic attacks and he has supported me a lot with them. I'm no saint to be sure and he has had a tough time with me over the years. But I feel especially in the last few years, I have changed a lot. I want to know if there's a sort of plan we can work to, or anything to break out of the cycle.

He relapsed last night (he messaged me to tell me), which is the first time he's done so in the last five months that I'm aware of. It just seems it's a perpetual cycle and I don't know if I can cope with it forever more. He is really angry because I distanced him from my family for the last two years, because I just want to feel confident I know what's happening with the relationship. I understand that's difficult, and he is hurt by it.

We were meant to see each other today, but he said that he was hungover and felt so terrible he wanted to stay at home and sleep, which I respected. I said feel better and he says he'd call me later, then I receive this message:

""But it would be nice for once for you to say ""I'm coming over. I'll sit with you while you sleep. I'll make some food. I'll be around and make sure you don't continue the relapse even though I know you are in a state of anxiety and confusion. I'll sew. I'll read. I'll just be there. I'll bring water. I know you fucked up but you didn't want to and you want you to get back on track. You have an illness. You're not a bad person. I can help practically and emotionally in this case even tho we know you shouldn't rely on me and nowadays don't overall. And I want to help. I'll be there"".""

 I didn't second guess him, he said he needed to sleep and so I said ok and talk later. I just really don't know what to do, it seems like all of my adult life I've been basically in fear of him relapsing and also if I'm honest with fear of never being able to have a secure adult life I just really need a little bit of advice and guidance.

I am a second-semester freshman pursuing a BS in Computer Science.

Long story short, I decided last night that my time would be best spent preparing for my nutrition exam instead of preparing for a participation assignment in ethics, and was told by the professor if we didn't come prepared to participate don't show. I did exactly that, and didn't show up to class today after passing my nutrition exam assuming it was a small grade. (I had been specifically struggling in nutrition, this exam brought it up to a B from a low C) Unfortunately, I misinterpreted the professor's previous statement and took it lightly, I now realize it was a threat to fail the course. I received 2 separate 0/100 grades for the assignment, and I don't believe I can recover to a passing grade.

I now have a proud 164/400 in the course, previously 164/200.
Should I try to drop out of the course or take the F?
Should I continue to go to class and try on the exams if I take the F? How big of a deal is it, will it set me off track to continuing my education?

197,"Hello everyone, 
  I am about to finish my third year of college at James Madison University. I have switched my major twice and am not on track to graduate on time. I had a change of heart sophomore year and left the business school to pursue nursing. I cannot get into the nursing program here so I am exploring different options. I applied to Bon Secours Memorial College of Nursing but if I do not get admitted in May I need a back up plan. It was a terrible mistake to only apply to this one school.

  

Let's assume I get rejected. My current major is Kinesiology and it will take me a few years to graduate if I continue with this path. The problem is, besides getting into pre-professional programs (optometry, dentistry, physical therapy) and nursing, the jobs do not look promising in this field. I cannot take the pre-professional path because of my current grades and it would extend my time here. This place is becoming too expensive. My advisor tells me that I can be a personal trainer, a fitness coach, an exercise physiologist, etc. but these careers do not interest me much and I just don't feel that this path is optimal. 

  

It is not all about the money for me, I highly value altruism and helping others, but if I am going to commit to something I want it to be sustainable and I don't want to be drowning in debt. I am losing interest in kinesiology. I don't really have a dream job but nursing seems like a great fit for me. If I don't make it into Bon Secours I don't know what I am going to do and I am willing to give up on nursing. I am just confused and don't know what the best option is for me. My parents will help support me but they are telling me that I need to commit to something now and stick with it. I am really stressed out and hate to complain about things like this because I am so privileged to be in this position in the first place. I am so grateful for this opportunity to have a higher education. I'm no elite student but once I make this decision I am prepared to try harder than I ever have. I am very interested in philosophy, psychology, law, social work, and nursing. 



What should I do? What is the optimal path given what I have? My gen eds are taken care of. Finances are an issue so I may want to transfer to another school. I want to do something I am interested in but I am flexible. I am looking into studying in other countries as an option and am really looking for more information about this. Perhaps Germany or Britain. I don't mean to offend anyone as this may seem petty to some but I am stressed to the max. 

Thanks for reading.

200,"Let's start here: My sister is 31 years old, lives at home with my parents, unemployed and currently can't drive due to 2nd DUI. She blames the fact that she's unemployed on that she currently has a almost 4 year old (part-time, he's with his other grandparents most of the time), and on the fact she's going to school full time to finish her bachelors. She also currently on a lot of medication for her mental health and recently had hyneria surgery--so painkillers maybe? She hasn't had the best track record in the terms of boyfriends--she's never had one that hasn't done jail time, drugs, dealt drugs or ripped her/her family off. Her new boyfriend is a guy I knew about ten years ago when working at my high school job and is two years himself out of prison for dealing drugs/doing drugs. Anyways, she never told me they were dating these past two months until my little brother told me because he himself was upset that she would allow this guy around his nephew. She wrote me and my brother a long text this last Saturday basically going on and on about how we are being cruel and unfair to this guy and that we should accept him. Me and my brother didn't reply at first and she stated in the text--Go ahead and conspire against yourselves. I finally responded and stated something along the lines of You can do better and we just want the best for you. Well, she then dug her claws out at me--and stated private information (that wasn't even related to the conversation) in front of my little brother, basically just items I had told her in confidence--when all I had said to her was I don't need to support you if you aren't going to do what's the best for you. Anyways, this was all last weekend--it's now Thursday and I go to check this App (lifecake) that we all share for photos of my nephew, come to find out shes removed me from that and changed her netflix password (which is fine like $8 dollars a month--I can pay that). Really, I'm just disapointed mainly because she's taking me out of my nephews life--for what a guy she's been dating for three months. I'm trying to slowely real myself out of family situations --like not going to Easter this weekend, but it's hard. I just more so want an apology from her as I didn't do anything wrong I just ler her know how I felt. I'm usually the second most person in her kids life--and to take that away from me is just more a disapointment. Basically, what I'm saying is I feel guilty but I don't think I did anything wrong. I told her how I felt about her new boyfriend and that I'm an adult and don't need to bring negative people into my life--she then backfired on me by spilling my secrets in a group text. I just don't know how to not feel guilty, I know she's family but this isn't the first time she has blackmailed or was petty into getting her way.

201,"I had an interview today with a small company who got recently started here in town. I won't mention the name of the company or what they sell (if they searched the name or the product they could easily find this and would know exactly who I am) but I want some advice as I don't know if I should stay away or jump on the offer.

I arrived on time for the interview but there was one other applicant so the interviewer was about 15 minutes late. Greeted the interviewer, formalities and so forth. I sit down and one of the first things she asked was if I understood this was a sales position, I did. She then kind of, in my opinion, sort of shit talked the other applicants. Said I was the first person to understand that it's sales, the job posting was written in a kind of vague way IMO where it could have been sales or maybe as a technician, but okay fine I guess. Then another thing she said early on was how she can't seem to get any good people around there, how they mostly seem lazy and like they don't want to do the work. BIG RED FLAG. I was thinking could that be due to your own decisions on hiring?

She explained about the company, the owner and the product a little bit and mentioned how the goal is to have every employee working there be able to open their own business just like that one day. Thought to myself that sounds a little pyramid schemey, but okay I'm still listening. Explains the pay, it's $300/week just to talk to five people and give them a flyer, and that's literally bare minimum, she went on to explain. That's all you have to do, and you can still be employed there. You can earn $700/week if you attend 12 appointments a week pitching the product in customer's homes, they make all those appointments for you, no cold calling or door knocking. After that is when commissions kick in, when you sell something, but there is no quota you have to reach. If you don't sell any units it's okay. She mentioned something about being able to earn $50-$450 commissions per unit but still not sure I heard that right.

She mentioned showcasing this to friend's and family members and the words multi level marketing and pyramid scheme were screaming at me, but then she said it's simply doing your pitch but they don't have to buy the product, just critique your performance and then the company can contact them and ask about your performance. Okay, that's still really weird to me but I asked her and she promised there are no fees to any of this, the product is provided to you free of charge.

All in all it was not your typical interview, a lot shorter then other interviews I've had and I didn't get a lot of typical interview questions, really just where I work and what I do currently and that was about it. Didn't ask about my other certifications or school...family or anything, not like any other interviews I've ever had with companies. I do understand this is a company that just started not long ago at all, they are registered with my state as an LLC, and I understand the reason for the perceived weirdness might be because they are just starting out and just hired these people, but for some reason my gut is telling me something about it just doesn't seem right, not necessarily wrong or malicious but just not quite right, and I've never felt this way before in any other job interview. Sitting in the lobby didn't feel right and talking to the interviewer didn't feel right. I've been told I should always listen to my gut.

I am not paid hourly by this company and will not be paid for training. I was told I can attend an orientation this next week and if I don't like the sounds of it I don't have to do anything else, just go my separate way. I did not feel pressured or pushed into anything at all. I just am wary about how it sounds like it's managed and not being paid hourly but $300 a week just to talk to 5 people sounds like a really good deal. I'm trying to decide if I want to move ahead with this place or not and could use some outside opinions. I appreciate it and thank you all.

If you're going to tell me that this is ""just a phase,"" I completely understand your point of view, but I personally do not believe that this is a phase.  Also, if you're going to laugh or scold because of my age, I personally would not appreciate your comment on this thread.  Thank you.
~~

I'm really confused with myself.  I don't generally ""feel"" things, such as happiness or the stereotypical ""butterflies in the chest"" when something exciting or important is going to happen.  However, whenever something bad happens, most of the time, I feel it.  Sometimes, it's compression in my upper torso/chest.  Others, it's just the feelings of complete worthlessness and the constant questioning of myself, over and over again: ""Why am I like this?""  On other occasions, I just don't feel anything.

I am considered an intelligent person, I am in an applied advanced learning program at my school.  I just don't know why I'm like this.

My work ethic has deteriorated over the years, and I don't know how I can turn this around.  I'm moderately obese, something I often sit down and cry over instead of actually doing something.  Nobody wants to help me, and I don't think I can help myself, either.  I have extremely limited options because of my age.

I would like to state right here that I am thirteen years old.  I live a very privileged life, I always have.  I hate myself for feeling the way I do, especially since I have so much whilst others get by just fine on so little.

Furthermore, I do not feel sympathy or any real emotions pertaining to other people.  I keep a journal, an my entry from earlier today reads:

""Yeah, people might be sad, but I'm sadistic.  I don't care""

This is the part where I started to cry.

""But I want to care

I want to be normal.  I want to have human emotion.  I'm in tears because I wish I was normal.  It's so stupid.  I'm going to read this later and question my thoughts.""

Whenever I get like this, I have my moment, and then, moments later, I just categorize it as being melodramatic in nature.  I don't understand it at all.

All in all, I just want to be normal.  I don't feel that I can tell my parents because they'll just yell at me for being ungrateful for all that I have(and I wouldn't blame them) and melodramatic.  In addition, I'd most likely get an ""Oh, please,"" before being scolded.

204,"Hello fellow redditors!

Sorry for the whiny title, I am after all a very inexperienced noob when it comes to dating.

The guy I am interested in goes to the same school as me. I've never noticed him (except that we ride the same bus to school each morning.) He never uses Facebook, is introverted but not shy, and mainly keeps to himself and his clique.

However, he started to volunteer at a soup kitchen I go to on a weekly basis, and despite having no connections to me whatsoever, knows that I come here very often. Yet again, he could've gotten this information from other students or our school counselor.

Despite being kind of a 'shy' guy, he started talking to me for hours on end that day and approved my friend request on FB, even though it is a well known thing that he is never active on FB.

After a few weeks, I discovered that I am quite interested in him, and we began texting each other on FB in April. For the first two days, we text pretty consistently, both sending literal paragraphs at each other. However, since then, we stopped texting constantly, and he seemed to be only logging in once per week. My friend told me I sounded too 'cold' over text, and that I might be giving him mixed signals. However, his reply to my latest question were two simple phrases, so I believe he actually sounds colder than me? I fear he is losing interest, which is highly likely, because it's only been a little over a month since we first talked at the soup kitchen, and we are on Spring Break right now.

We haven't talked since Sunday, but I've recently sent him a picture of my cat in a weird position with the caption ""aspiring ballerina'. Do you think I'm being too 'desperate'?

Help. I am just a really inexperienced girl who happens to be a serial-crusher; Please give me some advice as to where this is going and if he is still interested in me.

206,"So bare with me as I try and get everyone caught up to speed because it's quite a bit. Basically I met this girl online and started off as friends. Well a year later we decided to start dating and meet in person. (No catfish we had skyped and video chatted and I had watched enough of it to know the red flags lol.) Anways I flew up to Illinois away from home and spent Christmas with her and her family. Everything went great and I went back home. Months later I decide it's time to make another trip back and one thing led to another and ended up staying, getting a job, and getting engaged. 

Flash forward to now and we have been engaged almost 5 months, have dated for almost two years, and have a wedding coming up December 2nd. So now everything is starting to get real very fast and my anxiety has sent me into depression.  I didn't get to jump into college after highschool due to real life issues, severe anxiety, and moving quite a bit. Also this is my first real job honestly because of my anxiety. I've worked doing random things with family and also babysitted for quite some time. Well I've been at my job for 7 months now (which is a warehouse job) and absolutely loved it but I have no job security and I'm not really built for how much this company expects out of their employees due to how efficient they have to be and because I'm a little guy. The job security is hard because it's hard planning a future with how big the turn over rate is at this company and how impossible it is to move up if you haven't been to college and due to hiring from outside the company. The hardest part for me is going into work everyday is demoralizing because I'm barely keeping up and they are talking about raising our hourly quota which is already ridiculous. 

So now I'm severely lost because of all of this and I want to quit my job and go to school and do something I love but her grandparents don't approve because they don't believe that you can get a job after college and have super traditional beliefs such as the man works and women takes care of the kids and house. They think I will never find a better job than what I have now which is severely depressing to me. I really look up to them and respect them but I feel like they just bring me down everytime it's brought up. 

Now to add ontop of everything I'm severely homesick and struggling from being away from my family but either way my fiancée or myself will be missing their family. I have no clue what to do and my anxiety has made me so depressed that I can't even sleep at night at this point. I just have become severely unhappy and I'm a completely different person. I'm honestly not sure what to do or what to believe anymore and feel like I'll never be able to take care of a family working in a warehouse stuck at the bottom all my life. I don't have bills because her parents want us to stay with them until we get situated in life so I feel like now is the opportune time to go to school which her parents agree and support and said we are more than welcome to stay until I graduate. 

Tl;dr - I moved out of state from my family, just got engaged, hate my job due to being stuck at the bottom forever and zero job security, and want to go to school but not everyone supports it. All of this stress has fueled my anxiety which I had under control into a massive monster that has taken control of my life once again.

After I picked up the pieces and got back on my paws, I realize now that I've only got four people I can safely call friend.

The thing I miss the most was being a part of the big group. I'd like to recreate that and so I want to ask everyone who has come to the same realities that I have, do you all want to be friends? You'd all have to move to Portland since I've found everything I've ever needed in a city here and I am not moving out and giving all of this up. Besides, you'll like Portland a lot better than the city you live in now.

Wanna be friends? :)

209,"My little brother is 22 and finishing up a business degree at a pretty good state school. Over the weekend he was arrested for selling drugs at a music festival to finance his relapse. He struggles with the same vague anxiety/depression malaise that has plagued me since high school, and he has admitted in the past that he has a problem with drug abuse, ketamine in particular, as a means of mitigating this emotional turmoil. While telling me about the arrest, he admitted again that he has a problem, and he says he is seeking treatment. Our parents are overreacting, he's underreacting, and I have no idea what to do. I want to support him and keep him happy, but I don't want to enable him and make him think everything is fine either. Has anyone here been in a similar situation? How can I help?",13Apr2017,1
211,"Hi everyone,

Ok I got married to my beautiful wife in September of last year. She has had health issues for most of her life. She is 21 now and the biggest problem is Fibromyalgia which basically means she has chronic pain. She switches between bad and really bad phases and cannot work much because of it. The pain will get so bad sometimes that she will just pass out and be out for up to 20 minutes at times.

We have seen plenty of doctors and have gone through at least 25 different tests and they have no idea what to do. She has been on a few different medications and some will help for awhile and then stop being effective while others just flat outbdojt work or make it worse.

I'm wondering if anyone has ever been through it is going through something similar and can give me some advice on what will help?

I felt captured unter his arm and although I know my boyfriend isn't anything like him I couldn't stop thinking that he will become like him. So i found an excuse and went home. On my way home I was just shaking crying and felt like the shadows would follow me. I raced home because there I knew I would feel safe. What should I do? This was the second time I had sex the first time we both were a little bit drunk. I know now I can't have sex yet because I haven't handled everything.

Do any of you feel like you don't want to try new things because you assume you'll be bad at them?

Here's my situation: 

I'm tying to release a song professionally. I'm good at music and studied it etc. It's just my first time doing a professional full on song.

So I kind of don't want to release it? 

Because I know that doing something this big on my first attempt won't be the best it could be if I had more experience.

I feel like I don't want to waste the idea I have (perhaps a good idea) right now on my lack of experience, since it won't be the best that I can do in the future... does this make sense?

This problem lurks into the other sides of my life too, anything sports is an instant no because I don't want to make a fool of myself and mess up. 

Its as if I want to be the person I can be in the future with experience in the region, but I don't want to experience the section of life where I'm inexperienced... if that isn't too confusing.

232,"Hello everyone! My older brother, who is the oldest of five brothers(I am the second) has won about 6.5 million euros in the German lottery late last year. I just found out about this a month ago and he says he won it some time around November or so but has kept quiet about it because he has been thinking what to do and is afraid of what it might do to the family if everyone knew. He has confided in me because he and I are the two most sensible people in our family. 

Since I found out I have been reading all sorts of information online about how the lottery has destroyed many people's lives after their friends and family found out. My brother's plan is to give half a million to my parents and 100 thousand to each brother and keep the rest to do as he pleases. He has already met some private bankers at 3 large banks about what to do in terms of investments. I am happy with this plan. He really wants to do this especially for our parents who have done a lot for us but there is the potential that some members of the family may not be satisfied and may wish for more, or that some of our brothers may depend on him to support them indefinitely. We are a good family and love and get along well but human nature is human nature. And this is where the dilemma comes. Are there any reddit people who have gone through this situation or know anyone who has? What is the most effective avenue to ensure full comprehension and cooperation from the entire family?

I'd like some advice to see if the dental care I received today sounds correct (isn't a scam? or sub-par? or if a 2nd opinion is advised?). This was my first time at this particular clinic.

I (age 34) went to the dentist today: 
1) Cleaning took 15 minutes, but last time I was in was 2 years ago. This surprised me. Not really confident they cleaned ""Every"" tooth. Dr.'s and staff made frequent references to patients waiting.
2) They told me I need a deep cleaning on lower front. Maybe that's why the regular cleaning took no time? They said they would go back and regular clean the top with the deep lower clean? Is that normal?
3) They want to drill out the grooves in my molars and then replace that with the white filling stuff. They want to do this for 5 teeth. The issue doesn't show up on x-ray, but if you look at the teeth, the groove appears darker/stained.

Total cost to do this work is about $1200 dollars.

Does this sound correct/plausible? Was this experience typical? Should I go about getting a 2nd opinion, and if so how does one go about that?

Thank you!",13Apr2017,1

249,"Hey guys 
  
So I have a lot to say, so thank you in advance to anyone who reads all the way through, but I'll try my best to shorten everything as much as possible.  
  
I've found myself in a difficult situation. I basically have to decide if I want to move to a new city or not, and there are pros and cons to both.  
  
I'm currently living in Grand Junction, Colorado going to university. I moved here about three years ago, and living here was pretty great for awhile. I met a group of friends that I hung out with pretty much all the time, and things were good. That is until about a year ago.  
  
One of my friends in this group met a guy. She started dating this guy around a year ago and that's when things started to change. The fact that she is dating this guy is not the problem, but the problem stems from the reactions of my other friends in the group. My other friends for whatever reason did not like my friend's new boyfriend. They made it clear to her that the boyfriend was not allowed in the group. Naturally, my friend started to distance herself from us. I want to make it clear that I was cool with the boyfriend, but everyone else was not, for a reason I still don't fully understand. This caused a break in the group, and we all stopped hanging out as much as we used to.  
  
The summer after this fiasco came and I went back to Denver to work for the summer. For awhile, I was away from all the drama and it was great. But the fall semester soon came and I had to return to Grand Junction. I dreaded doing so. I knew things would not be the same and I didn't really want to come back, but I did anyway hoping that things might improve. I moved in with my friend and her new boyfriend, as they offered to be my roommate and I was looking for a place to stay after moving out of the dorms. That, and I hoped that I could stay close to my friend even though she had left our friend group. I was optimistic. I thought at the very least maybe I could maintain separate relationships with my friend and everyone else from the group, better to see them all separately rather than not at all. As the year went by, this turned out not to be the case.  
  
I see my old friends from the group from time to time, but things are not the same as the once were. Also, I only ever see my friend who broke off from the group at home, and she never wants to do anything with me anymore because she'd rather spend all her time with her boyfriend, so she doesn't really feel like a friend to me anymore. This has all resulted in me spending most of my time alone, when I used to see everyone almost every day and I was as happy as could be. Now I'm super depressed and life doesn't have the same zest that it used to. My friends have all gone their separate ways, and I'm stuck in this weird middle ground.  
  
I don't want to be here anymore, I feel like there is nothing left for me here. I am playing with the idea of moving back to Denver and going to a university there and starting a new life. I have family in Denver, not to mention my best friend who I've known for years. The problem with this is my Dad. He doesn't really like the idea of moving back to Denver, because he thinks that changing universities will slow my progress to graduation. He's probably right, but I would rather be happy and graduate late than depressed and graduate on time. He can't really tell me what to do either, I'm 22 and can make my own decisions, but I love my Dad and I don't want to disappoint him. Plus, if I leave Grand Junction, although things have been kind of crappy here, I will be leaving behind the people I have met here, and I'm not sure if I want to do that or not.  
  
So that basically covers it. If you've made it this far, thanks. I tried to keep it short but there's just so much to explain. What do you guys think I should do? Has anyone been in a situation similar to this? I feel so torn and unsure of what is the best course of action to take.  ",13Apr2017,1

I asked for the name of the business and it sounded fake as frig. They said they were ""Business Holdings Incorporated"" Not to mention the person didn't even sound like they were from the US, they had an extremely thick accent and mispronounced Incorporated 3 times before they got it right.
