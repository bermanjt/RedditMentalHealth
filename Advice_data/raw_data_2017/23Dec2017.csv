0,"It's your classic tale. I, a boy who likes a girl, thinks a girl likes him. This is the first time (that I am aware of) that I think this has happened to me so don't know how to approach the situation. To help here is some information that complicates things. I go to a private boarding school in England. The girl who I want to start this relationship with is Russian, so, as we are now on holiday she has returned to her homeland. This is a problem for obvious reasons. Another is that she comes from an extremely wealthy family and I, while well off, come from a different world entirely. The main problem of course arises from the fact that I'm not really sure if she likes me or not. In lessons we are more than friendly; we always look at each other across the classroom to make fun of stuff; we walk back to our different school houses when it's just us two; we are best friends on Snap Chat and talk a lot about shit; she pops up to me asking random questions which she knows the answer to. And even if this doesn't mean she likes me that way, which it totally could, she's definitely at least interested in me in some way. Another main reason why she might not fell the same way is that she is quite an attractive girl, while me, I'm not unattractive, but I play a prop in the rugby team and anyone who knows their game understands the body type required for that: wide. 

So really my question is this: Do you think it's a realistic view of the situation? Or am I just a wide eyed boy who's been seduced by the allure of foreign fruit?
And how would I go about trying to move the relationship forward? ",23Dec2017,3

2,So I was with my ex for about 8 years we were both our first and sex was well sex. But now that we’ve broken up and I’ve been playing around with other women I’ve noticed that I have a hard time performing..  I just can’t get that rock hard like I use to get with my ex I don’t know if it’s because I was use to it with her and being with another women is well just different. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m afraid to get rated on how good I perform by other men this women has slept with. I just want to perform like a normal guy. Any advice?? Thanks ,23Dec2017,2

10,"We (26/F &amp; 28/M) live in an apartment complex and have the classic difficult neighbors. They have a fondness for:
 
-Blasting their music with their apartment door open which means we can hear the lyrics to every song and can’t do tasks like talk on the phone, watch tv, or much of anything without disruption
-Playing loud movies late at night
-Leaving trash and food outside of their apartment for days/weeks
-Trashing the nearby area by doing things like letting their trash blow out of their apartment or throwing drinks in the trash which it obviously misses and creates a mess
-A weird love of elephant stomping up 2 flights of stairs 

First, you’re allowed to be a rude neighbor. That we understand and have tried to not complain about loud music with their door closed during the day because once again, technically they can play loud music and be annoying. However, they will play it during quiet hours and even when we ask them to stop at 3AM will simply keep going for another hour. 

Following some observations, we’ve recently discovered that one of the men is actually the son of our apartment property manager. It seems that when we’ve made complaints, they just go to her desk and she talks to them. This usually means things quiet down for a little bit, but start back up shortly after. 6 months left in the lease and we’re not sure what we should be doing. It’s not like it’s awful 100% of the time, but it’s annoying to have such a nice community with quiet neighbors and have to constantly deal with these crappy ones. 

The way the apartments are designed, we’re likely getting most of the annoying behavior since we share the main living room walls with them. We had thought about getting the other neighbors together to make a joint complaint, but are concerned about that now that we know about the property manager. 

Any advice? ",23Dec2017,14
11,"So I kinda have a situation going on. I work in a fast-food. I'm attracted to a girl who works there (I think she likes me too). But there are some issues.

First off, she has a girlfriend. And I really don't feel good about whether making someone cheat or breaking up. Either way I think it sucks morally.

Secondly -and maybe it will sound weird- but as much as I'm attracted to her, I don't really find her beautiful. So I'm kinda scared that even if anyhow it could work, down the road this could be a major issue.

Today, a co-worker made a remark about us liking each other, as in liking ""liking"" each other. Another co-worker agreed. Another one said nothing. As neither of us is out, it sucks. And it double sucks because I didn't want to come out and words go fast where I work, so I'm sure everyone will hear about it.

Taking all of it in considerations, it seems like quite a dead end to me, so I just want to move on. Not sure how though. Has anyone been in a similar situation or has any advice? :(",23Dec2017,4

My Dad won't hear anything about putting him down, and while he doesn't seem to be in constant pain, at his best he seems to be mildly content. My mom also has to take the brunt of caring for the dog, and it's been causing a lot of fights between them. Generally my Dad's great, but he's been completely irrational on the dog even though nearly everyone who's seen him has said that keeping him alive is horrific at this point.

So! I want to try online - ideally I want to find a community that lets you post a picture of yourself and has voice chat. The picture part isn't really necessary, but it makes me uncomfortable and that's been my goal. 

I'm into gaming (but trying to find more social hobbies), programming, reading, and a few other things. I'm willing to expand my interests. 

There are two main reasons I'm asking this:

1. I've spent all of my online life with text chat, hiding my face, and only talking to people who try to talk to me. Never really to meet new people. 
2. I want to make friends, not necessarily a girlfriend. If that happens, that's awesome. If not, then that's fine too - I just need people I can relate to and talk on voice chat, text, etc.

He also said someone cried in his office after I said something to her about something she created and that she wants to go to HR about it.

I'm honestly trying to think back over the past 4-6 months and I'm at a loss of where this came from. I don't recall ever commenting on something someone else did, and because of my job I rarely have interactions with people in other departments and when I do they've always been pleasant, I also work on the computer on independent work so I'm not customer facing. 

I asked my other coworker who is always honest if she may know if I said something rude that I didn't notice or if I seemed snappy, and she was as confused as I was as to why I got that feedback. This situation has made me really upset and hurt, and I'm now job searching.

I'm not sure if I should have a meeting with boss to get more feedback on this to know exactly what happened, or if I should I reach out to other coworkers and get their feedback? Or if I should just keep my head down and job search :/ Any advice is appreciated!

30,"Let’s call his fiancée Rebecca.

For some reason, her and I have been fighting for a year and a half and despite my many attempts to bury the hatchet, she keeps picking fights with me. 

For example: my grandmother had died and my mom decided to have the Celebration of Life 9 months later, so that we could celebrate all of the things my grandma did and not be completely swept away with grief. Several months in advance I told my mom I could go and had every intention of going. Then my boyfriend lost his job and we were served with a ten day eviction notice. We were in day 8 of the notice and we didn’t seem to have any resolution. So, when Rebecca messaged me to see if I’d still be going, I told her I’d try my best but I wasn’t 100% sure as we had an eviction notice and had to make sure we had a roof over our heads. She flipped out and called me selfish and accused me of needing ‘conditions’ for people to see my kids. None of which is true. She also stated that their daughter asks to see my kids all the time. 

We ended up going to the memorial after we got the eviction notice taken care of and so we were late. Thankfully, I didn’t have to see Rebecca there.

I have a lengthy history of doing things for my family. I gave up a promotion and moved to help my mom with my dad who had been diagnosed with two types of cancer and Alzheimer’s Disease. A week and a half after giving birth to my son, I gave my mom a break from my dad because the illness was taking quite a toll on her. In those few days, I realized how far the illness had progressed. When the father of my children was at work and I had my kids, my dad threatened to kill himself and I called the police. It was a terrifying experience for me and while everyone in the family is off supporting my mom, brother (and each other), no one thinks about how badly this has affected me. In fact, I’m pretty sure that Rebecca picked a fight with me because she thinks that her and my brother were there with me, when in fact, they were with me the prior day. 

This has caused a lot of strain in my family and now my brother and I no longer have a close relationship. He was very close with my daughter before he dated Rebecca, but now it seems as though he wants nothing to do with either of my children. 

A few days ago, she posted something on Facebook that read: ‘If you’re a grandparent, uncle, aunt, whatever to my child, make it known to them. Because if you don’t - I sure won’t. My kids will know who comes around and who doesn’t. If my kids grow up not knowing you, that’s on you.’

It was 100% intended for me and it was made clear by a response my mom made. A relative of mine that lives out of town apologized and she said ‘I think she is talking about relatives in the immediate area’

I have tried multiple times to plan play dates to get our kids together and I’m sick to death of having to chase someone around.

51,"### My background

* I'm 29 year old Japanese man.
* I'm living in Japan.
* After graduating from university, I've been working as a programmer for 6 years.
* Currently I'm working as a iOS app programmer.

### Question

I'm now considering if I work in some English-speaking countries like America, Australia, etc. because:

* I believe good programmers should master English. Because almost all programming language and its documentations are written in English. And speakers in many tech videos speak English. And English is nomally used in many communities in GitHub, StackOverflow or something like that. But my English skill is not good. Especially listening and speaking. And mastering these skills in a non-English-speaking Asian country is so hard.
* I don't like Japan's work culture. At my current job, I am always working overtime. My worst ovetime record is about 160h/month. And at my ex job, the company didn't even pay for my overtime work. I'm disappointed in Japan.
* I believe my salary is kinda low. (about 35,000 USD / year). And I also believe programmer's salary in developed English-speaking countries is higher than Japan's one. And also believe these countries even have better work culture than Japan.
* I don't stick to live in Japan. I just want to find the best country for me and want to live there as a good citizen.

What is the best way to do that?

Currently I'm planning the following flow:

1. Go to Australia and learn English at a English school in Sydney about 6 months. 
    * Because I think my English is not enough to work with coworkers who speaks English.
    * Australia has a nice immigration system.
    * It's cheap to go Australia from Japan compared to other English countries.
    * I would need a Student Visa or a Working Holiday Visa.
    * For tuition and living expenses, $17,000 USD is needed for the 6 months.
    * I would keep my activity as a programmer. (e.g. commit my code to GitHub, go to some tech meetups in Australia, etc.)
2. After (or before) graduation from the school, find a programmer job in Sydney.
    * Probably I would use LinkedIn.
3. After successing a job interview, Finally I am a programmer in Australia!
    * I would switch my previous visa to a worker visa.

How do you think about this plan?

Thanks.",23Dec2017,2

2) How do I not get cold feet? I have like no physical experience with guys but lots of experience with texting them and getting them to like me via text. So I guess sometimes I’m worried they’ll think I’m dull in person compared to text
3) How do I stop being such a perfectionist when it comes to dating? ",23Dec2017,1
53,"I'm not very talkative, at all. I like to keep to myself for the most part. I do my job to the best of my ability and do everything I can to make sure that I'm keeping the people ahead of me in production up to speed. Within the few months I've been there, I've already been given a good raise just as a sign of appreciation for a ton of overtime I worked. 

But my coworkers, from what I've overheard them discussing, seem to insist that I do nothing at all. Sometimes they take the initiative to do things for me that I don't need them to do, which ends up leaving me with nothing and I have to find something else to keep me busy for that time. At first I thought they were just being nice but I think they're being passive aggressive. If ever I have nothing to do, I'll ask if I can help and 9 out of 10 times they say no. There have been times that have been so painfully slow that I have had to ask my supervisor if she could give me something to do. I'll clean my area 5 times over if it keeps me moving around and not just sitting there. I don't know what the deal is. 

It's made me somewhat paranoid. I see them eyeing me at times and I start to think they're judging everything I do. My social interactions with them are awkward and clumsy. Work has become an unbearably anxious experience and I've even started looking for work elsewhere, just to get a fresh start with a different group of people. I suck with these people I guess (or maybe all people), and I just can't get a read on them. I've tried. 

Sorry if I'm not making a whole lot of sense right now. I'm tired.

The thing is, he’s really submissive. He loves it when I take charge and pin him down kind of stuff. Which I guess is fun sometimes, but I really prefer a dominant partner myself. I just don’t feel satisfied with things. I’ve mentioned it before I like the dominant type, but I don’t want him to change the way he is for me.

56,"Okay, so I'm too old to be bs'ing around and have a family to feed and bills but at the same time I'm going through this crisis. The crisis is, I've just always listened to others and never took the time to listen to myself and ask myself what I truly wanted to do in life. I'm currently 26 and will be graduating with a Bachelor's in Business Administration of Accounting in 2019 after Spring semester. But, I don't want to be an accountant and sitting down and looking at excel sheets all day. I mean, I like the work. I literally like working problems from the book, thinking about accounting and business, how the whole thing works, but I can't imagine working more than 50+ hours a week. It's because I have a child that I care way too much for and don't want to miss special moments and want to have more kids down the line, etc. But, there's this thing. Today, I was an inch away from saying, ""screw this! Follow your dreams (which took me long, but I've finally stopped suppressing it), and change majors from accounting to kinesiology."" I'm already certified as a personal trainer with NASM and am about to start the 80 hour hands on training at one of their facilities. I want to train people, get a client base, and eventually open up my own gym. But I'm realistic and realize building a client base can possibly take 3 or 4 years, as well as opening my own fitness studio requires money. Can I make my accounting bachelor degree work? Should I continue the master's track and eventually get the CPA and just work for a bit to open up my gym? Or should I start just right now and work as a personal trainer full time at a gym and let that roll out? I'm confused as what to do. Basically, I'd be using my accounting income to supplement my goals/dreams of personal training until I was able to do it full time (which could take years). If I had to make an ultimate choice, it'd be personal training. It's my life and my passion. But realistically, with bills and a child, and a family, it's hard to just switch over to kinesiology and start out at a gym and wait to build the client base. Am I crazy? I've never heard of anybody going into accounting doing much other than working industry or big 4 so it's making me hesitant. I don't know what to say but I need guidance and help making this decision. In January, I begin doing Saturday only training at the NASM center for 10 weeks. In January, I also begin volunteering (it's paid, $10.50 an hour) for a tax preparation company. It isn't forever though, the job lasts until April and most people don't even get paid for it they just do it voluntarily. I lucked out on the getting paid part. But, the only reason why I signed up for it was to get accounting experience under my belt since I have nothing but classes to show for. I really need solid advice because as you can tell I'm all over the place. My mind is telling me to play it safe, but my heart is telling me personal training + kinesiology major right now. Please help me.

**tldr; I'm 26, have a wife and a kid, and torn between accounting major (graduate with bachelor's in summer 2019) or personal training (I'm already a certified personal trainer, about to start 80 hours of hands on training with NASM. Don't know if it's realistic to use accounting job/income in the future to supplement my PT dreams till I can do it full time, or is it just a waste of time altogether and I should start PT right now full time? 2 opportunities my way next year, either full time PT training and switch majors to kine, or work for temp position from Jan to Apr as a tax preparer while studying accounting. I love PT 100% And don't really like accounting besides working out problems from the textbook as weird as it may sound. I have a 4.0 accounting gpa too. Please help!**",23Dec2017,1

62,"Hi. This is my first time posting here, so apologies if this is the wrong sub.

My sister seems to have a slight problem with letting go. I don't want to give too many personal details, but I'll just say that her and our father have had a bit of a rough past. He's apologized various times for his wrongdoings and has changed his behavior. She still clings onto the past and treats him as if he's still doing wrong, even though he has done a complete 180 and changed. I get being mad for a few years, but it's been nearly 20 years and she still acts like he's never apologized. He's done everything he can and is trying his best to get along with her, but when she continually ignores his apologies and acts like she's suffered all this abuse (when she hasn't), there's not much else he can do. I just don't know how to even talk to her about it. It makes me mad because I know that even though, yes, what he did was wrong, he's apologized for it and changed, but it's like my sister doesn't even hear him out now.
Basically, she broke a house rule one too many times and so my parents agreed that it was time for her to move out. But instead of out-right kicking her out, they decided they'd let her first find a job, save up for a car, buy said car, have 6 months rent ready for an apartment, and *then* she'd go. Basically, they're letting her save up for everything she'd need while still letting her stay at their house rent-free, so they're not really kicking her out at all. She sees it as ""my parents are so awful they're kicking me out for no reason at all and this is so unfair,"" when in reality they're giving her more than a lot of people get when moving out. She's going to have a car AND up to 6-months rent by the time she moves out. Maybe I'm biased, but that doesn't sound all that bad to me. She still refuses to see the upside about it and instead is focused on ""they're kicking me out"" (which they're really not).
Anyway, back to my main point. I get being mad for a while even after someone's apologized, but for years? Especially when that person has changed for the better?
I'm hoping someone might be able to tell me how to talk with her. Or how to best come across with it. I know I'm being vague, but I don't want to give out too many personal details. I don't want to come across as mean or like I'm just ignoring her feelings. Can anyone offer any advice? Sorry for the long post. It's just been really bugging me lately.

He has gotten in tight with the supervisor and now acts like he is part of management. Many others are really annoyed with him as well but it seems he really has something against me.

He will show up out of nowhere to i guess ""check on me"" at my work station and made a point to lay eyes on my laptop to see what I was doing. 

Also, If I am on my phone he will complain to others about why I am on the phone. If I am 10 minutes late to work, he will complain to others about my tardiness. I was out of work for 2 days because my kids school got cancelled due to weather and he was complaining to others that i miss too many days of work when it was literally the only 2 days I missed since he was there lol

We will be seeing all of my immediate family tomorrow and we want to let them know that we're engaged.  We'd like to do it in a fun/clever way.  Thank you for any ideas.

Please note: while these do not need to be used, we do have access to two blowup dinosaur costumes, a dog, and Eeyore and Tigger onesies.

Current ideas:
-- an over the top song and dance number (likely nixing this as limited time to plan)
-- incorporating the prompt into a question game my family plays, ie ""what did X and Y do on their two year anniversary?"" And one of the read out options would be ""got engaged.""

Backstory:
We got engaged two weeks ago on our two year dating anniversary, and the boyfriend arranged a bunch of fun stuff on the day.

Worth noting:
I think everyone there will be happy for us, ie we don't need to aim to tread lightly due to jealousy or despair or secret longing.  Looking for something fun and clever and not too corny... and isn't dependent on thinking of it ahead of time because: tomorrow.

73,"I'm 16, and I'm lonely as shit. I almost never go outside unless I have to, I play video games constantly, I attend an online high school and I only talk to my friends on discord. About a year ago, I went to a public high school with a handful of friends, and two really good friends. I fucked up the one speck of confidence and happiness I had when I started talking to this one kid that my friends hated (I'll call him Dave). At first it was a joke - We would text back and forth stuff like ""Wanna hang out?"" ""Nah, I only hang out with Dave"" We would laugh it off and talk about how shitty Dave was. Fast forward a year and now I'm here, in my room 24/7- only friends with people who were part of Dave's whole posse/group. I didn't stop. I don't know why - I guess I thought that I was being funny or something. By this point I was only speaking to the ""Dave group"". My old friend texted me ""are you done?"". I never responded. In three seconds of not responding to one fucking text, I ruined my relationship with some of the best friends I've ever had. A few months ago, I added my old friends to a group chat and asked if things were all good. They wanted to know why I started talking to Dave in the first place. My best friend I've ever had said this to me: ""We had something really good, you ruined it, and we rebuilt it."" I don't know what the fuck I want to do with my life, the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that my parents are alive and that I don't want to die a virgin.

I don't really know how to structure this, so I'll start with an introduction, state some specific cases, and then elaborate on them further below.

So, since about 12 I have been growing at an unnatural rate, and I am currently 16 and 6'5"". Any guess what the first two questions I always get are?
1) Do you play basketball?
2) Do you play football?

It doesn't help that I live in Tuscaloosa, AL.

And nobody is more focused on enforcing this stereotype than my mother.

Case #1

Every year my mom has fearmongered me into beleiving I will be forced into playing football/basketball, but every year I have been saved by some kind of sickness or circumstance. I could not be less passionate about either of these things, but it's like the people around me can't comprehend that a huge 6'5"" 16y/o would rather program computers than play football or basketball.

This summer, if all goes well, I will have a programming internship at a local company.

My mom has threatened to take that opportunity opportunity away if I don't play football next year.

She even said this behavior would ""make everyone around you think you're gay""

Case #2

Demanding every detail of romantic and social interests, and then criticizing and making fun of them.

So, in this year, I have nearly tripled my friend count. And I'm really exited to have them now, as I usually have issues making friends.

On several occasions she has snooped around to find notes I write to my friends, and proceeded to accuse several of them of being gay in nature.

Case #3

Blaming me for her problems.

I decided to be in this year's school play (which is very gay, according to her)

And because she refuses to teach me to drive, she had to take me back and fourth from play practice. 

Later one night I heard her yelling from upstairs.
""He's not even good at it""
           ""He has a TINY role, why should he be going to EVERY practice""
           ""I havent been able to get ANYTHING done with having to take him back and fourth from play practice""

Our house is a huge mess, (the fault of everyone, but especially my mom, who is a hoarder) but somehow, the entire messy house is my fault.

Case #4

Forcing political and religious views.

I was born and raised a devout Christian, and I still am. And I have absolutley no problem with parents instilling religious views into their children

Here's the problem.

Every time I act suspicious or step out of line slightly, I get a religious speech about how I should get right with God.

I'm the only person in my family attending church.

She is a far right conservative, but I don't fall fully into either spectrum, as you can imagine, this gets me a good bit of hate from her.

Conclusion

After years of distancing herself from me, she wonders why I hate her.

My brother went through the same relationship crisis.

Even my dad agrees with me.

So, what can I do in this situation?

P.s. - I am not homophobic, inclusion of gay insults was to further point out her insensitivity.

Her previous husbandnot my husband's dad) died and left her with 2 kids whom the government gives her a monthly check for them until they turn 18. The daughter turned 18 a 2 years ago so she no longer gets the help, needless to say the 19 year old has 3 kids of her own and has been to jail twice and has various issues of her own. So she only receives payment for her son, she gets roughly a thousand dollars a month to help take care of him. So she started this online romance with someone who tricked her and told her he was in Europe and he was a very successful businessman with multiple opportunities for business overseas and blah blah blah. She ended up falling for this guy and sending him money and not paying her rent for a few months and managed to get her and her family evicted from the apartment. She made no effort to try and house her kids (the 19 year old is getting housing from the government) but she basically tossed her kid onto us. He's 17, has no high school credits doesn't care about school, smokes all day and does nothing productive. We offered and accepted to help her and bring him in. He was with us for nearly 3 months and everyday was anightmare. We continuously told him the rules we expected him to follow, not many and he followed none. Simple tasks as communicate when youre getting home. Figure something out about school or a GED or a trade, something to keep him productive. we made him apply to a few places (we asked for months and wouldn't take initiative on his own so I told my husband to force him). We kept reiterating rules and explaining to him that he was in our space and needed to abide and help out and try to do his best to change his ways and live up to the standards we were asking of him. Needless to say his mother (my MIL) never called once to see how he was doing, to see if he needed food (she gave us 200 for 2 months) or if he needed anything else for that matter. This kid was difficult, I would cook and he would be picky and always say he didn't like eating that. he would starve all day to complain to my husband that he was so hungry and if he could please get money to go to the local fast food joint which he ate for nearly three months straight. I have a young son and he wouldn't constantly wonder why he couldn't have said fast food for dinner every night as well. It seems so insignificant but it was becoming a problem. He never did laundry, his clothes piled up and stunk up the house. We constantly told him about it and constantly brought quarters for laundry and told him where the soap and dryer sheets were. the list goes on and on, things were growing tense in the house directly resulting from this. On top of this my husband and I were having our own marital issues, I have been having huge mental health breakdown due to my job going out of business (when this started my job was closing down, I am not unemployed). Other issues were hurting our marriage also, we fought constantly, I decided to reach out to my MIL and explained to her how this was an unhealthy environment because we were fighting on a nearly daily basis and that her son wasn't being cooperative with anything that we asked of him. She constantly said ""I will talk to him, I will bring him with me"" This went on for a month and nothing changed. One day I was extremely frustrated it was three AM and  one of the things I hated the most about him is that he would leave the living room TV blaring all night so I would have to get up and turn it off EVERY DAY for MONTHS. I was becoming insane, so I texted her and literally said ""HI, I think you should be awake too since this is your fault and all. I wake up every single day to turn off the TV I've asked your son to please stop doing this EVERY DAY and he still doesn't listen, so I think you should be awake"". The next day the kid was gone and she's now telling everyone that I ""Kicked Him out"" . I was willing to take him in and try and help, he was extremely unnapreciative and simply took advantage of the situation. both of them did, his mom and him. Am I in the wrong? How can I ever go around my husband's family? We've been together for 9 years but his family and I have never had a tight bond or any bond at all.

While doing this I stumbled across a post with the title card of the child porn film Daisy’s destruction. I had heard of this awful film before. The person commented ‘the video that caused shock on the deep web’. I looked through his profile and saw he frequents the deep web for things like drugs. He has around 1000 followers is it seems silly to post yourself watching child porn so I believe that he was just posting it but he does not actually watch/enjoy CP.

Yesterday was one of those days and as I was getting ready to leave, I totally messed up and forgot to clock out! I remembered about 20 minutes later when I got home. I, for some reason, couldn’t let it go so I called the restaurant and my coworker picked up. I told him I forgot to clock out and he did it for me. Today, when I went in for my shift I told my manager about forgetting to clock out (and the real time I left) and that my coworker did it for me and that it wouldn’t happen again and that I was very sorry blah blah blah. Then, when I saw my coworker, I thanked him and he said yeah, that never happened so I was like oh sh.t...is this really that serious.

For a long ass time I felt alone and just overall really depressed but then this girl comes along and shes a taste of sugar after eating tons of dirt (weird analogy but you guys get me right?). Anyways point is she was really special to me we shared special memories that I hadn't ever shared with anyone else a few are she got my first time and she was the first girl to make me feel good from just cuddling like this girl would heal me I kid you guys not if I felt sore from a workout she would make me feel worlds better. It seems like I was doing the same for her the way she would talk and tell me made me feel like I was just as special to her. But it all came crashing down one day we got in an over text argument and she just broke it off. She said to her it didn't mean much and that from the beginning she said usually relationships didn't mean much to her (rubbing salt in the wound) I was totally stunned by this side of her that was suddenly being so cold to me  and at the moment it left me shaking like I was going to lose that someone who made me feel good when I wasn't feeling good. skip ahead a month or so maybe a bit longer we're not together although we have talked a bit along the way mostly just small arguments like minor and once again shes contacted me again I want to say what I hadn't said all along mostly how much she meant and still means to me along with possibly finding out really how much it meant to her and whether I guess it not meaning much at all to her was really the thick of it.

116,"Hi I am a college student,  I used to be into gaming, anime, drawing,  and a major Tech enthusiast, but burned out on it. So,  due to my boredom I wanted to try something new. While trying to do that I found that what I wanted was to be around more people,  socialize,  and help others. Ultimately I care for people, but because if my hobbies in the past I grew up more introverted. I realized that staying quiet like I usually did kept me out of society. A big part of it was my hobbies. So this past six months I challenged myself to become more extroverted and helpful to others in whatever way possible. When I first started it was rough because it was the direct opposite of what I was and I wanted to do things that involved people and away from my old hobbies.  As time went on I felt good about what I was doing from giving advice, compliments, improved manners,  helping special students and my professors and anyone I seen throughout my day that I can clearly see that needed help.  As time went on I get these fluctuating feelings of feeling good to sadness because I sometimes feel that I can not relate to people as much because I am currently changing from these changes.  It's an ongoing process.  A part of me recently wanted to go back to my old hobbies because quite frankly I felt bored about myself with the updated changes,  but that's because I have not found any hobbies that interest me.  But another part of me wants to keep moving forward with these changes because I'm curious about what would happen if I continued.  I am very conflicted because I walked away from my old hobbies slowly over the years because I lost interest or because I get bad trigger memories from them. I experienced a few toxic cases from toxic people involving my old hobbies that wrecked them (some are relatives,  some are peers)  and ultimately made me walk away from them because it's painful to go back and something I don't want to experience again.  So my question is this should I pursue these changes or should I step back? What are your thoughts? ",23Dec2017,1

I've definitely lost one before and obviously never gotten it back (or even tried), but now that I have the opportunity to take someone else's I think I would always feel guilty. At the same time, I think if I just leave it here (or even turn it in somewhere) someone else will just end up taking it and it won't go back to the original owner anyway.

118,"This girl  was the only person that could make me laugh so hysterically, that I had so much fun with everyday we were together, and shared so many common interests with. I try to find that same sort of thing again in other women but it just seems so rare.  

I dated this girl for 5 months, but it was riddled with red flags. I took no responsibility to end things early because I truly fell in love with her, despite the fact I was her sideguy during a LD relationship.. not proud of that and I'd never go into something like that again. I only stayed because I naively thought she wanted to be with me and was just in a difficult situation.  Despite how much I really like her Im not living in some fantasy where I could see us together again.. I know it would never work because of how unfaithful she was and especially how she ended things with me. Eventually her long distance BF broke up with her and during the week they broke up she ended up getting with one of our friends who she was secretly madly in love with. She then broke up with me on our next date. Really showed how much she cared about me. I was in a mental hell for a while because of that..but I think I deserved it (karma) 

 This girl was crazy drama clearly and I'm glad things are over now. Her and the friend didn't even last long either because he broke up with her a month later. (Karma?) But she's moved on since then and is with another guy. We somehow remained friends after all of this, mainly because we have so many mutual friends between us, but we're not very close because there's just too much baggage and I don't think her new BF really likes when I'm around. 

Despite all of these bad qualities I know about her now it's her personality that I truly loved. Her laugh filled my soul with joy as cheesy as that sounds. I always felt I could be myself around her. We did so many fun things together and we had so many similar life goals and interests. She was not only a lover but a friend I always wanted. I just felt so comfortable around her. I wish I could find these similar qualities in another girl. It's so difficult though. It seems rare to find someone who makes me feel all these similar things. I'm not sure what to do now. I feel sort of hopeless like I may never be in love with another again.

He's a young man in his early twenties who's been going through an extremely tough time because he's in the Korean music industry. I'm quite familiar with how the industry over there works, the companies treat their employees horribly, they quite literally abuse them, but nobody's doing anything about it. 


The thing is, this person is suicidal. I can understand why. Korean musicians break under pressure, they become mentally ill because of the environment. I'm scared I'll lose touch with him because once his managers find out he's talking to someone on the internet, it will be impossible to contact him again. 


I don't know almost anything about him, which is good because I don't want him to get into danger because of me. It's extremely risky. 


I'm not letting anyone die on my watch. His contract ends in two years, but he told me he's barely holding on. It's an incredibly tricky situation. I think it would be extremely hard for him to leave the company right now.

131,"hey, I have a friend who my problem with is that I don't feel that she is investing as much in the relationship as I am so I confronted her with it and here is what she said, ""I really seriously do care for you..  You're on my mind sometimes 
I do care about whatever state you're in..  spiritually and mindfully,  this mama bear thingy is making me feel like I should change stuff about you,  upgrade you 
It started with getting you to feel stuff and get them out and now it's about you controlling them 
That's why I feel pressure 
Whenever I see something in you that I might consider a weakness I get this urge that I need to teach you to become better 
And all of that takes time and dedication...  And I have way too many people that I care about that I already do that to.  Some are worth it some aren't
In this last period I knew way too many that don't,  so I decided I'm not gonna be doing that for a while 
But then you come along with your million texts and thoughts that need either validation or correction and I have no time/energy to do all that all over again,  it's a PTSD in the making 
I escape every situation that gets me to invest more. 
Very true and that's actually what I am consciously doing.""

I replied with this ""you need to keep on investing in people even after having a couple of bad experiences, This is the bravest thing you can ever do. And guess what? You’re going to be stung as a result. You just will. But when the scabs form and the healing process begins, you get to walk away with no regrets. You have the closure of knowing you did everything you could. You were 100% true in how you felt, and if someone couldn’t reciprocate, it is their loss. And I promise, there will be someone one day who is just as invested. And it will be worth the risk. So please, keep being brave.""

she replied with ""Don't wanna do anything abdo. 
Don't wanna be brave, let me be.
It's my choice don't come in and be all batman about this.""
[Batman is what she is calling me and Abdo is my real name]

then I replied with this ""Can you live with the thought of relationships that could have been very close very strong but weren't because of that? There is a world of very great relationships amidst the badly broken ones there's a heart that loves you amidst the ones that hate you, can you live with the thought of not finding that heart because of that? There's hardship in everything people want to get it's the alchemy law People go through tons of dirt to find one diamond, there's people that don't wanna try hard just like you they will see if someone is gonna try or not If not they will stop interacting with that person immediately even though if one of them tried hard enough they could have been best friends, I'm just saying that I respect your decision and I understand where it's coming from but I just think that the benefits of being Hurt 10 times to find the one is really worth it I'm not being batman here I'm just being honest.""

I've spent six months of this year being inpatient in an eating disorders unit whilst undergoing treatment for anorexia nervosa. I come from a wonderfully supportive and loving family, however since being discharged I have felt as though they are treating me like a child. They are constantly checking up on me and asking what I have eaten and when, and tell me off when I do not have a snack or meal that they approve of. I understand that this is necessary, as anorexics can be quite sneaky and manipulative, but I am genuinely making preferences based on what I want to eat. I also know that my siblings talk a lot about me behind my back, which I'm not really sure how I feel about. 

I'm incredibly grateful to have such a supportive and kind family, however as a 22-year-old, I feel as though I do not have any control around them which, ironically, makes me want to return to restricting behaviour.

I'm considering returning it and trying to find something else but it would be pretty last minute since Christmas is tomorrow!

162,Long story short I was a passenger on a charter bus that was rear ended on the interstate that resulted in the driver of the Van that hit us dying. The bus was impounded and our luggage below was not available for us to take. The sheriffs office released the bus at 9am the next morning for us to take our luggage but the company of the charter will not allow us to get our stuff until the bus is towed back to Illinois. I had 2500 worth of stuff below including half my clothes and a few medical items that aren't necessary right now but will need in a week. The company is telling me that they won't ship back my gear to me until possibly next Friday or later. I NEED my items in that bag. That is my legal property and I have audio proof from the sheriff stating that they should have given the luggage back and it's up to them. Do I have grounds to have them expedite ship my items to me this week. I realize it's the holidays but after Christmas I plan on giving them a nasty call to ship my items to me.

Anyway, when we were on a date, aside from it seeming like she wasn't that interested, she asked me a hypothetical question, if I met a date and they looked different from how they did in their pics (i.e. facial features looked different) and they were ugly, what would you do? She said if it was her she would just spend the day with them because she's 'not rude' then never talk to them again. 

I have a feeling she was trying to hint something to me by what she said. After she asked me if I was overthinking what she said, and I said no, even though I was. And it has been on my mind since, and has ruined my self esteem. I have just stayed in my bed since and been down, I haven't even looked at myself in the mirror.

168,"Long story short... Over the last year I have been told by my boss (verbally) I would be seeing a salary increase, and promised 2 separate promotions. All things never occurred due to ""Changing business needs"". My own boss agreed this was unprofessional, but the decisions were made above him. The way I see it, he made the mistake of telling me plans that were not official.

6 months ago my boss was promoted. I wasn't offered his old job, nor was it posted anywhere. It just went away. Almost immediately my responsibility's began to increase. Fast forward to last week, I am now performing my bosses full duties and I can prove it. I have seen no raise or title change. During multiple attempts to discuss this with my boss, I was shrugged off.

Last Thursday I approached my boss more directly with the documentation showing his old job, was now mine. I asked for my pay and title to reflect my duties, he only says a couple works that didn't even make sense in the situation. After work, I get a call from my boss and he states he wasn't happy with the way things left off and he didn't want me to come in the next day.

I had planned vacation time that would have me out of the office until after Christmas. A couple days into my time off, I get a voicemail from my boss. He states he wanted me to give him a call when I get the message, and before I leave for work my first day back.

I am currently of the mindset that he intends to terminate me over the phone, unless anyone can tell me otherwise. Sooo.. Do I sent an immediate resignation, or call and likely be fired?

My boss isn't doing very well in his new role, I believe he is trying to be able to use the old job as a fall back plan. I have enough rainy day funds to live my save lifestyle for months, and I am currently in the secondary stages of interviews with 4 different companies.

My mom died in 2014 (my dad died in 2009) so it's just me (23) and my brother (25) on our own now. We have had very little contact with my mom's mother since she died, and not much more before that. We pretty much see her twice a year and have to invite ourselves over to visit on her birthday and around Christmas. This year on her bday, we visited, brought her flowers and talked for about an hour. It was really uncomfortable because she basically just listens and never says anything in return, making the conversation awkward and one-sided. However, at the end of the visit, she says to keep in touch yet she never makes an effort to reach out to us on her own. I feel guilty for not making much of an effort to see her throughout the year but I also dread it a bit because it is super uncomfortable and feels forced when we do see her. 

How do I go about reaching out to her this Christmas? Should I call her and offer to stop by? Do I bring something?

The last year of my Bachelor's studies was about to begin, but I accepted the job and made the subtitles for one of the videos.

186,"I married my husband four years ago, we’ve been together off-and-on for seven years.

I will start by saying, my relationship with my husband is amazing. He’s very kind to me, very respectful, I don’t believe I have ever heard him so much as raise his voice at me. I think this is really the first time he’s actually been really frustrated with me,  so I’m not used to how to deal with it.

I will start by saying, my husband has *beautiful* hair. It’s very thick, and he kind of dotes on it. On a normal day his hair is like the one thing he really takes time to comb before he leaves in the morning. My husband’s job requires that he has his hair cut pretty short, and his hair grows quick, so he usually goes to the barber every weekend.

I’m currently in styling school, and I had a “brilliant” idea that I could start cutting his hair at home. It would give me a little practice and save us some money on the barber. Hubby was a little hesitant when I brought up the idea. He *really* like his hair. He’s gone as far as telling me in the past that his greatest fear as he gets older is that his hair will start thinning or receding. So he was a little apprehensive about letting me “practice” on him.

But I convinced him that I’ve totally got this and talked him into it. So this morning I sat him down in the garage and went to work. Everything was going fine, he was looking good, I was feeling quite proud of myself. Then my elbow knocked something off a shelf behind me, and I was distracted for just a fraction of a second. Unfortunately that second coincided with me blending the sides of his head with a shaver and I managed to put a long bald strip most of the way across his head.

Hubby was just staring at me with a look on husband face that said he knew I just messed up but was too afraid to ask. I tried to find a way to fix it, but after he looked in the mirror we both heavy-heartedly agreed that the only way to make it even close to socially-acceptable was to shave it.

I kept telling him that I was monumentally sorry I messed up, he told me “It’s fine” in that tone of voice that means it’s really not but he doesn’t want to chat about it.

I feel like absolute dirt. I would never, ever say it to his face (especially not now) but he really doesn’t have the right kind of head to pull of the buzzed look. And I miss his gorgeous hair! Which I can’t really complain about openly since it’s my fault we had to buzz it.

My husband has been barely talking since, which is his typical “tell” of being pissed off, and I don’t really blame him. I keep asking if there’s anything I can do to make it up. He’s just been repeating that it’s fine, but he conceded a few minutes ago that he’s a little angry about it, and he just needs to be left alone for a bit and then he promises he will be fine after that. So now I’m trying to leave him alone.

What can I possibly do now? I can’t magically make his hair grow back, and we’re going to have to go through that unfortunate chia-pet stage before it’s back to how it was before.

Is there anything I can do now to make it up??

We were watching a movie then me and the girl started cuddling on the couch together. My dick was hard on her ass and my head was on her tits she had her arm wrapped around my head and was rubbing the top of it. After a while I moved my head up to her shoulder and unzipped her coat/sweatshirt type of thing and started to feel her tits with her bra on then I put my hand under her bra and felt her nipple. She still was doing the same thing while I was feeling her nipple but after a little while moved my hand out of there because our other friends were there and I didn’t want them to notice it. The weird thing is I’ve never kissed her or even held hands with her and it doesn’t seem like she likes me at all. She’s sent me booty pics before and she said I’m like her “not gay gay best friend”. After it happened and we all went home I texted her about it and said sorry if it was weird for you I didn’t realize what I was doing and she said it’s fine but that’s all she said about…now everything’s back to normal basically and I’m still texting her right now but it’s kind of awkward because we’re pretending like nothing happened basically and I don’t know if she liked it or not or if she thinks I’m weird now.

So it was no surprise I’d get called gay by my family when I couldn’t get a girlfriend. 

There’s honestly too much information to dive into, so I’ll ask away.

I’ve had sex with 3 girls

I’ve known 2 from high school since 9th grade

One of them knowingly gave me chlamydia 

One of them just ghosted me and got another boyfriend after we agreed September 19th was our official day, we saw IT that day

I’ve been feeling…like shit

My trust in girls, I just don’t know…

I know girls and guys are the same, they get horny, they have standards, and they are only human.

If a girl rejects me, I’m not gonna be like “I was nice!” Or “She’s a slut!”

Two girls I’ve known for five years have betrayed me emotionally and physically

And the third girl…I met her on the whisper app

I rented a hotel, and after an hour of talking she agreed to come

She came, and she was even better looking in person

Well what was wrong?

She had a boyfriend who was working 2 states away. She claims she has a sex addiction.

So now I’m incredibly scared to try and talk to girls in the first place because I’m not that special, I have a crooked nose, one eye is obviously bigger than the other, I have EXTREME acne scars and acne and blackheads

The lead one pistol whipped me in the face and they dragged me upstairs bleeding with my hands behind my back. They threw me down, covered my head with my pillowcase and tied me up with patch cords from my room. They were looking for drugs (which were never there as I don't use or sell) so after about 15 minutes of not finding anything while trashing my life they decided to pistol whip me more and torch my toes with lighters while I was strapped down to convince me to give up where I had hidden them (I didn't have an answer they liked).

202,"Me, (18) have some troubles getting it up when things start getting heated up. I had this problem in the beginning of our relationship, then the problem seemingly disappeared for a wealthy amount of intercourses and now it's back, worse than ever. Things are all okay in the foreplay corner, but when I put the condom on, my dick just dies. Sometimes it just comes back to life and sex can be somewhat finished, but now it just doesn't do anything.  I'm even afraid to initiate anything as the shock of not getting it up pisses me off beyond belief and I don't wish to relive it.

Never had that problem with a previous partner, then again, we lost the condom quarterway into our relationship. Before my current partner, I've also had one night stands, where I just couldn't get it up.

I've tried masturbating with a condom, had longer breaks from porn, I've even had my blood tested for testosterone, which came back with a result of 12.3 nmol/l, which is supposed to be average? I don't usually have problems getting it up myself and I still tend to wake up with the good ol' morningwood.

213,"So I'm a 22YO guy somewhere in Asia, and I dated this girl from last year until July this year. We remained the best of friends somehow despite some rocky situations and her going to Europe for a year (still is, so we're in a long distance non-relationship), but we're doing pretty great and she still asks me to marry her sometimes so that's a bit weird. She also doesn't have many friends so she kinda treasures my friendship. She also has some kind of a crush on my best friend, and I've already told her that I could not be friends with her if she actively tries to pursue him, and she kind of stopped because she treasures me more than him, so... Yeah.

Anyway, I used to learn German back in HS for 2 years or so, and there's this girl that I had a crush on. She's the silent type, so we never really talked. For the last 3 months of the course, she always sat on my table (it's a communal table for 6 but since the class keeps on getting downsized it ends up being just the 2 of us) and not on a different table. I always felt that we had this uh... connection thingy where I know I should have tried talking to her or ask her out and so on but I never did because I was too shy and awkward. On the last day of the class, she asked me specifically to take a picture with her, and made me promise to look for her when we're both there.

It's been 3.5 years since I last saw or contacted her, but I never really forget about her, even when I dated my ex. We're friends on Facebook but are not active there.

I know it's a shitty move to message her since my ex and I are still hung up on each other, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that I should message this girl, and I feel like shit even just thinking about it. So, reddit, my questions are:

1. Should I just try to forget about the German girl and hang on to my ex (since she still asks me to marry her)?  
2. Even if I move on from my ex and go about my life, should I message the German girl?    
3. If I do message her, what should I even say?

P.S. I feel I need to reiterate that I feel like shit even writing this out. I knew that I should just forget about both of them but it feels... Weird. Like something is telling me to just stick with my ex, but something else is also telling me to just message the German girl since I have nothing to lose.

She had a boyfriend at the same time, is big in drugs. Shes has a cool personality which i just try to normally be friends with her because we have to see eachother everyday cause we have classes together. 

Its definetly not as bad as it used to be. i used to obsessed mentally everything felt about her road trips scared me cause i was away from her, it was that bad. Now my problem is i do online stalking occationally so i can find more dirt on her or just to be a wierdo. When she posts something or sends me streaks i get excited. And every girl i check out and i compare to her and i feel like its making it harder to find someome even though i probably still wouldnt do anything. The point of this tho is i need to not care about her anymore shes bad news and toxic at times especially when drugged out on who knows what. She has fucked guys twice her age when she was 15.

I cant keep trying to convice myself shes not really like this that i still have a chance. I need her not to mean anything but a casual friend to me. This is because we have classes together so we have to see eachother and i dont want it to be awkward or for her to pull a jealousy stunt so ill come running back. Somebody have any tips?

-back massage
-waking me up in the middle of the night to try to get in my bed while i was naked
-complimenting my breasts
-sexual topics of conversation 
So obviously very inappropriate but nothing really HAPPENED
It really fucked me up in the head though

Like I am only there to help others and can't expect people to help me. I don't have many problems, grew up in a nice family with moderate income, got bullied at elementary and high school but that was doable and I got past that. Now I am 20, and doing fine, yet I feel so alone. I laugh and have a great time, but still it aches that nobody genuinely wants to know how I feel at that moment, or any moment for that matter. In the past sometimes people did care about me, but it fades a little, just when I need it the most. I don't want to fish for compliments or fish for help. I just want someone to take the initiative and talk to me. 

My job is to help refugees and they are so thankful, which helps me a lot. Why can't my friends be like that? Why can't the girl I'm seeing be like that? I want to know how I can have my needs met without being obnoxious about it.

My dad on Tuesday told me that he’d get me a job with his company if I agree to quit my job and move back into their house. 

I feel really bad about this, because my mom is very emotional, but just today my parents stopped by my house and brought a Christmas present over. I was so infuriated with what’s unfolded these past months that I screamed at them “I DONT WANT YOUR FUCKING GIFTS!” And threw it on the ground. I peeked through the blinds, and saw my mom was crouched over the present in tears, while my dad was comforting her. I got a text later the same day from my dad saying “don’t bother coming to Christmas, you broke your mom’s heart, we just want to help you.” I can’t understand how he could say they’re trying to help when last month he threatened to go through the courts to make me legally incompetent.

Here's my story:

When I was in my early 20's I was working in a hospital as an EKG Tech. I had plans to become a search and rescue flight nurse. I had a lease option on a town home and things were good. Until they weren't... 
 
To keep it short and to respect privacy, I won't detail the specifics. However, I found myself in a position I never imagined being in. I came to the aid of my minor sister in a violent altercation where she was being attacked and the short end of the stick is what I found myself holding. A prison sentence for manslaughter. Please note that I never intended  to harm this individual and was the first one to request a call for help. I had never been in trouble before, nor have I since. The short end of it is none of the details mattered to the prosecutors and I lost nearly a decade of my life.

While incarcerated I took every educational, personal growth, spiritual class/opportunity I could. Sadly I live in a state that's economy is propped up by a prison economy which doesnt foster rehabilitative efforts and I wasn't able to achieve much, an AA with an emphasis in both business and psychology.

The aftermath:

I have been out for a several years, in that time I have managed to find multiple low level jobs and undertake multiple local charitable deeds including organizing an entire community to participate in social and civic causes. I've gotten married, own a house (credit due my wife), have two cars. On the surface I have done well.

The problem:

I have little in the way of education for someone in their mid 30's, &amp; I cannot seem to overcome the conviction I have as being a barrier to an actual career. I want to be productive, to contribute  meaningfully to my family and to my community, but I am hitting a wall due to my conviction and my lack of curent education. The jobs I get aren't  paying enough of the bills, are dead end, or short lived.

The goal:

To find a clear path to a successful career that I can pursue that will be profitable for developing a family and contributing to my community. A career which won't be hindered due to my conviction, and one in which I can pursue further  education that will not only benifit me and my wife, but also our future children. I would like something I can get into within a year or two and then continue moving up through further education.something with a, good career outlook occupational demand.

Please advise....

Mid thirtys, serious conviction, lack of education, seeking redemtion, ISO ADVICE.

240,"I recently met someone who seemed really nice and just my type off of Reddit. Seemed intelligent and lived nearby. We started texting at her request. However, as soon as I told her my height, she ghosted me completely. Things were going so well until that road block. She told me she was 181 cm before that, which then lead to my height. I told her I was short. She asked how much. I told her. ^^^^180 ^^^^cm. Then silence.

This shit seems to happen ALL THE TIME. I'm told I'm too short by most women! I have the communication skills, the intelligence, the sense of humor, and the honesty, and have been told by other girls in relationships that ""I'd make a good catch for someone"" and have been friendzoned a lot. It seems my shortness always gets in the way, though. This is before they can even get to see me. (I'm also as unattractive/ugly as I am short, but it never gets that far.) All straight girls in this part of the world seem to want tall guys and any short one is seen as disgusting as a gangrened leper.

Should I just start lying to them and telling them that I'm taller than I actually am? I figure, I have a better shot of them forgiving me for lying about that once they get to know and like me than I have of being insta-rejected for being under six foot. It seems to make more sense to me, even though I rarely ever lie.

I'm 25. I live in California. Relatively, I'm in okay spot. My world isn't shattered. I have a good family. A good job. This situation is just odd.

I just ended a 4 year relationship. If mutual break ups are a thing, this was one of those instances. We just fell out of love. Stopped sleeping together and lost mutual interests. There are other factors, like I'm to over weight and she wants to have freedom but those seem less important. Especially since I asked her point blank ""Do you love me? Do you want to try and fix this?"" She replied, ""I don't have an answer for you."" That solidified it, I think.

Since I've been home I've noticed that my parents (particularly my mother, who doesn't work and asks my dad for money to go to the store almost every day) spend way more money than they should based on how much my dad makes and how many mouths they have to feed (since I'm usually at college, that would be 2 adults and 2 children). They have a keurig that they buy the little pods for, they buy $6/gallon organic milk, they buy Ghirardelli chocolate syrup instead of the generic stuff. I could go on and on. 

Unsurprisingly, they have no savings that I know of, no investments, and still owe a lot on the house. They're almost 50 years old. Thankfully, I don't think they have any debt, but they barely have any money either.

I really want to tell them that they need to be better with their money. Hell, I only make $15,000 less than my dad and I don't have any kids to feed or a house payment. Theoretically, I'm in a better position to be a spendthrift but I save money in absolutely every way possible. Obviously their finances are their business and they're paying for my school so I'm in even less of a position to tell them what to do with their money. But I feel like they're screwing themselves over when they're older because they're in a terrible financial position and might not even be able to retire. 

Should I tell them to be less wasteful with their money or just stay quiet?",23Dec2017,2
268,"Hi reddit, this is a weird one I guess. About a year and a half ago I dated a girl for about 3 months, I was immediately entranced by her. On paper she was my dream girl, but eventually she decided to end it when she left for college, which she tried to avoid me and leave without a word but eventually said goodbye at the last minute.  I fell into a depression afterwords and have since come out but when I think about her I still get extremely sad. I had dated other girls before, for longer too but for some reason she’s different. I’ve gone on a few dates since but unfairly just compare them to her. I don’t text her and very rarely ever use social media to see her on there. The only contact I have is that one of my close friends is also close with her. I know this isn’t right and that I’m probably not actually in love with her but I can’t shake the feeling and just can’t stop thinking about her. It’s like I’m never happy or really feeling g anything unless something brings her up, which just ruins my day more. What can I do to get over this? I’ve been trying to get hobbies and meet new people but at this time I’ve been moping about the relationship almost 4x longer than the actual relationship lasted. ",23Dec2017,3
270,"I wasn’t a great student in high school and was honestly surprised when I got accepted into West Virginia University Tech. Last semester I thought I was working as hard as I could, spending 4 months on my own for the first time in my life. It cost almost $30,000 to send me there a semester and I knew I wasn’t doing great when midterms came around, so when I returned from thanksgiving break I was in high gear, working non-stop to bring my grades up, but last Monday I got my grades back and my GPS is less then one. I felt like I was doing better and I have a prescription for adderall which could only help, so my question is should I go back?",23Dec2017,3
271,"I just finished my first semester of college, it has been a great start so far. I don't know if it's the change of phase or that my mindset shifted or whatever, but I no longer want to talk to my ""close"" high school friends(?) It began to feel like that when I wasn't available for one of my friend's birthday. She became hostile over it and I apologized, she was fine after I did, and we talked at college like nothing happened. But still sometimes she was weird, and I just felt awkward. Since the birthday thing any meet up plan mentioned in the group chat never went through, always unfinished and messy, and they kind of made/make me feel like an extra. So I just distanced myself because I felt like the problem, and because I felt it was unfair to stick to a grudge when I apologized (I wrote her literally a testament and I gave a gift even though a few days passed) and she seemed okay about it when we met up at college a lot of times. That happened a month ago. A week ago I decided to just stop texting in the group chat because I realized the topics we unproductive. An example: The birthday friend texted in all caps asking us if we remembered a girl from high school. We answered yes, and she responded that she saw that girl holding hands with another girl. A big ""So?"" creeped in my mind. They also talk about other people from HS, and I honestly don't care about those people. I find it's such a waste of time to talk about other people's lifes. Sometimes when we meet at college we don't have much to talk about either. I sometimes feel like I'm the one building the conversation. The moment I stopped texting in the group chat I felt so relieved/calm, and I stopped wanting to share my feelings/thoughts with them. I don't know if it's wrong to stop the friendship like this. What do you think about all this? Any recommendations?",23Dec2017,4
273,"So it’s me (15), my mom, dad, and my brother (21). My brother is such a pain in the ass. The source of it all is he has bipolar disorder and doesn’t take any medication for it.

To add to that, he’s a self-centered, attention-seeking little bitch. He gets mad for no reason and has psychotic fits of rage. Like he’ll hold a knife to his throat, try to fight us. By now you’re probably saying “CALL THE POLICE!!!” Well every time we’re about to, he says some shit like “If you call the police I’ll kill myself” or “If you call the police I’ll just get out and slaughter you all”

Keep in mind I’m 15. I can’t move out or anything. And I’ve begged my parents to kick him out but they don’t have the balls. I’m tired of this shit. I just want to live in my home and play Xbox in peace. At this point I’d rather he be in jail. What can we do?

**TLDR**: My older brother is psycho and annoying as hell. But I’m 15 so I can’t move out. What do I do?",23Dec2017,4
274,"So... not sure where to begin. This is elaborate and confusing and frustrating. Couple weeks ago my bf started freaking out saying he has been hacked and there are people messing with him and watching us. He wasnt sleeping and was acting irratic so i insusted he seek psychological help. Did that, came home. Insisting it was real. Im frustrated thinking he is nuts and dont know how to help him. Then...we are home together cleaning etc. His phone is in the dining room hooked to the soundbar playing xmas music. He is in another room sorting through storage including a toy keyboard/piano, he checks his phone a few minutes later and theres a group text with 4 numbers all out of state and unfamiliar and they sent a picture of a piano. They are talking and laughing about it he brings me the phone and i text them saying who are you people? Not in my contacts. They respond with a meme saying it doesnt matter. Then laughing faces/emogies. I try to play it cool and they keep mocking me. Someone tell me if this is even possible. I mean the coincidence of it alone is hair raising but ... idk. Theres other stuff too, like his phone does things on its own and keeps showing his location as chicago.  And i turn the location off it turns it back on and updates. I was advised to shut it off and pull the battery but if they could see him in my home...what does that mean?",23Dec2017,3
275,"i've already posted about this but i just cannot confront her. i'd seem really needy and i guess i need to make new friends.

 but me and my ""best friend"" live pretty close and we have a good time when we hang out (at least thats what it seems like ). its just that i always need to ask and i just gave up cuz apparently she was ""busy"" and i guess she doesnt wanna hang out since she literally went to the mall today with her other friend and hangs out all the time with a new guy. she invited me to lunch tomorrow with her family for her birthday and to a party tonight. i just dont get why she never wants to hang out with me ? i stopped asking cuz i wanted to see if she'll ask and i guess having lunch with the fam counts?
am i just a backup friend? 

also her mom really likes that she's friends with me cuz im a good student and she thinks im a goody two shoes so idk we have fun but maybe she's just friends with me cuz her mom wants her to and she wants to go to med school or whatever",23Dec2017,6
276,"We're twins, both 15, and I cannot cope with her bullshit. She's always moody, slamming doors, crying about her hair or her clothes, yelling at me, slapping me, throwing around insulting comments when I'm doing NOTHING wrong. Yesterday she sat down on the lounge while I was watching TV and started telling me, in a very...smug way, let's call it, about how I ""threaten her"" and ""my presence makes her tense because I'm negative"" meanwhile I was just minding my own fucking business! I do nothing to provoke her because unlike her I hate drama, and she'll try and start something for no goddamn reason, then act all upset and confused when somebody tells her to stop it, and begin to try and make herself the victim. Her behaviour is bullshit and I'm so exhausted by it and frankly I really don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do.",23Dec2017,2
