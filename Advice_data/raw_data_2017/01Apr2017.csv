0,"Hello r/Advice,

I have been stuck in a rut for over a year and I'm not sure what else I can do to help myself. I have some ideas, and I've tried my best, but I would really appreciate some outside opinion.

Background:

I'm 22 going on 23, prior to my development of Asthma, Anxiety and Hyperacusis in 2014, I was a normal, healthy college kid. But 2014 changed my life for the worse and I have had extreme difficulty adjusting to life since.

I have severe asthma; it suddenly began in 2014, and has worsened since. I am medication for it and still working with doctors to find solutions, but it is still uncontrolled. I cannot do any exercise more than walking without triggering attacks, any kind of smoke, pets, dust, mold, fumes, pollen, cold air, stress or anything you're not supposed to inhale will set off attacks for me. I rarely leave my house or attend social activities because of my severe asthma. I have been in the ER countless times last year for attacks, when I get sick with a cold it quickly worsens and often turns into bronchitis. It's awful. It also feeds my anxiety and makes me anxious as hell..can't relax when you can't breathe right, and always have legitimate worries about asthma flaring up..can't even enjoy myself when I do go out. Many of the medications also make me more jittery and nervous and make me feel ill.

My anxiety primarily worsened after a bad trip with fake acid in 2014 as well. Since then my anxiety has worsened. I am often anxious even when there is nothing to worry about, I have panic attacks which fuel my asthma which also creates depression which fogs my mind up and makes it hard to focus. I have been seeing therapists and talked about medication but it has only helped little.

My hearing condition, Hyperacusis, is a hyper sensitive hearing disorder that causes collapsed tolerance to normal sounds; normal sounds can cause ear pain for me. It was severe at first, but thankfully I have recovered in the past few years using sound therapy.

All of these health issues that suddenly came on in 2014 has left me a debilitated and traumatized person. These problems continue to prevent me from exercising, socializing, it greatly affects my work personal relationships, affects my hobbies and talents (I'm a singer and songwriter and I can't even sing let alone play out with my band or try to go to shows because of the fear of asthma attacks).

I live with my parents and work full time. My full time job provides decent pay with room for advancement, I have health benefits, 401k, stock, paid vacation, etc. I don't have any completed college but I’m 2 classes away from an AA and I planned to complete a bachelors degree, but this problems have also put that on hold.  Currently I'm on a FLMA leave for my asthma for 3 weeks, trying to make some changes to my lifestyle in hopes of improving my condition (diet, breathing exercises, medication, etc.) so far, it is proving to not be enough time and I am frustrated and anxious about not being productive enough and wasting my time.

The problem is, my full time job is an amazing opportunity as I had a personal connection that got me in, and I want to stay with the company because they will help pay for school if I go and have been flexible with my consistent absence due to my health, but I feel like I am so consumed with my health problems that I am doing nothing for myself by working full-time but forcing myself to work while I continue to stay the same with my health and be physically and mentally miserable with the state I'm in. I am also having to deal with a verbally abusive and aggressive supervisor that makes the work environment very unnecessarily stressful and uncomfortable to work in. I have been verbally harassed for my health problems. It is a complex issue for another day, but it is a large reason why I want to quit.
My parents are supportive and understanding of me and don't want to kick me out. I pay rent to them and pay for all of my own bills. I have a good amount of money saved up so I'm not struggling with finances at the moment. If I am not working but in school they are happy and don’t mind me staying.

I feel like at this point I need to seriously get a handle on this and should try to work part-time, but I feel deep down that I need to quit my job and get some serious professional help. One issue is that I need a new car asap and I don't want to take out a loan if I have to end up quitting my job to focus on my health. I have savings to pay it off for a while but I want to have income. 

I am considering the following options:

Working Part-Time to resolve health issues until further notice (if my employer lets me)
Quitting and applying for Short-Term Disability until I can resolve health issues
Quitting and applying for unemployment to get on until I can resolve health issues
Quitting with no income to purely focus on resolving health issues

I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I hate what I've become and I want to be a normal 20 something kid with his own life, but these problems are just so severe and I feel like no matter how hard I try I'm in the same place. I don’t want to be lazy and mooch off my parents. I know this is really complex and crazy but I would really appreciate some outside opinion. Unfortunately many people only see what is on the outside and assume I am over exaggerating or fabricating my issues. It is very frustrating.

Please let me know if you feel my post would be better fitted in a different sub reddit, I will make the appropriate changes.

Thank you in advance,

2,"I went to a car dealership today to see about buying a used car. I was looking to spend only 7-10k. We have a daughter and another one on the way, don't have the best credit, and are hoping to buy a house in the not too distant future, so we can't spend too much on a car and don't want to take out a loan if possible. It turned out the salesman was a guy I went to high school with an he told me it would be smarter for me to lease a new car. He made it seem like he was doing me a favor telling me this and said that he'd make more by selling a used car, but he's looking out for me. He seemed sincere, but a lot of people have told me buying a car is the more financially responsible decision. Not sure what's true. Can anybody help me out? Thanks!",01Apr2017,1
4,"The oncologist told him his chance of survival, without a transplant, was almost non-existent. Fortunately, his transplant was successful and he is 43 days post transplant. He still get tired frequently and is susceptible to illness as he has no immune system. 

I am doing everything. At first I didn't mind because, well you know, he was sick and dying. I love him so much. I feel guilty for even writing this but I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful. Maybe I'm writing this just to allow myself to vent. I would never tell him or any of our friends how I am feeling. We are constantly told what an amazing love story we have, not to mention his mom often tells me I am his rock and that he couldn't have made this journey without me. While those are all nice compliments it makes me feel trapped. I know it sounds weird. I don't dare say anything to anyone how I am feeling. My SO is my dream man. I'm just feeling sad, tired and worn out. 

How do I move past these feelings? Should I talk to him or will that make matters worse? ",01Apr2017,1
5,"Hello r/Advice. I guess I should introduce myself first, My name is Riley (14/M), I am very insecure and get depression waves occasionally. My question is; When I get the waves of depression (at least once every other week) I feel like I can't breathe and that the world is closing in around me, I believe that the depression is caused from my insecurities, as they usually occur after getting too insecure (If that makes any sense) I have found that if I have something to keep me busy I won't get affected by it. Do you know if this is an effect of puberty or extreme insecurity? and if so, is there a fix or temporary remedy for it? Thank you in advance",01Apr2017,1
6,"I finished up five years of active duty so I could be a stay at home mom. The mom life plus working as much as I did, my husband wanted me to ""be happy"". Well it's been five months since I started the home mom life and I'm not any happier than I was while working. Postpartum depression has been a nightmare for me and it's something I struggle with on a daily basis. We moved to a different state for my husband's job, where we have absolutely no family and no friends. It's incredibly lonely and most days I struggle to function. 


My husband has always blamed himself for my issues. I wouldn't have postpartum depression if he hadn't gotten me pregnant. I would still have my friends if we hadn't moved. If I was still active duty, I would at least be kept busy and not miserable at home. Things like that. I've never blamed him for this stuff. It's all stuff he tells me he's feeling. 


Whenever I'm having a low day and try to just vent to him, his first response is always ""I'm sorry. It's my fault. You're unhappy because of me."" The problem is I'm not venting to bring that up. I'm venting simply because we're husband and wife and we're supposed to tell each other what's going on inside our heads. I'm having a bad day and what him to know how I'm feeling. As a result of this reaction though, I've just stopped telling him things. He goes down that route EVERY time. I'm looking for comfort and solace and understanding, not for someone to take the blame. 


How can I productively talk to him without him jumping to the instant negative response?",01Apr2017,1

Have you tried it, and if so, were you satisfied/dissatisfied with the results?

10,"Let me define ""caring"" and ""giving a fuck"", on this context.

1. Caring - they give me a safe shelter and food everyday

2. Giving a fuck - wanting to know about my social affairs, my things in school, my general well-being

Don't get me wrong, I deeply appreciate the fact that my parents care about me, but I just don't know how to feel/go on about the idea of them not extending their ""cares"" beyond my basic survival needs.

There was once this time when I was so drowned in schoolwork for a week, that in one day, my body just decided to sleep for 20 hours. Neither one of them woke me up; though they would have noticed my car being parked in the driveway going to work and going back home. None of them ever ask me about my friends, girls that I like, tests that I fail, things that I would like beyond our poorly imbalanced high-protein diet, etc.

Though I know that ADD is said to be hereditary, I think I am developing ADD because of my situation. I'm doing things that I wouldn't normally do just because I know that there's no consequences from my parents, like not studying or doing my homework at all, just because my parents don't give a fuck about my grades, which is a little ironic, considering Asian parents are said to be very strict about education.

Some people might think that my parents think that I am just independent, but that is pretty inaccurate because I am clearly dependent on them, as I don't have a professional or part-time job (I'm in highschool). I am not the ""edgy"" type kid that hates his parents, but it is not often either that I get to talk to them because I sleep very early and go to school early in weekdays.

Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks!",01Apr2017,0
12,"So my girlfriend and I were planning to go to a park today. We planned it awhile ago and we were both so excited to be with each other. One day her best friend started being a b**** to her and she just ignored it. She kept doing it but I tried my best to comfort her. She ignored her and was still so excited to go out w me. The day came for us to be together and she texts me saying ""my mom doesn't want us to be alone at a park when it's all cloudy"" (we're 15 btw). I knew it sounded a bit weird because we are always alone together but we ended up not going. Now she won't text me for some reason and idk why. I thought it was because she was just mad about her friend and needed time but then I saw her Snapchat and it said ""someone make plans with me"" although we made plans and she bailed on me. I realized that her mom wasn't the one who didn't want her to go and it was her that didn't want to go. She bailed on me last minute and now one of her friends are hanging with her instead of me. I still don't know the real reason why she didn't want to hang with me. Idk what to do about this. ",01Apr2017,1

16,"Hi everyone! I need some help deciding how I should move forward with my life. Here's my predicament- I live in both Washington DC and Austin, TX, and I have to choose one soon. 

I'm originally from DC. One year ago, I suggested to my 3 best friends in a fit of inspiration to drive to a new city and live there post-college, which was awesome! We were going to drive down there, then my girlfriend of 2 years would follow suit once she graduated in a few months. September 2016 we drove down, and my girlfriend broke up with me out of nowhere because she felt like I was ditching her. That stung a lot. Welp.

Still looking forward, I planted my feet firmly in Austin, TX- and I gotta tell you it's absolutely gorgeous there. Check it out sometime. Beautiful city, beautiful people, and I'm happy every second I spend there with my best friends. But one week into signing my lease, I get a call from a MAJOR national news conglomerate stationed back on DC asking me to freelance edit for them frequently (I'm a video editor). I can't say no to an opportunity like that.

I am lucky to have a family member who works for an airline that allows me to fly for a very cheap price granted there's an open space, so I set a system where I can fly and pick up certain freelance shifts back in DC, then fly back to my home in Austin for the remainder. It's been a full 50/50 split of my time.

While in Austin I apply for Austin work, but nothing great comes back to me.

It's been 7 months of doing this, and it's beginning to strain all of my relationships as well as my mental health. Since I don't spend enough time in Austin, another friend of ours moved into my room and he pays my rent while I'm away. In DC, I'm so alone and don't have any friends to see or greet, and the workplace is incredibly stressful. But it's an incredibly big honor to work for a national news outlet and would look great on the resume.

In Austin is all of my joy and happiness, as well as my 3 best friends, but there are no high-end job opportunities for me there- not nearly as great as the opportunities coming to me from DC.

At DC is my mom who is super stressed moving into a smaller apartment, and my current freelance job working at a National News station, which is an honor and incredible. There is also my family who is going through some hard financial times, but they don't necessarily need me although they have asked me to consider staying in DC and helping.

My lease in Austin is expiring soon and I need to decide whether to plant roots in one or the other. I can't keep doing life this way- it feels like I don't have a home anymore nor anyone/anything to work for.

Let me know if you have any questions because I can totally clarify.

Anyway, any and all advice would be wonderful. Thanks so, so much for reading. And shh dont tell my friends and family!",01Apr2017,1
17,"Objectively, I know I'm not catching up. Considering my only real responsibility at the moment is just finishing a degree, I take on a whole lot more and work every day towards achieving my long term goals.

However, in light of all the work I know needs to be done, I never tend to feel good about what I've achieved each day. Instead my mind is on work for tomorrow and the day after that, and so seeing the progress I've made never seems like an achievement and as such I feel like I have to drag myself into the next task rather than jump in with both feet.

Another example of this is in reading. I read 'learning' books - skills, life-improvement, etc - and always value having read something when I read it but with the abundance of book recommendations from people, all the books out there and all the knowledge they contain, I feel like the few pages I've gone through have made little difference. This tends to put me off reading for considerable periods at a time if I let myself think too much about it.

I'm huge on self-improvement and have found that gaining fresh perspectives, outlooks and ideas I hadn't considered before is great for my motivation and work ethic (e.g. listen to Les Brown talk about how the wealthiest place in the world is the graveyard due to the ideas and hopes that died with people who never pursued them). I first need to find these perspectives though! Does anybody have any words of advice for me (or others who struggle to appreciate their own labour!) to help me see doing work as an advantage rather than a drain of my resources?

Thank you!",01Apr2017,3
18,"So I'm an 18 year old girl and I met this guy online who's 16. I was 17 at the time we met so I thought okay cool. And plus I'm really not much of an adult. We were both looking for friends to talk to so it was good. We became really good friends and talked every single day all the time. We're so similar and it's just really great. After a few months we started really liking each other. No sexting or nudes or anything (that's not really what either of us wanted) and we haven't met because of distance. We are just really close and we really care about each other so deeply and it's such an innocent love like grandparents love or something. But today he was on about this ""awful lie he's told me"" and so I pushed him to tell me of course and it turns out he's 14!!!!! I'm 18 now and he turned 14 not too long ago!!! So after the anger wore off of him not telling me in the first place I was left with what the fuck I'm supposed to do. He's not a perpetual liar or anything and I know why he lied about his age. He's apologized a million times and I sort of forgive him. But with that aside I have no idea what I should do now. I want to keep talking to him but jesus fuck he's a baby!!! And I look like such a creep if we keep talking. The logical thing to do is cut him off but we both care so much about each other and each of us only talks to the other all day.

21,"I've been working in a banking job for 5 years.  It's not the best but I have all the flexibility I would ever want. I've been looking for another job for a while because I am tired of the job and I'd like more money.

Relevant Background Information:
I live alone.
I have a dog.
I go to the gym almost every day.

My current job---
PROS:
-Flexibility. I can reliably work from home once a week if needed.
-The volume of work that I have isn't huge.
-I'm working 9-5, I can leave early and go to the gym most days, and I take a pretty sizeable lunch.

CONS:
-Money: I would like to earn more. 
-I feel undervalued by the company

Just applied for a new job, nailed the interview, and got the new job. (Yay!)

My new jobs---
PROS:
-I'll be making 10k more a year than I am currently making (with possibility of making another 10k in overtime)

Cons:
-I'll be working 8-6
-I don't want to go somewhere else to do the same job (It's literally the same job)
-There is NO working from home
-I have a dog who I hopelessly love and this would make walking him and generally spending time with him limited.
-I had requested one day work from home a week. Denied.

New job: More money. Less flexibility.
Old job: Less money. More flexibility.",01Apr2017,1

46,"I'm a 36-year-old single male, who is one of those guys that seems to have it all together on the surface. My friends kind of see me as the swinging bachelor, with not a worry in the world. As is often the case, what's beneath the surface is less pleasant. 

Though I've kind of always been this way, it seems more and more lately, my mind is basically occupied 100% of the time with trivial nonsense. For example, the mental flavor of the week is this girl I've been talking to/seeing for a few months - we hit it off a few months ago, got hot and heavy, but I'm not really looking for a super serious relationship (which I told her), nor am I really that into her as a possible long-term mate. She developed strong feelings pretty quickly and wanted more, but I just wanted to mess around/have sex/keep it casual as made evident by my actions. Naturally, as of about a month ago, she has taken a step back and made steps towards moving on (there's already another guy in the picture). We still talk daily, almost constantly, but it's not the same. She won't even see me as of last week, saying it would be too difficult and confusing because she's still into me...and I'm clinging on for dear life for no reason other than to get her to continue to like me and appease my ego and pick me over this other guy. I'm telling her everything she wanted to hear earlier, sharing daydreams about ""our future"" and what not. Apparently, she sees through this and has me figured out, so she's not budging. She says she's still confused and really wants to keep talking to me, but it's a bad idea to see me - none of which is helping.

I'm fully aware at how terrible this is, but here I am still feeling like I can't breathe and am losing out to a guy that has proven himself better than me. The only thing that appeases this anxiety is when she says (or hints) about how she wanted to be with me, and still sees that possibility with me, so I've basically been smothering her to get/hear what I want. Top top it off, I'm convinced the reason she is looking elsewhere is something petty, something about my looks in particular, which I've always been pretty insecure about and the aging process isn't helping. Her compliments mean nothing to me and are forgotten as soon as they're said - what might pass as an insult from her (or anyone) will burn a hole in my brain for days. 

I haven't had too much trouble picking up women recently, but this is my kryptonite - feeling like I'm expendable and someone around the corner is better. I'm aware of the reality (she wanted more, I didn't, now it's too late), but I'm paralyzed by this feeling at the moment, and I don't know how to shake it. These thoughts occupy most of my time, rather than ones of any real substance or benefit to my life. The kicker is I don't even really want a long term thing with this girl, I just want her to be 100% about me again, like when she thought I was the greatest thing in the world. Though I do like her, I catch myself exaggerating and saying things I don't even mean or really think just to win her back. It's like an out of body experience where I'm disgusted with myself. My ego can't seem to handle any of this rejection. She's out right now and I'm glancing at my phone constantly, waiting on any sort of text so I can know (or think) she's not rolling around somewhere with this guy.

Basically, I don't know how to shake this. I know part of it is my getting older, and feeling my place in the world is less important than my peers since they have their own families and children...or like my looks are fading to the point where I won't be wanted by ANYBODY soon enough, thus possibly making this choice to be a bachelor no longer a choice at all. It's instilled a sense of panic in me that I've spent the last few weeks carrying around with little else occupying my thoughts, and is making me cling to a woman that is quite frankly, not even the best match for me, with the best parts being our sexual compatibility. It's all just eating away at me. I'm not sure where to start in bettering myself in this regard, and fixing how I'm feeling at this very moment...",01Apr2017,1
47,"My husband and I have been married for 5 months. We were together for 5 years before marriage.  We were living apart before marriage and doing long distance (about 2 hours away).  We planned to stay long distance until he completed his residency in June. He is now studying for his boards, so I have not seen him for almost a month.  He's also been really busy studying so we don't talk as often as we used to.  Anyways, this week he decided to email me and told me that he was unhappy and he didn't like how I was treating him.  I responded, and we also talked on the phone. I apologized profusely and promised to change.  I recognized what he was saying and am trying to be more self aware of me ""snapping"" too much or picking fights.  I am also trying to figure out why I do that.  Anyways, I've been a mess since then and have constantly been in fits of crying -- mainly because I am so scared he is going to leave me and maybe he is waiting until after his exam.  I am composed when I talk to him, but I hang up the phone and analyze everything that he says and am a wreck.  So now, his test is in about two weeks.

49,"Okay, here we go.

I'm currently living with my boyfriend, and he said he would rather me not have a job, so I'm taking care of all of the household chores and raising the dogs.

I came down here with my one year-old dog, and that was all we had at first. Just me, my boyfriend, and my dog. Then he got a puppy of his own. No big deal.

So I am raising and potty-training the puppy, but it's not going so well. Potty-training my dog was relatively easy for me, but this puppy is young, and therefore I realize she will have accidents as a puppy's bladder isn't strong enough to hold for very long until the age of 5 months.

So I am potty-training her to my boyfriend's specifications (as it's his dog, not mine), so it's failing miserably.

I clean up the dog's messes anywhere between 5 and 8 times a day, although I take her out every 30 mins. She comes inside and pees in the floor straight away. I scold her (as my boyfriend wants) and put her in a different room for about 10 minutes while I clean up the mess.

My boyfriend doesn't understand why she's not making any progress and blames me. Furthermore, he refuses to clean up after her if he's home. She just pooped in the floor, and I, being tired of cleaning up her messes from 4:30am until 10:30pm, asked him to clean it up. He said no.

So I said if he is not ready to have the responsibility of raising a puppy, then he should give the puppy to someone who can take on that responsibility. He said he'd sooner get rid of me than the puppy. (He never asked me to raise the dog. Just threw it on me. I don't mind, but he is treating me like the puppy is my responsibility although I didn't ask for a puppy)

I need to know if I should just altogether stop trying to potty train the puppy since he refuses to clean up after her when he's home.

I understand that he works, but he doesn't WANT me to have a job. So I cook, clean, do laundry, all the housework (and I'm very thankful to not have to work), but potty training the puppy with no appreciation is just too much.

I don't want to cause problems for the dog in the future though. Like if my boyfriend and I break up, and he is stuck cleaning up after her because I decided to quit trying to potty train her, I don't want her to suffer because of my stubborn decisions.

The easy solution is just to get her potty trained so I don't have to clean up after her, and I swear I'm trying so hard. From 4:30am until 10:30pm, I am taking her out every 30 mins between housework. It's just not working. Help?",01Apr2017,1
50,"Hi,
I am a 17-year old junior girl in high school. Prom is approaching soon, within the next month and a half. I had not yet made set plans for prom, but expected to go with my friends. However, I recently found out that my best friends are going in a limo to prom, and I am not invited. The person who organized the limo and sort of invited people to ride in the limo is someone who I am friendly with. That person invited my 3 best friends and other people that I am friendly with, but not me. The limo is full now so no more people can ride in it to prom. My friends have been talking about riding in the limo in front of me, so it’s really awkward because I won’t be there and I wasn’t invited. I am sort of hurt that they did not say anything to the girl who organized it, as it feels like they do not want me to be there with them at prom or they forgot about me. I remember my friend telling me that the girl who organized it said “I feel like I am forgetting someone” and asked my friend who she was forgetting. My friend said that she responded “I don’t know”. 
 I have other friends besides these ones, but I feel like I can’t go with them because they have their own set of friends, who I am not necessarily friends with, that they are going with. I know that no boys will be asking me to prom either. I don’t want to go by myself either because that would mean pictures of just me standing alone and driving to the venue myself. There would be no group pictures of me and my friends. I feel like if I go by myself, I would always remember going alone, especially when people ask me about my experience at prom. I feel really sad and unsure of what to do. I have been wanting to go to prom since I heard about it in middle school, and I already bought my dress. I feel like my friends are not really my friends because they do not care that I will not be there with them at prom. I feel really alone and that no one enjoys my company, as they have never asked me to hang out— I’m always the one asking (We have hung out before though, we spend time together everyday at school, and they’ve called me one of their best friends recently). Please give me some guidance on what to do regarding prom as well as my friends.",01Apr2017,2
52,"I turn 30 this September and I've just been laid off. I was lucky; although I never had a degree I worked my way up from intern to a program manager and co-wrote my own 400 page curriculum for high school students traveling abroad. I then would chaperone the students and prepare the in-country itineraries as well as facilitating the afterschool pre-departure leadership program the school year. My organization gave me healthcare and benefits--now I'm realizing my lack of education is making this job search extra difficult. Maybe it's the perfect time?

The thought of dealing with loans/debt makes me ill and I don't have leads on scholarships for older students. I also don't want to lose my unemployment and I'm deeply ashamed I haven't done this earlier. It seems unclear to me if my old SATs and college GPA is still relevant (back then it was 2.75--I dropped out to take care of my ill parents) and I'm not sure if any school would want me.

I've tried taking classes here and there for the past 6 years at the local community college while I was working, but I've found that the level of discussion seems so low that it's been hard for me to get excited--I'm not challenged at all. I think going to a four year would be best for me but I've never applied to one and I'm not sure they'll have me.

I know it's too late to apply for this fall, but I was thinking spring of 2018 would be a better option. I'm scared of losing my momentum. I don't even know where to begin or what my timeline of action should be, but I DO know I'm so tired of feeling ashamed of myself. *Please, any encouragement or grants that you've heard of would be helpful. *If you went to a particularly encouraging program that offers credit for life experience, or have heard of on? That'd be helpful too. 

*Are there reddit threads dedicated to advice and support for adults returning to finish their undergrad degrees that I've overlooked? I'm in way over my head. 

*Are there school counselors out here who have a simple sample application timeline they share with their high school students? I know plenty of teachers but I'm embarrassed to tell them about my struggles with something I know should be so simple- 18 yo kids do this shit all the time. 

My mom is better now but soon she'll need my support with her health because she's getting older and I need to have put myself in a better financial situation so that I can be a responsible child to her. **I reposted from AskReddit because they directed me here**",01Apr2017,14
53,"**Disclaimer: I am in no way trying to use my anxiety and depression as an excuse for my actions. They were unprofessional and not okay, and I have every intention of working to improve myself so that this doesn't happen again.

I just recently left a job where I no-called no-showed several times due to depression and anxiety. It was a retail job that I worked at for almost two years. I would not come in for work, not call, ignore their calls, and then go into work on my next scheduled shift like nothing happened.


There were a few times that I had legitimate reasons for not coming in without calling (Once I misread my schedule, once I was scheduled without being notified, once I called to see when I was working next and was given the wrong shift). But mostly I would either wake up and feel too anxious to go, and too anxious to call in sick, so I wouldn't go in at all. Or, I would wake up feeling so depressed that I couldn't get out of bed, then I would still feel too anxious to call in sick. 


Surprisingly enough, I never got fired for this. There were times when I was sure that I would get fired, because there was no way I hadn't gone over on my attendance points. But it never happened. My coworkers certainly weren't as friendly with me (100% understandable) and I didn't get nearly as many hours. I also went through periods of being really good about coming in on time and calling in sick. (I was really good about this the first 6 months or so - barring me misreading the schedule at the beginning).


Anyway, I recently put in my two weeks notice at this job as I got a job offer at a fast food place. I was really excited about starting this new job, and really working to change my behavior. But my anxiety got really bad. I was constantly worrying about my ability to perform (this was amplified by the fact that I'm a naturally messy and absent minded person - not fit for food prep), and it was impairing my ability to learn my job in a timely manner. 


I also accidentally clocked in a minute after my clock-in time a couple of times, and I called in sick with a bad cold. With their point system, that call out would have gotten me terminated, but my manager was kind enough to take off one of the tardies for me. 



I also suddenly stopped my heavy marijuana use, hoping that this would help me be more alert at work.



What it did though, was make it so I was barely able to sleep. My body has been used to going to sleep with the help of being really stoned - which helped my racing thoughts calm down and encouraged my body to sleep.  (I have insomnia - which is the reason I started regularly smoking in the first place). 


So, the first night I didn't smoke weed I couldn't sleep until 2 AM, and I had to get up at 5:30 AM for work. I drank a lot of coffee and went into work, and I was functioning (though I still was struggling to meet expectations). I was sure that the next night I would be able to sleep - due to the pure exhaustion that set in after my shift was over.


But, that night I didn't sleep at all. I spent the entire night worrying - my mind racing way too fast. 5:30 rolled around, and I stupidly decided to not go in. I was terrified of going in with such poor sleep - and surely performing very badly. 


After I had gotten some sleep, the reality of what I had done really set in. I knew that just simple willpower to not engage in this behavior wasn't enough - I had to start treating my anxiety again.


I had suddenly stopped taking my meds a few months into the first job. Because A. I felt marijuana worked better (it did at first, but my use quickly got out of hand - I developed an unhealthy dependency) and B. I was really bad remembering to take them - which made my anxiety worse. 


I went into the doctor the day that after I basically quit my job, and was given a prescription for long term and short term anxiety medication.



Now here's my dilemma - I need a job. I obviously can't go back to my previous job, there's no way they would take me back. 


So, I have to job search. I'm planning on omitting the fast food job from my work history - because there is no point in adding such a short term job that ended in such a bad fashion. Also, I was only at that job for a month - which is plausible for looking for employment.


But how do I explain why I resigned from my previous job? If I tell them the truth - that I gave my two weeks because I got another job offer - that would mean having to disclose why I left the last job.

I could always say that I left due to health reasons (which is technically true for my actual last job - though that's not the way to do it), but I'm worried that they will disclose my reason for quitting when any future potential employers call for a background check. 

Do any of you have any advice? Do any of you have atrocious work behavior history that they eventually overcame? Have any of you managed to get another job despite poor work behavior?

Once again - I am fully aware that my actions were not OK. I have started medication to treat my chronic anxiety (which is already starting to help), and I plan on starting therapy again. These behaviors are not a representative of who I want to be. This was the final straw for me - I am not going to compromise my mental health any longer. I need help in order to get better.

Thanks in advance for any advice. 

** I should also mention that I'm a part time college student, and that these were my second and third official jobs. (With W-2's and all of that).

61,"Hey all. So I should elaborate on the situation here, I suppose:

The friend in question is a girl I went to high school with. She graduated in 2008, I in 2009. For the purposes of this post, I'll refer to her as Rachel. All other names in this post, like hers, have been changed.

Rachel and I were close friends all through high school- we were in theater together and hung out outside of class all the time. It was never romantic between us (I was also close friends with her boyfriend), but it was no secret (despite my best efforts at the time) that I felt more for her than friendship. I never heard anything that suggested she herself was aware of how I felt, but mutual friends of ours knew, so I figure she must have.

Anyway, during her senior year she and her boyfriend (here referred to as Charlie) had a serious falling out, and the summer after graduation, she moved to New Mexico. We kept in touch for awhile via MySpace and Facebook, but eventually fell out of contact. I always meant to catch up with her again, but never did.

Sometime during the following two years (before 2011, I'm pretty sure), she went dark. As in, she totally deleted her Facebook account (we'd both closed our MySpace accounts in 2009). I never found out why. Last I heard, Rachel was attending college in New Mexico, was living with family there during the summers, and might have been getting into drugs.

Since 2011, I have occasionally tried to find and contact her, but have had no success. I want to let her go, but I haven't quite ever been able to. Somehow, the memory of her manages to swim to the surface of my consciousness once or twice a year. Maybe it's because I felt strongly for her once, but more compelling are the unanswered questions about her disappearance.

I found her phone number in an old yearbook and tried sending her a text a couple years ago. That took more time than a text usually does for me- I spent awhile crafting a warm and cordial message that made as few assumptions as possible and asked only if she remembered me. I was pretty excited when the text elicited an immediate response in the form of a voice call, but the caller turned out to be a thoroughly confused gentleman who spoke very little English. This suggests, to me, that her phone service was either cancelled or that her number changed- and evidently long enough ago for the number to have been re-sold.

I've thought of asking Charlie about her, but it seems like he may know even less than I do. He seems to have cut off contact with her when they broke up. He and I still hang out from time to time, but he's so full of drugs anymore that I'm not confident he'll remember anything even if he does have more recent information.

Rachel has family who are still living in my hometown- a sister (who is now engaged), a mother, and a father. Rachel still appears listed as family on each of their profiles, though never with a working link to another profile. Weirdly, her name is spelled differently on each person's page too (i.e. ""Rachel"" vs ""Raychel"" -variations like that).

Rachel is missing from nearly all of photos on all three profiles, too. The one photo of her that I can reliably find was posted in the summer of 2012. In it, Rachel is seated on a couch, wrapped in a blanket (during summer?), and is flanked by her smiling mom and sister. Rachel is smiling weakly, and apart from maybe looking a little pale, seems normal. Apart from looking a little older, she seems just like the Rachel I remember.

Rachel's sister (here referred to as Kate) and I knew each other from high school as well, though we never talked much. A couple years ago I messaged her on Facebook. I kept it light and casual, asking her how she was doing, it's been a long time, etc, etc, before seguing into asking about Rachel. You know: ""hey, I haven't heard from her in awhile, and want to catch up. Do you know of a way I can reach her?"" Kate never replied. I sent a follow-up message a week later, but it too went unanswered.

And the weird thing is, that's the most recent photo they have of her. There's nothing from the five proceeding years, and almost nothing from before that- even on Kate's profile, which is packed full of photos which are regularly added. The most recent is from this week.

I can't imagine how someone could just disappear like this. Alone, the details of her disappearance don't seem to mean much, but when added up, seem to suggest something- but what, I can't be certain.

My fear is that at some point after the summer 2012 photo was taken, Rachel might have died. It would explain the lack of more recent photos and perhaps her sister's decision not to respond to me. The thing is, the silence is nagging at me. I can't forget her, I can't find out more, and I know nothing about it now that I didn't know in 2014. I think I've uncovered everything that can through quietly looking around.

I want to reach out to her mother or father, but I don't know if I should, or how to go best go about it. I want to be sensitive and respectful to them, especially if it does turn out that I'm asking about someone who has passed away. Even if it's not a death (maybe a falling out or something?), this seems like the sort of thing that calls for a light hand.

I've managed to regiment my schedule so that I have anywhere from 4 to 6 hours (usually more time on weekends) of free time to work on these two interests each day. I want to improve to the point where I can get published and be considered a professional in both fields, and I realize that will take a ton of work and dedication, which I'm fine with. But I'm seriously considering if I should choose one and abandon the other to improve myself to the best of my ability in that one field (writing fiction or drawing). My love of drawing stems from its ability to tell a story, and I really want to improve to the point where I can render these images in my head clearly. Yet, at the same time, the sheer volume of descriptive work I can achieve by focusing solely on writing and improving my ability at making stories with the intention of getting published must be given adequate consideration.

I started working when I was 16 at Chuck E. Cheese's(a kid gameroom with pizza and parties). I was the younger manager in the company but then quit because my grades were dropping because I was so focused on my job. Once I graduated I served for a year or 2. 

Then I went to work as a receptionist at a finance company within 4 months I was promoted to a loan processor--that shit was so boring but I excelled and all my managers loved my drive. The company went through an acquisition and left the operations team because the other company had an operations team waiting for the sales. 

Now I work at a Hair Salon as a front office coordinator and all the clients love me and I get so mannny compliments of how well I'm doing. Been here for 2-3 months and I have started the apprenticeship program to become a hair stylist. The first class I attended I did great and the teacher was shocked it was my first class in hair. 

I don't have a passion for it--doesn't mean I don't do well, I just honestly couldn't imagine myself doing it for my whole life. 

Here it is 1 am looking at jobs on Craigslist and indeed and Facebook. 

I enjoy getting dressed up for work in button ups and all and looking the best I can look. I am super duper hospitality oriented and go out of my way to help clients/co workers. I love people! I love putting smiles on people's faces in everything I do. I am super professional when it comes to work. I can start a convo with anyone and everyone.

You click the link and it takes you to a website with Equifax where you type in your SS number and take the questionnaire. It gives you a confirmation code at the end that you are supposed to type in back on talentreef. The problem is I stupidly exited out of the questionnaire without writing down the confirmation number. It won't let me retake it and now that part of my hiring packet is not filled out making it incomplete. Should I contact my employer or should I contact Equifax somehow? I'm not sure what to do..,01Apr2017,1
74,"I have been with a small company for about 4-5 months now and it is a dead end job, even the owner of the company knows it and is not afraid to say it. Well he doesn't put in those words, he says its a transition job. The only person making a good living is the owner. He is very laid back and lets a lot of things slide. I do very well in this job and I want to ask for a letter of recommendation, but I am not sure how to go about it. 

I get paid about 20% of what I bring in, and the company is short on staffing at the moment so I was thinking I could ask for a raise and in return I would stick around a bit longer. Would that be a good idea? My way of thinking is that this company would bring in more money if I were to stick around and it might be worth it for him to just give me a raise.

TL;DR: Should I ask for a letter of recommendation after working for 4-5 months in a small company?",01Apr2017,1
78,"My family has an 1 bedroom apartment in the city and a house in the small town 25 km away from the city. My sister and I switch between staying in the apartment and my parents stay in the house to get away a little since it's pretty boring. It served as kind of a sanctuary because my mom had mental health issues(she's fine now). Due to financial circumstances we've been renting a room in the apartment since around December 2016. That room was mine and it had 2 closets and 2 beds. 

When I write this it sounds like a really bad move but that room was the most convenient because it's on the far end on the apartment. If we gave her the other room she'd have to walk through the whole thing. 

SF(sisters friend;late 20s girly girl that's kinda dumb) introduced us to the Roommate(late 20s; seems nice; doubt if she's the same type as SF) since she's her friend and needed a place to stay because of her commute to work. At first I was with Roomie because I've had a job in the city and the commute was painless. Roomie tells SF which tells us that living with a guy is uncomfortable and due to us not wanting to lose Roomie I get pushed out of the apartment and Sister takes my place. I should mention that me and Roomie interacted minimally and basically never saw each other(just ""hi"" and ""bye""; same thing with sister). 

I leave begrudgingly but get over it with time.

All is well until about a month ago when SF found some shitty job in he city. 
SF starts sleeping over without asking at least once a week to go in the city, key constantly jumps between Roommate and SF, SF one time even asks if I'll be in the apartment because she doesn't have the key and if not a 3rd person will have to pick up the key from Roomie and yesterday my sister saw her with heavy bags and clothes for going out to a bar. She now has 3 pairs of shoes and probably some clothes in the Roomies room. 

One time I come back from hanging out with a friend and Sister and SF are in the apartment. SF is eating something, Sister is keeping her company and chatting like a good host. Then Roomie comes back from work, SF just goes up to Roomies room like Sister was never there and comes back 3-4 min later like nothing happened(disrespectful).

My sister figured out that SF was ""kicked out"" of her relatives (sisters/step-sisters/aunts idk exactly stopped responding to her texts) apartment because she was pulling the same shit. It looks like SF wants to have an apartment in the city but doesn't want to pay nor maintain it. If she wants to continue doing this shit I want her to pay rent. I mean seriously, I was kicked out of my own apartment and now she's waltzing in whenever she wants? Fuck that.

Everything about this bothers my sister too but she doesn't want to act because ""her relationship with her is all buddy-buddy"". My sister doesn't want to act because our dad is a resentful and depressed person. She's already stuck with college and if this bothers her she thinks she'll become like him since it's a slippery slope. 

What can I do to help her confront her?

80,"So I met a girl a few months ago in class and had a little bit of a crush on her. She had a boyfriend so I respected that and layed low, but it was apparently pretty obvious I had a thing for her according to my friends and people that saw us.

Only problem is she's the original girls sister.

I have a good friend. I have known her since middle school and when we hang out, a few times a year, we always go out buy drinks and also hang at her house. We have seen movies together. We have done a lot. 

But last year in September, this band announced a big tour and her and I are really into them. And when their tickets finally went on sale, we talked about going (she asked). And she asked me a few times if I wanted her to but the tickets. I always told her I was going to hold off and wait to talk to my boyfriend. Which I never did. But the average person wouldn't go and buy the tickets with out someone's full agreement to going. At least I wouldn't. But she did. And didn't tell me until a week ago. 

She reminded me of the concert and not only that, told me she bought tickets. And now I feel obligated to go? But I don't want to disappoint her. 

I guess where I am kind of feeling bad about is she bought them for me AND my boyfriend. 

She doesn't have a crush on him or anything, they are just friends. One of the friends he thinks is a good influence on me. Considering I always allow her to have the fun, drive her home in her car if she has had a lot to drink. Or in my car for that matter.  And she has also stayed the night or hung out at my home. She's really fun and super nice and smart! So glad to have her as a friend, though! She's so quirky. In a fun way. Not dramatic. She's really fun. No lie. She's just lonely cause all of her friends are engaged or tied down. 

But idk how to tell her I feel bad. She did not have to buy the tickets and I tried to nicely tell her that I didn't want her to just jump the gun on buying the tickets. She asked me for weeks til they were sold out.

102,"Some context: i had a good friend whom I had once dated, who I hurt the feelings of during new Years (good intentions + terrible implementation = me being a pretty big jerk). Thing is, said good friend happens to be childhood best friends with the person who raped me as a teenager, and in angry response to what I really meant as helpful, my friend turned around and showed a post from a blog I had written detailing my experiences, to that Rapist (Potentially because said friend never believed me about them?).

And now, 4 months later, I'm still having panic attacks that said Rapist will come to my house and confront me (Im a college kid, so I technically still live in the same place) or start talking to my parents or something (whom are unaware of a good deal of it).

Anyway, for me, I would like to forgive my friend. A large part of who I am is someone who forgives, for better or worse. I guess it just seems healthy. I forgave that Rapist a long time ago (they are still an ass, but I think they really aren't doing what they did to me to other people). Though, with my friend, I guess I feel somewhat more betrayed by them with this.  The blog post was only written for me, and I shared it with people I trusted with my life and emotional state. 

There is this voice in my head that says I shouldn't forgive them, and they honestly don't deserve my forgiveness. I don't want to be that person though.

So my parents separated when I was around 12 years old(14 years ago) because my mother caught him cheating when her and I were out in the car one day. Since then he's with his new partner and I'm very aware that he's still up to no good.

Anyway, a couple of days ago I received a message request on facebook where a woman asked ""is your dad still alive?"". Immediately I called him fearing the worst, but he answered and I joked that I'd have to wait for my inheritance a bit longer. I explained the situation and gave the name of the lady and he laughed a bit as I said her name. I asked ""you fucking this one too?"" and he laughed again, I clicked her profile and said ""man you'll fuck anything"" he replied that he hadn't fucked her. 
So I asked why he was laughing, to which he said something along the lines of ""look don't tell anybody,(I confirmed silence) she's probably your half sister"" he then asked me to say he was alive but works in the northern states and I don't speak to him much.

126,"My father is so smug. I can't deal with it. He has been all my life. He's the type of dad to push me to become e.g. engineer or doctor because it guarantees a good life (take a P.H.D just because he never could). During my upbringing, he's always told me that school is the most important and he always judges my other hobbies. Whenever I talk about how fun that or that was, he always sniggers and says things like ""What are you even gonna do with that useless skill? You should quit. Quit now!"" I can't help but wish he would be more supportive.

This kind of upbringing has led me to a very strict work ethic. I work a lot with school. He's never helped me because he doesn't understand anything we work with anyway (he has a foreign background). Every day he keeps pestering me with things like ""You should study more!"", and ""Why were you up so late yesterday"", when I am already studying to the point that it's causing me a considerable amount of stress (top that with not having enough time to socialize with friends, no support anywhere, really). The reason I'm up so late is because I study. My grades are good, but even I am prone to procrastination and all that. I wanna go to parties like everybody else, but that is in his eyes a total waste of time. 

I keep contemplating whether I am being entitled or not, because he always makes it out to be whenever I discuss this (I bring you food, shelter, if you're unhappy just move out etc. etc.). Recently, I've found out that the only reason why I work to become an engineer is really because my parents are pushing me. I don't have any interest what so ever, yet they keep talking about doctorates and stuff all the time. Whenever I get a good score on my tests, my dad always acts as if I should thank him. I don't want to do things for somebody else anymore. I wanna do what I want, but I am too scared to leave the life I've established.  Sometimes I really just fantasize about getting bad grades or disappearing just to see that smug face disappear. I can't work anymore, because whenever I am working I feel as if I am only doing it for him and it disgusts me to no end. The reason why I am procrastinating more and more is to forget all of this..

I would like to start off by saying i am fully aware people have worse life's than me and i am not looking for people's sympathy or pity.
To be honest i don't really know why i'm posting on here. Maybe it's just good to get some shit off your chest? no idea.
And my English is not great as missed a lot of schooling

So anyway i'm 19 and i have Asperger's. (Which is a form of autism for people who don't know) I was diagnosed at about 8 or 9 year's old and i moved to another school with an autistic unit to ""support"" me. (more on that later)
In my first school before moving i was getting along well with one of my female teacher's she really made an effort with me in helping me learn stuff and I've always been called a teacher's pet so it didn't really seem strange at the time. Without going into to much detail let's just say she maybe liked me a bit to much.

That happened like 3 month's before i left for my new school and i think moving school's is hard for any child with Asperger's or any child for that matter and that with her really did not help me.
I was rather disruptive in my second school i angered quite easily and some of the teacher's really shouldn't have been working in a supported education department. I would have missed a lot of primary school but i didn't really want to be in the house with my dad. My mum is wonderful but my dad was/is not a very nice man. He would get very mad after watching football and would punch me in the stomach if the result was particularly bad but only after my mum was in bed or at work or college.
As you can imagine a school were there is a small number of students in a completely different area than everyone else and all the other students were told we were different. we had bully problems and the teacher's didn't really care to much about that. I am not the type of person to see someone getting bullied and not do anything so i would stick up for the rest of the class as i was the oldest and most of them had high functioning autism and were not very well adapted to those situations and as a result of helping out with that i seemed to get most of the other student's attention so they would mainly bully me. My mum would come into school and go mad at them but she has an anxiety disorder so she can't drive and struggled to get there a lot. Anytime i told my dad he just said if they hit you hit them back and if i came home crying he would hit me so i learned to just bottle everything up.

After my dad left i was in primary 7 and getting ready to go to secondary school. My attendance at school dropped off after he left my teacher's thought i was just sad he left but in truth i wasn't scared to stay off anymore.
My granddad passed away at a time when i was actually starting to turn my life around and i wen't into a deep depression (For 5 year's) and as a result i didn't go into school for 3 weeks. when i did it was the last day of term and i stayed in a room crying the whole day. at one point a teacher came over to me it was lunch time and she said ""Stop crying go out and play"" i broke down and told her about what that female teacher had done to me after i finished telling her she said ""Stop making up lie's you horrible child"" i hated her so much even before that. She is the only person i have ever told about that.
I wen't in for the first few months in secondary they had an autistic unit also but it was mostly well run. apart from one teacher who i overheard calling a student a ""retard"" which put me off going and i was very on and off in secondary school.

I started using heroin when i was 17 for about 5 months it helped me get through a hard time but i stopped after a friend overdosed. Right now i am getting bad again and i am thinking of going back to it.

I have tried to kill myself once on my 18th birthday i went out and walked to a bridge. the reason i didn't was because i remember my gran would be up and i didn't want to let her down.
I think the only reason i have made it this far is because i started listening to Elliott Smith two year's ago and his music just help's me. It doesn't make me feel better it just....help's (Sorry i can't really put into word's why)
I have never actually told anyone any of this my family don't even know about my friend passing. I doubt they would believe me anyway.
It's funny i get told a lot i am a really funny person, i cheer everyone up and that i don't present myself as someone who has Asperger's.(That one pissed me off and i don't know why)
I have at least started playing guitar again and writing song's but i doubt i'll ever play them.
So yeah i tend to go up and down a lot one week i feel like ending my life then some day's i'm ""fine"". I have this strange idea in my head that it's either suicide or back to using again. Is it worth going back to using to in my opinion keep me alive?

^The Advice bit^
And i will end this with some Elliott Smith lyrics :)
""i got static in my head the reflected sound of everything""

""One hit wouldn't hurt a bit
Slow down sleep
What's there to fight?
If it's good shit you won't know
And I won't know the fact that I'm dying
If I seem to be reckless with myself
It's the fault of no one
All things have a place
Under the moon as well as the sun
One more little one
I love you""",01Apr2017,1
132,"Several girls over the past 6 months or so that I befriended at college etc. it seems at some point distance themselves from me (they quit texting) it seems like they think I'm into them /desperate etc. In reality I'm not desperate, Only 1 or 2 of these girls did I even think casually about that dating prospects of. I don;t do anything weird like stalk them on social media/like all their pics etc. I truly liked them as people and wanted to be their friend, they seemed interested in friendship. But they don't want to hang out anymore (some U guess its not convenient now that we don't have a class together to study for). I can't even get replies sometimes to ""Hey its been a while how've you been this semester"" its frustrating. I understand I'm not very confident and I' average looking at best and I'm very quiet/deliberate. That may make me seem weird/uncharismatic, but that doesn't make me a bad friend. I'm eager to make things work with friends (maybe too eager) but i do that with guy friends too. I'm eager to maintain friendships because there was a 3 or se period were I isolated myself and basically had none, but I've bounced back from that. Is there something I'm doing that is so wrong? Am I picking the wrong people to try to be friends with? Maybe i just needed to rant. sorry if this seems whiney.",01Apr2017,5
133,"I'm a pharmacy technician at Rite Aid. The store manager constantly schedules me for one or even two shifts as a CASHIER weekly. Same for the other, newest tech. Around last November, when she started asking me to work 3 of those shifts weekly,  it became a problem and I had meetings with my union rep. It got very tense for me. My sleep schedule was destroyed because the shifts jumped from 1st to practically 3rd, in addition to 11-7:30 shifts in my pharmacy. I never fully recovered, and the disruption in my already tentative sleep schedule have continued into a chronic disorder. I am going to need to start working 3 days a week for a few weeks, then go to and max at 4 days from then on.  
    I already have always had  Aspergers and depressive bipolar disorder, making an inconsistent schedule and switching job departments destructive on me. I told her multiple times how I was struggling before I resorted to emailing the union rep. And after that she started ignoring me, blaming me for not being loyal to co-workers, complaining and acting very annoyed whenever the topic was being discussed. And it has been almost five months! She hired one person with extremely limited hours and has interviewed one person a month ago that I know of. Why doesn't she interview people? It's clearly not an hour's problem. It's ridiculous. I'm feeling resentful at what I have been dragged through just to retain my health and ride the lack of dignity of basically becoming a clerk as part of my weekly schedule when I became a tech to get away from being a sales clerk at my last job. I don't understand why she has still not brought things back to normal when I only worked in the pharmacy at all.

137,"Not too long ago, maybe a week or two now I had a pretty bad breakup with my girlfriend (I'll refer to her as ""X""). Her friends became my friends, I spent most of my time at her house instead of home and we used to do the same things before we met so I continued that.  
  
We both like cars and where I live there are clubs and communities which are really active with people meeting and showing off their cars and cruising around in a group. I used to do this all alone but finding out things happening via Facebook and talking to friends. Just so happens I met X on one of these events.    
  
She has way more friends to help out spread the word so I knew about more than I ever did and we both had fun as we had these friends to hang with. Before meeting X I usually went there alone and blended which I still can do but the problem starts here.  
  
My car broke down so I've been spending all of my time on that. It's ready to run again but as she used to find out events, I've lost a bit of direction as to where to find them and if I do then she will be there which could be awkward since it was a messy break up plus the fact I have no one to go with so I'll feel alone even though I'm in a crowd.  
  
There is a solution that could be real easy to manage but I don't know if it's absolutely the best option. I found out that one of my past ex (I'll refer to her as ""Y"") is still there if I need someone. I found out because she was helping discuss the messy break up situation with my best friend. My friend sent me a screenshot of the conversation and Y was defending me to my surprise. Y used to go out of her way to find these events for me because she knew I was as happy as I could be and that made herself feel good so we had a pretty good time together. I'm not sure why we fell apart.  
  
As Y is still in the background if I need anything I keep thinking of contacting her and asking if she wants to come along as a friend, nothing more but I'm not sure if she could keep me as a friend or whether she'd develop feelings again but it would be less awkward because if anything bad were to happen between me and X, Y would happily take my side or diffuse the situation.  
  
I want to see if reddit could provide some assistance or alternatives as This would kill my social life and I would eventually break down as I'm already suffering depression from X and her problem with me.

142,"I'm a 17 year old female, soon to graduate from high school. I get good grades, I'm well received at school and I'm not a trouble maker. I'm not a bad kid. My grandma is a 60 year old alcoholic and her (our) house is always messy because she is a borderline hoarder. The house isn't as bad as it would be on the shows you see on TV, but you cannot see carpet or one clear tabletop. 

My family (grandparents, who I live with) is nowhere near wealthy but they do manage to purchase expensive things. They recently bought me an $11,000 car, a $450 prom dress, a $3,000 trip to Seattle for my eighteenth birthday and a $300 hotel room for my prom night. I never asked for any of this but I am very grateful. However, there is a part of me that wishes I didn't have any of it. My grandma loves to hold all these purchase above my head and use them as an excuse to verbally abuse me, scream at me, treat me with no respect. I come home from school everyday to her demanding I do things for her around the house without a simple please or thank you. 

Yesterday when I came home, the wifi was out. I spent two hours fixing it for her and my grandfather only for her to tell me that I'm a dumba-s that can't do anything right. She proceeded to yell at me for hours (while I sat there taking it, not saying anything) about how spoiled I am, how nobody wishes I was around and how much of a c-nt I am. She also called me an a-shole, b-tch, jacka-s and a snot. Those names are things she calls me on a regular basis despite the fact I NEVER call her anything. I told her to never all me that again because she has no right. She then screamed at me to get out of the room and she told me she would never apologize because it's ""only a word.""

146,"12 days ago my girlfriend of 9 months told me she felt we had become distant and she no longer had feelings for me. We parted on amicable terms, mainly down to the fact that I cannot say a bad word against her, she is a lovely woman. From this I went NC for the next 12 days, until today when I broke, asking her if I could pick up my medal and old corps tshirt as I served in the armed forces. She has agreed to meet me tomorrow, but has subsequently text me around 6 times today asking me about a couple of job offers I've had and stating 'I should follow my heart'.

147,"So some backstory. I met my boyfriend when I was 19. We were working the same job that summer. At the beginning he wasn't much of a talker, but he came around, and we grew much more comfortable with each other. Eventually, I began to realize I had some sexual feelings for him, and after a night drinking I made a move. He evidently felt similarly, and we had a night of rough drunken sex. We both agreed that this relationship was only for the summer, and after we would be done. He also had a fiance he was planning on marrying, so there wasn't really any room for me after the job was done.

So four years go by, and we eventually meet up again. I wasn't expecting much, so when at the moment he met me again he kissed me I was very surprised and excited. We went to a motel for some private time and made love. 

We talked about what we wanted to do, and decided that we shouldn't be out with this relationship. I also had a wife at this time at we both had kids, but for some reason I can't explain we just couldn't help but feel like we were made for each other. I felt guilty about cheating to be sure, but I feel like if he wanted to be out with me I would leave my wife and be with him.

The years go on and nothing changes. We meet up once in a while way out in the middle of no where once or twice a year to be together, but that's it. I feel like if I could just convince him that we could have a good life together he would let us have it, but he won't budge.

Last week I finally confronted him, telling him that in this 20 years we've been together we could have had a real good life together. But no, all we've got is the place where our job when we were 19 took place. That's all we got. Even then, he wouldn't do anything.
I'm not sure what to do, and it's just killing me. 

I had gone home after he denied me again and just kept crying. Couldn't help myself. And now there are these mechanics who I think are stalking me, so I've got that to worry about as well. It's just like this whole relationship has gone from shit to more shit, and I wish I knew how to quit it.

**tl;dr:** Met my secret boyfriend when we were 19 at a mutual job. We've been lovers for 20 years behind our family's backs. I feel guilty and want to be out with him, but he won't budge, and I'm not sure what to do anymore.",01Apr2017,1

150,"Throughout middle and high school I was severely bullied by a girl in my year. She was quite popular and managed to turn a lot of the student body against me with nasty rumors. I was looking forward to college as my fresh start to meet new people, but of course, she happened to attend the same college on the other side of the country as me. It's been three years since we've started college now and still, every single day I'm afraid to go out because I'm too scared of running into her. I've missed countless events due to this fear and haven't joined many clubs. Whenever I meet somebody new I get paranoid that they know her and I'll be dragged into a confrontation with her. So, I tend to stay away from meeting new people.

Just recently I went on a solo vacation out of the country and stayed in a hostel, where for the first time in years I felt free to be who I wanted to be - a social person who loves meeting new people. I knew there was far less chance of anybody knowing her so I made a lot of friends and good memories, and it really put into perspective how much this fear of my bully has held me back at college.

Does anybody have any advice on how I can get over my irrational fear? In a sense I know she can't hurt me anymore, but I can't help but get scared off by the thought of meeting somebody who knows her. It's happened before, and it's really quite an unpleasant shock to find out.

Thanks!

151,"I'll try to make this brief as I appreciate any advice I get.
I was in the Marine Corps and then went to school under the gi bill afterwards.  I've been out of school for about two years, after college I traveled across country alone and lived in pretty much solitude for about 3 months before my passion for music urged me to California.  I found someone there and we are living in Cali together now.  I am unhappy almost all of the time, mainly due to me feeling like I am not living up to my potential but every time I try to change my habits, I eventually go back to the old ways that make me feel miserable, i.e. not working out, not practicing my art , eating unhealthy foods, being jealous over nothing with my girl, smoking and drinking, etc.  

I went to the VA and the quack prescribed me gabapentin which quiets my mind but lately its not enough.  I want to leave my job again because I don't want to be like those other fat fucks at my job who are sad, and just waiting to die (I'm sure that's not how they see it but I sure do).  

I am a nihilist by nature but I have this compelling desire to become more than I am.  I have two competing dreams; to be a video game concept artist and a renowned musician but instead of practicing my craft, I find myself drinking booze, playing video games and watching Netflix.  

I want to quit my job again even though I like it and I am good at it because I just see it as a waste of time.  I have switched jobs 5 times in the past 2 years (good jobs).  This may be the last time I can do this before people will begin seeing me as a flight risk and I'll be washing dishes in the back of some restaurant while kids half my age order me around.

152,"So I've been in this long distance relationship with this girl. We're 3 hours apart. But then I had to move out of state and live with some relatives for a family emergency. So that made the 3 hour difference into a 6 hour difference) So it was hard to be able to spend time with her. I'd stay up late til 3-5 in the morning every chance I got just to talk to her. Once the family issue got taken care of (within around 2 months) I was able to come back home and finally be able to chat with her without losing my sleep. But the last few weeks before I came home, she'd start being distant, saying she was busy with this or that and felt that I was being too needy, asking about her day. That was the first red flag. But I tried not to pay attention. School was probably hectic and she was probably stressed was my first thought. So I surprised her with me telling her that I was coming home that weekend. She wasn't really phased, not happy, not excited. That was the second red flag. I was coming home with an uneasy feeling. And staying true to my gut, the day I come home. She posted on Facebook about how ""Conflicted"" she was and I asked her about it... No reply. She left me on send for a few days. So I decided to snoop and went on her discord, since she usually talks to a lot of her friends on there. And that's where I found a conversation of her telling her friend that she met this new guy (2 weeks before I came back home) And at first, I was pretty upset, devastated, that she was doing this behind my back. I took some time to recollect myself and immediately called her. She answered, and I asked her if she even liked me still. She said ""No, I don't sorry."" Hearing the words coming form her mouth, broke my heart. Because she was already talking to this guy, meanwhile she had the audacity to keep talking to me, as if she still cared. But TL;DR She found out that I only found out because I went onto her discord. And she was so upset with the fact that I caught her cheating by invading her privacy. She deleted me off of social and I haven't heard from her since. She meant so much to me. We both met through mutual friends and we helped build each other up throughout our relationship, even though it was long distance and we never met in person. She made me want to become successful and one day come visit her, or bring her here so we'd one day live together. But now that she got caught cheating and is now upset with me for invading her privacy. Should I even bother trying to patch things up. To get some answers as to why she did what she did.

We are pretty much the same person.

I thought she was inviting Ava to our sleepover, but nope. Gabby was making plans with Ava and I spent the weekend by myself. Another time Gabby invited all our friends to her senior graduation party, and I was the only one not invited. There's been other times. And there was a time we went on a class trip to New York and she only spoke to our other friend. Basically Gabby and I would talk during class or over text. She's made me feel like I'm important to her, and then she'd make up excuses not to hang out. 

After high school, Gabby moved to another country to go to school and we stopped talking. A few months ago we began talking again over text. It was just like old times. She said, ""I have new friends here but I don't get along with them like you."" Pretty soon we were back to finishing each other's sentences. I missed it. I made new friends, but I haven't clicked with anyone like I do with Gabby. I began to forget all the bad times. 

We were talking every day. At the end of 2016 I told my friend that I might be coming to the country she lives in, and I suggested we meet up. Gabby said, ""Sure that's great."" But whenever I tried to arrange something she changed the subject. I thought, ""I'm not going to another country, just to get blown off."" So I decided not to go. I can go some other time. 

 On Snap chat, I started seeing posts from Gabby with our friend Nicole (again not her name). Nicole had gone to visit Gabby, just like I was going to. I got jealous. I was jealous that I didn't get to travel, and that Gabby took the time to make plans with Nicole and not me. I feel crappy for being jealous. Gabby is allowed to have other friends, and it's more of my problem and not her problem. I don't think it would bother me as much if Gabby didn't make me feel like I'm her best friend when clearly there's always someone she likes better. Also, while Gabby was with Nicole, Gabby stopped responding to my messages. Now, to be fair to her, she's probably showing Nicole around on their vacation. It's somewhat understandable. But it did bring back memories from high school when Gabby would ignore me when someone else came along. And Its not like I'm high maintenance. Back in high school, I'd ask if she'd want to do something maybe once a month. I was always introverted, so I was never the type of person who wanted to meet up every day. 

Anyway, Gabby said she's coming to visit for the summer. She said we should meet up, but I know when she gets here, she isn't going to call me. She'll probably hangout with all our friends that she likes better than me. And I've learned my lesson. If she really wants to do something, while she's here, she better make plans cause I'm not.

I still like her, we get along great. But I don't trust her. I don't know if she's going to ditch me again. I also know I haven't seen her in awhile and this might be our only chance to do something. Some vengeful part of me wants to cancel plans on her last minute. ",01Apr2017,2

Now i am super conscious of asking people to hang out and I'm super careful not to bug anyone. Secondly, i will randomly get what feels like really depressed for short periods of time and i would normally consider myself a happy person, and usually I'm really happy with my life. These bouts of depression are triggered sometimes because i take things too personally, even when i consciously try not to. Other times it just happens. I get so sad i feel extremely tired, like i cant move and like no one will ever love me. This happens about once or twice a day for around 20-40 mins. I was wondering if it is some type of seasonal depression because this sort of thing always happens around easter and lasts until summer. I had really similar experiences last year but last year i would sort of dissociate and forget where i was all the time. I know this sounds extremely whiney i just don't want to talk to anyone in my life about it because i feel like it's not a legitimate problem compared to what other people have going on.

Is this some kind of depression or am i just whiney?

166,"I definitely understand why I was ignored and bullied though elementary school (except maybe first grade, kids weren't vicious yet). I had **very** severe anxiety , and it was debilitating through most of my years 4-13. My parents have told me it just started when I was 4. Out of nowhere. I don't understand why and I probably never will. But through my own efforts to expose myself to what scared me and get through them (my parents didn't want to get me help even when I was depressed, until later around 14.. but I got through it on my own by then). I try to sometimes remind myself that I'm stronger than ever before because I got myself through those horrible times, while being isolated the entire time. And I managed to come out if it mentally healthy. 

But, I am an outcast in high school. Everyone either ignores me or just stops talking to me, and the people I do talk to don't care about me at all. They talk about themselves nonstop, that's all they use me for. The exception is one person. He is my ex (and the only one I had) boyfriend , but we are close and it's the only person I know that cares about anything about me, and doesn't act disgusted that I'm not pretty. 

I get mocked a lot, disgusted looks, guys make jokes out of me , use me as an insult to their friends (""hahaha there's your girlfriend"" and other similar things  people use that to mock guys"").  Girls want nothing to do with me and always have an attitude , or are rude as hell. There's maybe.. 3 that are nice to me. That's it. 

I'm just so tired of this crap. Will I most likely endure the same stuff in college, and will I most likely not be cared about still and always be alone? If so I don't want to go with false expectations. I would appreciate any advice. ",01Apr2017,14

178,"Okay so today was my 18th birthday and I went out for a meal with some family. (Gran, Grandpa, Uncle and his female roommate who we'll call O).

So as far as we all know my uncle and O aren't an item and they're simply just roommates.

Now I noticed throughout the evening that in the corner of my eye, I could see her looking at me every now and then for at most about 5 seconds at times. (At least once a minute, even when I wasn't talking).

I shook it off and put it down to her just being observant but when it carried on I decided to return the eye contact, as I am fairly attracted to her myself.

When I met her eyes, we stared for 1-2 seconds until one of us looked down and this happened maybe 15 times throughout the evening. However there is one scenario which made me suspicious.

At an isolated moment in the meal she looked at me, I looked back and we held the stare for 1-2 seconds as normal. Then almost immediately afterwards she did it again and I looked back again and held it for 1-2 seconds and during that time she did also play with her hair, then she looked at me again for the third time but this time I didn't look because I didn't want to make it awkward.

So with all this in mind and the fact that afterwards she began putting on lip gloss in front of me, it did make me feel as if something was there.

We did also speak at numerous occasions during the meal about the fact I was moving house and what my dream job was along with other miscellaneous things, the eye contact was unbreakable at these points.

Nothing happened after the meal though but I feel as if it would have been different if it were just the two of us...

Just to note, this woman is in her late 30's I believe and she is generally friendly with everyone but I feel as if the eye contact and stares weren't just accidental, especially as it happened at least 15 times throughout the night and the two things that I mentioned above had happened. I will also say that I never initiated the whole staring thing, it was her that begun it.

What do we think, is it in my head or is there something there?

I got out of my night class and on my way to pick up my bro and our friend. So on the way back home, the police were behind me and as soon I made my left turn at a stop sign I got pulled over. I passing through a neighboring city since it is a shortcut to my city. 

As soon the officer came by my window, he says ""you guys are high and smell the marijuana."" I didn't smoke since I just came out of school to pick up the others. The others were high, but I wasn't worried about it and really thought my tail lights were out or something like that. I gave my License and registration. Got asked to step out of the car, searched, then searched the others. Soon after the police searched the vehicle and found &lt;50g in a backpack in the trunk, which wasn't mine, but I understand I was the driver. 

So I got arrested and the others were able to leave. It was my first offense as an adult. While being booked I'll ask why I got the stop and other officer told me it was for the obstruction of view. Even the officers barely got the others info and I had to call them for it. I got out within an hour. The officer told me that since it's my first offense as an adult, I will do probation and PTI for ~6-8months.

* Should I get an attorney? I don't really have much money for one.

190,"We all make mistakes in life… Sometimes they're small, and sometimes they're huge. Permanently huge. One of the biggest mistakes I think I’ve ever made is deciding to get my sleeve tattoo. Some days I love it, other days I hate it. Being a woman, my confidence about my body changes with my hormones depending on what time of month it is. If I’m PMSing, forget it, I feel like I’ve made the worst decision in the world. It sometimes drives me to the point of tears. When I’m ovulating on the other hand, I feel more accepting of my tattoos and the choice I made, those are the days I even feel comfortable flaunting it.  Its rather difficult to remain confident when I never know how I’m going to feel about it the next day.. I often feel like I’m on an emotional rollercoaster, going up and down between loving myself, and regretting my decision. 
My sleeve may seem intentionally ‘put together’ but really it came together bit by bit, when I first began, I had no idea how it was going to turn out. It sort of ‘manifested’ itself. But I go through my days staring at other women’s tattoo-less arms, dreaming, wishing I had my normal skin back. Tattoo removal would cost way too much, and I’ve already invested probably close to $2,000 or so on what I have. My problem was that I just couldn’t stop. Each step of the way I felt like I needed to ‘fix’ or ‘add on’ to parts of my sleeve, so that it would ‘feel better’. And deep in my heart I knew I just wished that I could turn around instead. When I first started to get tattoos, It didn’t really click with me the permanence of them. I observe older women, and I wonder what my tattoos are going to look like on me when I’m old and wrinkly… I know that I can only hope for the best and there isn’t much more that I can do.  
Whats a shame is that I already feel so much judgement from people. Instead of people looking into my eyes when talking to me, I see them dart back and forth between my eyes and my arms.. Its rather uncomfortable and distracting when that happens.  I realize that the judgement I feel from others may just be in my head, but that doesn’t make it any less of a real feeling that I experience. I’d like to figure out a way to move past that towards a place of acceptance for myself. One of the most difficult lessons I have to learn from all of this is how to truly be me. I need to learn how to love myself and all of my decisions whole heartedly.  I hear my negative self talk and I try my best to correct it. When I catch my negativity, I attempt to look at myself through a brighter light. It was a bold decision that I made, so I need to be bold and own it for the rest of my life. I want to get to that mindset of being carefree, of not paying mind to any judging eyes. I have faith that eventually I will feel that but I’m waiting for that revelation. There’s a difference between knowing how I should feel in this situation, and actually feeling it.  I’m waiting for that epiphany to hit me. 

By posting this to the public, I’m reaching out for honesty and support. Has anyone else ever felt this kind of ‘tattoo regret’ before? What is your opinion on my sleeve? I am fully aware that this is totally a first world problem, and there are other things that are more meaningful that I could be expending my energy towards. But I see this as a real problem that I face in my life, and in order to have the energy to expend outward on more important issues, I need to feel confident within myself first. I feel very vulnerable by posting this, but I feel as though it’s necessary. Thanks for including your words and perspective! 

[Here's a picture of my sleeve if you're curious.](https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17425975_451034485230825_587623614724896343_n.jpg?oh=19f7c154ac3c5cade73c0c8e2c0312a6&amp;oe=599B0950)",01Apr2017,7
191,"So this thread is gonna be about this girl to break it down I been messing around with this girl when I was young from 11-15 we never fucked back in they day but always messed around an what not but when I was 15 I moved down south an lost connection with her.

Now I'm 22 years old an 11/15/2016 and I call her up an we talk after years an she wants to come see me so we set it up she drove like 3-4 hours to come see me when I got off work. We where chatting it up having good time later in my bed watching movie it was chill i was just touchy with her feeling her out legs, body etc I wasn't trying to bang her or anything so it wasn't aggressive. After ten or so minutes i start laugh a bit cause i was getting strange vibes from her and seconds later she just start making out with me. 

Now before I get into what happened next I do need to note after I left town when I was 15 she only dated girls after me lesbian.. Supposedly never been with guy but that I doubt.. any who we make out I start going down on her kissing her etc she asks if i have a condom an at time i wasn't sexual active just working tun so i didn't have condom.. She kept saying no an then working me up again and I just stabbed her with it an she responded in good way 30 seconds in she says ''im lesbian what am i doing'' then Please pull out don't forget I dont wanna get pregnant so I'm like yea sure whatever then minute in it hurts take it out.. I take it out and it just got awkward after that for minute but she ended me off with Bj. Pirate

Next morning we go to cvs an pick up a pack of condoms so next time im more prepared I later went on to work, After that I thought about time i had with her an I wanted to make her my girl an knew how she felt about me still. She kept saying i just wanna be homies or whatever so I was like whatevs an kinda blew her off next time she wanted hang month or two down the line. 

I later that year moved back up to her home town an she came over we hung out smoked some bowls chilled an laughed it up. She is always flirty with me an way and I feel she trys to impress me a lot. Later we fool around an kiss one another at my new place and she gets me worked up again teasing me but doesn't let me execute.. so i was getting mixed signals later on I texted her more she just kept making excuses I guess she got out relationship recently an maybe I was too pushy.. so we pretty much stopped talking.

now yesterday she came over to my house to hang out with my sister an didn't say a solid word to me in my house where my sister lives as well. It was totally weird I felt as though she should of greeted me out of respect so I got prideful an didn't say anything to her whole time she was her. Weird right ? I don't know what to make of this girl, I guess she told my sister about whole night we had back at my place when it got weird so my sister is gonna dig more because girl told my sister she will tell her more later..

Bottom of the line I wanna date this girl, I hit her up like 3 weeks ago before she even came to see my sister like hey whats up ''homie'' an she left me on read. Then I responded damn its like that an she left me on read again I don't get this girls problem.. any advice op ? Sorry for shit grammar kinda urgently writing this out. I have known this girl since I was 12 I would love to make her my girl she an I have a lot of sexual tension or something.

204,"Hello all, 

I've have things that I need an outsider's perspective for. I feel like my paranoia is increasing, but I'm not sure

My computer desk is perpendicular to a window. Even with the curtains drown, I always feel like I'm being watched. When Im in public, I feel like I'm being followed by someone or something and being watched.

I live in a very safe neighborhood, so home invasions and violent crimes are very rare, if non existent. Even so, whenever I'm home alone, I keep my AR-15 by my side with a loaded magazine(with an empty chamber). Even when I go to sleep. I keep it on the side of the bed ready to go. 

I don't trust anyone. My brain automatically interprets every action some one does as a hostile or demeaning. I think that everyone I meet secretly dislikes  me and there smiles are fake. I also think that whenever they say that they want to hangout, they are baiting me because they want to embarrass me. No matter how much someone says they like me, or they say how much they had fun and they want to hang out again, I think that they either secretly dislike me. Even if they dont hate me, Ill think that people befriend me and are nice to me because they feel bad for me. I dont think that anyone is sincere. 


Im also borderline obsessive about little details about people's stories. I have a habit of analyzing people's stories and picking it apart. When some's story's has the slightest discrepancy, I immediately think that they are playing for a fool. Even when they talk about other things, I'm very weary of them.

I want to stop being paranoid of everyone and everything, I can can't seem to get out of the cycle of pervasive mistrust. Has anyone else had this problem and overcome it?

205,"Hi, so, I was hoping that maybe someone out there can relate to the things that I'm dealing with, and maybe has advice or any ideas as to what might me wrong with me. 
So, I don't even know where to begin. I feel like at this point I've racked my brain for every possible thing that could be making me feel sad, and I have found some things...but I don't know. I don't even know if there is a problem anymore, or if the only thing that was wrong with me was that I thought there was something wrong with me and I was constantly stuck in my head trying to figure out what it was. Maybe I've always been a little bit sad and lonely for years and years, and I've just made it a thing by trying to anxiously fix it...whatever ""it"" is. I have no idea. The thing is, nobody seems to have any fucking idea what I'm talking about. Well, I've found internet articles here and there that I think have helped me out, but there's never been a real sense of clarity. I tried bringing my self esteem up by telling myself ""I am enough"", over and over, I've tried a lot of things that at this point I can't even remember. I have an entire journal filled up with thoughts and ideas as to what my problems may be...I think a large part of it was that I haven't been accessing my rational brain, and so my thoughts and ideas have been off the wall trying to hopelessly guess at what might make me feel the way I want, and I think I  barely know what that is. I think I have a clearer sense of what it is now, just peace, happiness, to understand myself, have some clarity, know what I want. And my imagination was/has been running rampant, I just seemed to let it get away from me so easily. Like, I'm not sure, but I think I convinced myself that I had a lot of feelings for a guy that I didn't even to begin with and then let myself fall into a belief that he was the best friend I've ever had and we shared some of life's favorite moments and he, and the few weeks in the summer we shared, became the center of everything. I think recently I, after much brain ache and reading and shit, have forced myself to come back in touch with how I REALLY feel, and not what the fake me feels. Like not the person I've been trying to be and put my entire consciousness into. I don't know man someone help me out sometimes I've felt like I'm going insane I can be excited that things seem to be getting better and then crying and feeling like dying wouldn't be so bad. I had an existential crisis, as well, I don't know everything all of a sudden seemed pointless and the only pleasure I took in that was that I just got to cry and cry which felt good but like also really painful, you know. We got a cat, and I didn't care at all. I pretended super hard to care, and I really badly wanted to be excited but I just wanted to cry. I CAN'T TELL WHAT IS TRUE ANd what isn't, my thoughts are all in a tangle and a lot of them probably aren't even important. For example: (I should write to J being totally honest and transparent about how I feel about him and how it relates to what I've been going through so that we can start with a real friendship with emotional honesty and me being myself, oh god have I not been myself, (lets go examine past memories to see if I've been myself) maybe I haven't, but how do I really feel about him, I can't tell he lives 430 miles away) And honestly it's gotten way more confusing and obscure than that in my head, and I think it gotten a little better now that I'm being more rational (Am I, though? What if I'm still doing everything wrong?)Maybe I'm overanalyzing everything and looking to closely at all of the little details, I just don't feel like meself. I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING IM FEELING ABOUT WHETHER ITS GOOD OR BAD OR A SIGN THAT SOMETHINGS WRONG. I literally have daydreams about someone seeing me crying about all this or noticing me and saying to someone or thinking something is really wrong with me and trying to help me or of someone telling em finally what is wrong with me and voila clarity. I feel like people might respond to this with letting me know that I'm depressed, and I do think maybe I had some of that but there has to be more than that and someone else has to know the insanity of what my life has been. Constantly trying to decipher what is wrong with you, and doing it all in your head and not in your heart is madness. And I think things are getting better, but, I don't know, I also will likely just start crying out of frustration or loneliness or who fucking knows what tonight so if someone wants to be motherly or friendly and just make me feel less insane that'd be lovely. I'm 16 by the way. Toodleoo. (kill me) ;)",01Apr2017,1
