1,"I get really self conscious when I have the same backpack or clothes on as someone else, I don't know why. School is starting up for me soon, and I need to choose a backpack that hopefully no one else has. If I have the same bag as someone, I freak out because I don't want to make unnecessary social interactions. I know this seems stupid, but it really is a major issue for me. So, any ideas of how and where I can get a somewhat cool backpack that no one else will have for school? By the way, I'm in high school.",25Aug2017,1
2,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I'm in a tough situation and I feel like a lot of you are gonna give me shit for even thinking this is a tough situation. Anyway my friend told me him and another friend (I have no idea who this is, he goes to his school I think) are thinking about killing themselves tonight. I'm trying my best to talk him out of it, but he said him and his friend agreed they're just both tired and wanna end their lives. I know his sister and I have her Snapchat, and I told him I'll get her involved if I need to so she can stop him from doing anything stupid since I'm not with him. He told me he'd never talk to me again and he'd hate me if I told his sister, but I honestly don't care. He could hate me all he wants, but if me telling his sister maybe saves his life then that's fine with me. He said he's calmed down and he'll think about not doing it and telling his friend, but I don't trust him at all and I feel like he's just saying that so me and his sister don't bother him. He's pretty mad at me I think since he's ignoring my messages and I keep checking the Snapchat map and I see he's online so he's very much alive still. And he most likely won't do anything until after about 10 or so since he said they're gonna do it after listening to XXXTENTACION's new album, which I already told him I'm worried about him listening to since his music is really triggering and he ""commited suicide"" earlier this week on Instagram. Anyway, I wanna give him time (as dumb as it sounds I know) but I just wanna let him take some time and breathe before anything else. He has family problems, which I'm sure is one of the things leading to this, and he doesn't get along with them so I don't wanna start any drama if he's not gonna even do anything anymore. I don't know what I should do. I feel so selfish not texting her right now and wasting my time on here. Please somebody help.

Update: I told his sister and now he hates me and blocked me on everything. I really hope he still doesn't go through with it, but I did everything I could :/",25Aug2017,1

5,"I have a close friend, he would call me his best friend, who tends to be really introverted. As I'm extroverted I've had to learn to give him a lot of space, but to me it seems its never enough space. We live together with two other people in a large house and he spends a lot of time in his room. Anytime I ask general questions (""So what's been up with you lately?"") Or ask if he had fun when he comes home after hanging with friends, he snaps at me and tells me to stop coddling him. I made an effort to only ask around once a month since he felt I was smothering him and he still snaps and says I'm smothering him. I've stopped asking about his friends at all. He gets mad at me for asking how his day was at work too. He's had a pretty difficult time of it (which is why he's living with me and my boyfriend till he gets back on his feet) and it gets him down sometimes but when I ask if he's alright or if he needs anything during those downtimes he snaps and says, surprise surprise, I'm being smothering. We talk a lot about society and politics and video games and the like but if I try to talk about anything he's up to he gets irritated at me.

10,"I'm pretty worried about having a mental disorder right now. I listen to the same song over and over, but not for just a week. I've listened to a song for a year now and I've played it around 900 times or more (that's my estimate) and I really am anxious about all this. 

I'm scared of being autistic or having ADHD, because pretty much nobody that's sane does this. I used to listen to songs many times before but only for like 3 days, like everyone else. But I felt really good when I heard this particular song the first time and I just can't move past it. I like reliving that feeling and it doesn't quite fade away. I was going through some rough times when I listened to it and it made me feel that there was some hope. This is why I'm so attached to it. It brings nostalgia and happiness to me when I hear the song. 


I've analyzed my behaviour and thinking patterns constantly to try to figure out if this is really pathological. But, I really don't think I am crazy... I don't listen to it over and over because I'm obsessed with routine and mind states (autism) nor do I think I've got problems with lack of concentration and dopamine (ADHD). I usually focus on things and am more hard working than most people. I'm shy but I've made many friends in my life and don't have that many problems socializing. I know how to make friends and when to smile or laugh, just like everyone else.  I've had problems with OCD and worrying over mental sickness before, but this time it seems to be more serious. The other times it was just speculation, but now I've seen with my very eyes that I have played a song many times... too many, in fact.

It hasn't helped me either that I've asked this before on the autism subreddit and have been told that I may have autism because you can't be objective about yourself or some shit like that. My anxiety just spiked when that happened. Oh, and I also wanted to say that I can stop listening to this song; it's not something that I don't have control over. It's just that I get carried away by wanting to feel the happiness that I felt the first time I listened to the song again.

So I need advice from you guys. Does any redditor here know a bit about psychology and can help me figure this out? Will I ever stop listening to the song?

11,"While walking my dog through my neighborhood, I came across a paved road that leads behind my house. I took my dog down there just to check out the area, and I was standing at the end of the street looking around when a man comes out of one of the houses and tells me that it is a private road. I ask how it's private if the road is paved and they get their trash taken from the road, and he said that they (the owners of the houses on that road) had to pay to have it paved, therefore it was private. Is this true? If the road were private, wouldn't it not appear on the city map? Does paying to have a road paved make it private?

20,"Hi everyone,

I'm facing a difficult situation here. 

1 year ago I got this job and at first it was kinda bad because it wasn't my major at school and I was still studying and working at the same time. I got mentally abused by a senior colleague and I went through some depression. My boss had to pull me out of the company and just kept me as his P.A. 

So I started to think about my future after finishing school. My degree sucks and is too generic. I can't be a PA forever and I also cannot be involved and trained to level up as the bitch was still there. So I decided to study abroad and then I got a French bf. So France it is. 

France is nice. I can learn a 3rd language beside my mother tongue n english. I love French cuisine. And I love my bf. France is very supportive and welcoming towards international students. So that's great. I also love studying. I did great in school too. 

Half year of my preparation went by. One day boss decided to let everyone go and just keep the core team which includes me, him and business manager. We work in film production. And boy oh boy the job is amazing, so inspiring and some moments can really take ur breath away. Thanks to it, I grew up so much. Im no longer the person Im used to be. Im more opened, sympathetic, proactive. 

I have been involved more than ever in the business now. I feel like they are my second family. They protect me and take care of me. And there are some projects that I have been involved for a year or more and the film is adapted from a book that I deeply adore. Im getting a double raise within 1 year. I have a career path so clear and so attractive. I can do it. And Im good at this job too. 

A project I was in as a film producer got acknowledged by the UN - Global Common Ground, raising awareness about Alzheimer's. I'm so proud and so so many memories with other projects. 

But reality hit..... Im getting my visa result tmr... if it's a yes... I'm not sure what Im going to do. Leave everything behind and further my study and get a more stable job ,(Cause film production is not that stable and it's also energy and time consuming), explore the world, be with my bf (I really think he is amazing and I cant find a better man). 

I may get a better job, I plan to maybe go to Canada or Singapore to promote my career. But if I can't compete, ... isn't it better to stick with my job now as the pay is good once u r senior and moreover when u can have ur own production company? 

I'm settling down in Vietnam. About to move out, pay income tax for the first time, be independent. But at the same time, I can have better living standard, travel the world, be with my bf. 

Basically to leave everything behind and start all over again is a tough decision. Anyone with similiar experience?

38,"Background:

Back around 5 months or so, I had an MRI and an EEG to check for a pituitary gland brain tumor, since my prolactin levels were higher than normal. Everything turned out okay.

Neurologist set up another appointment on late October. Everything was okay for a couple of months. 

Then, I've become really tired. Sleeping all day, no appetite, losing weight. Vomiting, nausea, it's hard to keep food down. Sometimes even liquid, and it's hard to 'force' myself to eat, I feel that I just throw up most of it. I've lost 2 week worth of memory---one moment, I was unpacking and putting my clothes and stuff away; the next, I woke up to find most of my shoes gone, my room not how I remember it, and two weeks had gone by. I *try to remember what happened, but it's just....blank. Nothing. Nada.  Been having bad headaches, as well. 

Went to doctor like a week-ish ago, got the blood test results, and my prolactin levels are even higher. Been having weightloss, too, despite not exercising---I've been too tired for that. Too tired for anything. It's frusterating me. 

Doctor is worried, and said to call my neuro and to get an earlier appointment---and if I can't get a hold of her or her schedule doesn't allow for it, to go to this University hospital that is known for it's tumor research---very good. She said it's *urgent. 

This has me worried, and scared. I also have a mysterious lump in the back left of my head, which I think she also wants checked out. With the way I've been feeling, and the sudden weightloss, memory loss (and I've also been having trouble with spelling, etc--though maybe it's because I haven't been reading nor writing much? I've been thinking about what if it does turn out to be a tumor?

one of my uncles has been diagnosed with a tumor, and he hasn't told anybody. He didn't want people to worry; his wife told people, but he doesn't know about that. There's already enough people that are *knock on wood* going to pass away soon, most from cancer--three have already passed. One 24 years old. One from heart attack. One from lung cancer. Another from smoking.

I like to think of things in advance, and I'm sure I'll get the results soon enough. But what if it turns out that I do have one (maybe more)? Should I tell my family? Friends? acquaintences/pen-pals/gaming/etc.? If they are already going thru so much, should I add one more problem atop of that? What if they themselves are already going thru similar health problems? Or are going thru other stresses, too. What should I do?  

I was thinking, if it turns out that I have to have chemo or something, I could just pretend that I have to do it for a school project. Maybe say that the chemo-smell is from being in the hospital. Are there even other options for a tumor? 

I know I haven't gotten results yet, will in a less than couple weeks, but...I'd like to think of what to do in each situation-

39,"**TL;DR** My mother is much more strict than the vast majority of parents when it comes to my twelve-year-old brother's bedtime, the content he's allowed to consume, etc. The other kids at school are making fun of him for it and I want to mention to her that perhaps what she's doing is kind of mean. Despite having exceptional behaviour and good grades in school, she's strict on him to the point that he's getting bullied, and I don't think it's right.

**The whole story**

For reference, the age gap between my brother and I are huge. I'm now out living on my own. My younger brother, however, is in grade 8 (in a couple of weeks, at least).

Growing up, I moved around all the time and went to lots of different schools. In every single one of them, there was always a group of kids who had extremely strict parents. Despite being early teens, they'd still be watching kids shows, they'd go to bed before everyone else was even supposed to be home, they weren't allowed to play shooting video games, etc. And in each school I went to, these groups of boys were always bullied. Of course, popularity in high school means very little in the grand scheme of things, but being bullied hurts and should be prevented when possible, in my opinion.

Up until I had moved in with my father, I was one of these kids. I always felt embarrassed and felt a disconnect from the other kids. I never got the references, I could never have new friends over without telling them that they couldn't watch certain shows and I other kids wouldn't want to come for sleepovers at my place because my mom wouldn't let us watch the movies/shows they wanted to watch or stay up as late as they wanted to stay up.

My family came to visit me this summer, and it's painfully clear to me that my brother is now one of said children who is being set up to be bullied in school. Of course, I don't want to see anyone in my family getting bullied.

Most kids his age are playing grand theft auto, watching south park and staying up as late as they want. My eight-grade brother, on the other hand, spends his days watching shows meant for children with a bunch of teddy bears lined up on the couch with him. My mother is easily in the top 5% of strict parents and was also this way when I had lived with her.

He has also mentioned to me several times that he gets made fun of for the rules he is meant to adhere by. He had some friends over for a sleepover awhile back and they were all sent to bed much earlier than any of them had expected. They made fun of him and he's now too embarrassed to have friends over for sleepovers. My mother has also admitted to me that all of the kids pick on him at school because he's not allowed to play any of the video games or watch any of the shows that everyone else is allowed to.

I know that rules need to be set and that today's standard of letting kids watch/play literally anything they want to and having no bedtime in place isn't exactly healthy. But, to me, this seems overboard. I think having your twelve year old watching childrens shows and playing with teddy bears seems extreme, especially when it's at the cost of getting picked on. I know letting your kid stay up until midnight every now and then when having a sleepover isn't exactly good for him, but is it anymore damaging than getting bullied throughout school? I certainly don't think so.

Is my mother in the wrong? Or am I overreacting? Would it be wrong of me to perhaps mention to her that she's going a little overboard?",25Aug2017,29

I'm worried that once my ""friends"" from this class find out I've moved up, they'll start to see me as an enemy and start getting hyper-competitive. Are there any good ways to defuse situations like that or avoid them entirely? I'm fine with trying not to mention it but I don't want to lie. ",25Aug2017,1
44,"My best friend and I have both known this guy Derek for a long time. She dated him briefly in middle school (we are in high school) but it ended quickly and they stayed friends. I ended up dating him last month and it got semi-serious. Some sexual stuff happened. 

We broke up because he couldn't handle a relationship. A week later he called my best friend (who he still talks to) and started complaining about me and saying how he hated my body and didn't like me like that. 

My best friend decided to keep talking to him. She talks to him all the time in front of me and it really bothers me. Am I wrong to want her not to be friends with him?",25Aug2017,1
45,"Hi.  This is the first time I've done anything like this, so sorry if formatting is off.

First off, just so you guys know, I'm blind.  Totally.  I use Voiceover on everything.

I've been looking for jobs for a while now, (I'm 26), but I haven't had any luck.  Unfortunately, people are fleeing the other way when I tell them that  I'm blind, because I'm being told it ""would cause undo hardship"" for them to get the necessary tools so that I would be able to do my job.

My question is this.  My ""dream job"", is to work for Apple.  Weather that'd be a Specialist, Genius, Tech support, ETC.  I've never worked on Macs internally before, but I'm willing, and very happy to learn.  Also, I am a very quick learner.  I submitted my resume about a year ago, but heard nothing back.

Would anyone have advice, or is anyone here a hireling manager, and can give me advice?  I do have a resume, if anyone wants to see it.  But it has all my personal info, so I'm a bit iffy.

Thanks for any advice you may have, I really would appreciate it!!  :-)

I forgot to add that I have almost 9 years of experience with Mac OSX, iPhone, iPod, MacBook Pro, and iMac.  Apple TV, and iPad as well.

She has a condition where in my terms won't be smarter than a 5th grader and will have to live with my parents for the rest of her life. She embarrasses me when she randomly starts dancing in the middle of my volleyball game when music starts playing. She has outbursts over tiny little things. We have to base mostly everything around her and what she wants. We can't go on a vacation because every time she has an outburst and ruins the whole thing. She also has a weird obsession to one of my teachers where she wrote her a card. She's 16 and she wrote my teacher a card with like I love so you see where I'd feel a little weird. She wanted to email her and has a picture of her hanging in her room. She's thrown stuff at me and never talks to me. She talks to my parents and some of my parents/my friends but won't respond to me. I ask her basic questions and she glares at me. I was locked out and was ringing the doorbell but she wouldn't open the door for me so I was outside for hours. She doesn't have a physical disability. We have good moments but mostly we coexist.

51,"So I work for a great small company working in accounting. started doing administrative work and am now a jr level accountant, learn fast and am good at what I do. When I got promoted from my administrative position our controller hired her daughter to fill my old position. and there's been a strong push to promote her within the company to essentially my position. While there was a promise that I would be promoted, nothing has happened so far. So they have me training her, but she doesn't understand any accounting concepts, and i have become basically glorified babysitter to clean up her messes and continue to advance her career. Today I found out she only makes 2k less than me, when I was making 4 grand less than that when I was in her position. I feel like this is a result of nepotism, my supervisor between the controller and myself has acknowledged that the controllers daughter is incompetent and doesn't understand accounting.

65,"So long story short, a friend of mine decided that we shouldn't talk while they study abroad for a year. I respect their wishes because I know that we care and love each other, and this separation is ultimately for the best. 

So it's been a year of me just hating myself for hurting this person. Since the beginning of the friendship/relationship, I never wanted to hurt them. Prior to this break we were really good friends, could tell each other everything and anything. Eventually I persisted and we became more than friends. It was great. Then I let my selfish desires get in the way of what really built the foundation of the friendship/relationship. The communication we had. 

So they were the braver one/ smarter one and realized that we needed a break to figure ourselves out. I totally respected this decision because they've always been the smarter one in realizing that some of the things we did, were really bad for our friendship/relationship. 

So I know they're back , and I want to talk to them again, but I just don't know how. I think I'm just really overthinking this because, that's what my brain does. I don't want to bother them, but it's just been eating me up inside. I care for them and love them. I rather be the one that's unhappy if I'm being honest but there's the idea of self-preservation. Me loathing isn't good for me. 

I want to talk and catch up but I can't seem to get past the idea that, what if they don't want anything to do with me? I don't think I can handle that rejection. It's already happened to me once before and that completely destroyed me.

This is a really long post I didn't mean to do that sorry.

(Please note this is unedited and written on a crappy phone sorry) 

Okay pretty much me and my mum don't get a long. At all.
We used to be very close, she was my favourite person at one point, but now I can't even admit that I love her.
We started drifting a part when I was 8 and she started ignoring me in favour of talking to her Facebook boyfriends. (Note she was married at this time) Soon she started getting aggressive towards me anytime I seeked her attention, I felt so neglected and I guess that's part of why I resent her now. 

When her and dad went through their breakup we actually grew closer, however over the years she became narcissistic, agressive, and guilted me for doing anything. I don't want to completely antagonise her, I know this wasn't all her fault. I was going through shit and developed a hatred towards her, there was point where we would argue furiously over minuscule things.

I'm 17 and I live between my parents, I dread the weeks I have to stay with my mum. We don't argue much anymore bc I've matured and realised when to pick my fights. But I still have an uncontrollable hatred towards her, every time she's near me I get furious and I can't help it. Being near her puts me in such a negative headspace and I go through depressive episodes at her house, it's rlly not good for my mental health lol. I can't tell her I only want to live with my dad, I've tried and she had a huge breakdown threatening to kill herself.

I know she's done bad things (much more than what I've written), but I really want to be a compassionate person and forgive her. I just want to have a mother in my life. Sometimes she whispers ""I remember when you loved me."" And know it's horrible and lowkey emotionally abusive to say that, but I miss that time too. 

I think she's getting better in terms of handling her emotions and how she's treating me, I really do think she's realised her wrongs and seeking forgiveness. I'm want to at least fix our relationship so I can say I love her. Sometimes we have small moments that were like old times and I just want more moments like that. 

I need advice in how to forgive and get over my own inner hatred towards her. I just want a mother in my life.

84,"*So the whole story is very long and way too complicated so I'll try to make this as short as possible (sorry if some parts don't make any sense):*

Around the end of January, I started dating my boyfriend but he has a very flirty personality and confrontations led to arguments and after 5 months he broke up with me.
My best friend comforted me and she was there every step of the way for me to be happy again without my boyfriend. I was upset and I really relied on her. I trusted her with my life and she was the closest friend I had ever had. This went on for about half a month and me and my best friend got closer and formed a stronger bond thanks to my boyfriend breaking up with me. However my best friend was still very close with my ex and although I didn't want her to talk to him, I didn't say anything and just supported her choice. I never brought up anything about it nor did I talk bad about her to our other friends.
However halfway through this month, my ex started talking to me again. We were very close before we began to date and so I responded to him and genuinely enjoyed talking to him. We decided to forget what happened (we thought we were already over each other) and to stay close friends like we were before. Then we had a fun day together and ended up talking all night, catching up on the month we didn't talk. Soon after I realized how much I was still in love with him and he too confessed that he still loved me and how much he regrets breaking up with me. He apologized over and over and I could tell he really meant it. But i half turned down his proposal to date again and told him I needed time to think since it was a lot, even though I love him. He understood and is giving me the time I need and we talk as friends.
I didn't tell my best friend any of this because she was getting really close to my ex and I didn't want to hurt her feelings. (Me and my ex both agreed it was for the better) She had told one of my other friends a while back that she had a crush on my ex. However me and my ex went from not talking at all to being very close so my best friend immediately got suspicious. She confronted my boyfriend and told him that he needs to choose between me or her. She told him that if he chose me she would never talk to him again. Despite this, my ex chose me saying that he would give up anything to never let me slip from his hands again.
Now this led to me having to choose between my best friend or my ex. It was hard for me and I was struggling to make a choice. In the end I was going to choose her when I found out that she had been talking bad about me behind my back for months saying things like, ""She stole everyone from me and everything she does annoys me so much."" ""It makes me not want to even be her friend and i hate listening to her talk"" ""She's one of the most annoying people in the world"" and more.
I was hurt and confused and very betrayed. I didn't want to become a burden to her or continue to be her friend if she thought of me like that. I haven't confronted her yet because I would risk my friendship and trust with the people that told me about the back talking.
Right now I'm so hurt because I would never have even thought of her talking behind my back. Now I feel conscious that some of the people I thought were my actual true friends talk bad about me. I don't know what to do... I feel like she shouldn't be making my ex choose between her and me and that she is jealous of my close relationship with my ex. As much as I would like to choose my ex over her, I don't want to lose my best friend either.

87,"A little context, I started a job not long ago that's pretty much the best job I've ever had.  I went from warehouse work with a high school diploma to an air conditioned cubicle in an office building.  When I was in training, I was told along with my coworkers that any talk about wages would result in disciplinary action.  The company seemed pretty progressive when I came in and the ratio of women/men was around 6/2.  I came in here with zero experience in the field and no education past high school as I could never afford it, but over the past few weeks I recently started talking about wages with people I knew I could trust and it turns out I'm making a few dollars an hour more than any woman that I work with for the same tasks.  I know I need to do something, but this is also the best opportunity that I've ever had and I know that I've done enough to piss off the company if they find out.  I know it's illegal to tell employees not to talk about their wages, but just because it's illegal doesn't mean they won't try to get away with it.

This post isn't to discuss whether or not a wage gap exists, I know for a fact discrimination is happening at my workplace and even if I don't have enough of a sample size (I only spoke to about 10 people) to prove it, I know at the very least that they broke the law by threatening retaliation for anybody talking about wages, which is indefensible.  What can I do to keep myself safe from retaliation but also to make sure that the company is at least punished for what they're doing?

I would also need money to go back to school. What I want to do is start my own business, but I need the experience to help me along.

I also don't have enough money to make all my payments this month. Hopefully we I talk to my bank tomorrow, they can cover me. But, I will not know for sure. My mistake was not planning enough. I spent too much money on going down to see the eclipse. I should have skipped it and not forced myself to go do that. 

I am at a crossroads. Do I stick with my job for one more month while I continue to search for anything here in the big city? 

Do I find a different/cheaper place to live? My coworker owns a house. Do I ask if I can rent a room from her and lose my place that I like? Some former roommates might be looking for someone in six months. I'd be okay with moving in with them, I think.

Do I quit my job and move back in with my parents? I lose my income stream and independence, but I pay less rent. I would be a failure by going home and I will hate myself forever if I do. 

Has anyone been in a situation like I am? How did you figure out what you wanted to do? 

I know I am not being specific enough. If you need more information, please ask.

90,"Hey all, 
This year i've been living overseas having just graduated from university. There were some rough times but after 6 months i began to feel pretty well adjusted to this new culture. Up until the last few weeks were I have felt in a sort of ""funk"", feeling i don't have  people that care about me in my new environment, despite having a massively supportive family back home it cant replace having people to talk to on a regular basis about whatever i'm going through in this foreign land. That's not to say i don't have any friends I have made many friends that i love spending time with, however i feel in my relationships i'm constantly giving trying to put effort in building friendships. It feels like I am always  initiating any activities with my friends, making them a priority working my schedule around them while I always feel like an option for them a 'spare tire' if you will. Asking anyway to make my friendships less one sided or a different way to look at things. 
Thanks in advance!",25Aug2017,0

97,"I'm 25 and have a ""good"" job as a software engineer that I'm unfairly ungrateful about. I've never been happy, but previously I always had something to look forward to that I thought would bridge that gap.

In high school, I thought a good relationship would fix me. In college, I thought that a real career would be a lot more pleasant than coursework. In my first job, I thought maybe it was just my particular role in my particular city (Dallas) making me unhappy. I got a job in Seattle, where I'd wanted to live for years.

It's probably obvious, but all my ""improvements"" were bunk.

I was really passionate about music for several years. Had a few bands and worked on it like nothing before or since, but I got burnt out and the reality of how hopeless it was caught up with me. I was hoping it was a way out.

I'm more or less as I've always been, but this time I don't really have a hope to cling to. For the first time, I find it hard to do anything outside of work. I fear I may feel this way for the rest of my life.

All of my ideas about improvement would be marginal. Moving back to Dallas (family, suburbs, sunlight), getting a job at a smaller, less soulless, company, doing music for the fun of it again. These things would help, but I've had them before and I was still going crazy.

What exactly do you do when you don't like your life, but there's nothing life changing on the horizon?

I've thought about quitting and living with my dad for a year while I develop a software as a service business. I've thought about getting rid of everything and pulling an ""Into the Wild"", hitchhiking and exploring, with or without the dying part. I am in Office Space and life does not seem worth it as-is.

I also think those extremes are probably unneccesary. Plenty of people are happier than I am with far less. Is there some other way I can approach this?

While I do appreciate ""think positive"" messages, please keep in mind I've been hearing that my entire life, and have tried most antidepressants in existence with little effect. Something more actionable would be better.",25Aug2017,3
99,"I would like advice about when to let things slide and when to not. I don't know when I should say what I think and when to keep quiet. I don't know how I can deal with my problems internally instead of vocalize my feelings all the time.


As I am now, I hate 'beating around the bush' with serious matters and I have an inability to lie about my true feelings/opinions. Because of this, I am a very blunt person, however I consider myself to be very agreeable since I respect others' opinions/feelings a lot too.



I am writing this because I feel at a complete loss. 


I lived the first half of my life being horribly bullied, but my single mother always told me to just remember ""sticks and stones"" and to not fight back- basically to just let it slide and hope for the best. Eventually, when I was nearing the end of elementary school, I put my foot down and started defending myself. I finished my pre-secondary education with little to no friends, but the small group that was my friends were outsiders like me who were all very motivated and did well in school... 


My little brother was born just before my father passed away. Due to the death of 6 or so close family members (spanning the first 13 years of my brother's life), my mother had a hard time with us. I realized at a very young age that I had to be easy to deal with for her sake, so I tried my best to never argue and stay quiet. However, my brother would get away with tons of things that he never would've had my father still been alive. He was terrible to my mother and never listened. I couldn't stand his attitude towards her and always felt the need to parent him myself. 


FFW. My brother was bullied a lot in school, but unlike me, he cracked under the pressure and got involved with really scummy people. He's a ticking time bomb of anger now. He doesn't listen to anyone but his drug addict friends and 'no' is never an option. He has broken walls, sent my step dad to the hospital [argument gone wrong; 17 y/o brother at fault], hit me after I refused to give him money, and he verbally abuses my mother. He also dismisses other's feelings since he always feels like the victim. I can't stand him and I feel like my mother is always defending him and throwing me under the bus. I always try to help her, but she just blames me for making him even more angry. I can't speak my mind without hurting my mother's feelings or being blamed for causing my brother's outbursts. Keeping my opinions to myself feels like I'm just letting my brother get away with the abuse, as he has never faced consequences for his actions [police called several times; ""Can't do anything; b/c he's a minor.""] 


&gt;Brother was kicked out for 6 months after sending step dad to hospital; came back tolerable unless you disagree with him.

&gt;He just turned 18 and is legally an adult.

&gt;Step dad left after my mother told him that if he upset my brother, there would be a divorce. No divorce yet, but he lives alone 2 provinces away. 

&gt;Brother refuses therapy of any kind. He doesn't actually want to solve his problems because my mother gives him anything he wants. 

&gt;I'm a dependent 21 y/o university student, 3 jobs, stressed out of my mind, unable to move out and too scared to leave my mother alone. 


&gt;&gt;Moving out is not an option.


I know I can be nasty, I know I've been in the wrong. I just don't understand when I should say something or not. I feel like everything would stay the same without my input, but it seems like if I stay quiet or not, I lose.


Talking to my friends is my therapy, they're great at listening... but in the end, I still feel so frustrated... I've stopped being able to let anything go....................... It seems like I always have to open my mouth or else I'll be more miserable and depressed than I already am

This is a throwaway because I don't feel very comfortable having said a lot of personal things. 

I've moved out of my parents place over a year ago. In fact I left the country to get away from my physically/mentally abusive mother, yet she still finds ways to harass my partner and I.

I've had the police called on me multiple times for no reason. In fact my mother have contacted the police in our area saying I've been kidnapped and held against my will. She has also contacted resturants in the area saying the same thing. She had made multiple email and Facebook accounts to try and msg us and had contacted everyone that could be related to my partner and I. May it be friends, relatives, and co workers. Anyone she could lay her hands on have been contacted. I spent the last couple hrs trying not to break down because I was greeted by the police at our front door. I'm exhausted from dealing with this.

111,"TLDR: I was always worried about the effects of smoking on my school and business performance so I told myself I would either slow down or quit if I ever saw so much as a blip. So far... things have only gone up. Should I still consider quitting just for quitting sake? 


Unlike many I didn't start till I was a senior in high school. Through the end of hs I smoked weekends, usually Friday or sat but rarely both. I still graduated with honors, my grades actually peaked second semester senior year taking 4 AP classes. The summer following I smoked every other or every third day. Then freshman year of college I smoked basically every Friday and Saturday but still never weekdays. I was really focused my first year to get the best grades possible to transfer into a well ranked business school. I was able to achieve a 3.9 over my first two semesters and got accepted. This summer I have smoked pretty regularly 4-6 nights a week. I smoke about a quad a month in the summer and every 2-3 months during school (sharing always of course) I did and still only ever smoke in the evenings when  I have no responsibilities left to fulfill that day.

Throughout high school and college I have owned and managed a business that has doubled in size every year (revenue and employees). I'm in the process of selling it now and should be able to cover the rest of my college education. 

I haven't smoked in over a week now (longest of the summer) as I'm on a two week vacation and I'm curious if I should take this opportunity to just quit altogether.

I don't feel particularly sick, but I am concerned about methyl chloride seeping through the floors or AC if they stripped paint off the tub. Maybe a slight amount of nasal irritation and a light headache (could be unrelated). Any thoughts on my best next move?

I thought that it was just me wanting results from people, or services or just the world in general but it turns out being very toxic. When I start something, I want to be good at it already and people telling me that it takes time in order to excel in that field, I just felt compelled to quit because I have no time (or I believe so) and submit to my impatience. For example, I want to be fluent in other languages but my relentless pursuing for a rewarding feat in a ridiculously small amount of time often destroys my interests and after I fail, my esteem. 

My impatience is destroying the things I usually enjoyed. I started skipping scenes in my favorite movies, scanning books instead of proper reading, gorging on food so I can do something else with my time instead of chewing and digesting it properly. I tend to rush social events in my life, meetings with friends, and only have sex so I could keep it out my mind as fast as possible. 

Also, I feel like I have to catch up to everyone around me. But ultimately, it's as if I just wanted everything to be done as soon as possible. What do I do?

120,"I've tried searching and talking to family and friends to no avail, so here goes: I left a job about nine months ago due to a lot of things--one of them being my former manager. Initially, we got along fine, but once I realized how lazy and attention-seeking he was, in addition to him trying to sabotage opportunities for me to take on bigger projects at work, I stopped talking to him. We were never close, but once things hit the fan, I would only communicate with him about work, in very short and blunt answers. Towards the end, when I knew I was getting another job, I started back casually speaking to him. Let me be clear, though, I still didn't like him and didn't trust him. It was just that I had no reason to hate him when I was moving on. Here's the thing, the job I moved on to is in the same building and we all are on an office messaging platform similar to Gchat. I can't block him on there, by the way.. Anyway, I'm in my new job, and he starts asking me to lunch, coming to my cubicle, and looking at my social media pages (once I found out, I blocked him). At first, I tried to be polite (realizing that was a mistake now), and rebuffed his advances with, ""I'm really busy with the new job."" Now, almost nine months later, he's still messaging me about lunch. No matter how many times I say no, he keeps asking. I finally started to ignore him on our work messenger, and now I'm getting messages in all caps. He's had a history of being pushy with employees (i.e. interns and temps) and was accused of sexual harassment once before. I don't think this is the case here. I KNOW he's not interested in me, but I can't understand why he keeps insisting we have lunch or hang out when he knows we didn't have the best working relationship and that I quit because of him. At this point, I don't know what to do. If I go to HR, I run into the risk of bumping into him in the building. I just want him to leave me alone. I have a lot of leftover aggression from my old job that he caused, and I'm trying to move forward. I know someone might say go ahead and see what he wants, but I rarely get to leave my desk b/c I'm so busy. So when I do take a lunch outside of work, I want to do it with people I enjoy being around b/c that's my time. That's very hard to do when you're getting messages every other week or month and that person is only one floor down from you. It's been nine months, and I haven't managed to make time to go to his office or go to lunch. Why can't he take the hint? Again, what should I do? No isn't working. Ignoring him isn't working. My new job has problems, too, so I'm currently looking for another outside of the building. I just want to start somewhere fresh and not be scared I'm going to run into someone I used to work with that I don't really care for. It's gotten so bad I don't even leave my desk bc mysteriously when I do, I bump into him going to the snack machine or other events in the building.

I live in Greece and the results for the university entries were released today, I had applied for 3 business management universities (the best one, a good one and a mediocre one), unfortunately I was only accepted in the mediocre one due to my grades not being sufficient (I just barely never made it into the good one by a small percentage). I am now in the dilemma to either take a gap year and rewrite my exams and get into where I wanted to priorly or go to this university, I came to reddit as my last hope since I got this feedback from:


* Family: ""choice is mine but full supportive of my decision""


* Friends: mixed (half told me not to waste my time other half said that I can easily make it if I rewrite and that they believe in me)


* Teachers: recommended me to take a gap year as I am a strong student


A little bit about myself: I have anxiety and I stressed out a lot during the period of my exams which lead me to going from 68kg to 59kg in a few months (im 6 foot) due to:


* Eating 1 meal max a day


* Lack of sleep


* More anxiety


I personally know that I am more than capable of making it into the top university as my mock examinations were all perfect scores (due to having no stress during the time) and my teachers think so too, now some of you might say that I will just go through the same problem/process and fail again due to my anxiety but I believe that since I've already had the experience I will no longer fear it and strive.",25Aug2017,1

Prolactin levels have risen more, to more than twice the 'normal' range. Very quickly, in the span of 2 months. Weight loss was in 2 weeks. Memory loss of 2 weeks, around 3 or 4 weeks ago. One moment I was unpacking, the next I woke up to find my room different. And weak. Very weak. 

I had an appointment set up with my Neuro to check up again to see if I have a brain tumor (pituitary). My general doctor was really worried, especially with the lack of appetite, memory loss, and sudden weight loss. Have a lump on the left back of my head, as well. Been feeling depressed. 

Doctor told me to call my Neuro to see if she would accept me tomorrow (now, it's today), and that if she didn't answer, or wasn't able to change the appointment, to go to this University that is very good with brain tumors--they have their own lab and hospital and have done operations and have helped making better treatments. She said it was URGENT!! And for a doctor to get worried, that's something (most all have been pretty dismissive). 

I fear the worst. I might find out in a couple of hours (going to see Neuro). Oh, and did I tell you, the Neuro is coming one hour earlier than her regular time? 

If I do, should I tell friends and family? Also, I have an online pen-pal that is currently going thru some health problems themself, and is stressed out over several things. Should I tell them, just in case the neurologist says I have to have emergency operation? I think I am going to (tell pen-pal). And what about my not-online acquaintances/friends, etc? My family? My family has already dealt with enough death and sickness this year. One died of a brain tumor. She was age 24. One heart attack. One lung cancer(I think...something with lungs). And one is going to die *knock on wood* very soon from pancreatic cancer that has spread quickly.

Should I just pretend everything is okay, until the *knock on wood* last moment? Chemo I could explain away; I would tell them that I have to go to the hospital to do a school project for Histortech or something. Smell could be from 'chemicals' or because were around smells.

1) What can I do for my boyfriend to ease his fear/distress about this situation?

2) Is there a subreddit I can post to about stopping my sleeptalking? Or does anyone here have advice to help treat sleeptalking?

I'm sick to my stomach about this, thinking of how my boyfriend must feel. :( Thanks

EDIT: I'm seeing a shit ton of comments about ""He's cheating and blaming you"" or ""He's looking for an excuse to break up with you,"" or ""He's lying for x reason."" We've been together over two years, living/sleeping together for about a year and a half. Our communication is excellent, and we are extremely open with each other about any problems that may come up. Neither of us has a history of cheating or disloyalty. There's no reason for him to lie about this. I have ALWAYS been a sleep talker, and I've had a ton of stress come down on me lately, due to the school year starting, so I wouldn't be surprised if that stress has affected my sleep talking.

I know people like to immediately scream ""BREAK UP"" every time someone posts a relationship based issue here, but Jesus H, you all jump to conclusions pretty quickly. Half of you didn't even address the actual questions I posted....

EDIT to my EDIT: Thanks to everyone who is actually answering my questions and providing logical suggestions. I really appreciate it.

UPDATE: Recorded myself last night. Not too much to worry about. I did talk, saying something about wearing too short of a dress (I'm guessing that has to do with me enforcing the dress code at my school), but the only other thing the app picked up was a really loud fart lol",25Aug2017,65

132,"TLDR:

After a show, our bassist accidently shot himself in the leg with a 357 sig. The round hit his car door, ricocheted into his femur, and traveled into his kneecap - completely shattering it. He was intoxicated at the time and also on an irresponsibly large amount of his prescribed anxiety meds. He won't be able to walk without crutches or bend his knee for an unknown amount of time. He will never be the same as a result of this injury. The issue now is that he doesn't seem to be realizing the severity of the situation and he thinks that he will continue playing with the band. I don't know how to tell him that it's not going to happen. He is very suicidal and I don't know what to do.


Full story:

To preface this, we have had issues with him in the past. He was struggling with addiction for a while and we were essentially going to kick him out of the band because he was using the band as an excuse to get loaded and party. We take things very seriously and are quickly gaining momentum as a band.

When we confronted him and told him we were kicking him out he broke down and cried, begged for a second chance, swore to get clean - and to his credit he did. During this he also said he had nothing else to live for and would likely kill himself if he didn't have music…

Fast forward to the day of the event, it was evident he was on too many of his prescribed meds, his eyes were drooping and he seemed off. He claimed a lack of sleep but my other bandmate knew something was off.
After the show, he was drinking. We loaded our gear up and when he came back to the venue to hang out he had his gun on him, claiming a random woman pushed him and he felt in danger due to there being a lot of drunk people out on the street. (we play in a big, dirty city). I expressed my concerns about it being illegal to have that on him at a bar, and told him not to show anyone that he has it.

Going back to our cars, he claims he was almost jumped by 3 people, he took his gun out and cocked it, putting a round in the chamber. They back off and he goes to his car. We're on the way back to our practice space in two separate cars to unload, and he was by himself, so I cannot verify his side of the story.

His car arrived a while before ours, and the moment we pulled up his gun went off and he fell over out of our sight.
We were frozen in the car for a few seconds when he comes crawling out from behind his car screaming for us to call 911. My other bandmate calls the police, and I run to grab a shirt to tie the wound after seeing the extent of the injury. I tied a clean rag and shirt on his leg to stop the bleeding. It was an extremely traumatic situation.

When the police arrived, they told me had I not done that, he would have likely died, and that he was 1cm from hitting his femoral artery...
His condition is very bad, he's missing half his kneecap, and tore many tendons and muscles. He's not getting a knee replacement not but he will have to later in life. Luckily he still lives with his parents and they're taking care of him. However, there's a more complicated part to this story...


MY CONCERNS:
Our bandmate has been suicidal for most of his adult life. He's struggled with this since childhood and has been on medication for clinical depression for quite a while. He has attempted suicide many times before we met him, and when confronted with us attempting to kick him out in the past, he told us that he has nothing else to live for and said he has no reason not to kill himself. I'm so afraid for him and I don't know what to do.

We were supposed to record our debut album as a band the week after that show and now everything has been put on hold. We have already found a ""temporary"" replacement but we have not yet told him that it will be permanent. Our guitarist thinks it would be best if they recorded the bass instead of our bassist on the album given the circumstances. I agree but I don't know how to tell our bassist that.

Something deeply concerning is that we've tried talking with him telling him to sell the gun (which is still in police custody until he or his parents claim it) and get rid of it but he refuses... He's also trying to downplay how intoxicated he was and is blatantly lying about how the gun went off. He said it malfunctioned but it was a brand new gun that could not possibly fire unless his finger was pulling the trigger (I know he racked the slide trying to unload it while pulling the trigger)


What do I do? We're all just 20 years old and I have no idea how to handle this and it's tearing into my stomach when I think of having to tell him that his dreams aren't going to happen...

I’m a first year engineering major, but I can already tell it’s not right for me. I have no true passion for it, and I'm already falling behind. I just keep dreaming about culinary school. I love *love* culinary sciences/baking, but I felt like it wasn’t a realistic option and opted for a high paying STEM major, even though I wasn't really that interested in the first place.
I thought I’d be able to bear it, but I was wrong.  I feel like an imposter seeing my other engineering friends be genuinely excited and interested in their field.

141,"I'm an unemployed friendless Swedish 22 year old that still lives at home with his parents and have no idea how to proceed in life.  
  
Backstory.  
When High School ended I had no idea what to continue to study at university so I thought I'd get a job until I figured something out.  
A majority of my friends knew already so all friends but one left town for studies when that summer was over.  
   
Fast forward to now and my only friend who was still in town just left to study at a university in a different town, quite far away from me.  
  
Which has made me incredibly lonely.  
  
I have a girlfriend, which I'm not really that happy being with, not because of her or me, but because of our situation.  
She's also studying out of town, about 4 hours away with train. So I can only see her about 3 times a year since she's busy with school and don't have time, and it costs a lot to travel.  
  
So there's not much intimacy going on between us, and almost 5 years of being together, it's starting to feel more like friendship than a serious relationship.  
   
So 3 years after High School, I still haven't found a proper job, I still have no idea what I'd like to study and work with in the future, my relationship with my girlfriend is getting duller and duller by every day and my last friend just left town.  
  
I do deliver commercial on Saturdays. Basically, I get up early and go to apartments delivering flyers for a company every week.  
It's nothing that can sustain me long term but it gives me some pocket money.
   
So all my days have become the same, I wake up, I eat breakfast, I go through new job listings, I play games and wait for it to become night so I can go to bed again.  
And then it all repeats.  
   
Which is why I need help. I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I've tried studying, I applied for a filmprogram at my local university but it wasn't for me so I quit.  
And I'm trying to get a job everyday with no success.    
   
  
What am I supposed to do? Am I just supposed to keep on trying until I can get a job? It's starting to feel like there's no point. Nobody wants me.

151,"To keep it anonymous I won't say what it is I do however I'll explain it enough so you can hopefully help. I work a job on call and work really intense and long hours. Many days I might not get sleep or maybe a couple hours. 

The problem is for me personally I can't do it. Working these hours and barely sleeping and eating is making me so weak physically and I feel barely conscious all day sometimes. Not to mention I get so sleep deprived and by body gets so fucked up I can't even sleep even though I'm tired. 

So I'm locked into a contract where if I quit I might have to pay to get out of my job. But it has come to the point want means more to me, money, salary, or my health and life which if I neglect I'll never get back or have another of. I can always get another job (hopefully still within my line of work). 

But if I quit my work will stick it to me and try to prevent me from getting a job in the same field. So the obvious thought is don't quit. But I physically cannot work under these conditions until the contract is up I feel it is literally taking the life out of me. 

So finicially if I quit I could get fucked and held to a contract, but if I don't quit I'm sacrificing my health and well being. 

Note: My work isn't exactly breaking and rules or laws if anything they stretch it to the legal limits but not exactly illegal practice.

172,"So, this summer has been a complete shit show and I'm exhausted emotionally. I don't really know if I should take the time to see a therapist, because I've been able to control my emotions pretty well the past few days but sometimes it just feels like I'm waiting for the next tragedy.

The summer started off well, I enrolled in an EMT class and for the most part was able to juggle working full time and attending class three nights a week. 

In the beginning of the summer, my boyfriend and I started having issues. He's bipolar, I have anxiety, it is not a good mix. We went back and forth a lot with ""maybe we should break up"" and ""no, let's stay together and work on this"" which has been really emotionally taxing because I live with him and feeling insecure about your living situation sucks, plus the fact that despite our issues and his frequent grumpiness, I do love him and want to be with him.

Then my sister moved across the country. She and my mom have been having issues because my mother had a suicidal episode earlier this year (second one, first time was years ago, she actually took pills that time, this time she just threatened it) which she did purely for attention. (My mom has every letter in the alphabet when it comes to mental illnesses, ptsd, anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder, S.a.d) After this episode my sister refused to leave her children alone with my mom, which is something my mom really really struggled with and still does a bit. (My mom practically raised those kids, she is a daycare provider and she has always watched her grandchildren) She felt like she was being treated like a criminal for having a fucked up brain, which I get, but I also understand my sister's point of view of not wanting to leave her kids alone with someone who isn't always emotionally stable. We live in New England, and my sister and her family moved to Florida.  I'm pretty convinced that combined with the fact that my sister loves Florida, my brother lives in SC, and her in laws paid for everything (they are living in the same house in FL, the thing's huge), my sister is doing this in part to get away from my mom. So being the only one who kind of gets how messed up my mom is, I've been a lot of her support and it's a little exhausting.

Then for a majority of the summer my parents were getting a divorce. Like I said, my mom has issues, and some of these can lead to abusive behavior, and my dad had had enough, which was good but also frustrating because my mom, again, came to me for support, as she often does because I'm the only one who doesn't shoo her away. My dad and I are thick as thieves, so it was hard because I'm very much more for his happiness than hers. Plus my dad and I are both atheists, and she's religious, and a lot of the abuse she spewed at us (mostly him, though) throughout the years has been based on this fact.

Now my parent's ARENT getting a divorce. Dad said he'd give it one more shot. This is frustrating because now I'm just waiting around for the next time they do this shit. 

The worst part of this summer happened two weeks ago. A dear friend of mine who was very much a part of my growing up, hung himself. He was my first boyfriend my freshman year of highschool, we were together for a year and a half, we were eachothers first kisses, and his cousin is my best friend. Even after we broke up, we remained good friends for years. We had sort of drifted over time, but he has always had a special place in my heart and this just completely broke it. The funeral and the wake were really cathartic and I'm thankful for that, but gosh I didn't know how much I miss him until the option of ever seeing him again was taken from me.

After this happened my parents announced that they're moving next year to South Carolina. My brother moved there when I was about 15, my sister has just moved to Florida, and now my parents are moving next year. I will be completely alone up here. My mom wants me to move with them but no fucking way am I ever living with my parents again, also, I'm 25, just moved out a few years ago, finished college, have a good job, have a new career path I'm taking since I just finished EMT school (I passed which is the best thing that happened this summer). I'm not just going to uproot my whole life to move somewhere where I have no friends, the seasons don't change, it's constantly hot, and bible thumpers run rampant.   

I just have so much to deal with, and I'm wondering if I can benefit from a therapist. I feel like I've been doing a good job dealing with everything, but it comes in waves, especially the grief over my friend and the thought that my dad will be a thousand miles away from me maybe by next summer. Maybe I just need a moment to type this all out, and hear from people that I can do this on my own, but I don't know.

Understandably his girlfriends in the past have always disliked me, which is whatever. They have come and go, as he has dated a bit more than I did. I have had two serious relationships, one of which I'm currently in, 5 years strong.
When I was a young teenager, I had really strong romantic feelings for him, and he did for me but we were dating other people. When I began my current relationship when I was 16, I let those feelings for Will go, and it's been strictly platonic since.
Two years ago, Will began dating a girl named Bre. He wasn't very interested in their relationship, and broke up with her multiple times. I guess she convinced him to stay and they became serious. Our communication died down a little, out of respect for his relationship and I was working and in school. They took another break, which Will called me a lot for support for, because she slept with someone else and is still in contact with them today.
They get back together, and Bre tells him he cant talk to me anymore. He refuses. He tells her he wants to see me, because it had been 8 years at this point without being in person. She warily agrees. I invite her to make her more comfortable.
They spend a week in my home, and I never got one on one time with Will the entire trip. In fact, she pouted and cried and insisted they take two days out of the trip to go to Universal Studios, but that I wouldn't go. My boyfriend kept me company and included himself in a lot of our activities near the middle of the stay because I knew how lonely and upset I was.
They leave, shes all smiles and hugs. I try to be kind in return and let her know she always welcome in my house. This was last July.
Between July and November, Will constantly apologizes and complains about Bre. I tell him its okay, shes first now and our friendship will of course survive and that I understand. He contemplates leaving her due to her lack of trust, high maintenance and controlling behavior. He's trapped because he signed a lease with her and has no where else to go. I talk with my boyfriend, and we offer him our guest room, and he can pay rent. He says okay, and will leave when the lease is up, in May 2017.
He messages me in November saying it would be best if we dont talk anymore and I say okay, immensely angry and hurt. He deletes me off Facebook, Xbox, deletes my number. Everything but Snapchat.
His friend Michael messages me in December, saying Will didnt want to do that, but Bre is watching him and threatening to kick him out. Michael says Will is still my friend and will find a way to contact me in time. I am still hurt and upset, but I say okay, if/when he wants to talk, I'm willing to listen.

It is now almost September and the open-endedness of it has trapped me. I feel like I can't move on because then what if he reaches out to me? I want to move on, because I miss him so much. I dont have any real close friends, and none for as long as him. He still views my Snapchat stories when he can, but that's about it. He won't delete me on there.

He has messaged me once since then, in March, talking like nothing happened. He briefly apologized but said ""he respects her wishes because she'll go through my accounts randomly at any time.""

I don't know what to do. I really miss him. I just want closure, whatever that might be. What should I do? Should I reach out? Or just keep going on, in the dark?

174,"I suppose I'm just posting this to seek validation for my actions today.. so here's the story. I train 5-6 days a week at the same time every day, for the past nine years at the same gym, so I've become accustomed to seeing familiar faces. My gym has had trouble in the past with younger women being recorded while performing cardio/lifting weights.. a majority of the members are women in their late 20's/early 30's. Every wall in the gym has a bold sign stating ""NO VIDEO RECORDING"". 

Today, I'm doing deadlifts and notice a middle-aged guy standing in the center of the gym, recording panoramic videos. I have never seen him before, which convinced me that he purchased a day pass (my gym is located in a tourist destination, so it's common that out-of-towners come on Friday and use the gym for the weekend). I ignored it the first time. The second time, however, I noticed that the entire cardio deck was recorded (50+ women using stair-masters and ellipticals), along with myself performing deadlifts. As he was recording, he was making faces and rolling his eyes. I was thoroughly convinced that he was taking videos of people performing exercises improperly.

The only staff member available was under-aged and soft spoken, so instead of getting her involved, I approached the man and asked him where that video is going, and if he could delete it since I don't want myself being recorded while working out. I admit that my demeanor was a bit strong, but I was aggravated that this guy was continuously recording people working out and nobody has said anything.

Immediately, it turned ugly. He got in my face and told me I need to learn some respect, and if I need to ask him a question, I address him as ""Excuse me Sir.."". I repeatedly asked him where the video was going, and he stated (with excessive vulgarity) that he owns four fitness facilities and he was recording videos of the duct work on the ceiling. I knew this was a lie, because his camera was facing downward at the gym members, not at the ceiling. To diffuse the situation, I apologized. I explained to him that the gym has had problems in the past with women being recorded and that there are signs on every wall stating NO VIDEO RECORDING. He ignored my rebuttal, and continued to shout vulgarity in my face, telling me that I have no right to approach him. Immediately after the argument, he went to the locker room and left the gym. Just about everyone in the gym noticed, and despite getting a bit flustered due to his size and intimidation tactics, I felt as if I was standing up for others in the gym when nobody had the courage to confront him.

My question to you all is how you would have handled the situation differently, if at all. I realize that the best thing to do would be to alert the staff member, however, I know her personally and didn't want her to be forced to confront him. I have been raised to deal with my own problems and not involve others.",25Aug2017,2
176,"Initially posted this to r/morbidquestions, then figured that it might be more appropriate to post here. 

This happened about three months ago. Had a friend dare me to ""run the gauntlet"" as it were, since he knows I have a pretty weak stomach. It took me about two days to finally get through all the videos. There was nothing out of the ordinary until the final video. I'm sure you're all familiar with it; 3 guys, 1 hammer. 

Like the other videos, I watched it and felt disgusted. I couldn't get the image out of my head. After a couple more days, I figured that there was only one way to stop thinking about it: watch it again. I figured I could desensitize myself. 

So I intentionally sought it out, and started watching it again. But as soon as the hammer went into that man's face, something *switched*. I don't know what caused me to do this, but I masturbated to the video. I came, and felt disgusted and confused. 

A week passed. I kept feeling the urge to watch the video again. I got aroused by thinking about it. I tried to stop the urge by masturbating to ""normal"" porn (I'm not even a particularly kinky person to begin with), but no matter what I did I couldn't stop thinking about the damn video. Eventually I caved, and masturbated to the video again. Felt even more disgusted for giving in. 

Now it seems like I can't stop. Either I masturbate to the video directly, or I have to go to it halfway through my ""normal porn"" just to get myself off. I know it's my own fault for going back to it. I don't want to think of myself as a bad person. 

Can someone please tell me what this says about me? ",25Aug2017,8

So im 27 and never had a proper relationship. I had sex but thats it. Four years ago had the last sex and i felt ""love"" but she chosen another guy. Since then i want that feeling. Yeah ima dude and guys dont have feeling blablabla but....sometimes i dream im in love. The feeling in my stomach, the scente of the girl, her smile and so on. I want that.

But im pretty unlucky. I was on dating sites since 17 but the last 4 years bombed my self esteem so hard that i started to be sceptic about true love. I deleted myself for a month now. Girls just ghosting me if im not funny or i show my feelings. If the illusion is broke. Or simply they dont like how im look... screw the inner good guy... im not picki, always interested in the other but i have to lick the floor for attention. If our taste of music, beliefes, hobbies dont march they immediatelly dump me. They dont like who i am. Things i like, i do or i say. I hate the fact i will be alone. I thought about going MGTOW.

When I'm around it it makes my throat burn, and it makes me feel pretty nauseous, it often continues to affect me for a few days, or can make a little sinus trouble into a bigger issue.     Some examples of problems I encounter are; my coworkers smoke outside but then walk directly inside our tiny shop and bring the smell in with them, or I can't be in my boss's car, or walking into a store there is usually someone by the doors smoking, or when taking my kid to the park other parents are smoking, or at the farmers market, local fairs, picking my kid up from school, the car in front of me at a stop light, people who smell strongly in elevators or in lines, it's everywhere.

Recently, I have been reaching out to some old friends from school and I am talking about like 5+ years ago, so it's definitely possible they could've changed completely for better or worse. Yet, I still try to contact my old friends. I've only reached out to a couple people and recently, it turned out really bad and we don't even talk at all so this is why I am really scared. I've been having dreams about one of my best friends from elementary school and thought about how they are doing right now because it has been forever. I have really fond memories with them. But I feel like I am going to be in the same place as I was and abruptly stop talking. I have her social media and stuff but again, it has been literally FOREVER since we last talked but dude, we talked about memes before it was even a social norm so I really want too lol. 

I know I shouldn't be comparing myself to others, but she is a lot more successful than I am with a boyfriend and graduating but literally I feel like I have 2 years behind where I should be.

181,"My brother went to a casting by a modeling agency and they saw potential in him. They were dissatisfied that he didn't have a portfolio, so they agreed to take him on on the condition that he starts making a professional portfolio. They'll offer the resources, he pays for them.

-3 outfit changes 
-professional actors headshot 
-styling guidance 
-hair and make up 
-photo retouching of 9 selected photos 
-electric contact sheet for all photos

185,"My (ex)boyfriend and I signed a lease for an apartment about 4 months ago. About three weeks ago, we broke up. It's a weird situation because both of us still love each other deeply and neither of us truly wants me to move out, but he thinks ending it would be best for both of us to go and have the freedom to be individuals. 

The first week was hard because we were still acting like a couple, with emotional break downs (on both ends) scattered throughout the week. He was also trying to sort out his feelings and trying to decided if breaking up was truly the best option. (The original proposal is that we would give it a month for him to try to rekindle the spark he's lost for me. He stated in the middle of week two it wasn't coming back.) Weeks two and three have been a slow withdrawal of that couple mindset, but we still instinctually take care of each other. 

I'm moving out ASAP and he's helping me pay for it. I have a few leads that I'm waiting to hear back from, but until then we still live together. 

I'm having issues accepting that the relationship is over. I still default to thinking of him when I wake up, and still have the urge to come home and cuddle up after a long day of work. He hasn't had nearly as much issue cutting off those thoughts and actions, which kind of hurts(?). I'm hoping for reconciliation in the future, and while he hasn't explicitly said it, I can tell he doesn't share that hope. And if he does, it's not a strong one. 

So, to make a long story short, I'm looking for advice on what to do to start processing things. He's going out of town for a week for work, and during that time I was going to start packing my things and, if my lead comes through, be moved out by the time he gets back. But during that week I'm going to be lost and hurting. 

I want to make clear that this is *not* a hostile or angry break up. It's one that neither of us is happy about, and we want to continue to be in each other's lives at some point. ",25Aug2017,3

Maybe $20-$30 left by the time payday comes around. Sometimes nothing left over. I'm just getting really sick of seeing my account near empty. Sometimes it gets overdrawn. Getting sick of that too. Sick of having to decide what bills I can ignore until the next payday. Sick of my shit going into collections because I can't afford to pay it. 

I've only been at this job for about four months. I really like it. It's the same thing every day, but it's a foot in the door for my degree  (vet tech). It's also worth mentioning I have a crap work history. I haven't been at a job longer than a year. I've had lots of jobs, also. I know potential employers frown upon that, and rightly so. I'd be skeptical about hiring someone that's had four jobs in the past year, too.

The job I'm looking at is a bank job. It pays five more dollars an hour than what I'm currently making. I've worked at banks before, and find the whole job itself monotonous and clients can be frustrating about their money. It's not something I really have thought about getting back into. But.. five dollars an hour more is starting to sound really appealing. I feel like crap seeing 50 cents in my savings account. I feel like crap knowing I can't ever travel anywhere because I have nothing saved. If something goes wrong (car issues, animal issues, etc), I'm pretty much screwed. I'm having health issues right now, and can't afford doctor/urgent care. I can't even afford over the counter medicine for my health issue right now.

190,"So first thing's first, the backstory: This really pretty girl used to like me when i was in grade 8, but I didn't know until the summer before grade 9 when I asked her about it; before that, I thought that my friends were just bullshitting me when they told me. When grade 9 came I wanted to try to get her to like me again, but I failed miserably. I never really tried to talk to her (until yesterday-more on that in a bit), and made things really awkward between us. As the school year was coming to a close I decided to forget about the whole thing. Grade 10 starts, and about after 2 weeks, I found myself in the middle of this really cool group conversation with these guys in my dorm who decided to just open up and share stuff; I wasn't even close with most of them, but it was still really fun. Eventually the girl's name came up and immediately my friends and I started recalling that tragic experience of mine; we talked about it some more, got a pretty good laugh out of it, then moved onto the next story. Suddenly it started seeming like a big thing to me again; how could I have convinced myself to leave that crap hanging? I wanted to do something about it, and so after a year of barely talking to her, I just came up to her and asked if we could talk alone some time. Luckily, she said yes- however, now I have to come up with a game plan or something cause I definitely don't want to fuck this one up.


What should I talk about? Can you guys give me a list of topics to have in mind? Right now I'm just trying to be friends with her, so at least I'd have something to work with once I decided to man up and ask her out or smth. Also, any tips on talking to a girl for and extended period of time? I've never really had a female friend I was close with, so I don't know what it's like to talk to a girl for as long as I intend to next week. Also. should I bring our past up, or should I just pretend like that shit never happened, cause it was a pretty bad experience at least for me, what with all the awkward encounters and the failed attempts at salvaging what little chance I had left via facebook. Finally, any tips on keeping the thing going in the event that the encounter goes well? I don't wanna start off strong only to lose it in the end; what should I do habitually whenever I meet her? What do i talk about? ANY TIPS WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.",25Aug2017,8
191,"I'm 17, and I've grown about 10 inches in the last 3 years (5'11 now) Idk what the average growth spurt is but yeah..  (very happy about this because my dad is 5'7 and my mother is 5'6) Also in this last year I started lifting and went from a 135lbs twig to 180lbs with a lot more muscle. My whole body has changed, and is changing.. 



I'm never really comfortable in my own body, and not in a body image aspect, more so like I don't feel like I have 100% command over my body, more like about 60%. I'm quite clumsy because of this, and I just exude physical awkwardness!



For example, today this (very attractive) girl was giving me a tour of the new school I'm going to this coming school year, we walked up a flight of stairs and I nearly tripped twice, I went to look through the window of the door to their gym, and kind-of banged my glasses on the window (LOL) and almost tripped again coming back down the stairs.. 



Also in general walking is so awkward for me. It's just spiritually painful lmfao.. Every 10th step I'll almost trip, I'll tend to walk really fast without realising and when I walk with people, I have to slow down for them and I then it's even worse, more like every 3rd step I'll almost trip (You'd think it'd be the other way around right? Slow down and it'll be easier, but no &gt;.&lt;) (also by 'almost tripping' I mean like skidding my shoe on the floor, like a stutter in my step, to put it poetically)



I used to have really bad social anxiety to the point where I'd never leave the house. I have come along way since then! I could talk to the girl giving me the tour just fine, made her laugh, got to know her etc. I've definitely transformed as a person, physically and personality wise, this just a huge obstacle for me that I'd really like to overcome!

Today I was sitting with a friend on campus when a classmate (and possible friend) walked by and started to greet me from a few feet away. I panicked for some reason and mumbled a greeting back which he didn't hear.

I know for a fact this was an awkward exchange because my friend started to laugh directly after it happened . I couldn't deal with it at that moment and just ignored my friend and continued with our conversation.

I screwed up. Badly.

I misunderstood several things. It all added up to benefit me, so I probably should have questioned it. I didn't. I don't want to go into exactly what happened, because spelling out what I did wrong and why I thought my actions were okay makes me look either stupid or malicious. It all seemed fine in my head at the time, but I guess hindsight is 20/20.

Short version is that my sister and I needed to clean up the apartment, and because of me, she has to do it by herself.

Apologies are just words. I offered to skip my class and stay home. I *never* skip class. This was a huge offer. She said I'm better off leaving because she's that angry with me.

I apologized as I left. I knew it wouldn't mean anything, but I didn't want to leave without admitting that I fucked up.

""Words are just words. If you meant it, you'd show it with actions.""

I pointed out that I did offer an action, and she rejected it.

""That's just a platitude. You're only doing it because I'm angry.""

So I just left. I'm on the shuttle heading to class now.

Of *course* I only offered it after she got angry. I didn't realize I had fucked up until she yelled at me.

But I offered it because I felt awful. I still feel awful. I feel like I took advantage of her.

But if words are just words, and actions are just platitudes, then what am I supposed to do? How do I show her that I regret being an awful person? I can't go back in time.

I'm afraid to offer anything else in case she throws it back in my face. But if we say nothing, then she's going to yell at me when I get home. I'm going to cry because I feel awful and I deserve the yelling. She'll get upset at the fact that she made me cry.

Fuck, I feel like crying now.

I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, if it is not then could one redirect me to the right post?

On to the story, I received a call from CHASE (or Capital One, I couldn't recall) about a balance I owe on a credit card that I have NOT taken out. At first I thought the guy was trying to issue me a card, but no I had a card issued in my name from May 2017 with a balance of $100-$200. I don't recall any having anything to do with CHASE, much less taking out a credit card.

The guy on the line said he'll transfer to the fraud department but never did. I have my suspicions but at the moment I have no clue where to start or if this is even legitimate. I mean I do get spam and junk mail (physical) from my P.O. Box from some financial institutions, but I just trash that stuff that isn't from my bank.

203,"Hey,

My husband has been divorced from his ex wife for many years and we have been married many years. His ex wife is irresponsible and creates debts she rarely or never pays. Like credit etc. We get bills in her name in our mailbox which I mark 'return to sender/not at this address."" We have had other contact about some kind of lawsuit about her debts and now I got a phone call to my cellphone from a law firm looking for her. The guy hinted she gave out my phone number but I think they got it from a Google search. I do not, nor will I ever speak with that woman nor will I ever give her my number. I have her blocked on social media, too. I have anxiety and getting lawyer type calls freaks me out! Also, to my utter irritation my husband's ex wife's address etc is easily found with a simple Google search. I gave him her address. Why are the people getting paid unable to perform a simple internet search? 

How far down in the hole is she if law firms are trying to find her? I find this disturbing and worry how it may affect MY family. 

I'm fed up with this. I did monitor my credit for awhile and there was no suspicious activity (I have no lines of credit, either.) What else can I do to once and for all stop the bills, calls etc? We don't live at the same address nor do we have the same last name.

206,"Hi reddit, I've been lucky enough to receive a job offer at a company and in a field I think I would enjoy working in. Furthermore, they are very generous with their starting dates so currently I'm faced with a choice between taking 7.5 or 5.5 months off after graduating from college. 

I've always wanted to take some time off, since this is probably the last time I'll have a chance to have such a long break for a long time. So far I've done a lot of backpacking which has been great, but I intend to spend most of the break on hanging out with family and friends, work on my hobbies, and also to think more about what I want to do long term. Eventually I think I would like to start a company or work in tech, so I will learn programming as well. 

The only concern I have is that 7.5 months is a long period of time, and I might get bored or end up not using it as well as I could. I would also miss out on 2 months of pay of course, and starting later would mean I would start with less colleagues and find it a bit more difficult to rent a place with my friends, so socially it might be slightly isolating. On the other hand I am not sure if I will regret not taking this time while I still can. What do you guys think? 

Thank you for your time!",25Aug2017,1
207,"Hi, Ive had a beautiful golden retriever puppy for around 8 months now, and she's very well behaved and super manageable, she's a pleasure to have around and never causes any trouble. I love her like a family member, and would put her life above my own.

But I always get these urges to hurt her. There doesn't even have to be much of a trigger - today she went into a mud patch when I told her not to, and rolled around in it, but that's such a petty reason. When she got out a looked at me with her innocent, carefree, happy eyes, I wanted to grab her throat and choke her. I wanted to twist and break her legs. She doesn't ever bark when hurt, so I fantasised about torturing her while she remained silenced and confused while in pain. Then I thought about what I was thinking, and I felt sick, and vomited a little. Then I went back to wanting to hurt her. And it was just this cycle. And it makes me so sad and pathetic and sick just looking at her small curled up frame on the floor.

I have thoughts about doing this stuff to people as well, but I know I'll never actually do that irl, and I've heard that it's a pretty common thing to daydream about killing people, so it's ok.

215,"Hey guys.

So I have what (I assume) are fruit flies. They aren't no-see-ums, at least I don't think they are. 

Some of them (a lot of them actually) are tan with red eyes, like bright red. 

I did my best Rorschach impersonation as I was swatting them left and right. (This was after I laid some traps for them that they seemed to scoff at by landing near the trap - although initially swarming near them - and then saying ""no thanks"" and flying away.)

After few dozen or so met their fate with my palms (and fingers), I found myself wanting something that hurt my hand less.

So I saw that fruit flies immediately die if they are sprayed with 91% Isopropyl.

Let me tell you internet friends. I went nuts. I did my best rogue squadron and took out as many as I could, although some seemed to be either too fast, or resilient and needing multiple sprays...like...a lot.

Anywho, I realized mid rampage that I was spraying this Isopropyl Alcohol all up in my kitchen, and around my stove, oven, my microwave, and pretty much...everywhere up in there. 

So...is my apartment going to explode? Do I need to go buy some lysol wipes and wipe away? Or can I just leave it be, order pizza (I'm skeptical about eating food in the house right now) and waiting to cook anything til tomorrow?

Also (sorry to drag on), any tips on killing these crooked fuckers? I'm pretty sure I'm getting bit by some of them. (Although that could just be my paranoia filled rage - I REALLY hate bugs.) 

A few things I've attempted:

Boiling Water and Vinnegar in the drains.

Dish-soap in the drains.

ACV

ACV with dishsoap

ACV with dishsoap and ripe and/or fruit that is mushy (I know, gross), with a piece of paper on the inside.

Originally the ACV combo was in a shallow bowl, then transferred to glass, then transferred to Mason Jars.

I had all the faucets going at once trying to drown them (filling all the areas with dishsoap). 

And then of course there was the Isopropyl 91% alcohol spray.

Will stuff explode if I don't take certain measures? Any tips on killing these assholes?

TL;DR: I sprayed Isopropyl 91% alcohol ALL UP in my kitchen. Any particular way I need to clean this to prevent an explosion or am I worried about nothing.

220,"
It all started a few months back (June) when my grandmother suffered a light stroke. Luckily she was immediately hospitalized and didn't suffer no real consequences. 

A little insight into her history, it's important: around 30 years ago when my mom left her hometown to study, my grandparents broke up. They never divorced just decided to live separately far away from each other. Their marriage was never good, they often argued but somehow managed to stay together until my mom left. After they parted they both lived alone, but for some reason my grandma started to feel like a victim (this), she started to hold grudges and that was what fueled her for the next 30 years. She would remember the smallest of disturbances that have happened between her and her husband or anyone else. 
-for example a story I heard several times during my childhood was that her husband was a scrooge and kept a separate bank account, never wanting to share his money etc. -This was most likely because they were never well off with money, and my grandma was a shopping diva while he preferred to save money for future investments. 

So to the point, after the stroke my grandma was told that she wouldn't be allowed to live alone anymore, since no one lives even close to her and assistant care is impossible to get we decided to sell her flat and buy her a new one close to us so we could keep an eye on her. Selling the flat was a quick process, but buying a new one that would suit our needs would be a different story. Everything was done with her consent of course. 

In the meantime we decided to put her in a top notch facility, where we hoped she would stay for at least a month till we prepared a room for her and prepared ourselves for the upcoming few months. She still needed some medical attention so the choice was the best for all of us. 

As expected it didn't go as we planned, while her stay in a okay hospital a few months earlier we noticed that she complained an awful lot. Nothing, I really mean nothing was up to her expectations. The food was bad, staff was unprofessional, other people annoyed her and so on. We ignored most of her complaints and told her we would find her a better place soon. (Truth be told nothing was wrong with the place where she was, it was a normal hospital) So we found her a new place, a best of what our city could offer. The place had everything, amazing staff that actually cared about you, regular social activities for people they were treating, great rehabilitation and even the food was pretty good as far as facility food can go. 

But nope, wasn't good enough for grandma. She wanted this and that, she nonstop proclaimed that we shoved her off there to die alone, even though that we would visit her daily for at least 2-3 hours. After a week of this, and our unsuccessful attempt to show her the truth that we cared about her and this was just a temporary thing we took her in earlier then we wanted to. 

Everything was nice and dandy for a few days, she enjoyed the food, we would rehabilitate with her daily, take her on walks in her wheelchair since she was still weak to walk alone. But then one day the complaints started rolling in again, the food (could write a whole paragraph about a no salt/no spices diet she started on her own will) wasn't good enough, she'd complain that the food was salty even though no salt was used at all in the making of the food. Then her occasional statements started rolling in how she missed her hometown, and all the friends she had there, how we don't want her any good and we should have rather left her to die in son facility. 

In a couple of days she became a ""victim"" of her parallel world where nobody loved her. She didn't show any appreciation and thanks for anything we done in the last few months for her. Not a single thank you. 

Personally I don't think she's a bad person and all, she's actually very sociable and fun to be around if she's no complaining, but it's getting out of control. 

So anyway, I'm looking for advice on how to approach her and work/live with her. Currently it's tuff, but somehow we manage. If anyone experienced a similar situation or has usefulI insight I would be most grateful for any wise words.

234,"About 6 months ago I hooked up with a guy(lets call him Jack) who is in a 5 year open relationship with a guy named Bob while I was on vacation for a week in Washington DC. Yes, we're all gay men. Thing is I live on the other side of the U.S in San Francisco, CA. I've actually met Bob, the boyfriend of the guy I hooked up with and I get along well with the couple. After I returned to SF I continued to keep in contact with Jack almost everyday. Jack instantly began calling me his best friend and has even once referred to me as his ""soulmate"" to some other people, with Bob fully aware of all this. Jack would often say things like ""I miss you"", ""Love ya"", and ""I love you"" and I would occasionally reciprocate, albeit half-heartedly. It was usually him who messages me first too, rarely the other way around. 

Recently Bob even paid for my plane ticket to fly across the country (a 6 hour flight) to surprise Jack because he recognized how important I was to him. Before this trip I had always considered Jack to be just a friend and kept him in that friendzone, but now I feel like I'm developing real feelings for him. The crazy thing is Bob seems to abide all this. I feel like Jack might be falling out of love with Bob given how he interacts with me. I just don't see how Jack can be infatuated with me while also being committed to Bob. I  think that I should stop talking to the two of them for while because I do not like being in the position that I'm in. Jack and Bob have each other and they seem to be happy but if Jack were to all of a sudden cut me loose then I'd be a bit heartbroken. I want to ask Jack if he feels the same way about me as I do him, but I'm also afraid of losing him at the same time.

239,"Hey there, I didn't thought I would get to this point (asking strangers online, but I think the best advice can come from here), but thanks for even looking into this post.

A bit a bit of context:

I live in a third world country where you have to study a university career almost as an obligation if you want to even think about having the minimal money to subsist fairly.
That if you're lucky and choose a money-making career. The rest of the people have to work a full time job to barely live.

I'm currently and luckily finishing an education career.
I'm currently in a stable and long relationship (7 years), which was build around trust and friendship before everything.

I'm living with him, and 3 years ago left my family's place to live with him. Have in mind that living alone in this country is very difficult because of the low payings. Therefor, I have never gotten the chance to live actually alone.

We have enough money to live, but only he works since I have to study full time, and I can't even get a part time job because university takes up even saturdays on full (almost all part time jobs are full weekends here). We live wth his parents.

Everything sounds nice on the outside, but I must say, I think I'm going through a severe, silent crisis. In every aspect of my life.

I have been barely coping with the challenge that studies have been for me. I have been struggling a lot and almost got kicked out of college because I failed over three times one of the courses.
Yet, I have been able to handle myself with some effort (I worked part time untill two monthes ago, I had to drop it because of my professional practice and the fact now saturdays are alos taken by other courses).

Although I like my career, I have been doubting severely about my capacity to handle it. I don't know if I have a true vocation, and although I know it's a great deal that I even got into superior studies (let's say I had a lot of social and cultural disadvantages for that), I don't know if it's right that someone like me will be teaching kids someday. I feel like I'm not good enough.

Aside from that, I feel like my relationship is falling apart. We've always been such friends, but lately we've been arguing a lot. He's been without a job for the last 3 months and in the last 7 years, has only worked 3 years in a stable manner. He hasn't been able to keep a stable job for more than a year. 
Worse part is that we don't even argue about that: I try to support him about his job issues, although keeping in mind that we both depend on that. The arguing usually happens for such small things, but I've realized he seems to think that I think that I'm better than him. He always says that: that I think I'm invincible, that I can handle myself in everything and anything, and that I think too highly of myself. Basically that I'm someone that looks down on everyone else, specially on him.

You might have also guessed the ""living with his parents"" point is a major issue. This is because of his job instability. And worst part is, they are really hard to live with. They complain everyday about almost anything, and to me. They barely pay their share of the bills because they spend their money on other personal stuff. They have very dirty habits which I have tried to talk about, but they just say ""yes"" and keep on going. I guess it's true that I'm the ""intruder"" here, but still.

This is a very, very recurrent thing he says to me. For this I thought that maybe I said some stuff that made me sound like that and so I consciously kept an eye over what I said and how I said it, but no... he keeps saying that, every single time we argue. It makes me actually sad that he really thinks that.
And so, family. This has been a major issue throughout my life. From a violent and con artist father (yes, he was a convicted criminal) that kept us wandering around through many countries up until I was a teenager, then to abandon us and leave us to our luck; up until my over-protective mother that didn't let me leave my house alone until I was 18. Family life has been hard. I guess it's in part the reason I left my home early, and I hopefully won't have to go back.

But you know, all I've been thinking about is to escape. I wish so badly I had the money and the time to work off to be able to leave everything behind. But I know that's the easy way out; I know it will ruin my future in economic terms, and most importantly, in emotional and relationship terms. I think I will repent so badly if I choose to leave my partner, cut ties with my family and escape my career.

All I think I need is advice to handle this phase, or to know if even it's a phase. I don't know how to handle this on my own, and I feel I am on the edge of getting depressed about everything. I already got a psychologist help, but it didn't do actual good.
I guess I need real life advice. Advice from people who actually have been through this, or know about this.

Thank you so much!",25Aug2017,1

258,"Hey guys, needed some quick advice. I've recently been interviewing with a company and it sounds like they're interested in hiring me. I haven't yet received a formal offer from them but I have already moved past the interview stage. The company is now having me submit references to run a background check and I'm waiting to schedule a drug screening as well.

Now, a few months ago I booked a family vacation for a few days at the end of the year (about a month after the position's start date would be). My question is, when is the best time to mention this to the company? Is it better to do it before a formal offer is made, or is it better to wait until I actually receive the offer and tell them before I accept? I'm just worried that if I tell them before it may affect the company's final offer.

Thanks in advance and I appreciate any help I can get!",25Aug2017,1

262,"Hi, 

I'm 17 and, tend to have a lot of free time. I always go out on my bike with my other two close friends. Its fun but, is getting quite boring and repetitive now. We've always done fairly boring things like ride bikes, same route, went on walks / runs same route, go for something to eat same place. These two are my best friends but in the nicest way possible they're so boring. I mention or do ANYTHING different they just find it weird and go back to their boring conversions about things you can tell neither are interested in yet, they do it as they want to act ""Mature"".

I was just thinking, in year 10 I had a massive group of friends. Sadly the classes got mixed up and everyone lost touch and a lot left. So the groups went small and life got that bit less exciting. I just remember about 30 - 50 of us were all out at any given time. Bikes, urban exploring, fair just sitting around. It was so unpredictable;e and the conversions were so different and you could just float from person to person and never get bored. It was such a fun and happy time. 

I realise I wouldn't have this big of a group again but, I'm just thinking how can I have a bigger group again? These two would never go out with someone they don't know, but, I honestly feel like I'm being dragged down by them. Problem is now, they're the only two friends I really go out with now so, I wouldn't know how to even start finding other groups. Any advice whatsoever?

Feel like I'm getting older now and don't have much more time to just have fun and live. I want to make the most of it. I'm too young to be going on 10 hour walks with a coffee, talking about politics. I want to just get out there and live a little. Any ideas? Thanks.",25Aug2017,1

271,"I am 25 years old and have been out of school for 5 years. 

I moved out of a difficult home situation when I was 17. With a combination of the money I had saved up and working full time, I managed to support myself and pay for two years of community college out of pocket. It was absolute hell, but I made it through.

At 20, the time finally came to transfer to four year university to pursue my dream of becoming a teacher. It was at this point that I discovered that the amount of money my abusive stepfather made meant that I was only eligible to receive enough in unsubsidized loans to cover &gt;1/4 of tuition. 

The only solution for me ended up being waiting until I turned 24 (and would be considered an independent for FAFSA) to reapply. Finally, the time has come for me to go back! 

It turns out that through scholarships and grants, my tuition is now 100% covered, with an additional surplus of $5,000 a year in money I don't have to pay back. 

I have a job in retail management that is somewhat flexible, but will require me to work a minimum of 25-30 hours a week. My SO recently got a large pay bump and is urging me to quit my job so that I can focus fully on school. I have the option to accept $6,000 in loans for this year that would make this a very financially viable option, but I am afraid that I would be making the wrong choice. I've already denied the majority of available loans for my first quarter, which means it would be fairly tight at first. If I did quit, I would plan to most likely give myself the first quarter to get acclimated and would look for another (more part time) job for the rest of the year. 

So Reddit, what should I do? Quit my job and focus only on school, or keep working and hope that I can do both well? ",25Aug2017,1
272,"Hi guys. I'm feeling a bit sad/lonely/ unhappy with  myself. I'm not sure why. I guess I don't have friends who enjoy doing the same things as I do. I know this is weird, and please tell me what you think my problem is, or if this is too conceded of me..but I want to feel good about myself. I want to dress up and take pictures of myself..when I'm out because most of the time I'm at home. Whenever i go out with my friends, I'm almost th eonly one that wants to take a picture..and i hate that i sound so eager to take one. I want to take pictures because I want to keep memories of having a good time..by being out..and so I can keep track of the things i've done...and just feel good about myself. I'm not asking for validation..but my friends are camera shy or think i'm the type of person who likes to post things on social media to show up. But I'm not. I want to explore my creative side. None of that stuff my friends ever told me, but it just things i gather from the few instances i've taken those pictures, or just a look of disrespect..like i'm trying to hard. Also I tend to think  everyone hates me. I just feel super lonely. No one in my family enjoy taking pictures of me that I actually like. and plus they take like 1 and they don't want to take any pictures. Its kind of discouraging. I'm really sad because I don't have many friends or when i make new friends, i feel afraid my new friends would think of me the same way. It makes me sad. 

is there anything wrong with me? I know i have low selfesteem issues that i need to work on and I'm trynig to overcome them by not caring what people think. but like i just feel like majority of the people treat me the same way. like i'm weird and different..orr desperate.

273,"A longer version of this story—my boyfriend and I live in a 1br apartment that has an amazing maintenance team. For all the hiccups our appliances have had thus far, they've been pretty good to us and get to our issues in a timely manner. This morning I found our water heater (separated from our living room by one wall) had burst and we had some water damage in the walls and carpets. Luckily I caught it before it was worse.

However, management's solution was to replace the water heater (A+ okay with this) but tear out the baseboards in the corner of our living room with the water damage under the carpet and in the wall. They've installed these massive industrial fans (each one is about the size of a small beanbag chair) to, I guess, suck the moisture out of the carpet and heat things up. 

They let me know beforehand that these would make my living room and kitchen a literal hotbox and that it'd be an issue to have it compete with my A/C to cool our living room. I was told by the maintenance worker that this would spike our electricity bill, but to bring the bill to the office later down the line and it'd be reimbursed (I've yet to visit the office and confirm or outline this, though.)

Now, this has been pretty benevolent thus far and it's been one hell of a morning/afternoon keeping my dog in the bedroom and making sure things were installed proper. But this is where my real problem starts—these fans are bloody LOUD. I didn't think it'd be so bad until I actually sat out here in my office area for an hour and realized I was getting a damned headache. My ears are starting to literally ache from the droning.

And unfortunately over the next three days, moving into the bedroom isn't an option, as my boyfriend works overnights and needs quiet/dark in the bedroom to sleep through the day. My dog also can't just be confined to the bedroom either, she needs to be able to get out and get daylight. I can only imagine what noise hurts my ears/head is going to drive her bonkers by tomorrow morning.

This is expected to last three days but I'm only a few hours into this since the maintenance guys left and I don't know if I can bear it three days. 

I've got a lot of work to do in my office and this whole setup is just a nightmare. Earplugs don't seem do help much and I'm extremely concerned for my dog's hearing being damaged by these machines. 

Not sure what I should do at this point—if I tell them that the fans are a problem, what are they likely to tell me? Is it common for management to work around this? There's no way I'll be able to sleep through these machines tonight, either, so now my work performance is likely to be affected (likewise with the boyfriend.)

Just frustrated and not sure what to do. Head is absolutely pounding.",25Aug2017,1
