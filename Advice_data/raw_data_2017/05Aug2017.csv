2,"I'm currently working as an attic insulator and I make 16$/hr in Ontario. My workplace is only about 10 mins away however I am getting rather bad hours at the moment. Another company has come to me and offered me 20$/hr and lots of hours but the only problem is the drive is about an hour away. Would it be worth it?? He says I have a guaranteed position because of my experience. I'd be commuting both ways btw, it's about 85km away.",05Aug2017,1
3,"After work today around 4, I went to the store and bought some goodies for the weekend. Them being some yummy things and 2 six packs of beer. I went and paid for it and noticed that the total of everything was a lot less than I expected. Well I just shrugged it off and paid the cashier. I got home and put away the yummy things and looked at the receipt. The cashier forgot to charge me one of my six packs of beer. I groaned, and started to feel guilty. I didn't want to go back at first because it's freaking Friday, I just want to flipping relax and numb out for the rest of the night, and if I go back I'll have to face people and traffic and I don't want that. Against my better judgement, I went back. Got in my car, faced 5 o'clock traffic and got to the store. Waited in the customer service line for maybe 15 minutes. I politely and carefully explained that I was there about an hour ago, my cashier forgot to ring up my second six-pack of beer and that I would like to pay for it, with my receipt in hand. The old dude just looks at me asks for my ID and charges me. And that was that. Having to face traffic and people and guilty feelings for only that. :/. I just want my yummy things and a beer!!!! Thank goodness it's the weekend! 

Would you have taken back the beer and paid for it? Or are you more along the lines of * FREE BEER PARTY ON!!!!*?",05Aug2017,2
4,"I don't anticipate any issues with my back round check but I have an offer. The real issue is I have to move to another city. I don't feel 100% comfortable moving until this is squared away.

Lot.) I tried to tell mom to take him to hospital and I don't want to leave him alone but mom just yells at me and he can't stop crying. Dad says he's going to leave if he makes it home and that he's sorry for hurting us by being crazy ( he's not wrong exactly, me an sister both very depressed and have anxiety disorders from all the trauma of beig with him and his anger issues and PTSD/bipolar 2.) and he also says he hates is job more than anything and is just going to get on a plane and go somewhere random. M sis is screaming at me telling me I should have just left him alone when he said he was getting in te car to go die but I didn't want to lose him. I'm also going to college in 2 weeks an have no loans or support besides him and I'm very depressed and have had severe anxiety but can't get in to see a therapist here and it will be even harder there. And my mom had no support network either besides her very old parents and she's been depressed and suicidal too. And this has all happened while we are on vacation across country which makes it even harder to do anything and makes dad even more guilty.

6,"I have a family member. She has fudged her life up. She constantly blames others, makes excuses for her actions or lack of, selfish, does not help others but expects help when she needs it and constantly complains about others.

My parents are very generous people and of course this leads them to get taken advantage of. Numerous people they have helped have thrown it in their face and never appreciate.

So getting back to this. I have a family member who as described isn't a very good person. I am back home for the summer and now I have to be witness to what is going on and it is upsetting me. This person asks to stay round at my parents to look for new apartments/ jobs to 'change their life'. This person is very well know for being a free loader and everyone refuses to take her in but my parents are too nice to tell people to fudge off.

I have spoken to my parents saying I dont like what is going on and I expressed how I did not want this person staying in my parents house. She has been staying for a few days now and she still has not even looked at any apartments or jobs. I know these 'few days' she claims to be staying will turn to a couple months.

This has happened before. A few years ago she done the same thing 'to try and change her life'. Those weeks turned into months. Then they sent het back to my grandparents who she has been leaching off for 45 years. 

Its been a few days now and I am fuming and cant stand the sight of her. I want her out the house now. I have just spoken to my mother who has claimed that it will only be a few more days. She has not contributed anything and they have been paying her meals and everything. Just to add that she constantly saying stuff about my parents behind their backs and failed to show any appreciation. I don't know what to do. I need some advice.",05Aug2017,1
7,"So, just to preference, I'm turning 20 in a few days. I've been putting in applications to legitimately every single entry level position in my area for the past month. I believe I've applied to just over 30 places at this point. Most of which are cashier, or ""Sales associates"" positions. Sales associate is just a glorified ""jack of all trades."" Cashier, janitor, greeter, stocker, all rolled into one. 

Originally, I figured I'd get hired right away. I thought I was a prize catch... I graduated with honors, and extra curricular activities, have no drug use, or criminal record, and spent 2 summers volunteering at a charity auction. So, I only applied at 4 local convenient stores, and 1 local super market. And sat on it for a week. And after calling each store, I was told directly by 2. That I was ""practically guaranteed an interview."" So I waited another week. And nothing. 

At this point, I was already frustrated. So I though, ""fuck it."" More specifically, ""fuck them."" And applied at another 10 or so places. Each convenient stores, or super markets. After a week... Nothing. I called them all again, and again was told to expect an interview. Yet nothing. So, I resorted to applying at fast food joints. Which I absolutely detested the idea of doing. But after applying at 4 fast food places, and all the remaining stores, and gas stations in my area. Again, I was left with nothing at all. 

Finally, here we are. I just applied at McDonald's 2 days ago, and applied to another super market that's a bit further away than I would have liked. And they are my last chances. If they fall through, I'm completely, and utterly fucked. Thoroughly. 
I'm incredibly frustrated, and hurt. I expected a few to ignore me. But 30+?... With a handful of places being fast food joints, and Walmart. Each of which, having a reputation of hiring anyone who applies? And I mean, it's not like I need the income right now. But what happens when I do? I just apply to the same 30+ places, and hope to God - ""This time, they'll hire me?"" And how long am I expect to live with my parents? I suspect the biggest reason is because of my lack of real world work experience. But how the hell am I suppose to get experience, when nobody will even give me the time of day? 

My parents still think I've only applied to a handful of stores. Because I can't bare to tell them nearly every single hiring store within 35 miles has basically told me to fuck off. Hell, a few lied to my face when I went in person. Telling me things like, ""we're not even hiring."" (Yes, it's was just as condescending as it sounds) When it said clearly on their site, they had multiple open entry level positions. I don't know if I look like trouble or something? I mean, I am nearly 6'7, 260 pounds. But I'm sure to be friendly, smile, and dress nice. Even when I'm going in to check my application I wear dressy-ish clothes. I.E. Button down, with some nice kakis. 

Anyway, sorry this became a rant. I just don't know what to do. ",05Aug2017,3
9,"Okay, so this is a long story. I (21F) have a best friend (22F) who I cherish above everything. We've known each other for a decade, ever since we met in summer camp. She's my rock; I know she'll always be there for me, and me for her. Truly, at times I feel like she's the only person who can understand me. 

As many best friends growing through adolescence together, we experimented a few times. Once when we were both 12, and then again when we were high school. Both times I was afraid of what might happen if we were caught, and the situation put me in a confusing spot regarding my sexuality. I didn't know if it was okay to do the things we were doing, basically. We never talked about it and sort of moved along with our friendship without acknowledging it happened. 

Now we're full grown adults, both with a pretty solid understanding on our sexuality. She's admitted that she prefers men, but finds women attractive. I consider myself straight, but I do find myself staring at women on occasion. Up until recently, I thought she might have been embarrassed about the times we had shared, since she never brought it up. Which is fine, since I was just as embarrassed and still emotionally confused about where I stood with her. Nonetheless, our friendship has remained strong, and nowadays we couldn't be closer. 

And then...a few nights ago, it happened again. We were snuggling on the couch and watching a movie, a usual for us. Before I realized it, her hand was in my pants and I had been the one to encourage her to put it there. A little awkward and embarrassing, but this time we were finally adult enough to cross the threshold and talk about it afterwards.

She admitted to me last night over the phone that she'd been in love with me for years, ever since we met. She said I was the only girl she liked in a romantic sense, and that she had felt confused and depressed that we never talked about what happened between us. I told her that it was okay, and that I was sorry for never talking about it. 

But the truth was and still is that I just don't know what to say. I love this person more than I've ever loved anyone, but I don't see her in a romantic light. Part of me is afraid of romantic relationships because there are parameters and obligations associated that I struggle with meeting. I much prefer our friendship, where I feel comfortable being myself around her and not feeling any constraints regarding what I can do or say. That being said, I do enjoy it when she touches me. I desire her touch, maybe because I'm a human who likes to be touched, but maybe because she's the only person I want to let myself be vulnerable with. 

She told me she understood that I don't feel the same and that she was just fine with the relationship we had, but wanted to know if she could continue touching me. The biggest and only issue is that I have no desire to reciprocate. As I said, I'm straight, and I've only ever touched men. I'm a bit afraid to touch a woman, and especially to touch her, because I don't want our relationship to move past the borders of friendship. 

Today, she told me she had realized that it would be painful for her to continue touching me if I wouldn't touch her back. She said the burden of unrequited feelings is too much for her and she would just rather we didn't do anything at all if I couldn't touch her. On one hand I agree with her, because I don't want to ruin our friendship with something stupid like this and she's entitled to protect herself from being hurt. But on the other hand, I'm afraid that now all of this is out in the open like this, things are going to become really awkward between us. Before we could both act like nothing was weird, but now that I know she's in love with me, I'm afraid she might start feeling jaded just by being around me as a friend. Not to mention, I enjoyed being physical with her and I want to continue doing it. I just don't know if I can give back what I'm receiving, for lack of better words. 

Sorry, I know this is a long post. I suppose I'm mostly just venting since this is all fresh in my head, but any advice or comments on the situation would really be appreciated. I feel so alone because I have no one I can talk to about this. ",05Aug2017,3
10,"I recently started dating this guy who I really like. We decided to end the relationship because one of our close friends (who is a woman) has a crush on me and neither of us want to hurt her feelings, especially since she probably has had a crush on me for a longer time than I have known my exboyfriend; we risked our feelings just to make her happy. I want to come out to everyone at school this year but the girl who has a crush on me is a really close friend of mine and I don't want to loose her or make her sad.

12,"So for one, I'm going to college and I make to-do lists for homework and on which days to do them. Which for me, that's okay and it helps me stay on track, because I know it's important. I also design logos, backgrounds, thumbnails, websites, and more to make some side money. On top of all that I make youtube gaming videos, which is a fun hobby of mine and I make a video a day and livestream a lot. OR atleast plan to.

I make plans so that today, I'll record this and that, edit, upload stuff, make thumbnails, design this, blah blah blah. I make to-do lists and spend a good 30 minutes creating one, then I end up not feeling like doing one thing. So I procrastinate the rest of the day and later that day, I'll create a new to-do list for tomorrow. Then repeat the process for the next day and the next. Really important stuff, like homework, paying bills, etc. I can do no problem with a to-do list. But it's everything else that I just can't seem to do with a list. So how should I approach this from now on? Should I just find a way to reward and/or punish myself with to-do lists and if I complete them or not. Or should I just forget about a list.


BTW, I've tried daily to-do lists, weekly, and even strict hour-by-hour ones, but they still lead me to procrastinate and create more lists. Thanks in advance!",05Aug2017,1

16,"It's not just that I don't have skills. It's that I'm actively bad at the things you need to do to get through life in general. I'm horribly unorganised. I'm so absent minded I can't focus on anything before forgetting it. I'm clumsy in a way that frustrates me. I fall into daydreams without ever realising or meaning to. Sometimes I fall asleep randomly in the day involuntarily. Getting out of bed is, and has always been, a monumental chore for me every single morning, I feel like I lack some form of common sense or initiative that other people seem to have naturally. 

 

As an example, I started working in a care home because I thought I'd like to go into nursing. But I'm terrible at the job. I mean really terrible. There's no time to talk to the residents but I end up talking to them and missing my cleaning chores. I drop things all the time, plates, medication, etc. I can't fold the sheets properly. I once accidentally left a tap running because I completely forgot about it and flooded the kitchen. I forget to put the washing machine on all the time. I put the clothes in, shut the door, and then walk off without pressing the start button. Nothing I do can make me remember. I forget the schedule for the day all the time. I just feel like I'm useless at the job even though I'm trying really hard. I thought I wanted to go into nursing but I don't see how I'll ever manage when I can't do these simple tasks. I actually don't know how I'll do any job at all. 

 

I do have some ""good qualities"" and things I enjoy but none of them fit into any kind of job. I like animals, I like video games, I like walking, I like sitting on my own for hours, I like writing, I like daydreaming, I like things that make me laugh, I like kind people, I sleep a lot. Sometimes I think about starting a gaming channel on twitch or YouTube but I'm also shy and I don't think it's a realistic career option. I also want to work with animals but I have no background or skill in animal biology or how to even begin. I can't focus well enough to study.

20,"Hey guys, I'm feeling pretty defeated tonight. Me and my lady are not on good terms right now. During our relationship, she has expressed her want for a puppy, something to occupy her time and thoughts. We tried a couple, one puppy almost got us evicted so we had to give it a back to the shelter. The other she brought home unannounced at a time where our schedules were insane and she flipped out on me when I tried to tell her it wouldn't work, the puppy would get neglected because we were barely home, let alone to see each other. Now, it's that situation all over again. We just got back from the dog park, with our 11 year old mini schnauzer. She had the chance to get a puppy like ours for cheap, however, our debt and schedules with our new jobs have left us as passing ships in the night, no time for anything other than food and sleep. Our money is so tight, I couldn't squeeze a dime out of the budget if I tried. She talked to me at the park about getting that dog, and I told her I was so pen to that when it would work out better for me, her and the puppy. She immediately shut down and wouldn't really talk, only saying ""I won't change my mind"" and ""You will never be open to it"". I can't handle it anymore, I've been busting my tail trying to get our life back into shape, money wise and love wise. To introduce a puppy, that's suicide. We barely have enough time to spend with our own, and it's awful. Her depression makes this ten times worse, as she won't talk to me or acknowledge me. I don't know what to do, I can't just give in and HOPE things work out for the puppy, that's not right considering the facts of our life. I am merely trying to stay realistic and all the while, be there for her and assuring her it isn't the end. I'm at a loss at what to do anymore here. 

Edit: I meant to include this as well, I over heard her friend and her talking about this, and her friend is saying I'm not trying and that I need to realize her needs. She is tagging along with that and agreeing. So that along with the above, where do I go from there, you know? ",05Aug2017,1

24,"I love physics and mathematics. I didn't do what I needed to in high school and spent time playing video games (League of legends to diamond 1 (My only real high school achievement sadly)) and my grades weren't the best. Even while doing that, I still loved reading books about Physics (The Feynman Lectures, The man who changed everything,...) and mathematics. I find it beautiful and fascinating.

The problem comes from the people I aspire to become and surpass with the knowledge they have gifted us. The greats I mentioned before went to universities like Princeton, MIT, Stanford, etc... Although I like the school I'm attending next year, I feel like I'm not cut out to be a great physicist. I feel like... I might not contribute anything since those people clearly did much better than me in high school. For this reason, I was so upset that I decided to try and take an officially-administered IQ test (Which means nothing in terms of physics studies) and got back 133. Now, I feel even more inadequate to those I look up to. My heroes feel like gods to me. My mind is poisoned with this, and I don't know what to do. 

Inside, I feel like there is a toxic waste bubble inflating around the concepts I enjoy imagining and constant telling me that I'll never get it, absorbing both those ideas and the passion I have for the study. I look at patterns like prime numbers for hours and days trying so many manipulations and calculations to find something, failing every time and hating myself more and more and feeling less and less valuable to my peers and heroes.

25,"Alright, so I received a full scholarship to a small community college to major in graphic design. I think majoring in this was now a mistake because I can't find a place that will hire me ANYWHERE. I took it initially because I was living off of 50 dollars a week between my mom and my dad and it meant I got to go somewhere else and stay and have actual meals.

So I just graduated with my associates and I've done a lot of extracurricular things like being the art club president and having a web design internship (which didn't teach me shit by the way i still dont know fuck all about web design and i hated the art director that i was interning for with a fucking passion she wasted my time) and I'm currently doing a mentor ship and we just finished painting a mural. I did all of this during my final semester while taking 20 credit hours and at this point I feel pretty entitled to a job that pays $10.00 an hour because I busted my ass but nobody will take me.

Both of my parents are unemployed because my mom can't seem to hold a job. (She got fired for missing too much work this time) My parents are divorced but we live together in a one bedroom apartment and my dad pays all of my moms bills and she'll kick him out a lot and make him walk to my sisters and it's just been like this for the past 3 years now and I'm really sick of it.

So while I am waiting for the next cycle my old college roommate asked me to come live with her in Southern, U.S.A, I'm from the far away North. I thought it was a good idea because I'm from a very rural area while she lives in an urban area with more job opportunities. 

So I moved down to the South, found a simple retail job, and my plan was to stay until at least February. Then if I got my dream job I could spend 4 months with my family before leaving or spend 5 months and go to grad school. However, I'm not quite adjusting the way I hoped. The homesickness is largely gone, but I just feel mentally drained every day. I feel like what I'm doing doesn't justify being so far from my family, and while the homesickness is gone I feel myself slipping into a depression I haven't experienced in over four years.

I know I can go home anytime I want, but I have a lot of fears.  For one I have a huge fear of failure, and I feel like moving back home is a sign of defeat that will impact my hope to travel for a living. I'm also worried about employment because I want to be active, I don't want to just sit home, but again I live in a rural area. I just want to make this year count for something, and I feel lost no matter what I decide. Plus, I'm afraid of hurting my friend, who is so excited to have me here.

I am a secondary education major with emphasis in English. I have been in college for 5 years now. I hate being a student. I have fulfilled almost all of my English requirements, but have left most of my education classes for last. I hate education courses, especially the prospect of the practicum courses where I have to actually go and teach at a high school.

I want to teach ESL to foreigners who move to the US. I don't want to teach elementary or high school. I want to teach ADULTS.

I would switch to the English program in a heartbeat except I'm worried that one day I'll want to teach high school. I like the idea of teaching high school literature, but it's not my main goal at the moment.

Where I live now, you must have an education degree to teach high school. I'd be able to teach adults ESL, but wouldn't be able to teach at a school if I decide that's what I want to do.

I want to move around a lot, but life is fickle and I don't know where I'll be based on jobs my boyfriend will get. Maybe we'll be here forever because he finds good work. If that's the case, I can never teach in a high school without the education degree.

I have 2 more years on my education degree because I'm a lazy eff, I resent being in school, and I despise the thought of taking the practicum courses.

Should I switch to English and just snatch up a degree I can use for teaching adults ESL, or should I suck it up for 2 more grueling years and get the education degree just in case?",05Aug2017,1
36,"So basically i had a small crush on this girl then she went out with someone while i went out of another person after she told me she liked him. After we both broke up with our relationship around the same time she really really liked me but my stupid self ended up going out with another person. A week after my second relationship that lasted around 2 monthes i jumped into another relationship and she was there for me the whole time kinda we occasionally talk and she would still message me first and everything. Now after the 3 relationship ive been in this year i really like her. But now she is saying she doesnt want to be in a relationship but we still talk in the phone a lot almost every night and she doesnt want to hang up because she likes the sound of my voice also she calls me cute. I flirt a lot with her and she just calls me dumb or stupid in a joking way. I asked her if she liked me and she said ""i dont know."" and everytime i ask she never gives me a straight answer. But she is really determined to not be in a relationship because she got hurt but also she says she wants to focus on school, i told her i can help her since i already took the classes and she agrees.  She has said many things like she would make out with me and stuff. Should I keep talking to her?",05Aug2017,2

38,"Hi! For a bit of quick background info, I am an 18 year old girl who is going to college. When we were kids, my twin sister and I were put in the same classes, and we shared all of our friends. Even as we got older and were put in the same class less frequently, there was always someone I knew in the room. As time went on, people joined and left, but I always had a small group of close friends and plenty of casual friends. To make a long story short, I never had to try to make friends from scratch. They just sort of happened over time, and I never really did any work.

I recently went to fish camp and made plenty of potential friends. I'm a friendly person who is pretty in tune with people, so people are usually attracted to me. I would have several great conversations, they would ask for my number, snapchat, discord etc, and then we'd part ways with a warm smile. But the thing is, I sort of don't know what I'm supposed to do next. 

The camp was three days, and frequently, I would catch someone I had talked to the other day looking at me only to be unsure if I should just wave or approach them. I wound up just approaching and briefly greeting/chatting with my 8+ new friends and acquaintances and then retreating into a camp activity with feigned distraction. Quite frankly, I feel like a platonic tease.

I could charm and finesse my way through things IRL, but now that everyone from the camp is going their own ways, I don't know what the heck to do. I'm not sure when, how, what or how frequently to text. I don't know how soon or if I'm supposed to bring up the possibility of meeting again, or how to let down those I didn't want to befriend but nervously gave my phone number to. I have no. freaking. idea. how to use snapchat.

I'm really nervous because I met a lot of interesting people, and several who I felt really in sync with, but I feel like I'm doomed to ruin everything. Please, I need a lot of help, especially with the whole snapchat thing. ",05Aug2017,1

I know if I have a problem I should talk to my family or friends, but every time I go to them for advice it just demotivates me. Not because they're bad family, its just they think what they know is always better, even if its not. My friends on the other hand, they give their best to advice me, but it still doesn't help me. So I'm here guys to know what your advice are and hoping its the advice that would really help me. I'm here because, I'm really desprate to know what to do. pls.

What happened is, 2 years ago I had severe depression that caused me on failing a lot of my subjects and now I'm in my 4th year in college(should be my last year), but because of the subjects that I failed. I'am not going to graduate this year. I really don't know how to tell my family about this matter, because they said that I should finish my college in time. And now, I'm getting the subjects that I failed 2 years ago and I'm having this depression again that caused me not to attend my classes again and I might fail that subject again. I really don't know what to do anymore. I know that I should learn from my mistakes, but I f*ck it up again and again. pls guys help me.

49,"This isn't a joke. 

So I've had a few run-ins with my dad's porn habits by accident, but the thing that stuck most is accidentally finding a zoo porn website in his search bar about a year ago. It took me a few days but I got over it.

Then maybe a couple months back I was using his computer again and came across a search of ""where do dogs like to be rubbed"" and similar ones. None explicitly sexual. To back up, we've had a dog for 5 years now, a small white thing. This got me a bit unsettled because he's always with the dog, and I can remember at least one time that I walked in his office and the dog was on his lap, which sounds normal until I noticed how shocked my dad looked to see me and how he said ""oh he just jumped up"" when it was very clearly too high for my dog to jump.

Now today he messages me about a movie I'm seeing, ""Good Time"" asking ""hey are you seeing good time today?"". I wonder why he's asking so I hop on google and there's a bunch of controversy over an alleged sex act on a dog during filming that happened today. I responded like ""oh you saw the interview"", he said ""yeah it was funny, looks great"". I told him it was a joke and it didn't actually happen and he said ""thank god"" but honestly, he had the interest to ask me about it and now all of a sudden wants to see it even though he had no interest in it before.

55,"Basically, I went to this gym on a free trial. They called me a month later and told me if i addressed the way i dressed that they would love to have me as a member.  I wore clean clotehs.  I wore gym shorts and a clean shirt that ive had for years that was pretty faded.  

I was like that is pretty rude to call me to say that and then expect me to give you money.  The guy called me back several times. and said my behavior is addressable and how he would love to have me.

Then the co owner who i got along with said whats up.. i really loved having you in my class over facebook. Then they got on my linkedin.

So, i wrote  a bad yelp review saying jus tthat.  I went to this place a month ago one time and they blow me up trying to get me to sign up. Then when i pick up the phone, they complain that about the way i dress and say how its addressable. Then spam call me over social medal and my phone when i tell them off.

About two weeks later on Yelp. two profiles that were both created in july and only had activity on July 27, and only reviewed like 2-3 places each. One of which was the gym i gave a bad review to.  Both, trashed me in their reviews. Both sent me nasty ""compliments via yelp"", and both accounts said really nasty things via direct message telling me that i was hideious and i should kill myself.

Maybe, I am reading into that. But, I have a VERY hard time seeing two random people write reviews on teh same day trashing me. and the same two random people were so upset, that they sent me multiple messages filled with really nasty and mean insults.  Like, i feel odds are this was an employee. Agree?

anyways, my friend that i went to the free trial with ran into the gym owner. And the gym owner went on a rant about how he is going to sue me.

Everything that i said in my review happened. I may of said it like an asshole. The only bits i cant prove were said via the phone.  And i feel like if i could get the ip addresses of those fake accounts from yelp or if yelp would confirm that they match the owner, i would be strongly in the clear.

What would you do here?  Is this something the Better Business Bureau could take care of?

60,"TL;DR: A 42 y/o guy befriends my 14 y/o brother on facebook, contacts him, meets up with him at 10pm, and tries to ask my brother to hang out next week.  

Recently one of my brother's friends (also 14) introduced him to someone (42 y/o guy). After talking for two days, the guy asks my brother to call him. According to my brother, they chatted on the phone for about half an hour and then later that night at around 10, he messages my brother and tells him he's ""in the neighborhood"" and would like it if my brother met up with him.  

So being the naive 14 y/o he is, he immediately agrees to meet him. Before my parents could react, he grabs his keys and heads downstairs to ""meet a friend"". Being the worrying mother she is, after about half an hour of this, she calls my brother several times but he doesn't pick up. My mother's a levelheaded person so she didn't immediately run downstairs to see what's up. So after like the fifth missed call, we hear my brother coming up the stairs.  

Mom starts asking him who he was talking to that could be out at this time of night and what they were talking about. With a nasty habit of snapping at people who delve into his business, he tells my mom that it's a friend that his friend introduced him to. Now, at this time she doesn't know that the guy in question is a 42 y/o. So after briefly questioning him, he heads to bed and that's that.  

This morning, (because my mom isn't someone that just lets questions stay unanswered) sits him and asks him to tell her everything that happened last night. After much coercing, he tells her that the guy is 42 and was telling my brother about how his childhood, how he grew up, what he does now, etc. So my mom bluntly asks ""What does this have to do with you then?"" And thinks that the guy is either in a cult or trying to convert my brother somehow. However my brother decides he's not going to answer any more of her questions and leaves.  

Earlier this evening, she decided that he didn't tell her enough information about the guy in question and starts to question him again. As a side note, my mom reads a lot of missing persons cases and things of that nature so she errs on the side of caution. After much beckoning he agrees to allow me to read the conversation between him and the guy in question.  

I scroll up thinking I'll find more messages, but the first conversation they had took place earlier this week on Wednesday. At first glimpse there wasn't anything really ""wrong"" with their conversation, but hearing that this guy is a 42 y/o talking to my brother... that just added to the creepiness. I already thought it was strange that someone his age would be out at 10pm but thought nothing of it because he apparently lives close.  

Anyways, I skim through the messages and get up to the part where the guy in question was asking my brother to attend his birthday barbecue on the 15th. Fortunately, my brother was smart enough to reject this invite but the messages don't stop there. I get to the messages that took place last night. The guy had said to my brother that he was in the neighborhood to meet another boy (presumably my brother's age) and would drop by to meet my brother. Not thinking too much of it, my brother gives the guy our address. The guy gives my brother his cell number and asks my brother to ""give [him] a quick call"". After the call and their meet up, he sends my brother a picture of the friend that introduced them to each other, ""Recognize him? He's sleeping over right now. He's a really horny little boy."" Now I don't know why my brother did not register that as a creepy thing to hear about a 14 y/o from a 42 y/o and he jokingly says ""Yeah with all those weird noises he makes.""  

So my questions are, are me and my parents overreacting? We suspect he's a pedophile, and if he is what should we do? My mom told my brother not to block him yet, but is there something else we can do? Also what's upsetting about this whole matter is that my brother does not see the magnitude of this problem. He doesn't understand why it's not okay for a 42 y/o to befriend him and contact him on facebook.  

I hope someone can answer my questions and offer insight on what my parents and I could/should do.",05Aug2017,69

She just posted some weird new trend where you can anonymously send her a message.  It's some sarahah thing?  I don't keep up with trends, I'm a socially awkward weirdo.

69,"So, the 2nd in command at our crappy little store randomly didn't show up for her shift almost a week ago, and hasn't shown up for any since. Bosswoman tried calling her and texting her. No reply to texts, and apparently the phone has been ""busy"" nonstop. No.2 is really, really not the type of person to just suddenly drop all contact, even if she wanted to quit (and she hasn't seemed upset or mentioned wanting to do so). It's a pretty informal workplace for the most part, and she's on positive terms with everyone, and is in general a pretty logical, normal human being. It's just really out of character for her.

I suggested to Bosswoman to look into her emergency contacts and see about calling them to ask if everything's alright (Bosswoman's original texts even just asked for confirmation that she's okay, regardless of whether she planned on explaining her absence). The only number she gave was, not her husband's, but her teenage son's, which is weird... and it's also the same number we've already been trying to reach her on. The other day, Bosswoman cruised by her address on her way to the bank, and I did the same because I had to go past on my way to the laundromat anyway. I *may* have seen her car, but it could have been another of the same color. We don't know which house is hers, just the street. I saw her husband looking at a hideous, like, matte-black painted car and would have stopped to ask if everything was okay, but I was with my mom.


I know you never really know what's going on in a person's head, so it's totally possible that she has just decided to stop coming in and cut off all contact as a way to quit her job. But we are all concerned because it seems so far from something she would do, and there's still been absolutely no word or anything from her. And honestly, I frequent r/unresolvedmysteries and it's made me paranoid. Suppose she's a genuinely missing person, and this is the part where someone came so close to finding out what happened before it was too late? Like, what if something happened and no one else has noticed? She IS pretty quiet. 

So basically what I'm asking is this: is there anything else we can do that isn't overstepping our boundaries and being super weird? Like, it's definitely jumping the gun to call the cops and ask for them to check on her right? We definitely don't want to be weirdos about it or cross any lines, but we're all super concerned??

72,"Hello

So I'm about to go into my second year of college as an undergrad.

I got back home from college in June, and having been home for 2 months now, I've come to the realization that I am...lonely.

When I was at school, I had a few ""friends"" there. I put quotes around friends because I never really made any close friendships throughout the first year of college.. I talked with them, studied with them, and played video games with them, but I never got their numbers or anything and I've never been big on social media so I've had no way to contact them and idk if they even consider me as their friends, I've always been a sort of ""side"" person, someone who is kinda just there and says a few words occasionally.

Well now that it's been 2 months since I've had a conversation with someone other than my brother, sister, and parents, im starting to go mad. 

All of my high school friends went their own ways, either too busy with work or summer school or they're on vacation. and since I never made any close college friends in college, Im just at home...

I know I could get a job, but I was really stupid and didn't think about that back in June. I've always been a sort of introverted person so once June hit, I just couldn't wait to go home and be alone after being surrounded by different kinds of people for 9 months. But, well, 2 months of being alone is kind of overkill... and I didn't realize that until today.

I think I've also started realizing this after seeing my brother, who is currently in high school, snap chatting his friends all day. And I'm just here on reddit...

It makes me think back and wish I wasn't such a shy fucker and made an instagram and Snapchat like everyone else, maybe then I would have a bunch of people to talk to and not be in this shitty situation.

I don't start school for another month and a half. I never thought I'd say this.. but I actually CANT wait to go to school.

When talking to the front desk prior to getting examined they told me the contact fitting ($75 total for wife and I) and exam was going to be covered by my insurance along with the $130 allowance to use for glasses or contacts. I then asked them if I use the allowance for glasses would the contact lenses fitting still be covered and they replied yes. The only thing they will not cover is the followup appointment for the contact fitting which is $30 each. As we finish up the day, we get glasses covered by the allowance from the insurance and when we check out they charge us $60 for the follow up appointment for next visit. 

One week later we get to the follow up appointment and while checking out they charge us the co-pays plus the $75 contact fitting they initially said would be covered. They're excuse was that it only was covered if we used the allowance towards contacts which is what I would have done had they told me from the beginning.

My mistake was actually paying them the $75 in fear that it would be sent to collections and ruin my credit.

What action could I take? I've already approached them about it but they keep giving me the run around. It is not a lot of money but I feel like I was scammed and mislead.

86,"This past year I joined a major club on my campus. It is pretty exclusive and only takes about a handful of people from a good amount of applicants. I basically signed up because of all the hype my friends made about the club. Anyways, after interviews and applications, I ended up getting in, but my friends didn't make the cut. So far I've gone through all the training (which was paid for), and have been to the meetings and get togethers, but haven't felt fully in love with the club. This club focuses on one of my minor passions, but isn't something I'm a hardcore fan of. However, I feel like I've invested a lot already and understand that I was chosen to be in it for a reason, which I'm thankful for.

I guess what I'm asking is, if I'm not 100% sold on whether I belong with this group, even though I've invested a lot of myself into it already, should I walk away or make the most of the situation? This is a club where in you are a member until you graduate and is a strong, close-knit community, but there is a lot of commitment.

Also on a side note, there is another club on campus that I'm really interested in, and I know I would fully like to invest myself in it because I did something similar in high school. It's something I've definitely been missing in college, and feel that I need to replace that missing feeling, I felt freshman year of college. If I were to join this club, it would somewhat interfere with the current club I'm in, but I'm sure it's possible to be in both clubs.",05Aug2017,1

98,"Throwaway because people know my real Reddit account. 

Just to set some context, I'm 18 and just graduated high school in June. I had this friend since freshmen year who at first was a great guy--he was friendly, loyal, outgoing, and reached out to everyone. But over the years he's slowly just become increasingly obnoxious--here's a list of things he does.

He monopolizes conversations. My other friends and I gently try to tell him about it, but he doesn't seem to listen and keeps cutting into conversations. 

He's a one-upper. If one of us tries to tell a story, he'll come up with something better. 

He also can't not be the center of attention. I went to a Catholic school and there was Mass every week. He would sing really loudly and weirdly (he never sings like this normally) so that everyone would look at him. I didn't really do anything about this until he tried this at a memorial of a friend who just died. This really pissed me off (which is why I'm writing this). 

I think he's a compulsive liar. While he's a pretty friendly guy, he's always making up stories about girls lining up to fuck him, which I suspect isn't true. Also he seems to make up a ton of stories where he's got it slightly worse than we do. For example, we're just talking about a test we got back-- I'd be like ""Damn, I only got a 72% on that last math test."" And he'd be like ""Well, I got a 70% so..."" [when I know he didn't get a 70%]. 

He drifts from conversation to conversation, saying a few words, walking away, and butting into someone else's conversation. 

He always finds reasons to feel slighted--like one time, one of my other friends and I were going to be at the same place at the same time so we decided to get lunch together. It somehow got out on a group chat that we were eating lunch together, and he literally spammed ""What about me??"" like 20 times. 

He also invites himself to events he's not invited to that he finds out about. 

He spams people. I was in a fantasy football league with him and I'd wake up to like 300 notifications about fantasy football trades (that were all bad by the way). 

He makes a show of being overly moral. I completely understand wanting to avoid parties, drinking, or drugs. But he seems to just criticize people really loudly for it, and just makes a big show of being straight-edge. Again, I don't fault him at all for his choices, but you don't have to practically shout ""I'm straight-edge, bro!!"" all the time. 


Also some more petty things: 

I'm a loud person so I totally get this but he practically shouts in restaurants and public places. 

He constantly feels oppressed by society as a straight white upper-middle class person. Things like ""My grandparents were really poor, why doesn't affirmative action work for me??"" Now I don't want to turn this political, but he'd say things like that. 

And finally, suuuuuper petty but he takes both armrests in the movies. 

Again, he's been a good person and friend throughout the years, but I've found myself getting a little annoyed at his behavior recently and was wondering if there's anything I can do. ",05Aug2017,1

111,"While checking out at REI, the cashier asked me if I wanted to become a member and I said sure why not. I gave him all my information to become part of the program, finished the transaction, and then continued on with my day. 


That night I got a text from an unknown number and it was the employee! When I asked how he got my number he said he hoped I didn't mind but he used my phone number from earlier when I signed up to be a member. I told him it was pretty weird but stayed calm and didn't freak out on him. I found this extremely creepy because he knows my name, number and possibly address from the store database. 


The next day, I forced myself to have one more awkward conversation with this boy to tell him I don't want him texting me anymore and mentioned I was going to work and we would finish the conversation later. I (stupidly) named the name of the franchise of fast food restaurant I worked at, but not the specific one so he wouldn't go murder me there or something. Then right before I'm off my shift, guess who walks into the restaurant?


Yeah that dude, and he brought his family? I had to interact with them all because I was working in uniform and can't be rude.

116,"I don't even know where to begin or if there's even only a single problem to fix. I guess I just want to write everything down as well. 

My mum has been married to my dad for 25 years. She went straight from her parents' house to my dad and has been a housewife since she married him. Since we moved to an english-speaking country 12 years ago she's been even more unhappy because her english isn't that good and she struggles living here. 

This unhappiness means that/is caused by her constant fights with my dad. She constantly berates him for things that happened years ago, about how he was a bad dad or a bad husband. She accuses him of cheating, he denies it, and I don't know who to believe - I don't think he was the perfect husband but they came from a tiny european village, it was just a sexist time and he was probably still a bit brainwashed from his incredibly strict parents. Because of this, they fight every week, christmases, birthdays, the whole lot. 

I think because she's alone all day she overthinks and so she twists events so out of proportion that sometimes I question whether she's even sane. And after the twisting she'll start huge arguments with it and when she argues she's so so awful - she's told me that I'm a slut, that I'm stupid etc. etc. and she just says the most horrible things I can't even describe it. Same thing with my dad, he works so hard but she's constantly telling him about how ugly he is, how he's lazy and stupid and not as good as other husbands. She's become so sensitive that we all tiptoe around her. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know how to fix it. She's so unhappy but she doesn't want to work (she got a librarian certificate a few years ago but doesn't want to apply because she doesn't think she'll get accepted), she doesn't want to see friends (she barely has any), she's unhappy in her marriage but doesn't want to get a divorce...

And the thing is I know her life has been shit. She gave up any and all independence to raise us and have a family. She's moved so many times in her life and had to save money and clean and cook all day and I'm so grateful to her for it. But I don't know how to reverse that. I don't know how to undo the past and neither does my dad and so it's just a neverending cycle of anger and hatred and blaming people. 

I know we're not totally faultless either. I've had really bad moodswings throughout my entire teenage years (I'm 20 now and on antidepressants which have helped a little) and have treated my mum like shit plenty of times. I've been ungrateful and awful and I feel so guilty for it. 

But this situation is so toxic, her constantly blaming us for how shit her life is and I literally don't know what to do anymore. She's done so much for us but we can't keep going at this rate. Me and my brother will go to other people's houses for dinners and we'll be amazed at how normal everything is, at how someone can make a mistake and not be yelled at, about how chill everyone is with everything.

I feel confident about our relationship, and I do feel it has a future. 

About a week ago we were finishing up a shower together and as we were drying off she was being super flirty and giggly and basically said ""I love you."" I didn't really say anything for a second because I was honestly really surprised. She was quick to add, ""You know what I mean, I love you as a person. I'm not like in love with you."" And I just I gotcha, and we continued with what we were doing. 

Fast forward a few days, and she's about to leave for work. She comes over to the bed, hugs and kisses me, and then says ""I love ya, see you later."" To which I just kind of smiled and said ""love ya too."" But now another few days after that she's said it numerous times in a few different ways. I haven't said it again because I'm kind of confused about the whole dynamic. Is this ""saying I love you because I love you as a person"" thing an actual thing? Is she in love with me or not? I can honestly say, I feel as though I'm in love with her, and I kind of just think she said the ""as a person"" thing was because she was scared to freak me out or something. But for all I know, this could be a normal dynamic I just have yet to experience until now.

129,"Hi all, this post may come across as 'bad karma'-y and I have my reasons (as everyone does when something tends to not work out for them) so I'll include them for you to consider. It's a little lengthy but I'd really appreciate your time.

Context: I just recently bought a bed. It was from one of those warehouse setups where a guy knows a guy who sells wholesale/bulk mattresses for whatever reason (overstock usually). There's nothing wrong with any of the mattresses, and nothing wrong with the mattress I purchased. The business is not ~sketchy,~ it's on Yelp with mostly great reviews, it has been recommended to me several times from strangers and acquaintances/friends alike prior to landing on them to purchase.

My mattress has a 7 year warranty. I haven't slept on it yet - purchasing a mattress protector today then it's all set.

The thing is - I have extremely chronic pain and fatigue. Especially in my back. I need something incredibly firm. I tested the bed and it felt great and firm then but I obviously didn't have time (days, weeks, months, etc) to see how it holds up.

Advice: I'm wondering what you would hypothetically do if the bed was KILLING your back but nothing was wrong with it. I'm talking a few months in, versus 5 years out of the 7 year warranty. Would you try to cause a warranty issue - like making the bed somehow sag? I know places don't accept returns or refunds when nothing is wrong. Are there even ways to make a mattress seem like it didn't hold up how it should have?

Additional context: Because it's a quick in and out warehouse setup the guy was very brief on my warranty and kind of evaded additional questions I had. He delivered my mattress and said he was in a huge rush (had to deliver ~10 more, visible in his van - both locally and (close by) out of state. I don't think there would be any type of partial refund or any type of flexibility if I called and said it just wasn't working out.
I'm incredibly broke. I'm in my mid 20's currently working entry level retail with less than ideal hours per week. The bed was cheap but I'm definitely in a tight spot now. I've been using a roommates soft guest bed and I wake up every morning so stiff and sore, worried that my muscles are too contracted and my back will go out, putting me out of work. I feel like I'm definitely skewing more towards the 'extreme' side of whatever chronic pain spectrum there is so unfortunately powering through on a mattress that hurts isn't possible for me.

My 67-year-old mother was diagnosed back in April with an aortic aneurysm and dissection with extremely high blood pressure. She finally underwent surgery last week, and has had complications. She had an ischemic stroke from the surgery, so they had to operate again. In the hospital, she became rude and nasty to the staff, calling them stupid, the food is garbage, etc. She was discharged yesterday, but was advised to stay to do physical therapy for a few weeks, otherwise someone would have to be with her 24/7 (she lives alone).

I am a 31-year-old female living with my SO 30 miles away. I have my own life, which has been terribly neglected. I have been resorting to drugs and alcohol to numb the overwhelming pressure I am constantly under. I lost my father two years ago to heart failure and prostate cancer. It's been hell ever since. My mother always relied on him for EVERYTHING. She hasn't even driven in 15 years. When he died, it was like I took over his role of babysitter. She makes me do everything for her; shopping, errands. She called me a month ago and demanded I buy her a pack of cigs and deliver them to her. When I refused, she called me selfish.

My mother is expecting me to give up my life to move back home and take care of her. She's been a 50 year long smoker, and has been smoking even with oxygen hooked up to her. I called 911 a while ago, because she can't breathe and felt like she was dying. She screamed at me for doing so.

This girl was really cool at first, but after 3 days I started seeing really major flaws in her. She got annoying. But he loved her. They hanged out and flirted all the time. Granted, I also flirted with her, but I don't have a girlfriend.

But theirs was clearly going much better. She also, as we learned later, has a boyfriend.

Now I didn't mind him doing this at first. It wasn't really cheating then. 

But we were coming back on a coach, and she was with us. They sat together and fucking... she had her legs across him, his arms were on her lap, they held hands for a long time, hugged, just looked like a couple.

I don't know if this is cheating. It doesn't matter. If his girlfriend knew the extent of it, she would be deeply hurt. And that's were this gets complicated for me.

He is extremely fickle and doesn't have any principles, the ones he does have he can change whenever to get what he wants. He is also extremely stubborn about it and aggressive when I or anyone brings stuff like this up.

Another point is that his girlfriend likes him more than he likes her, clearly. He knows, cos he said, and it's perfectly true, that if she found out then she'd be bothered, but wouldn't actually do anything.

After we got back, he still texts her, and her name is surrounded by heart emojis and shit. 

She is better looking than his current girlfriend and far less prudish, which is no doubt contributing to this. 

It fucking bothers me. Values and principles are very important to me. It's a code a person lives by, it's vital for people to be respectable.

I'm going to talk to him about this, I think. But what should I do, do you think? Talk to his girlfriend? I'd be breaking off my friendship, not to mention she'd probably stay with him anyway. He is taking advantage of that. Talk to him? He's stubborn as hell.

So... what should I do? Advice?",05Aug2017,4

147,"I am a pretty lonely person overall. I have no friends possibly suffer from some kind of social phobia as I feel uncomfortable in large crowds and mostly tend to avoid social interaction. I do have my family but have been feeling increasingly isolated from them.

I know that the ultimate long term solutions include trying therapy (which I already am, although it doesn't seem to be working), forcing myself into social situations, etc, but I am trying to find a more short term way of dealing with it in the meantime.

My usual go to solution in the past has been some form of escapism, whether it be video games, comic books, etc. Online interaction with people on communities such as this one was also an option, Now however it just doesn't work as well as it used to and I occasionally end up feeling lonelier. About two years ago I also tried getting into online dating but due to my fear of rejection I haven't even been able to message anyone; only adding to my loneliness with a new form of it.

So what can I do? What are some more healthy short term ways of dealing with this?",05Aug2017,1

154,"Backstory here: I have a group of friends that I met through smash bros. tournaments at the local game store. Although the store no longer hosts these tournaments, we still get together every friday in one guy's garage and play the game, often doing our own tournaments. 

The guys are almost always drunk and high, but they're the only competitive guys in my town, and I'd have to drive at least an hour away to play with people that are at my skill level. I sometimes drink with them, but don't smoke and I'm there specifically to get better at the game.

One specific guy (ironically the oldest guy in the group) has serious issues. He'll get really mad when I beat everyone there and start threatening me and then passing it off as a joke. A week ago he started shoving me, and this week, after killing himself twice in the game (first match of the night, I didn't even touch him in game), he punches me square in the solar plexus, says its a joke, and then slaps my glasses half off my face. The other guys in the room are super uncomfortable, and say he's a psycho and would jump in to stop him if it went any further, but the owner of the garage didn't bother kicking him out, and just said ""Come on man, don't do that."" Throughout night he continued to say whatever he could to try to get a rise out of me (I'm really good at ignoring it), blowing smoke all over me while playing, and being a general asshole.

This is something that seems to be escalating every week and I worry I'll have to fight him or bring a knife to deter him or something. Best case scenario would be the group completely ostracizes him, but he's been in the group longer than I have. What's the best way to handle this guy? I basically never see him when he's sober, let alone hang out with him 1-on-1. He's basically impossible to reason with, and whether I try to tell him to knock it off, ignore him, or anything else, it just seems to piss him off more.

159,"I am about to get an entry-level job with a hotel doing basic auditing. My BS degree is Organizational Management with an Accounting specialization. Essentially, it is a general management degree, that teaches some accounting principles. I was looking at the career track for this position, and the top positions, of which there are hundreds all around the world within my organization, require an MBA in Accountancy or a Master's in Accounting, AND a CPA.

In order to take the CPA exam, you must have 150 credit hours of college coursework, 36 hours must be accounting related, and 39 hours must be business related. 

My current degree does not give me the accounting I need. Would it be better to get a second Bachelor's before the Master's so I can sit for the CPA? Or would it be better to get the Master's first, and then play catch up to get the CPA?

161,"Unfortunately I live with her because her mom married my dad. At first we became REALLY close, and I became ""friends"" with her friends as well. Well her buddies were not my kind of group; they would ignore me and I felt really unwelcomed, so I distanced myself. We just didn't have anything in common and I thought they were pretty annoying anyways. 

That meant I wouldn't be hanging out with her outside of the house because she's all about her friends. It got worse when I met my SO through her and her boyfriend because SO felt the same way so the both of us would just ignore them and do our own thing. I can't even consider it ignoring because they never talked to us, so we were just there. I feel like she resents our relationship for that. 


Then she has attitude issues and disrespects my dad which none of us appreciate. I've just been learning she's a very odd person? Just someone I really don't want to be around. Like she started her rebellion phase late. I remember having her kind of attitude when I was 14 or 16. I question so many things she's done but I don't know if it's intentional. Before I moved in with my dad he warned me about her. Said she can be manipulative, her mom let her do whatever, don't buy into her sob stories they've heard them a million times etc etc. I brushed it off until now. 
 


I've never had a friend before so I don't know what to do. It's uncomfortable being around her. I know she notices I don't want to be around her as much. 
Basically what do I do? How do I treat the situation? My SO says to talk to her but honestly I am afraid to. She gets pissed at my dad when he tells her to clean up a small mess she made, how is she gonna react to a serious discussion like that?

My mom died 3 1/2 months ago from cancer. My parents were together for 35 years and were happy. My dad has been talking about dating because he's been lonely for the past month and a half. Obviously I feel like this is too soon. I texted him yesterday to see if he wanted to go get dinner with my wife, my son and I and he didn't respond until hours later. Then after responding, he sent another text to me on accident saying he had a great time and hoped they had too. He's sent me texts on accident before. my dad is 60 and isn't very tech savvy.

I texted him back and asked him if he was dating. He said yes. In the text he mentioned the person's name and it was the same as my mom's sister. I asked him if it was my aunt, thinking that it most likely wasn't and just needed to hear from him that it wasn't. he said it was and asked if that was ok. After a long while I responded that I was too stoned (I was not too stoned) to process it and that I'd get back to him tomorrow. He texted that he is very lonely and he hopes I understand.

I'm weirded out by this big time. My aunt is nice and all, but it's too soon for him to date and I'm uncomfortable with it being my aunt. I've never seen my dad and aunt be anything other than family to each other and my parents were happily married. My aunt and my dad both took my mom's death very hard and they may be bonding through their grieving, but this is weird. I don't like it.

169,"I'm a 22 year old medical student (medical school is done straight out of high school where I'm from), and I feel like I may be going about life all wrong.

I was born to a very privileged household, with my parents having made most of their money in entrepreneurial ventures and real estate. I'm thankful for the life I've had, and I'm more or less where I am today because of my parents' full support, nothing else.

I always wanted to study something I was passionate about, and picked medicine because it was a profession built towards helping people. I enjoy my course, I'm good at studying for it, but after having a small taste of the real world, some of my priorities in life have shifted. 

I've come to realise (from the politics of life) that money and influence are necessities if you want to be someone in this world. I wonder if professions like law or finance would take me to the lengths that medicine couldn't. At the same time, I don't want to stop medicine, I enjoy learning the content, and I'm good at clinical skills and practicals. I would still love to make a difference to people's lives. I'm far too old to switch careers at this point, and to be frank, I think it would be more practical to finish my medical degree as Im close to finishing it. 

At the same time, my parents' company is facing a significant downturn, and I feel the pressure to become highly successful so my parents can enjoy a retirement worthy of all the hard work they've done in life. In a way, I feel like all I really wanted was to be similarly/more successful than them so I could make up for all they've done for me, as well as ensure a good life for a future family, if I plan to have one. Joining the company without a degree is out of the question. I definitely want to have control of my own career at a future point in my life, so perhaps getting into real estate or other entrepreneurial ventures after completing my postgraduate training could happen?

So guys, with this in mind, am I going about life the way I should be if I want to achieve the future I want?

170,"Throwaway account, will become more obvious as to why as I start to explain myself, I'm really starting to worry about my health, both physically and mentally, and until I get back to university where there can be more discretion in my life, I don't know how to possibly deal with them.

This is for a number of reasons:
I can't go to a doctor nearby, because he issues I have are more personal, issues that I don't want to and probably never will want to discuss with my parents. Also I work all day weekdays and our doctors office only opens on weekdays, I don't drive myself so there is not much chance going elsewhere for treatment unless I tell my parents for them to drive me.

The issues I'm facing are as follows:
For a while I've been worried about my mental health, I've lost a lot of the drive to do things that I used to have, I don't really enjoy going out as much as I used, I'm really bad around new people which I never used to be and in general I am just feeling tired, depressed and anxious about everything. This probably stems from my job that I can't quit also because I'm saving money for the following year and I'm living pay check to pay check in my overdraft right now.

The second (and probably more severe) issue is that I've found a large lump just above my anus, it's been there for quite a while but I've never been confident enough to seek medical attention, but recently it has become so painful to do simple tasks and even lie down to go to bed at night. Now I know this could be as simple as just asking my parents to take me to the doctors, but I looked up the symptoms I'm facing online, and it sunk within me. Over the last few years I'd experimented a little with anal sex on myself, playing with toys and such, I don't consider myself to be a gay man (if you consider me to be, then so be it, I may be bi, I'm not sure) but I just enjoy how it feels, I've never been attracted to a guy, and this might just be a phase, but the causes directly link to the symptoms, and I've already had closed brushes with my family members, I would never hear the end of it if they found out.

What do I do? I'm in so much pain.",05Aug2017,1

I'm 19 and I come from a really abusive household. My parents had tried to control and ostracize me until I was 18, culminating in them throwing me out with nowhere to go bc I was legally an adult and they couldn't control me anymore.
I'm no longer homeless, but I really really want to get my shit together but I have no guidance or any idea how. 
1) I did not graduate high school. My mom took us out of school under the guise of ""homeschooling"" us, but taught us nothing. She had a friend who was a teacher sign off on everything every year, so she got away with it. 
I think I should get my GED but I don't know how? Also I don't think I can pass the math/science segments, so how can I fix that?
2) My parents liked being in control of where I go and who I'm with, so they didn't allow me to get my driving permit/license. Since I'm over 18 I don't technically need a permit, I can just go straight in and get my license. But how can I learn to drive? I've gotten a few lessons from friends, but no one is committed to teaching me. I obviously don't want to push them, since it isn't their responsibility at all..but I'm not sure what to do?
3) I'd like to go to college, even just a community college, but I can't even afford food some weeks. I don't know anything about financial aid. My parents didn't even go to college so they couldn't even be inadvertently helpful. Advice?
4) I've had to file my taxes on my own for 2 years now. Last year was fine. But I still haven't gotten my refund for this year yet? I obviously did something wrong, but I'm worried about getting in legal trouble or something? What should I do?
5) advice on how to learn to ride the bus in a small town where it's not necessarily set up for easy access like it would be in a city?
6) Any ways to budget, save money, make extra money on the side?? Pls

We were together for almost 2 years until she ended it 2 months ago when the summer began. I wasn't expecting it at all.

She said she still loved me but ended it because she couldn't reciprocate the love I gave her, and thought I deserved better. She wanted me to be with someone who was ready for that. She thought it was best for both of us. I still love her a lot and that's not about to stop anytime soon. 

A few days before we broke up I remember us talking about what our future looks like together and we both agreed that we'll be there for each other no matter what. Throughout our relationship we talked about marriage and kids and committed to everything. I gave her a promise ring, she loved it and had it on all the time. This is why the break up came as a shock to me.

My cousin has a toddler and occasionally visits my grandparents who I live with at the moment, and every time she comes and brings her kid I'm extremely anxious and scared. The toddler is going on two, and I've seen her dozens of times, but I've never once held her or touched her due to this fear. Once i had to sit in a car in the back seat with her beside me in the car seat and i was very uncomfortable. I don't know where this is all coming from, I've never had any bad experiences with babies or small children before OR as a child myself, I'm an only child and I have never had anyone significantly younger than me in my life for an extended period of time. It just feels like this is entirely irrational, but no matter what I do, even so much as forcing myself into the same room as my cousins toddler, I still feel extremely anxious and awkward and nervous. Its not only certain children either, its every single one I've ever come across after the age of 13. 

I still feel protective over the child, as in I live in a very un child friendly home, so I feel compelled to watch the kid to make sure she doesn't get hurt or pick up something dangerous, but I still feel very uncomfortable, and it makes me sad as I might want kids of my own someday.

I have a friend whom I think about more often than other friends. It bothers me that I think about her more often or want to tell her stuff more often than other friends. I get a little yealous if she meets up with other friends or posts stuff about how much she likes other people. It's not an extreme feeling, I just feel a bit insecure because I want her to like me that much as well, which I know she does but can't help feeling that way. Also sometimes when she's being nonchalant (cause sometimes she can be a bit superficial) while i'm being emotional I can get a bit needy fe if she's being nonchalant about coming over I tell her she shouldnt cause I want her to be excited about coming over. Again this happens when I'm being emotional and I realise it's stupid. I really like her and I think she has so much potential, I so want her to succeed in life, find a boyfriend who treats her well and believe in herself more and I hope she can love me in an equal way because I want her to be part of my life and I know she does too. We have very honest conversations and our friendship gets very emotional at times and it feels different with her (because I get yealous more easily and because I think about her more) than with other friends.

When I talk to girls they seem to laugh at the funny stuff I say, and smile at me and I always think they like me but I ask them to hang out and stuff and they don't really give me a answer.
I mean I'm not that attractive. I'm around average so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. 
This is one of the reasons why in school no girls talk to me. Apperantly someone told most of the girls I get attached easily...

186,"So I recently landed a job about 3.5 months ago that I've been working towards for about 2.5 years now. I moved halfway across the country and finally interviewed and landed the job. 
My old job paid what I would consider a mediocre salary of about  $43,000 with the potential to over time maybe get up towards 55-65k, while my new job a sales job has a base salary of 30k and a potential to make well over 100k within a year or two.
While I could make my own hours and had about a week more vacation time at my old job, the income potential and medical coverage of the new job are definitely more appealing. 

My biggest issue is that I already feel like my new job has taken away from some of the things my wife and I love to do in life. I have goals in life and have things I'd like to be able to purchase at some point and with my new job I can make plenty of money to be able to obtain those items but I'm struggling between how much money actually means to me and my family compared to having a bit more freedom with my old job along with obviously a lower salary.

Is there anybody out there who has given up a better paying job and taken a bit of a pay cut so that you had more time with family and doing the things you love? If so, do you regret not pushing yourself to succeed in a career or are you a lot happier being that you spend more time with family even if that means less money to buy extravagant items?",05Aug2017,1
188,"I don't know who am I anymore. I feel like I am just waiting for the time to pass until something interesting comes the way. I believe it all started when I was 18-19 and I realized that I am always seeking for attention and decided to act like the quite guy in the room and let attention come to me. Needless to say I did not work I just became more shut to my friends and with the occasional outburst.

Fast forward 2 years, I decided to move to Germany to live with my relatives (the idea and decision were made with a snap of the fingers). The whole point was to setup a nice life for me there finally get into university and have an amazing life, needless to say I failed and came back after year and half and did not even learn German.

And now I am lost, full with self doubt, can't handle criticism from people who are judging me,  constantly day dreaming, wasting my time, impatient, can't focus, having panic attacks, don't know how handle people and much more.

The only good things people know about myself are that i go to the gym, I cook, that I have a job and that people thing I am positive until they get to know me better. But I am mediocre with those things.

The only real good think I know I always get to stand up after failing and trying one more time, but at this point I need to try something different.

Any tips, advises or whatever is welcome at this point.

PS. I do NOT think about killing myself, because if I do it it will be just to get a reaction from the people around me, which is pathetic.

190,"Hi to all those who read this. So basically, I'm a Belgian soccer fan and I'm trying to arrange a meet & greet with Dries Mertens. As most of you already know, he's currently a Napoli soccer/football player and a Belgian Red Devil. A dear friend of mine has been a fan of him for years but never had the time nor the means to talk to him. She hates the idea of standing in line for an hour or more just to see him 10 seconds and then immediately being escorted out so the other 642 people behind her in line can get their 'chance'. However, I've never been a strategic mastermind on how to achieve a meet & greet with a famous person, I'll admit that. It doesn't need to be much: 2 min is more than enough, but I just have no idea on how I can make this happen.

So basically, I was hoping someone could give me a helpful idea or in the best scenario get me in contact with someone who would be capable of fulfilling her dream. 

It can't hurt to try. Wouldn't be the first time Reddit made a dream come true :) thank you in advance to all those taking the time to comment.",05Aug2017,2
191,"**TL;DR at bottom**

Hey,

So I generally prescribe to the belief that violence and or aggression aren't the solution to 99% of interpersonal problems. 

But last night I was at a bar with some friends, 2 of which I don't get along with- so I just minimize interaction with them. 

Any way they and three others were going to a different bar. Lets call this group **A** I asked where **A** was going and whether they mind If I tag along. They all seemed to not mind. ( I wanted to switch bars because the one we were at didn't accept credit cards)

I told **A** that group **B** about 6 of our other friends were getting more drinks.

Out of the blue the two girls from group **A** *ordered* me to go tell group **B** to stop. Over and over then some random man with his wife said ""Go do it!"" I hesitated looked back and said ""No.""

But I was pissed because it was wrong of them to order me around and was an intentional humiliation. Bosses order people around but peers shouldn't order peers around.

If they weren't girls I would've gotten physically confrontational. I'm 6'2 strong and believe I can hold my own in fights.

But since they're women what would've been the appropriate response? ""You go do it"" or ""Fuck off, do it yourself bitch."" comes to mind, but I was caught completely off guard.. 

**TL;DR:** 

* What do you do/say when women challenge your authority or are rude to you? 

* When is physical aggression and or violence appropriate.

I have had 2 packages stolen from my front porch in the past two months. Both had tracking numbers and confirmed delivery to my front door, which I verified with the post master at my local post office. 

I live in an apartment complex and my door is around the back of the building facing a forest. Its relatively secluded. I only ever see a few neighbors that I share a porch/walkway with, with whom I have always believed to be on friendly terms. 

Today, I was just about to hop in the shower when i heard the mail truck in the parking lot, and my phone buzzed with the delivery confirmation few minutes later. By the time I dried off got dressed and went downstairs, the package disappeared. In broad daylight, on a saturday afternoon. No where to be found. Confirmed with the post office it dropped at my front door, and then promptly filed yet another police report (I filed one the first time this happened, too). 

The cops said they cant do anything without proof. They suggested a trail cam. I'm open to that idea, but I don't want to totally invade the privacy of any innocent neighbors I share the porch with, every single time they come or go. Possibly a trail cam with no flash..? Is that even a thing?

199,"BACKGROUND:
I'm 30 and I work in the marketing department of a well-respected professional, regional theatre company doing design and video. The theatre works in Rep, so they stage shows May - October. My job is currently a 6 month contract but they have asked me to come on full time, year round, for a salary that is 5-6k below what I believe to be market value for my skills, job responsibilities and quality of work I'm putting out for this area. They've raised their initial but are not able to go any higher. I'm also not sure I want to do this job year round and give up on some of my other aspirations. 

EDUCATION:
I left a BFA - Theatre Acting program back in 2007, after completing the first semester of my junior year. Performing is my true passion, and I've worked professionally as an actor in smaller regional theaters since leaving. Seeking more stability and income between jobs, I started to learn graphic design and video production which led me into this job. Fast forward to now, and I'm about to finish an Associates in Graphic Design and Video Production from a tech school in December '17, and have enrolled, but not yet started classes at a 4 year university to finish my undergraduate degree by May '18. I'm receiving talent scholarships, and other scholarships and they're only requiring me to take the minimum 32 credits to receive my BFA degree at a cost of about $13k. This amount doesn't seem like a lot, but I'm still paying for the undergrad that I left, and while not impossible, it will be a bit of a strain. 

EMPLOYER:
My employer is on board and is extending my contract to do part-time work during the school year before returning to full-time next season. At the end next season we will have a final conversation about me coming on full-time thereafter, which would mean benefits and 401k. But I'm not sure that's what I want. They could be open to me staying seasonal, but that wouldn't include benefits, and the pay scale would be a bit lower. 

DIFFICULTIES:
The reason I've posted here for advice from all of you:
-I don't feel finishing my Undergraduate degree will do much for me career-wise in the short to medium term other than Grad School or Teaching options. My design and marketing work/ portfolio is more important for landing jobs and I'm confident I could secure employment doing similar things in other markets. 
-Long-term I want to produce, direct and move toward a career as an artistic director. Having a BFA could, but may not, help with securing a position doing that. 
-It's a personal goal to finish as it's always been nagging me in the back of my mind, but really, any good actor is self-aware and the main reason for returning to school is to improve some of my weaknesses. Unfortunately, most of the classes I need to take for the 32 required credits are Gen Eds; leaving little time in my schedule for the things I really want to work on. If I don't go back to school I could take private lessons for these things and spend less money and time doing so, but wouldn't end up with a degree.
-My long-term gf (soon to be fiancé) lives about 800 miles away, and we've been doing long distance for several months. It's difficult and we both want to be nearer to each other, but understand being apart is beneficial for us financially and career-wise at the moment. She wouldn't be able to re-locate due to her job and I'm seriously considering moving there. I wouldn't find the same opportunity there to complete the degree in such a short timeframe, as I've looked into it. She also comes from a culture (south asian) where degrees are very important. She has a masters, and I will only have an associates and I worry about the views and feelings of her parents and family, regardless of whether I can provide for us.

CONCERNS/ THOUGHTS:
I'm worried that if I don't finish the degree now, I will never finish it. I'm getting older, and this may be the best opportunity I have to complete it before life gets in the way. One side of me says take a year, focus in and just get the damn thing done. I can pay it off over several years and it won't be a huge burden. 

The other side of me says, don't waste the time and money on a degree that doesn't seem like it will really advance my career. Instead spend money on the private lessons while finishing my associates and in January move to be with my fiancé and find work there.

Regardless of which option I pick, in an ideal world I would perform November - April and return to my current job May - October, every year for the next 3-5 years. This would allow me to build my resume and portfolio while still allowing time for my other passions. I believe my employer would be on board with this as well from the discussions we've had but it means no benefits or 401k.

I'm torn. Give it to me straight. What do you all think I should do?

My problem is that I'm afraid of thunderstorms. Seems like a typical phobia, rather a common one, but that's a bit different fear.

If I'm woken up by a thunderstorm I instantly burst into a little panic attack. My heart is pounding as if it's going to leave my chest; I feel cold sweat streaming down my back. I cannot put my mind at ease. Of course I turn on all the lights, usually start to watch something on YouTube and try NOT to think about the weather outside, but it doesn't work. Neither does listening to music. I still feel very uncomfortable and I can't even explain it. I'm not afraid of anything specific, I feel safe in my cosy room, but in spite of this I am so trembling and all shook up. I maniacally check weather forecast, I begin to hate summer nights, and must say that summer is probably my favourite season in general. What can I do?

212,"Probably not the *best* place to ask this, so if anyone has any other subreddit suggestions, I'll take them. Throwaway because my only other Reddit account is a novelty account that hasn't been posted on since about October.


I decided to go on a walk today. I'm visiting my childhood home and my parents for the week, so I figured I could hit up some of my old haunts. Up the street a piece lives a middle-aged woman with four kids, two grown and two younger. She has a horde of stray cats she feeds that live in her driveway and under her deck. 


I walk past this house. No one's home, but I started getting absolutely swarmed by little calico kittens. My mother has a decent relationship with this woman (we used to drive her kids to school) and I can't bear to leave these kittens on the road to get hit by a car, so I give them a few pats and try to pick them up and put them closer to the house in order to get them back to safety. After about five minutes of this (there were four of them and two kept running back after me wailing for attention whenever I tried to leave,) I hear this sad little meow. And then another. It sort of forms into a string of them after a while. 


Thinking that one of the cats might be in distress, I trace the cries up onto the woman's deck. Now, there'd been this really, really atrocious smell, but I'd assumed up to this point that it'd been coming from the junk piled up in this woman's yard, or the ambiguous pile of mud/manure piled up on her pavement. Turns out it wasn't either of those, because when I climbed those steps, the smell fucking knocked me over sideways, literally. These are pretty steep stairs, and I'm not wearing shoes with the best fit, so I almost fall, but I manage to right myself and see this:

http://imgur.com/a/OvjeG


I'm not sure how long the cats have been locked up, and they don't seem sick/injured, but the smell up there implies they've been left to sit in their shit/piss for at least a day or so, that they have a third cat who's dead and decomposing in the back, or maybe both. Poking around up there left my hands *coated* in greasy mud and probably in cat shit, too. I decided to leave them there since I didn't know the full story and I was basically trespassing at that point, so I managed to dump the kittens off on a tortoiseshell and white cat I assumed was their mother from the growls she'd been giving me and stumbled back home. 


Locking your cats up for a while is okay in certain situations, but it's absolutely filthy, and it seems like they've just been left there to starve/dehydrate/have their pelts rot off in piles of their own filth. I'm thinking about coming back up in the middle of the night and seeing if the cats are still there.

214,"I'm a girl and I have this coworker who is a guy (let's call him Y)

Just so that we are clear- Y and I both are happily married to different people and have no feelings towards one another whatsoever. 

We have been cordial towards one another always. We get along as well as two people who work together should. 

So- Y has been going through a tough time at work as he was the center of attention for a few months and suddenly the spotlight has been taken off of him. And he's finding it very hard to cope with that. 

He's obviously overreacting. It isn't as dire as he's making it seem but I can understand how he must be perceiving the situation. 

Due to the way he's been handling the situation he's been shunned from the whole team and no one really wants to talk to him as he either complains endlessly or is an absolute bore to talk to. 

So this is where I come in. As I mentioned before I've been cordial with him and whenever he has asked me for advice in the past, I've given it without much drama. 

Now that he isn't comfortable talking to other members of the team, he keeps stopping by my desk to talk to me with increasing frequency. The problem is - if it's work related I'm more than happy to talk. 

But his visits are not work related. He's constantly complaining about others and how he's feeling horrible and how the whole world has turned against him. It's endless rants and I'm fed up of it.  I've tried to be very patient. I've tried to make him see the situation from other view points. But none of that seems to matter. Every single day it's the same recycled idiotic conversations over and over again and I'm absolutely at my wits end with it. 

Recently it got really uncomfortable when he tried to suggest that we should grab lunch together. I knew if I went to lunch with him it would be nothing about complains so I declined politely. 

Instead of leaving it there he kept pestering me asking me if I was going to stave till the evening, when I said ""No, I'll grab lunch later"" he said ""Well let me know when you're going. I'll come with you"". That just drove me up the walls. I think he FINALLY sensed that I did not want to go get lunch with him and he said ""Well if you want to go on your own, I won't come with you. Else let me know I'll come"". I said fine and just left to go get lunch on my own. 

I do not want to hang out with him. He's a bore. We have very few things in common. I don't like his outlook and life and how negative he is in general. I'm happy to be there to help out with work but I do not want to get involved with things he's going through with his life. 

How do I make him understand that I'm not interested in expanding our work relationship into a friendship and that disturbing me while I'm trying to work (regarding things we spoke about just the day before) is not okay?

218,"I am seeking some advice about how to help my roommate.

We are both in grad school and have been living together since 2014. But in the last year I have noticed some change in his behavior and think he might be suffering from depression/burn out.

Let me first add that I admire his work ethic. He is the type of person who will be in lab at 9am but not come back until 12 am.

Lately he has completely given up on hygiene (except showering and brushing his teeth) and doing his part to keep our house in order. He looks like he hasn't gotten a haircut in months. The times I had to step into his room to turn off his alarm after he had left, I found his room in disarray. 

Just to see how he was living on his own (and this was sneaky, I know...) I came home after 3 weeks of time off, without letting him know what day and time I would return. The house was in complete disarray, with all his stuff scattered around the kitchen and living room. The bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned for months, and our sink was piled with dishes.

Understanding that he might be spending a lot of time in lab and needed some help, I did the task of cleaning up the whole house despite fighting jetlag after my 18 hour flight. After cleaning counters, mopping, and scrubbing the whole bathroom, he said ""thanks"" for cleaning the toilet (as if that was the only problem, but yeah it was really gross).

When you live with someone, you really get to know their habits. Usually he spends a lot of time in his room, but now he tends to camp out in the living room with his laptop and the TV. His meals consist of microwaveables, spaghetti, and he often skips breakfast. One time he cooked spaghetti and put leftovers in the fridge for over three weeks. As one would expect it got moldy, like many of the foods he left in the fridge and probably forgot about. 

The other night I woke up early because of my jet lag and found that he had left an unopened carton of juice on the counter without opening it, and had gone to bed (I put it back). Just now I walked into the bathroom and found the floor all wet around the toilet, with his glasses placed on top of it away from the toilet bowl (who forgets their glasses on the toilet bowl after showering?). These cases of absent-mindedness are not isolated cases, especially given his tendency to leave stuff lying around for weeks at a time. It has become a lot more frequent these past few months.

Last (and perhaps the most troublesome), a few days ago my roommate asked me if it was okay for us to housesit his friend's cat for a week. Being an animal lover I agreed and thought it would be a good way for my roommate and I to bond. However, this morning he texted me to ask if I could take care of the cat from Thursday to Saturday because he had ""forgotten"" that he had a wedding to attend those days.

I became livid. Part of me wanted to say yes: to once again clean up after the messes he made and to compensate for his inability to keep our house in order. But I realized by picking up after him, I would only be enabling irresponsible behavior (this is a guy who got so caught up with talking with a professor that he ""forgot"" he was supposed to drive me to the airport, almost causing me to miss my flight!). Given my allergies and inexperience with cats, I gave up a gentle but firm ""no."" He decided that his friend would have to find someone else to care for the cat.

I feel guilty for having feelings of anger because of the cat episode, among other tasks I do to make our living space more comfortable. But I also cannot shake the feeling that our relationship is becoming toxic, especially since he is very isolated, withdrawn and does not ask for help (I personally find counseling therapy to be very helpful to cope with the stress of grad school).

There has to be plenty of others who have been in a similar situation, I would love to hear from you guys. Any feedback is appreciated!",05Aug2017,4
228,"My partner and I are having an argument over whether a $3,000 to $5,000 investment on replacing worn down, non-locking chainlink driveway gate without a pedestrian access with a wrought iron automatic gate with a pedestrian gate will increase our property value. One of us is of the belief that the curb appeal would be greatly improved and initial perceptions of the property may be much higher after a gate renovation. One of us believes that the chain link fence is fine and investing $3,000 to $5,000 will only reap a return of about $100 on resale. Are there any realtors or home appraisers who could comment on possible pros/cons to making the upgrade? I have photos but I cannot attach them here.

229,"I feel discomfort and some pain  in my lower back doing any core exercises like crunches, curl ups, plank, and starfish. It isn't so painful that i have to stop immediately but i can will myself through it if i have to--for example, when i was in high school i needed like 30 something curl ups to pass some fitness test.

Like i can do a set of like 10 reps easily, but at around the 7th or 8th the discomfort starts. If i keep going on with more reps and sets, i have some trouble getting up when i'm done and discomfort standing up straight. I worked with a trainer, he told me i have a weak lower back but didn't tell me what exercises would help. Tbh, i didn't really bother asking as i wasn't going to focus on my abs/back but to gain strength in my arms and legs. But this is an issue i've had since at least high school with core exercises.

What can i do?

Also, most exercises i've done have more of an effect on my upper arms, yet my forearms barely get any tension, what exercises focus in forearms? thank you",05Aug2017,1
230,"hi. sorry if this is hard to sparse but its difficult to write when you're not naming names and trying to offer as little identifiable info as possible. like the title said, it's long.

about me: mid 20s, come from abusive/neglectful family, have never been to college, can't drive, multiple mental disorders and illnesses, basically had an extremely messed up life that i haven't had much luck in trying to fix, despite my efforts.

the situation:

I moved out of my aunt and uncle's in 2015 after saving up about 5000 dollars from my job. I wasn't quite ready but my welcome had been wearing thin after about 8 years, among other issues.

The original plan was to move in with my sister for a few months, then move in with either my friends in one state or my friends in Washington state, after visiting both to see which one would work. this plan fell through for a few reasons (my sister was a hoarder in a very disgusting house so I had to move out with yet ANOTHER friend asap, the first state i visited didn't work out, and i never got to visit Washington.) Basically, all my plans fell through.

Then for about 2 years I'm stuck at my one friends house with their family. They didn't ask for rent which was good but all my money went to food and other necessities/emergencies. I couldn't get a job because I had no idea when I'd have to drop it and move out. Of course, I ran out of cash by the time I could move out. I spent the last of my savings on moving.

see, my Washington friend originally offered to let me move in in 2015, but then we kind of fell out of contact for 2 years? or at least didn't talk as much. Natural growing apart as people, it happens. So I had to start looking elsewhere to move, since I felt like we weren't really friends anymore. This didn't work out so out of desperation I just went back and asked them if I could move in, which they said yes, but I get the feeling they didn't really want me to move in with them and were just being nice or felt obligated to do it.

So now I'm living with them and here's the current situation:

1. I have NO money. the 5000K i planned to use as a cushion while I look for a job is completely gone.

2. rent is 450 a month (per person). If I'd known this I might not have moved in. Admittedly, I should've asked first, but my friend also never mentioned it, so we're both kind of at fault.

3. there's a third person living with us, who does not know my financial situation and expects me to pay the 450 a month. my friend (who is their niece) doesn't seem to have told them, which I thought she would have. I haven't had a chance to discuss it with them yet.

4. they both went on vacation for 2 - 3 weeks this month, and I need their help in getting a job etc, so I haven't been able to actually look for a job. I also already lost my apartment key so I can't leave the apartment for long. My phone has also been shut off due to lack of funds.

5. This is my first time living out of my home state, and the first time I'll be expected to use public transport, which is stressful and confusing in an already stressful and confusing situation. I also have no money for it.

6. overall the vibe at the apartment is they're super buddy-buddy but seem to have minimal interest in me, and when I do try to talk to them it tends to be awkward and stilted. Definitely don't feel super welcome. Also, we're all pretty different people with very different lifestyles and interests. I've been here about a month and a half or two months now, and the vibe has pretty much been the same.

**TLDR: Moving in with people you never met isn't a good idea, I have no money, haven't been able to get a job, I don't think my roommates actually like me at all, what should i do? should i look for a way to move out?** Admittedly, I'm really run down and depressed that nothing I do ever seems to work out and I don't know how much longer i can keep this up.

Please don't give me advice to the tune of 'well you should be more independent and not rely on these people so much' because I *know* that; I don't want to be a leech like I am right now, it's completely degrading, but just telling me what I already know won't help. (sorry if this seems mean but I've had people be very rude to me when reaching out for advice before on reddit)

I'm in charge of reviewing his work nowadays but last week he told me that he was given some new tasks and doesn't think he can get everything done in time. I'm talking to some other people on our team to see how we can lighten up his workload and my manager overhears us. He later privately tells me that I need to be tougher and wants to train me to lead more. He says that I should've pushed back and told the coworker that it's do-able.

The two sets of teeth are 19 1/2 inches apart, and where I want to hang it has no studs that are 19 1/2 inches apart. I decided to go with drywall anchors.

Also, command strips (which would probably work otherwise), will not reach out past the frame to grip onto the wall. I need help. I estimate that this picture is like 15 pounds. HELP ME PLEASE!

241,"Honestly need to hear if someone else is like this and how they handle it. (*the high part comes at the end*)

I feel emotions very strongly on my body and parts of my mind. I feel like it might be hormones, but I'm not sure. Btw I'm a girl, but this is not about pms and periods. 

Luckily I'm pretty self aware, therefore I don't let these feelings/effects influence my actions and how I treat people. Most people think I'm VERY chill when it comes to emotions, but that is cause I have to distance myself from them.

When I'm get let down/ i get sad I feel my chest get heavy and hurt, and I mean HEAVY, like it HURTS. More psychically than emotionally, it's mainly the frustration of feeling this pain that makes me sad, not the incident. At this point i detach myself from my feelings to stop the pain.

When I get exited I can feel my stomach lining flushing with blood. Before I feel the emotion. Stuff that trigger this can be as little as a text from someone I care about, both romantic and or platonically, and they can literally just be talking about some random bs. At this point I also detach myself, because what normal person gets excited by that.

*Then the high part*

When I get happy, for instance when I'm with my friends at a party, I literally get high of emotions. I feel my whole body tingle, i feel warm, giggly, I stumbled over my words,like I'm drunk and I say weird shit. Without drinking or taking anything. In retrospect I look at situations like this as if I was drunk, wondering why I said those things. This is the only time I don't distance myself from feelings, cause it's mostly not destructive. And I honestly feel like i don't need to drink or take drugs. Also afterwards it feels like I'm having a hangover. And it's not like I'm tired for staying up late or needing alone time, I'm like exhausted mentally.

I feel like I might be hyper sensitive to endorphins or lack there of.

243,"I've been trying to be better at communication with my family. I had a conversation with my parents trying to get them to understand me as a person and the fact that sometimes I don't want to be teased, that I need understanding and compassion. I'm an extremely emotional and sensitive person but I don't see that as a bad thing. I just whole heartedly wanted them to understand me and they wouldn't listen they kept interrupting and rolling there eyes and being sarcastic as I poured my heart out to them, almost begging for their support as I am going through some rough times. They kept saying I wasn't understanding them and that I need to listen to them. I am listening. They don't want to be wrong or change at all. It's so frustrating and so sad to me. I'm missing the compassion and understanding that you should be getting from your parents. My sister recently took their side on the issue too. 

Here's a little background: I'll be the first to admit that I haven't always been the best kid (I'm 20 now). I used to throw fits when I was little because I had so much emotion and I was never taught what to do with it so it manifested into anger. I used to talk back and complain about doing the dishes (what teenager doesn't). I can admit to myself and my parents that I've been difficult but I can honestly say I've been working really hard on myself these days and when I have an argument with them, I know I am being way more calm and mature. But they don't see that at all.


I don't want to have a bad relationship with my family, we're really close. Maybe it is all my fault like they're saying. What am I doing wrong? I don't want to hide myself from them and only be the person they want me to be. I want to be myself and for them to understand that. Help!!",05Aug2017,1

I also have fear of rejection, like, if I asked her out on a date and she laughed at me or something I would insta-quit that place and never come back. 

I'm looking for some really sly ways of finding out if she is interested or if there's a chance. 

I usually wait till it's to the point of ""I like you, let's date,"" because I'm also terrible at reading signals lol. I'm bad at all of this.

Advice?

Edit: Finally balled down and asked her out for something simple like lunch, and she showed interest immediately. Got stuck at work today, but ending going out for a nice evening at a nice restaurant and a comedy club afterwards. 

It sucks to feel the way I did before I actually asked her out, like the pacing back and forth and the stress and anxiety of not knowing or wondering if she likes me or not.

245,"  Heya, so just about to go into my last year of high-school, and have been urged to take a gap year with a program and be abroad. Okay, that's great, definitely a better alternative to studying full-time with no direction, which is my other option, but what do I do from here?

249,"Since i was rougly 13 y/o i have been having suicidal thoughts and feel sad for a majority of the time. I never thought too much about it and assumed everybody must feel this way. I mean i wasn't constantly unhappy, i often would feel normal when i was busy. But whenever i had time for myself. Whenever i have or had a moment to do nothing, i instantly seem to feel sad without apparent reason. I know myself and i would probably never really commit suicide since giving in to those thoughts as long as i believe to hurt somebody by doing it. 

I will just honestly say what could give me those feelings, but i might be wrong. I was bullied before i was 13 years old, which basically really shut me down. I didn't really talk anymore. Was careful what i said. Afraid to say something somebody might take the wrong way. 

Since then these feelings have been there luring whenever i had nothing to do. Never really letting me be happy. Most of the times wanting to be dead without dying. When i was 16 i seemed to be making some progress. I started talking a bit more. 

Unfortunately my best friend got cancer a bit later and i fell back. Shut down. Not saying a lot and feeling sadder then i had ever before. A bit over a year ago, he passed away.  Giving me a lot to process, but honestly also freedom of mind to not think about how he was suffering anymore. 

The beginning was rough and shut me down further then i was before. Luckily i met this amazing girl which really helped me ope up. I never really trusted my friends, but she was the first who i dared to open up to. Ater that i met some mutual friends who i can be honest and open to as well. And now i have had 1 amazing week in which i didn't feel that sad.

However i just fell back. Feeling alone and sad without real reason to. Not thinking about anything but just still being sad. This carefree week really showed me how much i am actually affected by it. I want to get rid of it. In my mind it is probably either some form of depression or something to do with loneliness. Should i go to the doctor to talk about it?

However, whenever we talked, we would get very close and stop talking to one another for a couple months for religious reasons (we're both very conservative). After 3-4 times of this happening, I got tired and just proposed to her. She said she's not thinking about marriage for another few years but she started acting strange and gave me her snapchat (only her female relatives and very very close friends know her Snapchat). Within a week, we were strangers again. I tried contacting her again a month later but she got really pissed and blocked her to one-up her. She sends a friend to message me saying to unblock her and I did. The girl says that we can't leave on bad terms and I tell her its impossible because I can't stop so we block each other.

Fast forward a month, there's an art festival planned for the weekend so I tell a married female friend of mine to message the girl (big fan of art and local artists). She does but the girl messages me saying I broke her trust and rants about strangers should not have her sc. I apologized and asked in what way she prefers me to contact her in case something cool comes up again. She says not to ever again and if I did, I'll be speaking with her dad. I get pissed and say I wish I never met her since my love for her is a curse that distracts me all the time. I told her I'm thinking of leaving the state for graduate school just so I stop thinking about her. I blocked her.

257,"Today, I guess, is my first day sober. I’ve been smoking weed pretty much daily for the past six years. I’ve talked about quitting off and on since I started. The positives and the negatives push and pull my opinion. I don’t want to quit. I want to quit. I use weed as a crutch. It numbs my emotions. It makes my anger slip away, so I giggle instead. My use of marijuana started that way, but I have many other reasons now. Most of all, it helps with my headaches and neck pain. I have migraines, tension headaches, and cluster headaches. For the past few years I’ve had neck pain that radiates up and down, giving me headaches, and making it nearly impossible to get work done efficiently. The pain started in my left shoulder way back in community college, five years ago, I think from repetitive office work. My shoulder always felt pinched and distracted me from work. Now, my shoulder hardly bothers me like it used to, but the left side of my neck is always hurting. Also the left side of my face...my left nostril, my sinuses, my eyebrow, behind my eye, my forehead, all around my ear. I rub and rub and apply tiger balm and salonpos and hot packs and cold packs. I wear a neck pillow and I have two kinds of neck massagers. My boyfriend massages me. I saw a chiropractor for several months, but it didn’t help and I went broke trying to keep up with the payments.
A vicious cycle began. See, ever since I started grad school, I’ve felt a lot more mature and in control, and ready, just for my whole life ahead of me. This is the time in my life where it makes total sense to drop my habit. I wake up and my head is pounding, my neck is in knots; it is impossible to get work done, I am too distracted by the pain. This kind of pain is particularly difficult when I'm reading and writing, which is my life, my job, my school...everything I love is reading and writing. So, I smoke weed. My pain goes away, but I am distracted in a different way. I am high. Being high at 23, having smoked for six years, is much different from being high at 17. I become paranoid. I don’t want to make the neighbors mad, I don’t want the landlady to kick me out. My heartbeat goes up. My anxiety is exacerbated. I want to quit. 
I’m at a crossroads. I went to a University psychiatrist last week about my depression and anxiety medication (my PCP just moved out of state- he’d been giving me anti-depressants and xanax for the past two years). I decided to be completely honest, and told him that I smoke once or twice a day. He told me he would prescribe me xanax only if I quit smoking weed. He said I will be drug tested. Now, I am riddled with anxiety. I’m desperately caught between quitting and not quitting. Xanax or weed. I hate how xanax has nasty side effects after long-term use, but I definitely don’t abuse it, and it helps me live my life normally. I’d like to live my life clear headed for once, even if just to see how my perspective changes without it. Part of me hates this doctor for making me choose, and regrets telling the truth, but I know he just wants me to be able to function in grad school. 
I woke up today and my neck and head were pounding. I’ve been keeping myself busy with some yoga, TV, reading, emails, etc., but I have to take breaks because of the pain. I keep thinking about my bowl. I’ve resisted all day. I’m planning on throwing out my pieces and the little bit of weed I have left, but having a hard time parting with it. Halp.
