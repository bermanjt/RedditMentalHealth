0,"My mother is 62 and my sister is 32. My mother lives on disability and volunteers at the local hospital. My sister is an unemployed mother of 2 (barely a mother, leaves the kids age 1 and 5 alone and never takes care of them) to describe her would be a disgusting person, barely showers, stays stoned all the time, eats constantly, stays in bed, she steals and lies. A STRAIGHT UP LOW LIFE!

she lives with my mom. my mom let my sister move back in after she was evicted from her home. (For completely condemning it with cat shits and trash) she's doing the same thing to my moms house, i cant even visit because the smell is unbearable.

things have been escalating. she doesn't pay rent and is destroying the home i grew up in. she constantly tells my mom she is a bitch and she wishes she would die, says my mom needs to be admitted to a mental hospital, and all of the other horrible standard things that a human should not say to another. It is to the point where my mom is ready to evict her.

my mom let her know that she was filing for eviction (i told her not to let her know, my sister is a VERY retaliatory person, slashes tires, breaks windows, steals) but now my sister said this - ""If you evict me I will have nothing to lose and I will Kill you""

we know that she is serious because she is that bad of a person. My Mom's scared, I'm scared. we don't know what to do.
Note that my mom is to poor to move out of her house and has bad credit from a bankruptcy. she has no where to run to and the police in the area do NOT care. (poor area of Saint Louis)

any and all advice is welcome!",28Sep2017,28

3,"Hello everyone,
I am a freshman in college really struggling to find something that interests me. I have been to several career fairs and attended career centers which have guided me to take test that have given me results that I don't agree with. So far the only classes that I have deeply enjoyed are my religion classes. Unfortunately, I do not think that a degree in Religious Studies will point me in any direction career wise and would just leave me with a useless degree and a pile of debt.
Has anyone else been in this situation? If so, what is some advice to finding something that I will enjoy.
Thanks.",28Sep2017,1
4,"I want to do clinical psych and eventually work back in academia. Ideally I'd be conducting research and teaching college level psychology eventually. I'm 24 and in my 3rd year of a BS in business psychology program.


The school counselor told me a PhD program is going to cost me $250k unless I can get into something funded, and given my academic history its highly improbable, even if I have a 4.0 from here on out. I cant justify 250k in debt. I've had a 4.0 for the last 3 semesters, but before that my gpa was terrible, cumulative is 2.5. 


So now I dont know what the hell to do. Get in a well-compensated industry and study psych as a hobby? Find a way to make the psych career work? Take on the debt?
I'm a bit lost right now. Any advice would be great.",28Sep2017,1
5,"Basically I have a co-worker who may be a sex addict... and I may be on the receiving end on some of his strange sexual urges... please tell me if I'm just being on edge.

My coworker has some sexual problems. Let me say that I am extremely open and non-judgmental towards other people. To each their own... if no one is getting hurt and it's not illegal... have fun with your sexuality. But this is now effecting me... so the guy I work with likes a lot of.... fecal matter (he's very open about what he's into). Basically he likes to be shat on... he's into really anything that involves gross shit. There's a reason I'm saying this. He also (openly) jerks off in the guys bathroom everyday. Again... to each their own. But I'm sensing he has an addiction to sex. Here is where it's beginning to effect me:


1) the sexual harassment I put an end to in the very beginning. I set a very clear boundary and told him what isn't okay. That includes him calling be babe which i also freaked out about... he also used to always ask me if i needed help when i go into the bathroom... none of these things are an issue now..


2) there is a male and female bathroom. The guys bathroom is in the warehouse and is very dirty. The guys like to use the ladies room for that reason. That's totally fine as it is single stall and has a lock outside the door. No biggie. It is right outside his desk. On three occasions now, after watching me pass his desk and go into the ladies room, he has tried to ""accidentally"" walk into the bathroom (pretending he didn't know I was in there and not knocking). I promise you this was no mistake. Thankfully i always make sure the door has been locked. This was his way of trying to get a peek. And I finally called him out. He denied it and eventually admitted to it (weirdo) and apologized.  he said it was a mistake (liar...). Hasn't happened since thank god. 


3) ((guys this one is sick)).... so today I was sweeping the warehouse because I was bored. Right outside of the men's bathroom I noticed something familiar... MY tampon applicator. I know it's mine because a) I'm the only woman there... and b) they're special colored ones that I just started using... and guys, If you don't know... typically a woman will wrap up the applicator too in toilet paper if she wants to be modest and throw it in the trash. First I assumed it just fell from the trash when the cleaning guy was doing the garbage... then I realized there's no toilet paper wrapped around it like i normally do. It was just sitting there outside the men's bathroom..... I think he took it from the trash and did God knows what to it... am I going crazy? Is this something guys Do? I need advice on how to go about this.... I'm so grossed out. 


Ps. My work has HR but they're in India (I'm in the US Chicago office)... I don't know if I can really get him with any sexual harassment because all this shit can be explained as an accident... guys, am I crazy? ",28Sep2017,7
6,"So I've recently been feeling like I don't want any responsibilities at all. The only things I like doing are for pleasure (video games, movies, gym.) I don't care about school. I don't care if my grades are bad or good. I don't care about cleaning around the house. I basically don't want any responsibilities and I know it's wrong since I'm already an adult. 

I kinda feel like my life is a waste of time. I feel like I shouldn't have been born and that someone  better should have taken my place. I'm not suicidal I just feel worthless but I'm ok with it. I'm fine with not being successful. I'm fine with being a loser for my whole life.

It's basically a group of people who you can vote for to be homecoming king and queen (that's for grade 12, grade 9-11 is princes and princesses) This means, even if I don't end up winning, I have to go to the Homecoming Football game to stand with the other nominees and they pick the winners (I've never been to a football game, it's way too ""social"" for me I guess.) and during a pep assembly for the homecoming dance (who I don't have a date to. No friends that will go. I was gonna go with a female friend but she said she found out she has plans. Awesome) during the assembly I'm on the floor of the gym and I have to dance with a female nominee (every nominee does this with their opposite gender counterpart) And no girl would wanna dance with me. No nobody wants to go to the actual dance with me. Nobody wants to go to the football game with me. This just isn't for me. 

I talked to the counselor and he said it would be a fun experience. I know this may sound like stupid high school drama, but this is just stressing me out so much. This shouldn't be me, it should be some popular person that everyone knows. No girl will wanna dance with me in front of everyone. Please someone just try and help me. Please. ",28Sep2017,1
10,"A few months ago we moved into a brand new, semi-fancy apartment building in a suburban/retail area. We live on the sixth floor. 

Almost as soon as we moved in, it became apparent that the construction of the building is really shitty. The first night we moved in, I ran a load of laundry and flooded the downstairs neighbors' place. Apparently ""when the building settled"", it cracked lots of pieces of PVC plumbing, such as the washer drainage line, so these floods are common. :/ They said they are going after the contractor. You can also see weird stuff throughout the building, such as uneven walls and exposed pipes cracking the surrounding floor (like in the garbage chute rooms). 

But I don't mean this as a list of complaints--we're resigned to riding out the lease and getting the hell out of this overpriced mess.

 The real problem is that the elevator we use makes a loud metallic scraping sound when it goes from our floor to the floor just below it. Only during that specific movement. It's loud enough to be quite unsettling. (Screee!) It's been doing it for months. I've reported it, but just got a ""thanks for reporting it!"" I know they're not going to do anything about it. I assume it's another issue of the way the building settled.

Does anyone know (from an engineering/construction standpoint) if this is an actually dangerous situation? I'll deal with living here until the lease is up but I'd prefer to not die. I can use other elevators, it'll just be annoying/inconvenient.",28Sep2017,1

12,"Hi,

I moved to a new area which is 2 hours from my hometown. I knew of the area and knew it was a nice place but didn't know anyone here at the time of moving. 

I moved here with my partner at the time and after 5 years we split up. It was a rough relationship let's say it was controlling and that's all I want to say on the matter. 

Due to this I am unemployed and didn't manage to form new friendships during this time.

I have lived here just over a year now but lived alone here for 4 months. 

I am desperately trying to find a job quick because I know it will help solve this situation.

My confidence and self-esteem was totally destroyed however on a brighter note, the freedom of the break-up has made me very positive and excited about what could be for me and the possibilities.

I regularly speak to my family and they are awesome but my family are difficult to get too and we are currently meeting once a month.

Sometimes I feel like I love this area and I do, I'm in a big city and I've always wanted to live here. The opportunities I have here are incredible. Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by sadness and a homesick feeling of pure dread and panic. I know no-one here. 

My question is how can I form friendships here?

I try my best to make small talk with as many people as possible. I say hello in passing to people whom I've seen a few times around and neighbours from my apartment block.

15,"A little background: I'm a H.S. Senior with a ""challenging"" and complicated life (I am not a special snowflake :( ). I am a normal teenager with normal doubts and problems. Looking for advice and guidance.

Lately, I've been feeling indifference towards many things in my life and I realized how bad it is for me despite the fact that I feel good about it; it causes my mind to wander with no real objective in life. This has affected two important areas of my life; social (actually... love) and academic.

In the case, my love life (which I really lack) I cannot tell whether I need something more than a friend or I am just fine like I am right now. I believe I feel subconsciously inclined to find a partner ASAP, but consciously I am not proving it. For example, there is this girl which I THINK it's flirting with me, but I am not really sure, therefore I am not willing to make a move and ask her out because I do not really feel like it, and I have never had a girlfriend, but I think I am projecting indifference since I am not really showing my mutual interest in her (but I don't really know if I like her in the first place, and I don't really know how it really feels to be in love... therefore this is just a hypothesis).

In the academic case, I recently enrolled in an AP class of my preference (I'm stating this since I know many people just enroll in AP so that they look good in college applications, but in my case I did it because I like it) but I started to feel like ""whatever"" after falling behind for not doing homework, not because I am lazy but because I had different expectations about the class and my time. I lack the support and the time to do the homework. 

Since then, I have been feeling like shit whenever I go to the class and sit there watching how I am wasting my time, and see how pointless was to join the class. In addition, I think the ""post-traumatic"" effect of the class will be the loss of interest in that subject. Now, I really feel like ""meh, I won't do the homework and I don't really care"". This is affecting me. I might ask my counselor to drop me from that class before it affects my grades and prevents me from graduating, and before it makes me hate the subject that I love.

I don't know if you see the connections I see between indifference and the occurrences I just explained. To sum it up, I don't care for some things in my life, therefore I do not take further action.

**ADVICE IS APPRECIATED, ESPECIALLY FOR THE ""LOVE CASE"" (this is a shout for help from a confused teenager)**

P.S. This was posted as a single post in r/CasualConversation but it was removed cuz ""This submission is better suited for our Weekly Thread"". Then I posted in the Weekly Thread, but I don't want it to get it buried under all the other comments. So I'm posting it here hoping to get feedback.

17,"All this started last night when me and my family were going grocery shopping. It was late, but our girls were still up and we really needed to get groceries. Everything was normal, we got our stuff and since our girls were doing so well we decided to get candy out of the bins.

Then an older gentleman walks by us and tries to get my attention, at first I thought he was an employee, but then I noticed he was wearing a too nice attire. He tells me and my wife that we have beautiful children and how smart they look. This was normal, people come up to us all the time to tell us how pretty our girls are (not trying to brag). Then he switches the conversation to how smart kids today are in general and how technology is amazing.

He talked about how companies like Google and Amazon are really pushing amazing things out and how he was a part of it. He asked me what I did for a living, being honest I told him I did factory work, but I was going to school for computer programming. He continued to ask me more questions, where I was going to school, how long what I thought of Seattle.

Then the thing he said that kinda threw me off. He invited me to coffee so we could talk more and get to know each other better. He said that he knew some really rich people who would be interested in me and don't tend to mess around with these kind of things. He wanted to open doors for me and that his people were looking for someone of my caliber.

I said ok to be nice and I had the day off anyway, but now thinking about it I feel a little uneasy. I'll be completely honest I am not great at coding, I'm just learning and getting the basics down, I told him as such and he seemed to just brush it off. Today he sent me a text about the the location and getting to really know me and about getting me into places and opening doors for me.

Maybe I'm just being paranoid, or something, but the whole thing feels like a scam waiting to happen. Though the guy seemed nice enough so I feel hesitant to cancel out right.

I guess what my question are:

 Should I go?

Do you think something fishy is going on, or am I being paranoid?

19,I'm a graduate student and today I had my first quiz in one of my classes. I got there about 30 minutes early to cram and in the hallway was a fellow classmate. I sat down across from him and we said hi and he asked me what my name was again. Right after he mentioned a band from a t shirt I wore to class  the previously week and mentioned that he wanted to ask me about it but I left class very quickly. We chatted about music for a bit and exchanged numbers when we realized we go to some similar local shows.

20,"I'm about to turn 21 and I'm in college. I still live at home, but I pay for my tuition, car, books, food, etc. I feel that I'm old enough to make my own decisions and go places that I choose without asking my parents for permission. I am still respectful of them and we get along well, but it drives me crazy that they still veto certain decisions. For instance, this weekend my friend and I were supposed to drive to Nashville (~6 hours away) but my mom said ""absolutely not"" because my friend is male and I'm female and it's apparently inappropriate. How should I handle this? I feel like if I was living on my own it wouldn't be an issue. How should I respectfully tell my parents that everything I do is ultimately my decision because I am an adult with a job and a car and I can go wherever I please? Anybody experience this?",28Sep2017,4
21,"I got my permit when I was 15 and a half. Where I live, you can get your permit then and your parents can teach you, you're not required to take professional lessons. I didn't take lessons because it was too expensive at the time and I was happy to learn at my own pace. Thing was, my parents weren't that good at teaching and I found out driving gave me terrible anxiety. 

I think I got my permit renewed twice. At first, it was just taking awhile so I got it renewed as soon as it expired but after that, I got discouraged and ended up waiting a good few months before I got it renewed again. I remember being at the DMV when I got it renewed a second time and the woman at the front desk has a sign above her head that read ""We are ALWAYS nice to EVERYONE"" but she sort of drilled me for not having my license yet and said ""We don't just give these out to everyone, you know!!"" It made me feel really bad and just reminded me of how much of a failure I was. I did better this time, went on the freeway even. But again, my dad was terrible at teaching and would give me constant panic attacks. In the end, still didn't get my license. 

When I turned 21, I went to get my ID. That's what I have now but it's not a permit. Permits don't last as long and I knew I just figured I was never going to be able to learn to drive. 

Now I've just turned 23. I want *need* to get a job and having a license would make that a million times easier. I talked to my mom about it, and she'd be willing to help me get back into learning and do it at a decent pace. She's not terrible at teaching like my dad is and told me I can even wait a year to go on the freeway if I want to. 

I just feel like I'm going to give up again, though. It makes me anxious just thinking about it. It would be really nice to get some tips from people. Like, how can I stay motivated and how can I become more comfortable? I know adult lessons are a thing, there aren't many around where I live though. Do you think it would be best to take them anyway? Are they worth it?

I understand how to drive a car. That's not really what I need to ""learn"" it's more than I just need to learn to be comfortable on the road.

26,"So, where I live, we only have one class, not multiple, which means that we're all always in the same room.

Well, this girl and I keep looking at each other in class. We have eye contact and lock our eyes for more than 5 seconds multiple times throughout the lessons. 

In the breaks, she touches me without having any reason to - for example, I always have my charger with me and charge my phone in our class' socket. That one time, she almost jumped at me and grabbed/hugged my arm for a few seconds, asking if she could charge her phone. 

I also like her, so I sometimes ask her if I can see her phone and stuff (messing around with her), and our hands touch a lot. She never takes her hand away or something like that. 

She also keeps laughing at my jokes -- she even laughs at stuff that's not supposed to be a joke! Lots of laughing.

30,"Some background:

As a 36 year old guy, I imagined my life very differently at this age. I figured I'd be married with kids, have a house and a career. I didn't expect to keep trying for these things. Often times I wonder about what could have been if I lived my life differently and wish I could relate to those who do fit my ideals.

In the past few years, the following have happened:

Negatives
Fiancé ended relationship and I became very depressed for a long while.
Started experiencing shoulder pain last November and going in for an MRI - scared I might have to get surgery.
Still a library assistant and not a librarian (more people familiar with the latter term in my username), however, some job prospects are out there.
-Concerned about getting a new job if I have to get shoulder surgery. I've got something like 8 weeks of sick time built up with my current employer. What if I have to to take time for recovery after just getting a new job?

Positives
Going to therapy which has helped a lot.
Earned my MLIS.
Developed new interests/hobbies.
Made new friends.
I've learned to be more outgoing and take charge.
Dating.

Concerns
Haven't met any of my life goals.
Scared about shoulder surgery and how it would affect a new job and/or love life.
Getting frustrated at how slow things are going in general.

34,"I'm 22 and living at home in California with my mom and sister while working a full-time job earning $13.00/hr, 40 days a week.

To sum up six to seven months contemplating the matter, I've decided that I wanted to move out as soon as possible.

I just bought a new car because my old one died, so because of that my savings were almost entirely depleted (I hate being in any sort of debt, so I paid $10k in cash). This leaves me with about $2k left in savings. Not much at all. I also have $2k regularly floating around in my checking account.

After taxes and insurance, my net income comes up to about $1600 a month.

I have to pay rent, as well as gas and food and utilities, so my expenses are about $600-700 a month, give or take $50.

Additionally, I'm being as frugal as possible and putting $700 a month into savings.

The cities that I've picked are fairly far across the country, about 1,000 to 1,500 miles away from my current town. The reason they're so far is mostly because cost of living is low, but jobs there within my field have high wages, and the crime is much lower.

I'd love to move out as soon as I can possibly afford to. Every day, while I enjoy spending time with my mom, every other part of my life is like a prison sentence.

I've been trying to apply to jobs in these cities for a few months now, but nobody's gotten back, so assume I'm going in without a job.

I've never really moved out this far before, but I really need advice in this situation because I'm desperate to move out, but I don't want to screw up and end up broke AND have to move back. I've moved before, but only in town, never interstate.

From my research, average monthly rent in these cities for a studio/1bed is about $600-700.

How much money should I have saved up before moving to a city 1500 miles away?",28Sep2017,1
35,"Sorry if this is formatted weird/a wall of text, I'm on my phone. 



I graduated high school in May. I never did have any plans for college, as it didn't really intetest me and I wasn't sure what to major in anyway. I told this to people, including my mother. My parents are divorced and my dad lives 30 mins away and doesn't really come around much or talk to us. 




Now that the school year has started (I have 4 younger siblings all in school), my mother has been trying to push me to do something. Which is fine, because I WANT to do something, but at the same time it feels like she's trapping me at home. And it confused me to no end. 

She brings me job applications from stores/restaurants/etc and tells me all about how great working there would be. But then nothing. She doesn't take me to submit it, she doesn't ask me about it or anything. I don't have a car. I don't have a license (because she won't let me get one....because she doesn't want to pay the insurance?) This admittedly makes me less adamant to get a job. I'd have to rely on her for rides, and her job is 90% driving all day and she conplains about having to drive all the time, constantly. So I'd feel extremely bad making her drive more.

I just feel trapped at home, becaue no license or car, we're poor, my mom has expressed very clearly that she doesn't want me to move out (which I want very badly to do...there's 6 people living in a 3 bedroom house). 

My mom and I don't have a good relationship anyway. She's religious and she will argue with my siblings and I until she gets the last word. I don't talk to her about any of this stuff because I KNOW she will argue with anything I say and never apologize for anything and hold her beliefs until I'm either crying and I give up, or walk away if I'm being particularly stubborn and she knows she can't ""win."" For an example: There was a whole dramatic event in August when I tried to ask her if I could get a tattoo for my 18th birthday and she refused to talk to me about it i.e. changing the subject in the middle of our conversation. I really wanted one so I kept pressing, and she ended the conversation with ""ask your dad"" and walking away. So to me, she didn't give me an answer. But I did, I asked my dad who has tattoos of his own and he took me to get one and I got tiny, tiny tattoo of a cat silhouette on the back of my shoulder. And then my mom threw the biggest fit I've seen her throw, saying she didn't give me permission and ""how could I get a yes out of that conversation."" Of course none of this was to my face though, she said this to my siblings instead and then stromed out the door as soon as I got home from my dad's. This has always been a theme with her, she is very controlling over my physical appearance, so much that in middle school when I would cry because I hated my long hair and told her it made me hate myself, she still refused to take me to cut my hair ""because I would look like a boy."" And I had to go to my dad for that too. 




But anyway I guess she wants me to stay home and work, idk what she thinks about my transporation. Which I do not want to do anyway, I hate living here and everyone is always arguing or yelling at each other. But I don't know how to get out or how to even talk to her about anything because she is the worst person to talk to. I tried to just take a walk tonight because I was sick of sitting inside and she got vaguely pissed and said I could only be out for ""a little bit."" I'm 18....and I can't even take a walk in my own (gated!!) neighborhood. 



I dont know if I'm being an overdramatic teenager or what. If I am it's understandable, I just need advice. On top of all of this I don't really know what to do with my life and I have anxiety. I dunno. Am I the one making our relationship bad by not talking to her? What do I even do to try and get out of the house? Thanks. 

TLDR I'm 18 and my mom wont let me have a license or move out, but still wants me to get a job.",28Sep2017,1
36,"This is not a serious matter. If I could guess, it would seem that he recalled my username from when I showed him a time I got a lot of upvotes on a comment. I'm an active user in the subreddits for my specific interests, and in AskWomen, where I write things insightful and often very personal. I have had an inkling that he's been actively checking my userpage for a few months now, given his behavior.

Here are a few examples:

1. A couple days ago I commented on reddit a time in a movie where someone made a really weird face. It was something me and him had both laughed at when we saw it, and made into somewhat of an inside joke, but we haven't spoken about it for nearly half a year. Just last night he made the face out of the blue. 

2. I commented once that I think effort put into relationships should be a 40/60 split, with both partners trying to be the 60. A couple days later, we both made a mistake doing something together, and he said the fault was ""40% you, 60% me"". 

3. There was a thread asking about specific moments with your SO, and in that thread, I made a mistake in wording when recalling a memory. When we saw each other, discussion of that moment came up naturally, and he repeated the phrase I had used in my post verbatim!

These could all very well be coincidence, but if it isn't, it's not something that bothers me whatsoever. I have been purposefully commenting a lot about the great things about him and our relationship, so that when he checks my userpage, he is reminded that I love him and care about him.

But anyway, I really want to know for sure whether he's looking at my reddit or not. What is something I can do to be absolutely sure, just short of asking him? Is there a topic that would certainly get a comment from him? What can I post about that would make him have to bring it up (without hurting his feelings/manipulating him)?

Looking for any and all ideas. Thanks!",28Sep2017,5
37,"I live and Canada and I am 18 years old. I have been going to school for 13 of those 18 years and have gotten good grades relatively easily throughout all of it but now, as I approach the end of college and the application deadlines for universities, my motivation has been steadily dropping along with my grades.  

As this is going on and I am cruising through university programs without finding anything that I find fulfilling, my huge bucket list of adventures resurfaced. I made that bucket list a few years back during high school and, throughout this week, updated it.  

The Bucket List consists of a bunch of trails I'd like to walk on, mountains I'd like to climb, countries I'd like to visit, etc. This is something that, if it ever happens, will happen during most of my twenties and a portion of my thirties or something like that.  


Now onto the actual question of my post: what are my options to accomplish this? I don't think I am willing to go through university right now and think about this later both because I do not know what I want to do in life and don't think I could even pass my courses with the state of mind I am in right now; I am completely burnt out from school.  
What jobs could I look into in order to earn enough money to scrape by all the while going on huge treks across continents every time I get the occasion? Server/barman come to mind, but how do I get started? There are also other jobs that offer travelling such as working on a plane or on a boat, but how much of my time will I have to myself. Those do not sound like jobs that can be easily replaced if I quit every couple of months.

I know that Islam already permits a Muslim Man to marry a non-Muslim women (as long as she belongs to the ‘People of the book (Jew, Christian, catholic)).

Back story: my girlfriend and I have been dating for quite sometime, and of course my family doesn’t even know she exists. I’m sure she will convert to Islam, and I’ve been teacher her things slowly. We’ve even talking about raising our kids as Muslims and around a masjid.

I wasn't planning on giving my jersey to anyone (forever alone), but i was so tired and out of it from practice i said something like, ""Yeah sure, whatever."" without thinking it through AT ALL. A few minutes later when i was changing into my cloths it hit me that i had said yes, when really i dont want ANYTHING close to a relationship. If she wears my jersey, all my friends/family would assume we're a ""thing"". I dont want to let her where it put i kinda said i would let her wear it, and i really dont wanna go back on my word cuz i hate conflict and making people disappointed. As i mentioned earlier I dont want a relationship AT ALL, with her i really dont know what to do.

58,"Hello everyone. I am currently pledging a fraternity at a big SEC school. I thought I knew what I was getting myself into, but as the days go on I am starting to become more and more anxious about this process. I suffer from extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and I tend to overreact and fear a lot of things. I let the little things bother me, and I have a tough time coping with mental distress. I want to be initiated into this fraternity, but I honestly have been having anxiety attacks where I come so close to just quitting. I am terrified to be around the actives at the house because of the tasks and demands. Not that these are hard, but I just am afraid of messing up. I don't work well when I am being verbally assaulted or harassed, so messing up with an active doesn't help my case. Secondly there are some hard tasks that we have to do. I hate driving other people's cars and it gets me so tense when I'm told to do it. I freak out and panic sets in. Another hard task is Memorizing the name, major and other info about my pledge class (of 53) and actives (over 100) seems impossible to me, but apparently is required for initiation. I have a friend who is a senior in the fraternity who has been guiding me through, and I want to ask him what I should do with my anxiety. I don't know if I mentally can handle the rest of pledgeship and I don't want to let anyone down because of my own personal fears and anxiety. Is it ok for me to talk to actives on what I should do?

60,"So, for the first time since elementary school, I'm actually alone all the time. I only have one friend, but since we don't have the same classes I never see her and we only get to hang out every few weeks. While she's great and we have a lot of fun together, I can't talk to her about anything personal so all my emotions are kinda bottled up.

This year I knew no-one in any of my classes (which isn't different from the usual) but instead of being able to make friends, nobody talks to me. Usually I'd be able to make about 2 friends in each class- they'd ask me for help or I'd ask them and then we would talk and hang out occasionally. While none of those friendships were particularly close, they were SOMETHING.

Now though, even though I still try to hold casual conversations with people, nobody really seems to care. I still act polite and help people when they need it, and some of them bother trying to help me when I ask, but nothing comes of any of it. I feel like everyone looks at me with disgust and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. There's not any clubs I'm interested in at school and I don't have the desire to become friends with anyone specific- most people are kinda douchey and I'm not about that life.

I was an usher and I was standing at one of the entry ways to basically help someone find their seat and greet them and all that.

He goes to the same college as me and is two years above me. He'd ask me questions about me, like he was trying to get to know me, I'm not sure.

Towards the end of the game I asked if anyone knew the time so I could figure out if I could still take a bus home. He told me the time and so I said I can't take the bus home because where I live the public buses don't run that late. 

So later on when the game ended he approached me and offered to give me a ride home and then handed me his phone and asked for my number. He said he'd text me when he got his car from the police station and then he could come and pick me up once I clocked out.

So once he text me and I clocked out he picked me up and drove me home. We struck up a conversation on the way to driving me home and he was a really sweet, and really cute guy.

My line would’ve kept me there all night; the store size simply doesn't fit the demand. While completely checked out (not cashier wise). A very happy seeming, nice cashier managed to snap me out of the stupor after telling me to come over failed. So she brought me over to her check-out line; all the while telling me her name, asking me mine. Pointing to her the amusing lack of a name-tag, but very clearly wanted to know one another on at least a first name basis. This brought the hope I might be able to make a new friend. Beyond her seemingly positive, happy demeanor; or a perfect employee/cashier mode. Slight possibility she genuinely wanted to talk. I’m as oblivious to these things as someone can be.

Went in the next night, then day after or so, started to feel a little creepy, about the 3rd-4th time through her line now. For reasons beyond my knowledge, she remembered me, my name.. It's a relatively small store that has thousands of customers on daily basis. It's odd as I tend to ghost myself in public. She recalled the last things I’d purchased, finding amusement in sugary selections. Next day she asked what I’d been up to, or what plans I had; I honestly admitted I’d woken up at 3PM.. Couple days later I went in, same thing. Both smiling saying each other’s names, joked about all the sweets I eat (hyper-metabolism). Then asked if I’d woken up at a reason able hour that day, pretty smile and laugh, all confusing the hell out of me. 

g creepy, (I’m often overly respectful/shy), or putting her in an How not to come across like I’m trying to just hit on the cute cashier.. I’m honestly happy to make a friend, especially one with the positivity she exudes. Snapped me right back into reality, after over a year spent out of it, not sure why it, or how, but lifes events actually seem to matter now?

**tl;dr**
Best way to make simply friendly contact (verbally isn't really an option) with a cashier that I think shared a genuine, mutual interest. Prefer not to be a daily regular, though would nearly likely do so otherwise, but now may appear a bit creepy, (typically overly respectful/shy). Specifically want to avoid putting her in an awkward, uncomfortable position in front of co-workers, boss, or other customers?

70,"I'm with a girl I've known for 13~ years, have been dating for almost 3 years now. We had a brief time together for a few months in 2013, but events that occurred then play a large part of what's come to be.  The honeymoon phase is well gone (obviously) and we live a relatively normal life: an apartment, cat, different jobs etc.  But something happened in 2013 the few months we did date. She cheated on me and never told me, and I found out on my own this time around by digging in her gmail right around when we first started dating again this time.  She said she was planning on telling me, but I had that feeling and found out before she decided to.  To be honest, I don't think she ever would have, she has a lot of guilt and fear holding her back from a lot of things.  Ever since that incident, I've had a really hard time trusting her with not being faithful.  She tells me I need to let it go and trust her because she's changed, and she could be right- I know that even I have.  There's ticks now that trigger these paranoia outbreaks that even after 3 years of seeming faithful.  When she was being unfaithful the first time, she would send long texts only when i was out of viewing radius of her phone, randomly post very ""seductive"" selfies on her tumblr with in strange context in the middle of us having a prolonged silence (we didnt live together then).   Things she did that I eventually learned meant she was not entirely honest with me.  The day after she cheated on me, I had a feeling and she looked at me with what my mind calls ""mona lisa eyes"", this glazed over look where it feels like I've never even met her.  I've seen that happen in her a few times this round of dating and It really sets me off.  I become *that* dude, that boyfriend who rips and tears his way into all of her media. I become the shit head who goes through every single message, every app that even has a messaging function- I've literally looked at her ETSY messages.  I've become the guy I used to tell girls to dump because he's a fucking creep.  As that guy, I wan't to say something:  It's disastrously involuntary. It's a red line that if you cross, your body runs hot and it stings. You can't think like a rational person anymore. You are a fleshy mass of anger and sadness trying desperately to find concrete evidence that you were right. That you justified that level of invasion.  I feel like sometimes I'm almost hoping to find something just so I can have that one last heartbreak and leave so I never have to deal with another outburst again.  

However recently, I went too far. She had a box with a lock where she kept a notebook. She'd been aware that I've gone through her media, understood why and forgave me a hundred times.  This was her last place where she could have some privacy. After she told me she was going to a homecoming get-together with a guy I knew she'd had sex with like 7 years ago, I lost it. I read in their messages she had been writing a letter to an old friend, which I'd never heard from her.  I broke the lock on the box and there was so much, I couldn't bear to read past 3 pages.  There was letters of reconciliation to exes, full length descriptions and stories about every guy she's had sex with, and the letter to *another* guy she had been text-fooling around with the first time we dated (which I also knew about). The letter was to try and lure him out of wherever he's hiding because he's a criminal and nobody's heard from him in years.   This was the apex of everything, the literal holy grail of what I wish I hadn't been searching for.  But then it wasn't.  These things apart from the letter were never meant to see the light of day or anyone elses' eyes.  She promised me they were her way of dealing with her demons from the past, and after a night of writhing back in forth in our bed by myself- I got it. I don't know if what she said is true but I understood one thing: I'm never gonna stick my nose in anything of hers again.  I keep hurting myself on purpose, and I think It's because where I am right now I'm unable to forgive her or trust her.  The past week she's been on her phone all the time writing insanely long messages or apparently stories.  She's been working on a pirate story with some old friend of ours who lives in Arizona now and I only heard about it when she explained it to our room mate.  We've been trying to be cute and get things back to somewhat normal, but the inner distance is very obviously growing.  I think what feelings I have left after beating myself up are on a primal territorial level-  like where I don't wan't to see her with anyone else but I'm not even sure if I want to be here anymore.  It feels like now the only reason we're together is because it's easy.  Because if we broke up we'd have to move away from each other and actually deal with it.

71,"I recently got a job at Chicken Express, and I got my friend a job there as well. We both work part time due to school. When they asked how much hours I wanted weekly, I said 30. I'm have saving goals such as college and other things. And that's what my buddy started off at as well. But, recently my friend has been requesting more and more hours like crazy. He lives with me, so I would know if he has any specific goals, but he's just doing it for the money. This week, he got 38 hours, I got 25. Next week he's scheduled for 34 hours, I'm scheduled for 21. I messages both of my managers, and it seems like they don't really care. Also, I'm only making $7.25 here. My friend doesn't seem to care either. Every time I bring it up with him, he just says, ""Well I asked for my hours."" I'm almost confident I can find a job with somewhat better pay, but I'm arguing with myself on whether or not I should quit.",28Sep2017,5
72,"This is, admittedly, a very silly thing but it's been driving me insane. 

My brother (37) recently moved to my town, and started working in the same office as me (24) a few months ago. He gives me a fist bump every time he sees me, and every time we part ways. He walks by my desk and gives me a fist bump, and he stops to chat (which is fine), and then when he leaves he gives me another fist bump. If we pass each other in the hall, he fist bumps me. 

It feels very juvenile and is honestly kind of embarrassing. I want him to stop. I don't know how to approach it without hurting his feelings (he's pretty insecure and sensitive). Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?",28Sep2017,1
74,"I'm 16, and they have been emotionally abusive towards me in the past, both recent and over the years. Currently I'm not allowed to have a personal life, I'm not allowed to learn how to drive, I'm not allowed to get a job, and they keep taunting me about how I'm going to end up on the streets, or end up homeless and alone. That shit messes with me, and kind of scares me because I've been so stressed out with school lately I can't even function when I'm there. Earlier today I was so happy and excited because I could finally speak my mind again without having to worry, and they weren't home. They came home at about 7 PM, and it's like all that happiness instantly drained. If I'm around anything that reminds me of them, such as school, I feel instantly drained. I don't understand what's wrong with me. It's like I get a lump in my throat that won't let me speak, or act normal around them. I don't know what to do, other than try to get enough money to move out but I can't do that without a job, and when I'm 17 I will be able to, but I won't have a car, and I still won't be allowed to learn how to drive. I don't live close enough to anywhere that I'd be able to walk to if I worked there. But I feel like i put myself in this situation somehow, but I can't explain how or why I got here. I'm doing so horribly in school because I'm stuck in this loop of ""Oh, you can't do that. They don't want to listen to me."" and ""What's the point? I'm going to fail anyway."" and currently, I'm failing four out of seven classes. 

I don't know what to do, sorry I've been kind of rambling this whole time, to be honest I'm terrified I'm going to always be like this. I feel like I deserve every ounce of what I'm getting, but I don't know why I would. I don't know how to cope, any advice would be amazing. ",28Sep2017,1
75,"Hey everyone! Sorry for my confusing username, but I guess it's worth noting I'm a lady. I need some advice, and am not sure who to ask!

About a year ago I was FWB with a dude. I ended it after a month or two because a) I sensed his feelings were ""dating"" feelings and I didn't want that and b) He seemed like an angry person. After I ended it, he flipped out, harassed me, threatened me, etc. Fast forward to a few months ago- he reached out and apologized. I accepted the apology and ended the conversation ASAP. He's reached out a few more times, and I've done the same.

However, the other day he reached out after I'd had a few drinks. Seeing his name makes my blood pressure spike, so I wanted to try to pacify everythin.. Anyway, he was very vague about what happened a year ago, but apologized over and over. He insisted it ""wasn't really him"". I called him out on this bullshit, stating my own personal experiences when I didn't like who I was, but still made my own (shitty, awful) choices I had to live with. Without getting into specifics, he was saying that how he acted wasn't under his control, etc. The way I'm saying it makes it sound like he was abusing and such, when in reality it made me think that he had a brain tumor. He didn't go into specifics over text, but all the signs pointed to something like that (where your brain is just so unhealthy it literally changes who you are). 

I'd feel awful if it was a brain thing, because I totally understand it can make you say things out of your control (he was only verbally a jerk, never physically). Tell me- am I being naive and he's really just a manipulative prick?? I have no interest in a romantic or sexual relationship with him, EVER. But he is begging to meet for a drink so he can explain things. Should I accept? It should also be noted we belong to the same gym and live within 0.25 miles of each other- I often see him around. 

Sorry for the long post! I'm still fairly new to reddit, so I hope I followed all the rules",28Sep2017,7
76,"So before I start off: I too know how it feels to deal with mental illness. I am not posting this from a position of ignorance. I used to have severe depression, although I now no longer have it. I have OCD, social anxiety, and have gone through (and am still going through) a fair share of crazy stuff in my life. But I decided to make the most of it, and get my shit together. I did this with no therapists because I didn't have a way of finding one. I did look to lots and lots of psychology channels on youtube though. I couldn't have done it alone. Point is, when it comes to mental illness, I know what I'm talking about.


So I have a friend who is extremely messed up. He has ADHD, anxiety, depression, and a LOT of other stuff that probably aren't even diagnosed. For a long time, he's been extremely suicidal. Last year, he compiled a video of people dying, school shootings, terrorist attacks, and car crashes. He sent it to me, and a ton of my friends during school. We immediately reported it, along with all his suicidal tendencies. He got suspended for one day to talk with a therapist, who didn't seem to help him all that much. My friends and I are guessing that he made the compilation to get attention. Even though he has all these issues, nobody can deny that he is a huuuuuuuge attention whore. He lives off of others' reactions. After that incident, all the staff at the school knew about him being suicidal, but they did literally NOTHING. My friends were getting pissed at him, and rightfully so. All he would do is complain to them and refuse to accept any help they offered. I still had hope for him, so he chose me to follow around religiously. He would text me every five seconds. If you don't believe me I will show the DMs with the names blurred out. He would text me saying how much he hates his life and wants to die every day. I would always respond with a super heartfelt, long, and thought out message. He would just respond with, ""That won't work"". I told him to get professional help more times than I can remember. He said he has seven therapists but he refuses to go to them. He only goes to me. Nobody else. Just me. He would text me at 4 am on school nights. He tries to isolate me from my friends. In the middle of last year, he literally picked up an exactoknife during his shop class, opened the blade, put it to a random kid's neck, and threatened him with it. He only got suspended for a WEEK. He should have been expelled. It's required by law. I don't even believe police were contacted. And at the end of last year, he admitted he loved me, and he ""always had since he met me"". Oh yeah and he said it backwards in German. Oh yeah and he goes on 4chan 24/7. And he says he's a communist and a nazi. At the same god damn time. You probably think I'm a troll, but I swear on my cat's life that I am telling the truth and nothing but the truth. I told you he's an attention whore. Crazy shit. I politely declined, telling him that while I didn't hate him (I honestly had every reason to), I would never view him as anything more than a friend. He said it was fine. The year ended. I refused to respond to any of his texts. He still texted me all summer. This year, he still hasn't taken a hint, apparently. He texts me things like, ""I'm lonely send hugs uwu"". He texts me during the middle of class and gets pissed when I don't reply. He lied to my face saying he would get sent to an asylum if he were ever reported again. He said he would go to an asylum in Anaheim CA if he were reported again. I looked it up and it was all literally links about immigrants applying for asylum in California. fail... Did he even try on that one??? So I've given him advice on how to get his shit together, but he refuses. And let me tell you, slowly getting your god damn shit together and be confident in yourself is the only way to start healing from mental illness. All he wants to do is bitch about his problems to me in the middle of class and refuses help. He should have gotten expelled last year. Being completely honest, he should have been taken to a mental institution a long time ago. The school administrators are refusing to acknowledge the problem knowingly at my own expense. He's been reported so many times. They know what he does and they know all his issues. I've tried being a casual friend, but nooo. I either completely isolate myself from others for him or I ditch him completely. There is no in between. Advice?!?!",28Sep2017,1
77,"Backstory I am the oldest out of 6 kids, he is wealthy.  I am the only to graduate college he paid 30k while i was in school and i have 50k in student loans. I graduated with a 3.6 and work for hom right now.  Out of the kids one other he paid 10k towards school but he dropped out. One is attending community college and pays himself. And 2 of the girls are in college and he is paying all of it no student loans for them.

A few examples of where I'm advancing at work or ""in"" where she is not.. 

-Recently, I got a raise and promotion, and have been allowed to hire someone to backfill my position. Said friend has been asking for a raise and to hire someone to help with her position for 8+ months with no luck on either front. She definitely deserves a raise and help, and I do what I can where I can to try to help her get it, but ultimately it's not my decision. 

-I have been involved in our quarterly exec strategy planning sessions for over a year, and she has always been upset she wasn't invited. She had been invited to the last one after asking to be invited. Now, my boss let me know today that she is not going to be invited to the next one (along with one other person who was there last time, but is not being asked to return). 

I'm really concerned about how she's going to react when she finds out she's not invited to this meeting. I'm worried about her feelings because I know she's going to be pretty devastated. I don't know what I should do - should I give her the heads up that she isn't going to be invited, or wait and act like I didn't know? 

I also feel like she's started to pull away from our friendship a little... not talking to me as much or telling me things she normally does about work or otherwise. It could be in my head but I'm not sure.

85," I am currently a mechanical engineering student. Throughout my 21 years of life, I have bummed along and went along with the education system. Did reasonably well to basically go anywhere other than courses that requires an interview/resume. 

At this point, I start to ask myself, what do I actually want in life. I narrowed it down to 4 main objectives. I want to find new things, build new things, educate and alleviate suffering. 

As with the above, I have just picked out mechanical engineering for my undergraduate studies. I have applied to medicine but failed to make it in. (I am from Singapore by the way, it is insanely competitive here). I am also quite interested in life sciences and their research. I have just started my first semester of undergraduate studies. I am doing well enough, but I just simply feel very unmotivated. I see very little meaning in my daily schoolwork. 

As you have read, and many people have given their comments to me, I seem to be very confused in life. Engineering, life sciences and medicine doesn't seem to connect very well.

86,"Hello fellow redditors and thank you for taking the time to read this. Here's the situation: I'm a 40 year old man (as of three days ago), and I'm thinking about going back to college. My first stint in higher education was a booze soaked, party driven mess. I was too cocky and/or (not so much *or*, mainly *and*) too scared to fail that I dropped out in my third semester of Computer Engineering. Then, I moved on to a very fancy and bougie business admin school that I paid for myself (first stint was on daddy's dime). That too proved too annoying and I was focused on my job anyway. In hindsight, I was a moron and a lazy dumbass: it was a good school with good people, the class conflict merely an excuse to drop out yet again. Basically, I was going full ""I don't belong here with these fancy kids. I'm older than them and I'm too blue collar for this crap"". Which, as you can probably tell by now, is a dumb thing to think. A couple of years later, I went back to the first college, enrolled in the same course and I couldn't stand it. Dropped out again. None of that has stopped me from having a pretty good career. I'm a pretty good professional and I'm making pretty good money (I'm still working class, but I can pay for tuition, fortunately). My life's stable. I've got a good job that pays good money. I live in a great city with many higher education institutions. My job gives me the flexibility to work from home and pretty much set my own schedule (within certain constraints, of course). I've always wanted to be an engineer. Seems like a no-brainer, but I feel too old. Too wrapped up in the adult life to add another layer of complexity to a life that's not super easy (I know, it sounds whiny, but still). Will the admissions office even consider me? At age 40, I feel like the 20 year-old me was too immature to take full advantage of the education that was being provided to me. I feel like I'm in the right mindset now. Should I? Are me fears warranted? If you stuck around and read this all the way through, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. If you have some advice for me, you're the real MVP :)

103,"Hi all.

I've been on Facebook for over 5 years. I also am an administrator for several business pages, including one that I've been supporting for over two years. What's more, I've even paid Facebook for boosted posts, etc. Facebook is my primary website for business, work, student, friends and family. If I had other options I would have turned to them. Basically, last week my Facebook account was disabled without notice. I wasn't sent an email, or given any chance to save any of my photos or information before this occurred. After, I have submitted an appeal for my account, and have not heard back. Looking online it seemed like rarely anyone ever hears back (and I've had experience with their ""customer service"" in the past so I don't really expect a response anyway).

So, I just tried to make a new account. But I realized too late that if I used any phone number or email linked to my first account, it would get systematically disabled. After that I tried to make new emails to make fresh accounts. I think at this point FB was pinpointing my phone and laptop IPs or something, as the security was tougher and it required a phone number. So I bought (ACTUALLY, BOUGHT) some burner phone numbers. Eventually every account would get disabled. Any attempts to reconnect with the community were met with my account being disabled. Now any account from my phone or laptop are automatically disabled, whether or not they are my account or someone else's who was simply using my device to log in. Facebook has no customer service whatsoever. There is no one I can contact to discuss my account, or why it was disabled.

The only reason I can think of is that I've gotten multiple copyright notices. However, a couple of the recent notices were for content posted a long time ago that I had been unable to delete. The thing is, Facebook pages actually make it really hard to go back and find specific videos to remove. I post a lot of videos on my business page and more often than not they're memes. Sometimes, I don't catch the copyrighted material or wrongly assume that it's been altered enough to fall under fair sharing. When I've gotten any kind of notice I've done my best to go back and find any related videos and delete them.
If I made a mistake and uploaded content I should have, I would like to have the benefit of the doubt in that I did not realize the material was copyrighted, and believed they fell under sharing for entertainment purposes after having been modified as derivative works. And if this wasn't the reason my account was disabled, I have no clue why it even happened. I have friends on FB that I can't connect to any other way. I was in a lot of groups as the only admin so those are just completely lost to me, know. If my pages didn't have multiple admins I would have fucking lost those too. I'm an RA in college and in a lot of clubs, as well as working for a news site, and all of those use Facebook group chats for communication.


I don't know what to do. I'm miserable because I hate Facebook but with the way campus society and life works makes me dependent on it. One of my pages recently reached 120K likes and I want to see it continue to grow. But I'm being treated like a criminal on FB, a spammer or a stalker or someone who's done something awful. I don't know who to reach out to, because I'm not someone famous that could create buzz and make Facebook notice me. I'm just one of many who's been screwed over the site. It seems like so far the only way I could access the site is make a fake account that I would only use on other devices, but that is almost just as useless because the only way I could be connected is using library computers or friend computers or get a new phone, which is ridiculous.

104,"My anxiety, social anxiety, and depression is affecting the way I do school. My mother put me into online school because she assumed it was just the environment. No change was made. I went to a therapist voluntarily. This helped me identify the problem but my mother stopped taking me because of switching jobs.

The problem is that even though I want to care, but a part of myself is making me not care. That part of myself dominates me, and tells me to not do my work, because it would be fun to do things less important. When I see even one overdue assignment I fall into a pit of anxiety; which causes more overdue assignments to pile up. And then my depression kicks in which fuels my urge to stop caring. I hate it, I want it to stop. I just want to succeed!

I am trying to get my mom to get me back into therapy since she is now settled in her new job. But now I am alone all day that I have online school. Being unmonitored does what you'd expect for a 15 year old. To give contrast to the hole I dug myself in; I am a sophomore going on 16 in the 12th of October. I want to get my license and have the freedom to drive. And even work.

105,"So I suspect my mother and sister so have some sort of mental illness or something, but I am not sure what. I just know something is wrong with them. 

My mom sleeps on the couch in the living room, and my sister does sometimes as well. The reason for this is because it is the only room with air conditioning as it gets hot in their rooms.

Anyway, whenever I am in the room when they are trying to sleep they ask me to leave. Okay, understandable. You want to sleep. However, there is more to it. If I am doing something like watching tv or using the computer when they are trying to sleep, they freak out. Badly. They start crying if I don't leave. My sister has emotional ossues, but my mom not so much. She has terrivle decision making and is stubborn, but she isn't very sensitive as far as I am aware. I can't name any other insignificance that freaks her out as much as this.

Now you might think it is because they don't like the flashing screens that they want me to leave, but it is the opposite. My mom can't sleep without the tv on with noise. If you mute the tv or unplug it she will wake up. 

So why? It happened today with my mom. My dad was sleeping in the same room, no problem. So the problem isn't people being in the same room, but being awake in the same room when you are sleeping.

106,"Hello. I am not sure how to explain all of this, but I'm going to try.

I'm a 17 year old boy, tonight I found out my dad does crack-cocaine, I've semi-known for months, as I've know he's smoked marijuana, I found small bleach/white rocks on top of the bathroom mirror where he usually puts marijuana (That I have pinched on occasion), now this present night, I found eye-drops, a ripped up cigarette, more white/bleach rocks that I already know is crack because my brother has confirmed to me (He has known for over 5 years, he is 27). I have no idea how to deal with this, apparently my father also has used heroin before (Brother has seen burnt spoons in same place) NOTE: My brother knows a substantial amount of information about numerous substances, as do I, we both have partaken in numerous substances in the past.

Now, how do I go about this? It's literally all unfolding in my brain right now, my house has always been a mess since I was around 5, when my aunt died it all when down hill, my house is dirty, stains everywhere, un-fixed droors, literally anything you can think of that could break, only the outside of the house looks nice. What do I even do? I have always known my dad is like a walking zombie, he doesn't support me emotionally, or in any way at all, he doesn't fix anything around the house, and if he does, it takes weeks of him sitting on the couch making excuses, sorry for rambling, but this is fucking insane to me.

I have always had a drug problem, though I never really think I was ever addicted to anything, as well as my father's nephew I had never met outside of Facebook, also as a note, I have never met my father's side of the family because apparently his mother was abusive toward him and some other reasons.

How the fuck do I go about this? Telling my already depressed mom who has been depressed for over a decade since my aunt died, and her father died about 2-3 years ago, and her uncle died literally a week ago. Telling her could break our entire shitty family. (I have a 34yo sister, 27yo brother, and 30yo brother, as well as a nephew and niece, 3yo and 10 months).

I am literally just spewing everything on to this text box right now, as I am shaking and fucking on the verge of crying right now, what do I do? Please give me some advice, I'd love if it was lengthy. This is just inane to me, I've never actually felt real love besides my mom buying my anything I have ever wanted, I have never fucking felt it, and after this it's all coming together, my family is completely trash and it really hurts, I look at my Uncle's family (Mom's brother) and he fixes everything as soon as it breaks, he is a stand-up guy, owns a construction company, kids, wife, nice clean home. Then I see my family, and it's completely disgusting. It fucking hurts. I also have said this before, but I am just spewing everything out right now without some sort of format, normally I would when I'm writing anything, but I just can't for this. Help. ",28Sep2017,3
107,"At 24 I've never had a boyfriend, had sex with all of three guys all of who played me and hurt me without a care.

Recently after being ghosted on I talked to a male cousin and annoyed him with my negativity because his response to me being ghosted yet again was 'the guy will come looking for you eventually'

This same cousin who claimed that there were guys who wanted relationships and would like me couldn't name one guy for me because he said everyone he knew I was their type because I don't carry myself in an attractive way.

I don't dress fancy. In school I was made fun of a lot, called gorilla and beast which made me shave to a point my sensitive skin (I have eczema) broke out extremely bad all over my body, making me not able to wear shirts that show my cleavage. 

My hands and arms are no better and despite years of doctor's visits it's never gone away. 

I'm not good enough to have someone care about me. It's not like I was a average girl looking for swag thugs, I loved artists and men who were creative and dressed normally. 

But even for them I wasn't enough. My cousin gave up on me because he told me I don't put any effort into my appearance, I told him the truth that I tried to change before and it wasn't enough back then.

I'm told to be comfortable with myself and dressing up in skirts and dresses and earrings was never comfortable for me. I always dressed naturally. But men don't want that, they want the outgoing girl.

It doesn't matter that I have a college degree, no kids, decent paying job, not that many sexual partners either. Because I don't dress a certain way I can't attract men and the ones I do attract just leave after a while.

I feel like I'm just meant to be alone. Forever stuck watching others have kids and boyfriends and lives that I'm constantly on the outside looking in.

High school senior, about to go on two-week break before three weeks of class, study leave, and then break-up in early December. 

High school hasn't been my time. I never really found my clique, and despite guarantees from my sisters, this year hasn't been any easier. I feel isolated and unwanted because of the exclusive nature of my year group, and the few friends I do have like making jokes at my expense. I don't want to spend any more time than necessary with anyone from my class - I just want to graduate and leave for university. 

What should I do?",28Sep2017,3

114,"I want to preface this post by saying that I'm 22 years old and I love basketball. I've put so many hours into basketball that I don't think I could ever see myself living without the sport. I'm still young and I feel like I was robbed of something so precious to me.
So about a year ago I tore my ACL and my meniscus along with it, which is pretty common. I had ACL surgery this past January. I woke up from the surgery to my girlfriend telling me the surgeon took off half my meniscus and I wouldn't be able to play basketball again, at least not competitively. 
Fast forward a week after surgery and we saw him for a check up. He didn't really discuss too much after the surgery so we had to wait patiently to hear why he decided to cut off half my meniscus.
He came in pretty happy and said the surgery was a success. However, my definition of success was being able to step onto a basketball court a year from that day and he knew that was why I wanted the surgery. I reminded him of that fact. Knowing that I was about to graduate from college, still seeming pretty happy, he said that I should really just focus on studying now. He rushed us through the appointment and left. He didn't even go through any options on what we could do if I wanted to play again. He just said that I could no longer play basketball and that was that. 
He knew I came to him because I knew he was a good sports doctor. I left knowing that I could no longer do what I love the most. 
I guess what I wanted to know was if I can do anything to recover my knee to what it used to be. I don't know too much about stem cells. I've heard about meniscus transplants but I've heard they only last around 10 years. I just want to be the same athlete I used to be. I know it may never be the same again but in this day and age I feel like anything is possible!
My other question probably should be referred to r/legaladvice but I'll ask it here anyway. What should I do if I want to sue this doctor? I don't remember signing papers that allowed him to touch my meniscus. How would I be able to get those papers I signed without going through him? I really would like to know if I gave him any sort of permission. This has honestly been the worst thing I've experienced. Something I loved was so quickly taken away from me after I had thought that it would be returned. I'm heart broken and have shed too many tears over this. I need to take action and stop being so passive. If I could win some money from this doctor, I could possibly use it to fix my knee. Please, whatever advice you have, I would like to hear it. Thank you.

TL;DR My doctor removed my meniscus during ACL surgery and I'm not sure I gave him permission to do so. What legal advice can you give me?
Also, is there anything I can do for my meniscus? I love basketball and my doctor told me that I can no longer play with it missing. Any new information on the advancement of meniscus replacement or anything, please let me know. Any information you can give me would be greatly appreciated. ",28Sep2017,2

Anyway logically I realize 1. What an asshole 2. I was an idiot 3. We were never going to get married and I've basically been over it but I still dream about him. Basically I'm the dreams he comes back to my hometown and sometimes we just talk, sometimes he apologizes. Sometimes he tries to get me to hold his hand or something, literally anything innocent like that. So I figure either my subconscious is still pining or maybe I low key want an apology? 
But this is causing me a lot of missing sleep once I wake up. Cause I can't get back to bed afterwards.

Things between me and my manager have been tense but for the most part civil but yesterday he went beyond what I think is acceptable and it's not the first time he has done so.

Things from yesterday. 
1 - During a feedback season he went on and on about who I'm not performing good enough for his team, and that I'm not taking on his feedback (which was not to use negative language like cancellations or remove a service to check what a customer wants / needs to do). During the session he kept saying how my job was at risk, that I wouldn't be allowed to return to the job, and that he was ""Prepared to go to war with me"".

2 - Later on in the day as I was sitting next to him I hear him mocking me for getting a customer to cancellations to cancel their Broadband. 

I called him out on It saying he didn't know shit about what was happening for the customer, and if he knew then he would realises that yes customer needs to cancel a service they no longer have the need for, he said that it was a ""coaching method"" to get me to improve, I quit the team and said that I don't want to work with him anymore.

It's not just the incident yesterday show his complete lack of any appropriate management style, but a huge list of little things that have build up, Like his refusal to do call listening when the customer request it, he view that if a customer want's to speak to a manager that a failure on our part, he boosted about getting another team member fired during a team meeting, he tell us to come to him for help but then dismiss us if we do seek help, he is determined to always be right and when evidence is present to show he wrong or just mistaken he never apologises. 


I need to say that I am on a 12 month final warning for a previous issues which was dealt with, (and I believe that he pushed me to be fired) so it possible that if I speak out they will find a way to just let me go and that my stats are low, won't lie I know I'm not the best agent and I can improve I just don't see this job as a future career as he does, not do I think that I should be mocked for helping a customer.


My options as I see them

 Do nothing - keep quiet and just quit mid / late October.

 Request a transfer to another team - Likely involve a pay cut or they might refuse as I'll only be there for a limited time

 File a complaint against him - It's not just me who feels this way about him, all my team are frustrated by him

 Hand in my notice - Give a months notice period, not worry about the sabbatical (as constantly reminds me that it's on his suggestion) and find a new job after travelling.

125,"I recently started a job in retail, I've done retail before but in an independent shop. However with this job nothing I do is good enough, none of my colleagues want to interact with me and the more I work there it seems the more I'm bad at my job. At my previous retail job I was really good, got on with everyone, loved it and honestly was the most productive employee there (my boss actually told me!). This place is known to be quite shallow but it feels like there's one tight nit group of employees and no one else can get a look in. The managers just seem to dislike everything I do even when I do it to the best of my ability and I just get a vibe from them ever since the start when I asked any question they thought I should already know despite this being a completely different shop and my other retail job being a while ago.

I don't know what to do because now they aren't scheduling me in for hours. I feel like a failure if I leave after a month but to be honest I'm waiting for the Christmas rush of employment to find a job where the people aren't like this. Honestly it feels like I'm the unpopular kid in a workplace full of popular kids. Some people are nice but they all seem to be leaving soon. I honestly don't know what to do because they make me feel so isolated no matter how much I try to fit in.

You can say ""just do the job and leave work it's for the money"" but when the managers are isolating you too then I don't even get hours. I've only been there a month. Do I leave and find a new job? My last job I absolutely loved but lived too far away to commute and it was an independent shop so I couldn't transfer to where I'm living now.

Any advice on this situation?

131,"So before people start saying ""You're not stuck, you can always leave"", yes, I know that. But I'm not just gonna give up on it before at least making an effort towards fixing things.

Here's a little background on everything: Me and him (Let's call him Lee) have been good friends for 2,5 years now. We met online and have chatted almost every day since we started talking. We have a fair bit of stuff in common, and, to a reasonable extent, know lots of things about each other.

The problem is the following: We really like roleplaying, especially personal roleplays (i.e.: I roleplay the girl he likes for him), so there usually HIS roleplays and MY roleplays. We also have a couple commong ones that are nice, but the real issue resides in MY roleplays.

To put it bluntly, Lee is bad at roleplaying. He seems to be good only at playing himself and a couple other characters that share traits with him. Whenever I come up with a scenario where he has to play, for example, a girl I like, he either refuses to play roleplay the character, or he roleplays them very badly (as in nothing to do with the real person, even though I give him clear directions as to how the character is supposed to behave).
Same goes with stories. I like writing and, more often than not, he asks me to write a couple stories for him. Most of the time, I don't really like the general plot of the story, but I write it anyway, both because it's good practice and because he absolutely loves my stories. I've written over 20 stories for him, from 1.000 words to 34.000 words, about different characters and situations and whatnot. A couple weeks ago, I asked him to try and write me one, no matter how short or bad it could be. To this day, nothing has been written yet.

Now I know he's claimed to be a 'bad writer' before, and that he's just not able to kick the story off, and that's alright. I never expected him to be the Shakespeare of modern romance. The thoughts that worry me is that he might not even be trying. Whenever he roleplays a character in a bad way or says he isn't able to write a story, it makes me think more and more that the problem isn't in his ability to write or roleplay, but rather in how willing he is to do those things.

I went from, a couple months ago, being supportive and understanding to, nowadays, being sad and honestly annoyed. Quite frankly, I really feel like punshing him by not roleplaying or writing anything else anymore until he decides to do what I asked him to do, but at the same time, I feel like it's unfair to punish him (in case he's actually feeling bad for not being able to do those things for me and not just purposely avoiding it), and he's pretty much my best friend. We stop RPing means we stop talking, and even though I can live with RPing stuff for him and having our common RPs, I still think I deserve a bit more from our friendship.

So, my fellow redditors, what should I do? Should I threaten to stop doing things for him if he doesn't start returning me the favors, should I keep encouraging him? I've already told him how I feel, so he's well aware of the fact that I'm not too happy about things how they currently are.
Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: I do my friend favors, but when I ask him to do me favors, he claims he isn't able to do them. I'm starting to think he's not even making an effort. Should I believe him and be supportive or should I accuse him of not trying and stop doing him favors?",28Sep2017,7
132,"I saw a Simpsons episode a while back where Homer tells Bart ""Stop thinking about fun and have it"". It really hit home for me and made me really think about my life. It's something that I think has been bothering me a while but I don't think I ever realised precisely what was wrong.

Looking back I can't really recall the last time I was simply content with the present, just enjoying my life at that moment. I'm not sure how to articulate it, but if I had to try it feels like everything in my life is a race to the finish line. It seeps into every aspect of my life, from my career to my hobbies, to my relationships and so forth. 
This year especially I've noticed how it affects not only my happiness, but the course of my life. I finished university last year and got a really good opportunity as a software developer two months later. Right off the bat I had trouble being happy in my job because I was already concerned how it's going to affect my career in the long run. Only 4 months into the job I was already moving on to the next job that I thought would benefit my career better. Around the same time me and my boyfriend got married and started the process of moving to Germany (my new boss was aware of this and we struck a deal so that I could continue working remotely from Germany). 
Even now, celebrating a month in Germany, I find it hard to live in the now and just enjoy the new experiences. The future is constantly on my mind- what if Germany doesn't work out? Where will me and my husband be in 5 years? When will we be ready and the time be right to start a family? Etc etc. I should be having the time of my life. I'm in my mid-20s, in a new country with a wealth of experiences waiting for me, and yet I'm not focusing on any of that.

As mentioned above, it even seeps into my hobbies. If I read a series of books, I rush through to get the ending. If I'm playing videogames, I'm always waiting for the fun to start instead of enjoying what I'm currently doing. If I'm watching a series, I'm eager to see the ending and don't care much about the middle-stuff. It feels like I'm always waiting for some big pay-off that never comes, when I should be enjoying what I'm currently doing. It also means that I end up chasing new experiences endlessly. I'm currently sitting on about 20 unfinished games from the last few months alone and all I can think about is all the new games coming out in October (most of which I probably won't finish as I move on to other new games).
When I'm developing a piece of software for my own enjoyment/enrichment, if I successfully implement a new feature I can't just sit back and enjoy a job well done because I'm already thinking about the next thing I need/want to do.

I can't even remember the last time I just slept in, because I get up as soon as I wake up. There's always something else I can be doing, so sleeping in just feels like I'm wasting time.

I've been suffering from really bad anxiety this year and I think part of that is that I'm constantly chasing an ever-shifting finishing line and never taking the time to just enjoy the here and now. It takes it's toll when nothing is just good enough and you can never just be content in the moment.
How do I teach myself to just stop worrying all the time and just enjoy being in the present?",28Sep2017,3
133,"Hey guys

So my friend Jack owns a house and for the past year or so I've been subletting the guest house in the back from him. I pay $1400 in rent.

I have been traveling abroad and returning home next week. I plan on spending one more month in the guesthouse and then moving across to the east coast.

When I informed my friend Jack that I will be coming home next week he dropped a bombshell on me: his friend Patti (who strikes me as a horribly selfish person) has moved into the guesthouse with her dog due to an ""emergency"". All of my stuff (clothes, books, TV etc) is still there. 

Keep in mind I was never asked if this was okay. It just happened totally behind my back.

Jack asked me if I could stay in his guest bedroom in the main house for my last month there and is asking me for $700 for my ""new"" living situation. Originally he had said I could just cook him delicious meals but now he suddenly wants cash. He has had people pay $700 for the guest bedroom before but I just feel like it's a huge slap in the face considering I have basically been pushed out of my own place.

136,"Basically i am looking for advice on whether or not i am thinking straight or if i am just an arsehole. My partner and i have been together 3 years. My partner and i have a great relationship and have never really had any problems, aside from those that usually face couples, (no unfaithfulness ect) but we have always worked through them and always moved forward. My partner has a younger sister, and i have known both of them for a pretty long time.

 I have only really got to know her sister in the last 2 years. Both girls are amazing. They both have a lot going for them and anyone lucky enough to be with either of them are very lucky. My partner is great, we are best friends we get along, have only had a fight once or twice but never really anything major. We share similar interests, but i dont think we are the same people we were when we first startes dating. I was at a dark time in my life and she got me through. We built eachother up, and overcame some massive obstacles together. We do not have kids and we also do not have financial commitments together, we work together very well. What i wanted and needed back when we first started dating, has changed a lot, she still provides me with most of that, but i feel there are things she wont ever be able to provide to me. 

This is where her sister comes in. She was to young when my partner and i started dating for me to have an interest in her. She has matured, and along with that she has gained many new interests, and also ambitions that i truly admire. Ambitions similar to mine. We share intrests in the same hobbies, goals and many more. It seems i have more in common with her sister, than i do my own partner now. The age gap between us is less than 5 years. So she is not all that much younger than me. 

My dilemma is, do i keep building with my partner although i see our overview, and goals in life changing. Also build with someone who doesn't share my interests. Or do i actually talk to her sister and tell her how i feel and guage a response from that. I dont want to lose one or both of them if i fuck up. I dont want to tell her sister these things, only to find out she has no interest and then potentially ruin something great i have. I have thought this over so many times in my head for over 12 months and just don't know what i should do. 

Any advice?",28Sep2017,1
137,"Hey guys! I'm from Brazil, 19 years old, and currently I am at one of the best universities on my country, my course is Physics, but... I really am not happy. The academic pressure on being a physicist is huge around here - all research projects are funded by the government, and the government does not value science at all, so the salary is low and the difficulty to get to the ""top"" is very high. When I first got into the university, I was okay with that, because I thought I would be brilliant and a very good physicist. But then I began to know all about the salary, the difficulties both on the uni and out of it for professionals in that area, and my motivation on this course began to fall down. I failed two subjects last semester, and now I am beginning to want to change to another course (maybe economy or computer science, which are both nice). But the thing I am most scared is the fact that my university is public, and here in Brazil, the process of admission on public unis is very hard, and if I changed my course, I'm not sure if I wanted to go to a paid uni, so then I would have to study hard to pass the exam to get in the university again. I would like some opinions about the subject, because I am confused and scared I am screwing up my academic life. And I'm scared too that I go into another course and don't like it as well.

138,"Back story, I’m on holiday and for the past couple days, all she has done is cry. 

Her mother works nights and her brother usually goes to her dads and she stays at home. 

Her brother is a 13 year old going on 4, with anger problems that only my girlfriend knows about because her mother won’t believe her.

Tonight she has to stay with her brother because he really doesn’t want to go to his dads, leaving her alone with him.

Furthermore, we usually use the nights where her mother is working as “alone” nights and we are no longer allowed them. We have a sexual relationship and this has been cut off entirely because of it.

139," Hi guys and gals, I often give advice here and I haven't asked for it before, but I need help with something. 

I'm really bothered when people throw around words like ""crazy"" and ""insane"" as synonyms for ""dangerous"", ""reckless"", ""evil"", etc. 

People like me who suffer from severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia are *11 times more likely to be victims of violent crime* than the perpetrators, and we're 16 times more likely to be *killed* by police. 

I strongly feel that this is due to fear and misconceptions, which can be directly attributed to the power of words. When we think ""crazy"" is the same as ""dangerous"", for example, it reinforces the idea that the mentally ill are dangerous. Then when someone is in a situation with a mentally ill person, they react out of defensiveness, sometimes with deadly consequences. 

However, when I talk about how the word affects me, I get laughed at and told that I'm being too sensitive, that I give words too much power. I've posted LPTs about it here on Reddit, and all I got were insults. I don't think these same people would laugh or diminish the hurtful power of words like ""faggot"" and ""nigger"", which are also associated with violence against minority groups. 

My people have been locked up, lobotomized, given shock treatments, burned, outcast, and generally tortured since the dawn of humanity for no greater crimes than having been born with the wrong generic makeup, and mind you it could happen to any one of us, whether or not we're aware of any family history of mental illness. Furthermore, with old age and the possibility of dementia, our mental state may deteriorate such that any of us might become a ""crazy old man/woman"".

I want advice on how to handle these situations, wherein I express the hurtful nature of these words for me and it's not well-received. 
I try to make jokes, saying for example that ""I hate when people call Donald Trump crazy for his reckless behavior. I may be crazy, but he's just *deranged*"". 
This usually gets a chuckle, but then I'm told again that I'm just being too sensitive and am brushed off. 

I'm not trying to be the PC police, I just want people to be aware of the effects that their words have. Maybe what I need is advice on how to be less sensitive to the power of words? Am I wrong here? Do you have any suggestions for how I can do a better job of fighting the stigma and misunderstandings around mental illness?

Thanks in advance for any help. I know how it feels to craft a thoughtful response on this sub and never hear from the person again, so I'll try to give a speedy reply and upvote to anyone who responds with constructive feedback. ",28Sep2017,0

141,"I've had a rather interesting childhood. I'm 17 now, going on 18, and as far as I can tell I've exhausted most if not all of my creative juices. I've always been the creative type.

At around 7 or 8 years old I taught myself how to use a computer. At around 10 I taught myself Photoshop and started diving into graphic design. At 12 I started learning how to program in web development languages like html, css, js, etc. At 13 I published my first app, Writer, that currently has around 25,000 users. At 14 I bought myself a Canon T6S with the money I earned from Writer and taught myself photography. Keep in mind these weren't just hobbies, these were full-blown ""I wanna do this for the rest of my life"" passions. With every new creative endeavor, I would find myself completely engulfed in it. Lost in it to the point where it was the only thing on my mind every single day. I would isolate myself from others for days, even weeks just to try and master the subject I had been attached to. This short, generalized ""list"" (?) of what I've accomplished so far doesn't even include a few other things I've dabbled in in between these passions, all of which were like minipassions.

Right now, I feel like I have nothing left. I'm not interested in anything at all. I feel like a retired professional who spends his days laying around, contemplating, and drowning away his sorrows by drinking and smoking weed, both of which I have done. Every time I try to get back into any of the subjects I've mentioned, I feel empty. I don't feel that urgency to create, or that feeling of curiosity I used to feel.

I think part of my desensitized personality has to do with the habitual self-destructive behaviors I've engaged in since I was 7. I masterbate to porn almost daily. I listen to music way too much. I stress myself out over seemingly nonstressful things. I overanalyze. And above all, I'm just a total mess. Recently I've been trying to counteract these habits by sleeping earlier, working out, socializing more, but I'm completely lost in the sense that I don't know what the fuck to do with my life anymore. I don't know what I want to be anymore and I'm tired of it. It's annoying how I'm constantly changing passions, it doesn't really allow me to completely master that subject completely.

I know this was a long post, but I feel like this was the only way to express myself so that people can really understand and give me advice accordingly. I appreciate all your help if any, and I'm eager to hear what you guys have to say!",28Sep2017,4
142,"My coworker is a nice lady who means well but yesterday she tripped and fell and could not get up. I'm a teacher and she's my assistant. Basically it took a good ten minutes plus a parent helping me to get her up. She cannot bend and lift herself so it was very hard.

Anyway the children were fine but so many thoughts rushed through my head. Like what if one of the children suddenly got hurt too, or what if one decided to run out the class or cause a ruckus.

Next morning I spoke to her about my concerns. She stated that it's not like she'd ever be alone, the kids could go get help, I could try and Walkie talkie another teacher, I could call out loud for help etc.

She said she thought she was going to die when she fell. She got a doctors note saying she can't do anything at work for the week.

I'm thinking wtf you're going to be on the floor, unable to move and you're going to get the children to be responsible for you? I can understand people having a heart attack or passing out but Jesus falling on the floor and becoming immobile means you probably shouldn't be doing this physical, active, teaching, mobile, lifting, bending, playing, sports, running type of job. Its teaching not office work man we are here to interact with the children not sit all day!

I did not say any of this I did not want to be ableist. I said look we should talk with the supervisor to think of solutions so I am not so worried and stressed. 

I feel like I'm working with a beat up old lady who can barely walk. She's helpful with paperwork, setting up the class, cleaning, prepping, organizing, good thoughts and ideas but she cannot do physical work too well. I feel like I'm working with a volunteer.

I'm 21 and in first year of tertiary high school, it kinda sucks that everyone else is only 17 or 18 but I can deal with it.

The problem here is that I feel lost and helpless at school, I can't function alone and constantly need help from the teachers to understand stuff or my classmates. 
I don't feel like I'm dumber than anyone but my head shuts down during instructions, and I have a natural tendency to go to others for help, but think I'm becoming a burden to others, the other day a teacher angrily told me that I'm like a child, and the worst thing is that I think she's right. Now I'm terribly stressed when I go in the class, and I realized that I don't function normally.
I really want to keep studying but I fear failing the year because I don't have my shit together and the age gap between me and the other students will only deepen.

149,"Background: Back in January, My friend K and I were thinking about going on a trip to Chicago during her fall break (October).  Planning was very minimal, just threw out some dates. K announced in May that she and her husband are expecting their first baby due in January 2018. When she told me, she was still very excited to go to Chicago, but still not many plans were thrown out. At the end of August/Beginning of September, I messaged her to start the planning process. She was very much on board and seemed excited about the trip. Then her car broke down and she had to purchase a new car. She called and said financially she didn't think she would be able to go on the trip, but maybe we could take a day trip somewhere else.  Things happen and I completely understand, however I really want her to have this opportunity before the baby comes to enjoy a weekend away from her small town.

I am in a position where I would be able to use airline points and hotel points to pay for a considerable amount of the trip for her and I, which would be roughly 400 she wouldn't have to spend. I am in a better financial place where I would be able to pay for other things if needed  (subway passes, dinners, attractions). I would like to offer this option to her, but am not sure how to without it sounding awful. My thought was maybe I offer it to her as a baby shower gift, or just a thank you for being a friend trip. I know if I were K and someone offered this to me, I would feel worried and like I would need to pay, but I honestly do not care/ will not be upset if she doesn't. My other thoughts of course goes to What if she used the finance excuse because she didn't want to go.

153,"So I'm a college student currently living with my girlfriend in an apartment, our first time living alone with a partner and so far it's been pretty good. However like most partners, especially testing the waters and learning to live with one another, we aren't 100% amazing all the time. Since getting here (2 months ago or so), we have gotten into two major arguments, wherein my already loud as a person girlfriend yelled. The two arguments were done within an hour, and happened two days in a row, right after ""quiet hours"" began. I was not aware that our neighbor (we have an end apartment) could hear us, nor did I know they were bothered, however I was definitely concerned that may be the case. I know this is entirely our fault, and we've worked on our issues to avoid fighting again.

It's been two weeks since then. Noise has not risen above a normal level, and though my girlfriend talks louder than average, I don't think it would be loud enough on its own to be a disturbance. That being said, we received a complaint about the noise, specifically citing loud arguments. Our office is very efficient, so it seems like the complaint was a new one, but keep in mind it's been a solid half a month since we last had a fight. I'm now concerned that we are being too loud in our day to day life or that we've passed off our neighbor(s) considerably, and am scared that this will show up next time we try and rent. I'm worried even if we don't ever have another fight (which we're now very conscious of, trust me) there will be another complaint. I'm also worried about the judgement from the staff and how this may affect us moving, or receiving references in the future. 

I know noise like that is unacceptable, but now I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, because I hadn't believed us to have been that loud and we are not frequent fighters or anything if the sort. My girlfriend says it's fine- because it happened to her at old apartments, and she says we just need to fix it, but I'm not so sure...

156,"So yesterday I was told by my boyfriend that he figured out why I had trouble making friends. He said that I do some things that could make people uncomfortable. Now, I do realize at times I can be a bit much for people, merely because of the fact that I get social anxiety and I get so anxious that I seem to talk fast and I get jumpy. 

Here is a list from what I took from the conversation 
-I talk really fast, it’s hard to follow what I’m saying
-I make jokes that are unappealing, and I am left being the only one laughing
-I cannot see when the person wants to end the conversation and keep talking
-I always need to get my say in
-I tend to interrupt people on a regular basis. 

I would say now thinking back all of those things have happened before. The last is one that seems to be the worst. I believe it could be that I have ADD (diagnosed by a doctor and on meds) and when I think of something I have a feeling that I need to say it before I get distracted by the next thing.

181,"I (23, M) went on a date with a girl a few months ago. She is an amazing, smart, pretty person (21) and I really enjoyed the night with her. You could say that I was into her, but since I just met her, I was still open to other dates. We started dating, and after 3-4 weeks I went on 2 dates with other women. Both those dates were a lot of fun, and I ended up sleeping with both girls. The first girl who I was still seeing found out, and I ended up hurting her feelings. She told me she had some guys not be trustworthy with her in the past, and that is was something she was really insecure about. To be honest i thought as it as a little possesive, but I could empathize when she told me her story. I promised her to not date other people anymore. We've been dating for a few months now, and I'm really doubting about my future with this girl. She needs a lot of affirmation from my side, and is pretty sensitive. I dont share those two traits with her, and find it pretty difficult to deal with. It seems that no matter what I say or do, she always end ups doubting if I'm still into her. And I try to convince her. A lot.

I really like her though, and she is one of the most amazing persons I've ever met. I don't want her to be hurt again. Yesterday night we got into a fight while she was drunk and trying to convince me for her to come over and stay the night at my place. She knew I was ill and still wanted to go to my 8:30 lecture, which is the reason I already told her it wasnt a good plan. She again took it really personal, and made a big drama about it. Of course she was drunk, and normally doesnt make such a big fuss about it, but I'm a little done dealing with all those insecurities and giving that much affirmation all the time.

I told her this morning that I need some time to think about 'us'. She took this very personal and I think she's really afraid that I'm going to leave her. 

And I just dont know what to do. I don't know how to deal with somebody who's that insecure,and I'm tired of trying to convince her. I also realise it's because what other people did to her and I feel really sorry for her.

 Has anyone ever had to deal with an insecure partner while being pretty confident yourself? Is it a dead end? Or is there a solution that causes less friction?

185,"I'm going to community college and every class this semester the instructor said ""introverts need to come out of their shell."" The class that really upsets me is math, the teacher literally said he won't accept work from loners and that he's going have us make friends. My English class instead has us get in groups of 2 but it has to be with someone new each week. Every class, every day, has a group assignment now. This is my last semester, I just need to finish this semester and move on but every class makes me want to jump off a building. I've missed several classes so far and if I miss more I'm sure I'll get dropped or fail. I don't know who to complain too or what. The syllabus for all the classes say to bring up any concerns regarding disability to a specific office but they dont help with mental issues just things like deafness and stuff and even then require a doctor's note. I figured a community college would thrive to be inclusive but all my professors really seem to hate shy kids. I don't know if this can be solved, I hope so. Thanks.",28Sep2017,90

187,"(excuse my english, as it is not my first language) I (21F) have been going trough a lot of stress lately. In summer my parents had a car accident (in which no one was seriously harmed but it was enough for my grandmother to spend several weeks in pain, laying in bed as we took great care of her), my sister left to have an internship abroad, had a few burocratic issues applying for master's degree and went on dates with guys from apps until I met the man I love, who basically used me as a rebound (break story if you care for the details: https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/712p37/cant_get_him_out_of_my_head_this_hurts_love_hurts/) As if the heartbreak and usual feeling of desolation didn't weight enough on me, the course I'm taking, where I'm taking, fucking sucks (it's a master's degree in Multimedia Art)! I really wanted to specialize in the area of audiovisuals, to get familiarized with video and image software and learn digital animation, image and video production and post-production techniques. I wanted to apply in this particular school where they offer internships with corporations, but instead I ended up doing it in my shit homeschool (due to some problems getting the credits to finish graduation), where they make it all too conceptual and theorical. Besides there is no one in class who I feel like I click with. I am very shy and don't cope well with new beginings, having to interact with new people with the unavoidable expense of getting awkward. This blows. I can't concentrate in class. I can't sleep at night. It hurts to get up in the morning. It feels like I'm about to fall into an abyss. Which day deeper into the hopelessness pit, demanding more and more effort to pull myself together until my strenght drains away. Whether I go, whatever I do, there has always been this feeling of desolation that follows me, keeping me ""updated"" of my little big misfortunes and reminding me of the past. I am helpless. Art and intoxication have been my coping methods. Yet sometimes it feels worse. The rupture made it worse. I hardly find any motivation to persue, leading me to a point where I face death as a path. Yesterday, once again, I contemplated the idea of suicide. I don't know anymore what I'm up to. I feel like I'm stuck. I'm scared that one day I will have enough courage to end it once and for all, because I feel horrible imagining the grief I would cause to my family.

189,"I got a second job a while back just by walking into the place and asking for it. They said I could start right away as in on the spot.

I worked there for a few days but with my main job taking priority I had to leave the second job.

They didn't really seem to care, from all the people I talked to it seems like the longest standing employee there was only a few months. Everyone else has only been working there for a few weeks at best. 

When I told them I had to quit they told me to ""take care"" in a text message. After that I told them I still wanted my check and I said I could come by to pick it up. They then told me they need all of my personal information over a text message so they could process my check. I told them that I didn't feel comfortable with just texting this person all of my info and said I'd rather do it in person. I then asked for the paperwork to fill out which you'd do at a proper job no problem but they told me to just come in with all of my information written on some paper and give it to someone 'up front' and that after I do that my check can be issued at a later date.

That seems sketchy as hell to me. I know that no one has worked there for even 3 months without quitting, they picked me up pretty much with no questions asked and now they're saying that me just putting all of my personal information on a sheet of paper and just giving it over to someone upfront is the only way they have of processing my information to give me a check.

198,"So I am a 22yo female that has been dog sitting for neighbors, friends, friends of friends, and have steadily increased my network. I just recently picked up a job letting out an 8 month old havanese puppy. At the last minute the mom also asked if I could put her 7 year old on the bus on Monday and Wednesday this week . I agreed since she seemed a little desperate and I have some experience baby sitting. 

This is where it gets sticky. I have first hand seen how this 7 year old treats the dog and I am really uncomfortable with it. For example the Mom requested I leave a leash on the dog when she is outside of her crate incase I need to grab her for some reason (which I immediately thought was odd). The problem is the child likes to take the leash and swing it around like a jump rope to annoy the dog and then promptly yells at the dog when she tries to chew the leash. She swings a knotted rope in the dogs face and ""accidentally"" lets it go so it hits the dog in the face. Additionally the puppy is teething and will nip every now and then and the child will grab the dogs head and force it onto the wood floor pretty forcefully. Finally she will tie the dogs leash around a bar stool, charge the dog, then when the dog chases after her she goes just outside of the dogs reach and laughs at her. 

I am incredibly uncomfortable with this situation but I do not know the family very well because they are friends of an acquaintance and this is the first week I have assisted with the dog/family. I have considered contacting the ASPCA but I don't want to press charges or get them in trouble. I just want them to respect the responsibility of having a dog and possibly get the kids to understand that the dog is a companion not a toy. The mom also told me that they will leave the dog in their room sometimes because her boys (3 teenagers) do not treat the dog well (I do not know the extent of their ""abuse"" (for lack of a better word) towards the dog but I would imagine it is worse than how the girl treats it. 

I want to confront the mom and bring up my feelings and concerns but again I do not know her very well and I am not sure if she would actually listen. Would anyone be willing to give some guidance here? Am I being too paranoid?

Thanks in advance :)

TL;DR I am concerned about dog abuse, don't know the family well, and am trying to figure out how I should handle the situation.",28Sep2017,1
199,"24 year old Male, Living in SF bay area.

Ive had a history of car problems. Long story short, over a year ago, my car was stolen from my parking space (96' Accord...easy steal) and the car I bought with that insurance money broke down a few months after purchase. This forced me to quit my job out of town, as it was near an hour-long commute. I have been without a car ever since, and I have been bumming rides to work with my mom for more than a year. 

Fast forward 5 months. I landed a warehouse job, however I just left my job I had gotten a few months ago, due to highly unethical behavior from very toxic coworkers. Talking driving drunk on forklifts type deal.

I don't have any capital, maybe 1000$. I have been paying bills as mom lost her job a year ago and hasn't been working since. She is in a legal dispute with her work. She was let go after 20+ years at the school, and cannot legally work until she is cleared from her doctors.

I am getting denied on my car loans, and then being counter-offered with absurd interest rates of near 20% from dealerships, since I have not bad credit, but no credit. Now that I have no job, I can lie to dealers or banks about my employment, but this isn't the right thing to do. I know they may call my employer, and find out I don't actually work and was lying about the application. I also tried renting a vehicle through Lyft, but they won't allow it for an affordable rate since I am under 25 years old. My mom is growing old and dire of taking me everywhere when she has shit to do too. So I need a car, but Im lost and feel very stuck.

 I know I need a job of some sort to provide income and proof of income towards a car. I have an interview today for a part time position. I plan on going back to school, so my previous job I had just gotten at full-time wouldn't have worked out anyway. I planned on getting a vehicle so that I can also Lyft/Uber in my spare time for extra cash. But I need a car obviously to do all this.  Where do I go from here? I am completely lost.

Then one day we got in an argument and he stated he would ""Never cheat on me""? I was confused because we never stated we were even involved in a romantic way. We would hangout and hookup but I didn't think it was serious? Then after he told me that, he had told me he ""Didn't was a long distant relationship or anything that diverts him from his studies"" I automatically locked that in my head and assumed ""okay, he's transferring to a more populated school; more and new people to experience, whatever"". He would still call me the ""relationship"" names and I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. When it got closer to him leaving I began to distance myself from him because I did not want to stay close with him... I was afraid because I knew he was leaving. The night before he left he came and said goodbye, and when he was leaving my place he began to cry. I didn't know why. He did introduce me to his family throughout the time we spent in the summer and all of his friend and we would hangout with them, but then he told me he didn't want a long distance relationship?

CPS has been over there multiple times, but nothing has ever happened. I don't know how nothing has ever happened but it hasn't. A neighbor of mine said he has seen the dad out to eat with the sheriff from our town, so I think maybe that's what has been keeping them safe in their shitty ways. Connections. Blehg. 
Anyways. My neighbors and I hadn't witnessed any abuse going on for a while. We WOULD witness them drinking liquor in the middle of the day out on their porch. (small yards, not hard to see what others are doing. we're basically all on top of each other) We've also seen them rolling up blunts, and smoking in front of their kids. 
After CPS not doing anything my neighbors and I kind of gave up, but it's making me sick to my stomach. The mom is pregnant again and I feel so sorry for her future child.

ill probably talk a lot about myself

im 2nd year in community college ( equivalent ) and i have been dreaming to get into the tops school. these usually only accept those who follow a more intense undergrad program ( equivalent ). i shouldve gone to these but i was dumb as fuck when i graduated from highschool.

but ive learned that they also accept a small amount of people who come from community college ( equivalent ). this is where the dream started. i saw how many seat were given to people like me, ive asked my professors about it, he told me top20 of our class of 400 get a seat at the most prestigious school in the country. and kept on dreaming and dreaming and dreaming.

and then, i started to look up for actual facts, and the dream died out.

people like me have actually small to no chance at all. they mostly accept people who followed math and physics programs. i did computer science. i thought about following extra math courses on my own but... no one take seriously people who self taught math. and even if computer science had a chance, most of the seat i was talking about were actually given to prestigious community college and internal student from like harvard and shit. then i kept on looking up more disappointment.

theres also the fear of disappointing your parent, the fear that your younger sibling and friends become much more successful than you

its crazy how from one day to another, i went from studying from 8am to 11pm to playing overwatch and gaze into the void, feeling like life is pointless, thinking about how trash my future will be, how my friends will part their way from me... im just waiting there, for some miracle to happen, for someone with good authority that will tell me "" you can do it "" or just a way out.

Long story short, I am 3 years into my professional work life and I somehow just can't get myself to get out of bed at all.

Some days it's easier but on some days I just don't feel like getting up at all. It's horrible, as I do want to go to work, but somehow I just end up not going there on time.

My boss never sees it as a big problem as he knows I finish off my work even though I'm late, but I do feel pretty bad about it.

I have been working part time during school and college for over 6 years, and I was maybe late twice. But now I'm almost constantly late even though I really rather not.

When I'm late I'm just lying on my bed, sometimes sleeping but most of the time I'm awake. But I just find it so hard to get myself out of it. And while it doesn't sound like it, I do really like my job and everything around it. I'm also not terrible at what I'm doing, moving up the ladder once a year.

205,"This is a lot of jumbled thoughts about how I was raised and how it's affecting me today. I don't know if it has any effect on any of this but I am now 19. I am female.

I was raised in a Christian household. We went to church every Sunday morning &amp; evening, and every Wednesday night. We helped at church events. We pray(ed) before every meal. Etc etc etc. 

My first church was very...intense. I went there from when I was born to when I was around 9 or 10, at which point they kicked my mom out of the choir for divorcing my dad (no consequences for him, who cheated on her).

Sermons were shouted. Lots of ""hellfire"" and The Fear Of God. Everybody speaking in tongues, kids pretending to so that they would fit in.

One thing that was stressed was selflessness. I don't know if it was stressed to the point that I feel it was, or if I'm imagining. I'm probably imagining. But I am naturally a very empathetic person. As a child, I donated money to charities, gave away my belongings to the less fortunate, etc. I feel like I'm bragging by saying this, but I believe I am a selfless and generous person. My intention is not to boast about anything, and if it comes across that way, I'm very sorry. I don't know what else to do at this point.

I think that my natural empathy, plus my Christian upbringing has made me very unhealthy. I don't want to admit it, because my focus shouldn't be on myself, but others. I don't know if this is how everyone feels and I just can't take it. I don't know if I'm overreacting and if I'm really selfish (I know I am; everyone is).

I just feel like trying to help everyone is getting to be too much. I keep putting aside my own feelings so that I can console a friend or try to help them through their problems. Because I am a Christian, I should put others above myself. I know this sounds like bragging, please know that I really am at a loss here.

                Really need some perspective, suggestions from other parents or young adults. 
 
My son is in his late 20’s. He has a Master’s and got a great job right out of college and relocated for it. He’s always kept to himself though. Most of his answers to my questions are simple ‘yes’ and ‘no’. I would encourage him to get involved in his new town’s activities, but he would just stay at home and not make new friends or date. 

One day out of the blue, during a weekend visit with us. He suddenly tells us he has a girlfriend he met in a video game he plays online. She came out of nowhere. He answered my questions about her, but said he didn’t know much about her family since she doesn’t speak with them, but that she had no kids. They spent a weekend together (this also bothers me) when they met in person. She is college-educated at least. I didn’t think much of this relationship, assuming it wouldn’t last.

Fast forward, two months later, he visits me for my birthday and says nothing that weekend about his long-distance girlfriend (this is relevant later). 
2 months after that, I was texting him about future plans over the summer and he suddenly tells me that his new girlfriend moved to his current town, and he wanted to tell me before things got awkward in my planning events over the summer. When I asked if she was living with him, he simply replied yes.  He wasn’t even going to tell me they were living together unless I asked!
Anyways, I met her and she’s nice. She’s 5 years older than he is. During her first visit, she told me I could ask her any questions to get to know her, since she understands how she seemingly has just shown up. I am curious about her past relationship history and family. When I asked about her family, she simply says she doesn’t talk to them anymore since her father was sexually abusive and the family took her father’s side. Again this is suspicious to me. Why not talk to her siblings or mother? How can they “take” sides?

When I asked her when she moved in, she had moved in the week before the birthday weekend! He had not told me! When I asked him why he didn’t bring her, he said because it was my birthday and it would’ve been a distraction to my day of celebrating. 

I just have some red flags since my son didn’t tell me, she just showed up, and she moved in with him so quickly. They’ve been together almost a year now, but he never tells me anything about them. When I ask how things are, he simply says “Great.”

How do I get to know her past? Should I hire a private investigator? This whole thing of meeting online in a game is just bizarre to me.  I like her personality, but wish to know more about her past life. Isn’t it odd how they met? I would have asked her more questions, but I didn't want to be rude. ",28Sep2017,0

211,"Hi, I've never been very good at asking for help/advice... mostly because the people in my life have their own problems and I've never wanted to be a burden, only to try and help. I'm desperate and I don't know who to talk to. 

I'll start at the beginning like any good story does. I was born as a replacement for my brother who passed away, only a few months old. My parents and elder Sister were devastated. After I was born they always told me, 'I was a gift from God'. Yeah, I felt like that was a bit of a burden to live up to. 

During my early years, they treated me like a prince. Especially after they found out that my Father had cancer. He told me that I would need to be the man of the house and look after my mother, He passed away when I was seven. I remember not crying at the funeral, I guess I didn't understand or I just felt empty inside.

My Mother was a wreak but eventually, she remarried but I grew to resent him for shouting at her and leaving her time and time again.

 They tried to help me through my adolescent but I turned to drugs and alcohol for comfort. I somehow managed to finish school and got enough grades to be offered a conditional place at university but I dropped out of my last course and gave up on school. I'd been working in a bar and decided to go full-time to try and support my self fully.

I met my partner at work and we fell in love. We had so much in common and I felt I had met someone I could spend the rest of my lift with. We moved out together but she picked up a drinking problem. It didn't help that I was obsessed with doing drugs and drinking daily. She lost her Job and spent a year with me supporting her but doing nothing other than drinking. She left to go to her parents when she couldn't take it anymore. We kept in touch and I told her I would get clean and do what it took to build a future for us. It's now been 9 months and I'm working as a manager in a storage facility and still clean. 

I don't make great money and I'm in debt but I break even most months. My partner is working again, just as a cleaner but it doesn't stress her out as much as her last job. She has gone through periods of being sober and keeps trying to get better but eventually, it gets the best of her. She becomes borderline psychotic and has even been sectioned by the police once, but normally after a few days binge, we end up in the hospital for 24 hours while they patch her up and We continually attend the local support services regularly.

I constantly feel like I am failing her... I go to the ends of the earth to try and protect her from her self but there is only so much I can do, I have to go to work during the day and she is left alone to stew in her thoughts, depressed and feeling hopeless. Like nothing will change... 

I even started a website, believing that I could create a passive income to be able to support her 24/7, turns out I have no idea what I'm doing and most days I feel brain damaged and drained. I just question myself constantly and put on a brave face to tell her it will all be ok. 

In truth, I'm scared and I don't know what to break this cycle and it's starting to feel hopeless and like I'm losing my mind. People are starting to notice at work because I keep making mistakes.

I feel I can't take any risks because I don't have any margin for error. I can't fail, I can't fall...

213,"I’m currently seeing this guy unofficially who seems like a total sweetheart and someone I could see myself in a relationship with. The only thing that’s currently not great is that he’s in med school ( the goal I’ve had for years) and I’m not even close to getting there yet. He’s telling me about the cool things his class is doing and that he gets to shadow doctors, etc. He’s not doing it to make me jealous in anyways way, just to include me in his daily activities and exciting events, but it’s making me feel really upset and like I’m not good enough/a failure. I want him to be able to tell me about his day and to be proud of him without these self-harming thoughts. Can someone please give me suggestions if they’ve been in a similar situation?

218,"Hi everyone, a little background. I'm 21, a full time junior in college in the US. My family was going through some financial hardships for about 3 years and I had to really financially help them every month but things have finally turned around. They both work now (mom at a school, dad at home) and my mother received a generous sum of money from a personal thing that they are investing and saving. I work part time at school at 11 an hour with only about 10-15 hours a week and only get paid once a month and will be starting an unpaid internship soon. To give a clearer picture, I'll only be getting 420 bucks for a month of work this paycheck. I just started the job and once the semester is over I'll start getting 15-20 a week and go up to 11.50. 

I currently live at home and commute to school. I pay rent (200), plus my phone bill (85), car payment (110-130 a month), and sometimes health insurance (75) and about every 6 months my car insurance (300). I want to start budgeting and saving my money but with the expenses I have, I spend more than I earn. 

I completely understand why I have rent, and bills need to be paid. But would it be wrong for me to negotiate with them on say 250 for everything a month? I feel guilty for even thinking of negotiating but I really need the help. I helped them when they needed the financial help and since things are better, I feel the need to ask for help now. 

Is it wrong of me to ask this? What number would be good for everything?

225,"
This is going to be very long, and I apologize about that. At the bottom I listed my main concerns and questions about everything if you want to get a quick gist of it.

Before I tell you my problem, I’ll start things off by saying, I am gay and in the closet.
Or I should say I am like 70% gay and 30% straight. So a little bisexual if thats more accurate.
 

I have no intention of coming out anytime soon. One reason for this is because I’m still young and still heavily reliant on my parents, and they are not open to homosexuality in any way shape or form. 
Telling them could result in some damaging consequences and as of right now, I am not mentally strong enough to handle coming out. I want to be fully ready and completely content with who I am, and right now I’m not. 


So now I can explain my problem. 
 I met a guy a little under a year ago and since then we have been technically dating. (we are heavily involved with each other but we have never actually said we are dating) 
We met at a bar and I don't know his friends and he doesn't know my friends.
He knows I’m in the closet and how afraid I am of my parents finding out.


So anyways, for the most part things were great. I loved him, he loved me, and we were having a great time in each others presence. 
But recently I have just not been happy with anything. My feelings for him are not as strong as they use to be, and at this point I feel like I’m just leading this guy on.
So recently I have been playing with the idea of ending things with him, but I have no idea how to go about that. I also think that he might be catching on to me seeming less interested. I try not to be obvious in front of him, but you never know.


So the big reason as to why its a complicated and difficult situation is because I don't want anything about this relationship getting out to other people. And our text and other similar things have me so worried that I cant concentrate on anything without the thought of those getting out creeping in my head.

We text like crazy when we’re not with each other and that has been really worrying me, because of how much ‘evidence’ there is within our conversations. 
What if I end things and he gets upset and shows people the evidence of our relationship and all of the things I have said to a man that I am practically dating? 
This would be the end for me at this point of my life, and I don't know if I'm strong enough right now to handle that. 


One thing that makes me feel a little better is that he told me in high school that he was forced out of the closet so he understands the fear of coming out and people finding out.

If I’m coming out, I want to do it myself. I DO NOT want to be forced out of the closet. 
I know one day I’ll have to face who I am, but right now I can’t.

There are some other factors as to why I want to end things, but nothing that major. 
But a big reason for me is just being flat out not happy in this relationship. I don't know how to describe it. I’m just not as happy as I use to be with him. 
But my worries of things getting out worry me A LOT.


When we first started talking I said something stupid out of pressure to get him to like me. I said I’m only gay. I know that wasn't smart, but this was my first relationship and I was worried he wouldn't trust a bisexual. (apparently its common in the gay community to be cautious about dating bisexuals because of the worry of them going off with a girl)
I love men, but if there is a perfect girl for me I wouldn't be opposed to it.


So to sum up this long confusing post here are 3 big reasons as to why I am worried about ending things with this guy.

1. I do not want to upset him and break his heart. (I know that might be inevitable) 

2. I do not want to upset him; him get angry and go off and tell people about everything and show our text.

3. Him not knowing I am actually a little bisexual. I don’t want him to get angry in the future if I ever happen to meet a girl I like and he finds out I sort of lied about being 100% gay and goes off to tell people or even worse the girl.


All of this has been tearing me up inside. I am scared of all of these potential outcomes, and the more I think about them the worst my worries become. 

So should I just ask him to delete our text because of how worried I am of my parents or others seeing them? If he knew how worried I was about this I think he would understand. 
He wouldn't be happy about it but possibly ok with it.

He's actually an understanding guy with a heart so part of me thinks he would willing to do that for me. 

Once again, here are my main concerns. 

1. I do not want to upset him and break his heart. (I know that might be inevitable) 

2. I do not want to upset him; him get angry and go off and tell people about everything and show our text.

3. Him not knowing I am actually a little bisexual. I don’t want him to get angry in the future if I ever happen to meet a girl I like and he finds out I sort of lied about being 100% gay and goes off to tell people or even worse the girl.




tl;dr: I am gay/bisexual in the closet, and I am trying to end a relationship with a man without the biggest secret in my life getting out and without breaking his heart.
I am scared, tired, and unhappy. I just want out.

227,"A little over a week ago I impulse bought a bunny, even though where I live has a no pet policy. I discovered a month ago that one of my housemates has a kitten that she has been keeping a secret, so I figured that I can keep a pet a secret too. The bunny and I have a good thing going and it is very happy and comfortable with me. I am only 19, so I visit my parents once or twice a week. When I told them that one of my housemates has a pet they told me that what she was doing was wrong and that she could get in big trouble if our landlord finds out. I have never been good at keeping secrets, so having this bunny has been stressing me out. I am constantly worried about the landlord coming over (which she only comes over if someone is having a problem, but with four of us living here there's a problem maybe once a month) and I'm also worried about my parents finding out. If my landlord finds out I have a pet I will be fined a large amount and risk being evicted. Regardless my parents will be angry that I bought a bunny against my lease, but if I step forward and ask them if I can keep my bunny at their house until I move to somewhere that allows pets in a year or two, I feel like they will be less mad than if they find out on their own. My mom has always talked about wanting a rabbit and my dad had always wanted another guinea pig (we had one several years back), so I'm sure they will take in my bunny if I needed them too. However, my bunny is very happy right now and we have a good schedule set up: he stays in my bathroom with a fan on at night and whenever I am not home, and he can come into my room whenever I am home. He is also free range right now and loves to run around my room. I never bought him a cage (mainly because the stores were all out) so he just had a litter box that he is already getting good at using. But, my parents house is larger than my little room and it could be dangerous for him to stay free range, so I have no idea what his life would be like there and my parents would probably put him in a cage for most of the day. But also, I am going out of state for a weekend next week and I will have to find someone that I can trust to watch him, which I don't have anyone to ask as of right now and having him already living with my parents I wouldn't have to worry about finding someone I can trust. 
So, my question is should I ask my parents to keep it at they're house, where I don't have to worry about him getting caught, or should I keep him at my place where he is already happy?

228,"Today will be the last day my mom calls me crying over something my sister has stolen from them. This has been going on for years now and it's cost my parents thousands of dollars and it's all been for drugs. Credit cards stolen, checks forged, valuables pawned. I've had it. It breaks my heart to hear my mom cry the way she does. My sister lives at my parents house with her boyfriend and things go missing all the time, but my parents won't do anything about it. They kick out her boyfriend, but he comes back when they're out at work. They won't kick her out because she'd have no where to go.

Advice? ",28Sep2017,1
236,"**TL;DR:** My current job is making me think deep about my passions (makeup/cosmetics) and where I want to be as a professional. Should I go back to school to pursue a science degree (like chemistry) even though I have a (non-science) Master’s? Or should I focus on getting more experience in the field I studied? Any advice concerning fellow women going back into school for science is appreciated.

Some background (wall of text warning!):

I'm looking for advice on career changes. I’m currently 29 years old and I got my bachelor's in interdisciplinary social sciences (poli sci and history) several years ago. After getting my bachelor's, and after a few years working at random jobs not knowing what the hell I was going to do with my life, I thought working in public service was a noble career just right for me. I ended up getting my master's in public administration last year. I currently work as an admin assistant in a non-profit health center. However, I’m having some serious doubt about my work life.

Aside from the fact that I feel stagnant at my job. I’m not sure if the 9-5 office culture is right for me. Everyday feels the same and I can't stand the slow work pace. I feel like I have not grown or learned as much as I could have. The type of work I do is boring. My job is to set up monthly meetings, write minutes/reports for said meetings and miscellaneous data entry. My boss is the Director of Grants and my involvement with her work has been minimal. Recently, I've been given front desk receptionist duties. I have nothing against doing it, but it's not what I was hired to do. I feel like people will never see me as anything else other than a receptionist. My boss and coworker (considerably older than me) complain about the unorganized culture of our workplace. Although I try not to openly express my frustrations, their open dissatisfaction has greatly increased my own. It's gotten to the point where I don’t care about the work I do. I dread going into work, even though my job is ‘easy.’ My boss herself expressed to me that she feels stagnant at her position too. It’s clear sign for me to move on from this place.

I fantasize about being somewhere else, but I'm scared of falling again into the 'admin assistant' trap (if that makes sense): the boring duties and the tendency for people to underestimate your knowledge. But I guess these problems exist in any job on earth. I feel that my resume is not at all impressive. I have worked at random admin office jobs at different companies: I did income taxes at some point, I worked as an admin assistant construction company, was a volunteer at a women's rights organization. I’m scared of not moving ‘up’, whatever that means. I sometimes feel like I'm only good enough for admin assistant jobs and not much else. It doesn't help that I also feel like I don't know anything, despite my two degrees. (All I know are internet memes...). I've been at my current position for 2 years, waiting to see if things changed, but they haven't. Unfortunately, I'm feeling too scared/(lazy?) to quit and search for something else.

This situation has me thinking more about my passions. I love makeup and cosmetics and spend a good amount of time everyday reading about new products and product reviews. I would love to understand why products work on a scientific level, and the formulation that goes behind the products we enjoy. I am considering following a career in cosmetic science, but I think I would need to start with a degree in science. I had been intimidated by math and science in middle/high school, but always held an interest in science. As an adult now, I think I can probably be successful in completing a degree. I don't have any major commitments, and I think I'm still young enough, so I think it can be possible. I know there's a lot of work involved...I guess I want to do it because I think it'll be an impressive accomplishment. I'm not 100% sure what it's like to be a woman in the science field, etc.

Just wanted to know if its too late/too soon for a career change...

237,"English isn't my first language. Kindly, correct me. Thank you. 

So, I believe that I have mentioned this before. My thirteen year old brother, will, force my six year old sister to play basketball, with him. Indoors. 

My brother will yell at her, that she does not get enough exercise, that she needs to be active, for sixty minutes a day. This, obviously results in her, coming back to me, all red, breathing very heavily, and crying. If she fails to comply to his rules, he will repeatedly throw the ball at her, hardly. 
If that does not work, he'll slap her, very hard, multiple times, if needed. and the physique, which he had worked hard for, at the gym, is quite a horrid combination.

My sister had informed her school counselor, 6+ times. Her school counselor will tell her, the following : "" Oh no. Hang in there. Think of happy things. "" 

Yes, I am aware that she must be busy, with her job, but really? You can't devote, at least a few minutes, composing a rational solution, to this ongoing problem? My sister can't come home, without trying to be very quiet, so that my brother doesn't hear her come. She will start crying, when she hears her name called. 

I'm thinking of calling her about this. My dad can't do anything, at 60+ years of age. My brother has slapped my mother, which my mother completely forgives. In fact, she adores him.

240,"Hi. I want to gift someone who's in a very bad place money to buy a house so I can help end some of her troubles. I want to give roughly 200K. I need advice.

She was just robbed-first step is buying her a home security system which I'm doing ASAP, but the truth is she lives in a house that is FALLING. APART. Literally. And in a terrible neighborhood. The real estate in the surrounding cities (which are safer) is not expensive, so she could get a much nicer home for between 100 and 200K. My boyfriend also has $0 to his name.

241,"Sorry this is so long. Tried to summarize, but it’s a long story. Here goes: 

I had my keys stolen yesterday afternoon. I didn’t realize this until I had gone out to go to work the next morning and my door wouldn’t open. (I have keyless entry) Thinking I may have locked my keys in my car, I unlocked it with my app, got in and tried starting it. An alert popped up on the screen “no key detected” F*%k. So I freaked out and went back in the house to search for my keys, no luck. Upon going back to my car, I found that my backseat had been trashed and that my xbox was missing. I called the cops and filed a police report and then went to the dealership to have them get me a new key/reprogram both and disable the missing key so no one could steal my car. I asked them three times if the key was for sure disabled and they assured me each time that it was. Fast forward to that night. Got home around 9:30pm, went to bed around 11. When I woke up this morning I had a notification on my phone from 12:11am that said “low washer fluid”. I knew that it only sends me those alerts when my car was running. So, panic attack ensues and I check the tracking on my app for my car. Sure enough, my car is a half mile away. (Lying a$$holes at the dealership) Without thinking, I threw on some clothes and ran to where it said my car was. (Very stupid, never do that) I got there and couldn’t find it so I figured it must be parked in a garage. My finger was reaching for the lock button on my spare keys to honk the horn when my mom called. (Thank god) Needless to say she screamed at me and told me to call the cops. Called cops, sprinted back to the house, and my mom left work and met me there. While we waited for the cops my dad downloaded my app and tracked the car again. It was moving. He followed the app trail and eventually had eyes on the car. My mom and I were waiting with one cop while my dad was o the phone feeding us information as to where this guy was going. He eventually stopped at a dollar store and the police caught up to him. Arrested and thrown in the back of a squad car, I got my car back. The police said that they found cocaine and marijuana in the car and that the man had been smoking both cigarettes and weed inside it. When they opened my car door I almost threw up. The smell of weed/cigarettes mixed with cologne(that they had left in my backseat and spilled everywhere) was so intense that my eyes were watering. We finished searching the car and realized that my $115 lifting belt was now missing. So my question is, with this man arrested and significant proof that he is the one who stole my Xbox the night before and my belt today, is there any way to either get a search warrant for his home or to make him pay for my stuff?

I am a young male (19) who could play a role as low as 14. I have potential to be a big star because I have a big heart, good looks, acting ability, awesome personality, photogenic, hard worker, etc... I am a big prospect for the hollywood at the moment.

All I want to do is get myself into the position to empower others on these topics. This being said... I was asked to play the main character in a art house, indie film, about gender fluidity.

The producer wants me (as a young lovable kid with his own social problems, growing up in the south) to be the face of the movie. Meaning I will be promoting it heavily on social meadia. They are dropping 750,000$ on just PR work. I will be shown on ellen degeneres and many other talk shows, radio shows, interviews, etc... This will possibly boost me up very high especially if the movie catches. This is not a movie to make money, it is a movie directly made for hollywood and for kids who are depressed, questioning themselves, feeling misunderstood, etc... 

What is the problem you may ask?

There will be a good amount of nude scenes and sex scenes with me. Both with a guy and a girl. It is a sexual movie... obviously not a porno or anything, but still I will be fully naked for only glimpses. I am comfortable with myself and its not the nudity I am worried about. Other than my poor parents seeing this and loosing all my friends with far rightside views.... I am worried if this will ruin my future chances of being a mainstream actor. Will participating in this nudity ruin my chances of being anything else? Will this stop me from being able to play as a young kid/highschooler considering that is my most valuable trait? By saying yes to this, I am giving up my life that I once new because the small right side town i am from will not accept me... But by saying yes I maybe able to empower so much people. Please someone help me think this through.",28Sep2017,6

246,"A couple of weeks ago I went on a job interview that I didn't think I would actually like, I ended up being highly desired by the employer. The job interview was for a ""network engineer"" position, which was basically a placeholder since the current IT director is moving to a CIO position and he was looking for his replacement, after which I would become IT director. The company is a retirement facility management company with about 20 location. I wasn't to fond of working with retirement facilities, but it doesn't really matter since I am in IT. They ended up making an offer and I rejected it since its less than what I'm making now, then a second offer came with a salary slightly higher than I am making now which I also rejected. I told them the offer was decent, but I thought a lot about the commute and that driving in downtown traffic would extend my current commute by over an hour, depending on traffic. I currently drive in the opposite direction of the flow of traffic, which makes my commute to work pretty quick. After the rejection, they gave me a call and said that I could work from home and setup an additional office, aside from my corporate office downtown, at a facility near me, which one happens to be about 3 miles away form where I live now and that was enough entice for me to take the offer.

I went to my current boss, which I am currently and IT director of a company with about 250-300 employees, and turned in my 1 month notice. He responded with ""your not quitting!"" and has been trying to convince me to stay for the last week, which is hard for me since I've been at this company for 6 years now and am pretty valuable to the company. Currently he is offering more money and a company truck with gas paid for I could also use for personal use. The problem with my current job is that it is very political, there is always unnecessary drama with management, my IT budget is very tight(making it harder to make advancements), and the benefits are very sub par.

I'm looking at the move as an career gain and not a financial gain. The retirement company has about 1000 employees and I would get to work with a lot of new ""cloud"" technologies. Also my resume doesn't have a lot of work history and this would give me 2 IT director positions what would potentially open more opportunities for me later in my career and potentially make me desirable for another IT director position later. I'm also graduating with a computer science degree mid next year which both companies are very supportive of, and thus the reason why I couldn't do the commute initially. 

I need advice on what I should do, on one hand I could stay with the company I'm with till I graduate and take the higher pay with the company vehicle, or on the other hand I could make a move to the other company and be in a lot less stressful environment and be able to build my resume further. I can't decide between the two, initially it was easy until my current boss said you cant leave and is willing to do whatever it takes to keep me here.",28Sep2017,2

Is he most likely doing that thing of when a guy says all this shit about how awesome you are and how much they like you to get you to like them more, so that you will be convinced to sleep with them?

250,"I have a rather long backstory to go with this question. A little over a year ago, my husband and I gave a dog to our neighbors (and best friends at the time) because we didn't have the means to care for her at the time. We were friends with them for a little while before they moved next door to us and over the last year, we have come to realize that they are terrible and we're no longer friends. We gave our dog to them when we were still friends shortly after they moved next door. They kept her outside, which is fine because she was a rather large dog that we didn't have the means or room to accommodate at the time.

That brings us to issue one. Where we are, it is illegal to leave a dog tethered outside. They are supposed to have a fenced in area and not to be tied. However, as they were our friends, we overlooked the problem. Also, she had plenty of room, never got tangled, and had shade and shelter, so we didn't think much of it. Even after we had our falling-out, she appeared to be taken care of. She is a very fluffy dog, so she didn't appear to have any issues.

Over the last year, these people had several animals die on them, including but not limited to two other dogs that starved to death that they got after we gave them our dog. They have had animal control called on them several times due to the dog we gave them being tethered and the conditions that a second dog was being kept in. Other than leave warning after warning, animal control did absolutely nothing. We wanted to get her back badly, but as she was now their dog, there was no legal way to get her without them giving her to us, which was pretty much out of the question given how our friendship ended.

Today, she showed up at our doorstep having broken the rope she was tied to. She was terribly thin, dehydrated, and dirty. I'm unsure what to do because I don't want to just give her back to continue her cycle of neglect, but I don't want to be in any legal trouble either. I also refuse to have her sent to a pound or humane society. As sad as it is, it is rare for larger dogs that aren't puppies to get adopted out and I couldn't handle not knowing whether she was happily adopted or put to sleep.

TL;DR: I gave a dog away a year ago and she showed back up in far worse condition than she was given away in.

251,"I am having a slight personal problem with transactions showing up on my bank statements. The past two bank statements I've gotten in the mail have shown multiple transactions that weren't mine. I've checked my Microsoft transaction history and cross referenced it with these statements and found that some of these I could not claim absolute responsibility for.

Here is where the dilemma is, my absolute best friend I met online, we trust eachother with most everything, please don't judge me for this but I gave him my bank account info. I know it isn't him he sent from the last statement, as he sent me screenshots of his Microsoft transaction history. My main reason for bringing that up is that if I do tell the bank and they investigate or something as they might. I don't want it to end up at his doorstep and me to have to explain this.

I don't know if I am overreacting, I asked my dad when I first noticed it and he said to wait for the next bank statement to come in before I start worrying.

252,"Hey, I'm 21F and I am still a virgin. I was never ready for sex when I was in relationships and I haven't met anyone in a while, nor have I been in the best life situations to be thinking about having sex. 
I met a guy this year and I think he's alright and I'm 100% sure that he would have sex with me if I initiated it. At this point in my life I feel like sex could be fun, idk, I somewhat want to do it, but people tell me I should wait until I meet someone I love. I haven't known this guy very long and I don't love him, but I think he's alright and he sexy enough to have sex with. Is this a bad idea? Should I wait until I love him/trust him more/meet someone else that I love?
I am also somewhat concerned because I have never seen a unicorn. I know that if you see a unicorn you will not be able to touch them, pet them or ride them if you are not a virgin. Unicorns are very pure creatures and this is why they will not allow themselves to be touched by people who have had sex. I know this is a really far fetched dream but if I stay a virgin for the rest of my life I will be more likely to get the chance to ride a unicorn. Is sex really worth giving up the opportunity to ride a unicorn? I don't know what to think about it and could use some advice.

257,"I will tell you the story to emphasize how much I hate myself right now and I can't imagine how much pain my best friend is in. 
Story:
This past weekend my boyfriend and I  went to a party to celebrate a friends birthday party.   That night my best friend was free and I invited her to come to the party. I was buzzing and was texting my friend that my boyfriend was being lame and not hanging out with me. She started texting my kind words and was on her way.  When she arrived later at the party, the liquor was low, and she mentioned she was pretty drunk but when we hang out we drink more because we rarely get to do that together because of school, work, and family.   We drank a more and started dancing. 

We went outside the place to get some fresh air.  My boyfriend and best friend were talking with a few people. On the other side of us was a group of guys hanging out (I didn't recognize them.) Before you know it my friend leaves our group to hang out with the group of guys. Later I see her smoking a blunt.  In a matter of seconds, I sit done to relax and my boyfriend hangs out with me and I see my best friend leave with a guy. I freaked out and called her from across to street to come back and I call her cell. She answers and tells me she is just going for a walk, I told her to get back here now! My bf (also drunk, he gets super happy and careless) is speaking on top of me telling my friend to go do her own thing and not listen to me. 

(backstory, my friend has a history of getting with guys when she is drunk and I always talk to her about them and she doesn't like that part of herself.)  

I told my boyfriend to fuck off, that she needed to come back.  My boyfriend was so mad because I keep interfering with her life and he started walking away.  I was stuck between following/waiting for my boyfriend and best friend. I choose my boyfriend because I know him, he wouldn't have answered his phone to tell me he was safe. I followed him hoping he would stop and help me get my best friend.  For 2 miles I followed him and I kept calling and texting my friend to go straight home along the way. She answered and told me she was looking for me and I told her my boyfriend started walking home and I followed him.  I told her to PLEASE GO HOME SAFELY! She said OKAY OKAY and she was heading home.   Long story short my sister and her boyfriend came to take us home (if it wasn't implied, we live together). My best friend texted me that she was home and I was happy but scared/upset she left the party to be with a guy. 

Here... this part killed me:

My best friend and I talked last night because she needed to talk. She told what happened after she got back to the party. She walked to the bus to get home, already drunk and high and someone stops their car and the guy was talking to her and she said he persistent and was pushing her into the car. She told him, no but she ended up in his car....This is when she texted me and told me she was home.  She explained that the guy talked to her and feed her and had sex with her. My friend wanted to go home but he kept pushing her to do it.   He dropped her off almost half a mile from her house because he had to go home....

That...... killed me. I hugged her and told her it wasn't her fault. He took advantage and raped her. But she doesn't want to report it. I told her I loved her and she should talk to someone but she said no. She explained that she was just grateful he used condoms and that she deserved it for letting herself get that drunk.   She didn't deserve it. She woke up with hickies or bruises on her body. 


I feel ashamed. I should have never left her. I held her and blamed myself for leaving her but she said I was not to blame but herself. Again, it was not her fault! 


I don't what to do. I listened to her and told her I loved her but I'm so ashamed of myself and blame myself. What can I do for her?

259,"I'm not going to list all the details. I only truly realized my mother is emotionally/vaguely abusive three years ago, and not a day passes that I don't think about the things she's done to me to keep herself safe or to just... have power over me. Some things she does because she's very overprotective (ex: not letting me outside as a kid, traveling to another city as a teen) but other things she just doesn't like me doing it. Because she doesn't agree with it. She is a very religious racist, homophobe, and transphobe, and it took me a while to realize that she has... an awful personality. She is not 100% a terrible horrible person, but she just says these... things. You know. We'll never be able to get along because she's stubborn in her beliefs and her child doesn't want to be on a leash anymore.

I fantasize quite a lot about lashing out at her and making the apartment a mess for her to clean up, so she'll be scared of me. I want to threaten her with lack of help from me financially so she'll never insult me again. I don't want to do these things but I think about it a lot, and it disturbs me. I don't want to be worse than her.

I've wondered if this could do with my PTSD symptoms- you know, just wanting to be angry or something? I never would hurt another person, I just... want to be scarily angry. Should I perhaps seek a PTSD counselor for this so I can stop being so angry at her? Or should I do something unrelated and just... not think about it? That sounds hard to do, but maybe there are techniques out there that might help.

Talking to her will not help because abusers always think they're right and will always try to turn the blame on you. I don't have the mental energy to have a discussion with her, especially when she has a habit of interrupting me and not listening to me. 

Is there anything I can do? Thanks.

260,"I just wanted to preface that due to some circumstances I don't want to get into, we can't really see each other very often right now. 

My girlfriend has been in college for a little over a month now and her quality of life and happiness has plummeted significantly and I'm getting very worried about her, I don't really know what to do to help.

Being in college right now makes her extremely on edge or anxious. A lot of things can send her into an anxiety attack at the moment. Ranging from lower marks (which I suspect comes from anxiety, she's always been an exceptional student and it's part of why I love her), knowing that a test is coming up and she can't bring herself to prepare because she's deep in her own head and can't convince herself that she is capable of doing it, any out of class assignment brings her mood down greatly.

She shakes and almost cries and I don't know how to pull her out of it. So my first question is **What can I do to prevent an anxiety attack when I can see it coming and help her get back to neutral, and how can I console her during anxiety attacks?**

She's losing quite a lot of sleep just thinking about all of the work she has to do and I think that's a big contributor to her emotions being so out of it. She gets tired from being so anxious, and since she lacks proper sleep quite often it just stacks onto it. 

**How can I help her manage her work load and not have to cram for practice?.** This is a big one for me, I really want to help her manage her time more efficiently. 

But most of all, I want to help her before she gets deeper into her own head. I really want to help her and I've been doing my best for it, but I just can't figure out what I can to do really do this.


Thank you to anyone who answers. I really love her with all of my heart and she's helped so much ever since we've met. ",28Sep2017,3
261,"Hi All,

I (30 F) have a friend (36 F) who is the most negative person in my life. Since she was little, she's wanted to grow up, get married, have babies, and take care of everyone. She's a successful professional, attractive, and has several hobbies/interests. She's been on and off of various online dating sites for several years, but tends to have less-than-stellar judgement (IMO) on what men to meet. Even if she's not totally sold on the guy, and even if she's just been on one date, she falls into a depression if they reject or ghost her. She says the same thing to me every time, ""I really don't think it's going to happen for me"" (meaning getting married). She then proceeds to delete all dating profiles and social media accounts.

This has been the sequence/circle of events for the past 4 years. She has literally brought up the idea of an arranged marriage a handful of times (she's Maltese). She becomes very sensitive and will snap at me if I try to joke or make light of the situation. I've tried to comfort her, and remind her of everything good going on in her life. I worry that she's putting SO much emphasis on finding a husband, instead of working on finding happiness inside of her. She's been to talk therapy before, but stopped going a couple years ago.

It's getting to the point where she's bringing me down, and her friendship is becoming more of a stressor than something pleasurable in my life. I really hope I'm not sounding insensitive or selfish, but I really just don't know what to do. There's only so many times you can say, ""I'm sorry that happened to you. I understand how hard this is"".

272,"I am a non union government employee in Canada. I started my position about 7 years ago and was told that although the current position was a .67 ETF but additional hours average out to a 0.8 - 0.9 EFT. They had put in a request to have the position  increased. About 6 months into the position  we were amalgamated into another region. As such my increase in EFT didn't happen but I was still able to work up to about a 0.87 EFT.



2 years ago we got a new manager (I have 6 but this is my directing one) and my 0.4 and 0.2 coworkers quit.  There are no plans to fill these positions. When the manager started she said I was no longer allowed to use my discression and had to have prior approval for any additional hours.



This has basically ended in me only getting paid for 0.67 while constantly staying late due to the increased workload. My boss is routinely  impossible to contact and a lot of my additional hours are not forseeable. (I work in health. People dying, helping the public, urgent paperwork with tight deadlines.) 



I got called in for a meeting in April regarding ""performance issues."" This meeting was basically me getting in trouble for not doing what was once the 0.4 and 0.2 positions work (which I am not qualified) and a ""we known there is a lot on your plate. Unfortunately we cannot increase your EFT due to the current fiscal climate."" My boss was going to check in with me weekly/monthly and remind supervisors to complete delegated work more timely. I would have a follow up in july.



My July follow up never happened. And neither did my weekly meeting outside of the first month. I just got emailed that I am having another meeting regarding performance issues early october.



I am very annoyed. I've looked into similar positions in my region and they are generally staffed to a 1.6 with fewer duties and clients.  



The only reason I can think that I would be called in is because my managers and lots of supervious took vacation during the summer.  I had to serve as partial proxy for them. My directing manager was gone for over 5 weeks in early june and late July, she has to provide authorization on all checks and invoices so some were paid in late August and September.  But all these accounts are now cleared up. 



I guess I am looking on how to address the ""performance issue"" when the answer seems obvious to me but seems unacceptable to them, or what I should be tracking as I feel I am being unfairly targeted. I am currently tracking all the additional work outside my regular duties (like government mandated fire drills) , it's just stressful to me because I know all the extra I do to keep this facility running. I have started to look for other jobs but I like my coworkers and this manager is already passed
