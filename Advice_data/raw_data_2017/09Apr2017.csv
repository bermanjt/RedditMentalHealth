0,"Sorry if this sounds like I'm trolling or anything like that, I wasn't sure if it was ok to post something like this on this subreddit; hopefully it is!

I'm a 23 yo kissless virgin who's seriously thinking about getting a prostitute.

To clarify, I don't feel lonely or depressed or anything like that, I'm not a fat neckbeard or an enlightened katana dual wielding fedora sensei and I certainly am not unfulfilled, I go to the gym and I feel generally pretty good about myself, but I'm a complete social outcast with 0 women in my life, and this honestly doesn't look like it's going to change anytime soon, and sometimes I wonder what sex feels like. I don't even care about having company or anything like that, I'm mostly focused on the sex, if that makes sense. I don't want to treat anyone like dirt or anything like that either, I just want something casual and laid back.

Thing is, I know virtually nothing about it. What would be the price ranges for an average prostitute, and what kind of things would that get me? Is it worth it if I'm that inexperienced? Will I be wasting my time if I don't know what to say or do? What would be acceptable to ask them? What would I say when talking to them on the phone? Is it acceptable to ask for pictures beforehand? Would it help me with women in the future?

If you're wondering, prostitution is legal in my country, so in that respect I'm good.

Any advice you can dispense about the situation will be greatly appreciated; thanks in advance.",09Apr2017,27

4,"Im 25f and he is 29m. 

We were only talking to eachother for about 2 weeks and i wasnt looking for anything serious. We met up twice and the second time we met up we had sex in my car. Earlier in the day before he came over,  he lost his phone and had to get it shut off so we were only able to communicate on facebook messenger. 

When we were getting into it, He was having trouble maintaining his erection. It kept coming and going.  I asked if it was me and he said no it was just uncomfortable in the car and he couldnt really move. He wants me to go down on him so I start giving him a blow job and he moans and groans, grabs my head and tells me he loves it, so i keep going until he cums and i swallow it. He then asks me to get on top of him, which i do. We repeat this twice and after we were done, he started asking me if we could meet up again tomorrow and that he really enjoyed the sex and hopes that I'm not seeing or ""doing"" this for anyone else. He also asks to take me on a date the following sunday
 And i say yes.He leaves and its been 3 days and ive heard nothing from him. Im taking into consideration the fact that He works 2 jobs and his daughter was in the hospital the day he came over and i think she may still be sick.  I also checked facebook messenger to see when he was last active and he hasnt been on it for two days. 
I think it would be overreacting to say that he doesnt want to talk to me anymore since it hasnt been that long but I dont know what to think. What do you all think?",09Apr2017,0

9,"Thanks for reading this (in advance).

So around 18 months ago, I noticed that my left wisdom tooth had started to protrude through my gum and was exposed, however I had not experienced any pain aside from the regular ""teething pains"" associated with it. (No major problems)

Fast forward to around 12 months ago, the wisdom tooth is finally fully exposed and isn't causing many problems at all. On a few occasions the skin around it would become inflamed and sore, but I'd usually take paracetamol to reduce the pain. (No major problems)

3 weeks ago to Present:
I have been experiencing a lot of pain in my left wisdom tooth and the surrounding areas such as my back molar (basically the molar closest to it) because it feels like the wisdom tooth is causing pressure and pushing the molar forward. I have tried painkillers to ease the pain yet I haven't had any joy in them at all. The pain is constant and my gums are swollen around the wisdom tooth which isn't allowing me to chew properly due to the pain it causes. I'm not sure if it could be an infection or something but it definitely feels like the wisdom tooth is pushing on my molar which is causing the most pain.

Any idea how I could ease the pain? And how bad would the tooth have to be before a dentist would remove it?

Any advice regarding anything I have typed above would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",09Apr2017,1

24,"Throwaway account - 
Hey all, so I have developed a little situation here in which I need some urgent advice, but first a little backstory. I live in the UK with my partner who suffers with Psychosis (Who I care for) &amp; recently we moved into a one bedroom flat (apartment). To start with, things were fine, and after a while we met our downstairs neighbor, who for the sake of this post we will call ""J"". So J is a mother who had her kids taken away a few years ago due to serious drug addiction (to what we believe is coke or meth). For a while, things were relatively normal, and apart from her being a little loud with music at times, we all got along just fine. About a week ago, J asked my partner to go out and get her some shopping (of course giving her the money to do so) which she was more than happy to do. When she brought her shopping back, J believed my partner had stolen some of the money she gave to her, despite all the numbers on the shopping receipt clearly adding up to what she was given. At this point, I got a little suspicious that she was off her head on something, and just kind of swept it under the carpet. Last night, J's cat got attacked by another cat and was left in a pretty bad way, and J being a rather lonely person was absolutely torn up over it. My girlfriend went down to her place to attempt to comfort her as we could hear her crying from the flat below. To start with, things were fine, and after some time had passed J was becoming increasingly insane, accused my partner of stealing her drugs and cigarettes (My girlfriend doesn't smoke and almost never drinks / has never done drugs) &amp; putting thinly veiled threats to her while cutting her own wrists and destroying her flat with a hammer. My partner has now come back up to our flat and told me the whole story, &amp; due to a few other factors that I will now explain, has left us at an end as to what to do about it. We were informed by one of J's relatives that she is very violent when in a depressed or bad mood, and also as a drug user, she is close with a lot of very bad looking people, the kind of people that would break your neck for looking at them wrong. This is what worries me most about contacting the police, if they had insufficient evidence that she was a threat to society and let her go, if she would come back to get us, or worse, get her dealers to do her dirty work. Our flat isn't the most secure, we don't have the funds to move to more secure accommodation. Any advice would be much appreciated as I really don't know how to pick up the pieces from here. 
TL;DR: Neighbor went crazy &amp; accused my partner of stealing, made some threats &amp; has a history of violence and drug use. Wary of contacting the police in-case it backfires on us and puts us in danger by her connections. ",09Apr2017,1
25,"My story begins in January. I met a girl who was absolutely gorgeous, talented, smart. She had no reason to like me, or even talk to me, but I was the guy she chose over anybody else. I was apparently ""funny, cute and caring"". Things seemed to look up for me as basketball was gone but I had someone to care about and share my life with. Things changed though.

Sometimes she was moody, didn't want to talk. Eventually, I asked what was wrong and thats where I found out she was raped in Indonesia over the winter. This is when I realized she wasn't who I thought she was and was clearly broken on the inside. I found out about the self harm too, and honestly it scared me. But her friends told me to suck it up and be there for her, even though it was hard for me. Eventually, she had too much on her plate to handle a relationship, understandably, and things broke off. My heart was broken, but she asked me to stay her friend, not be mad, don't leave even though we're not together anymore. Of course I did, even though what I wanted the most was to never see her face again. But for her, I tried to be her friend

Fast forward to now, me and her have drifted, never talk anymore. I'm depressed about basketball being gone, parents angry at me about grades, I felt like I have nobody. I came to her for help, to give me hope one time that someone cared or help me understand where I went wrong with her. Maybe I came across as needy, wanting her attention too much. Her friends told me to fuck off, and that my problems weren't hers. That was it for me.

I get it, she's going through rough shit that I can't even begin to imagine. But I did nothing but care, be there, ignore the darkness and fear, because she deserved it. When I needed someone the most, she turned her back on me. 

I guess what I'm trying to understand is if my compassion for her was wasted, just like it was on the other girls before. It seems like all I do is care for others, things, that just end up hurting me in the end. 

I get to be mad right? I get to be angry? Help me, to understand that I've done nothing wrong. Or help me understand what I have done wrong. Thanks",09Apr2017,3
26,"I'm from a small town. I never had lots of friends but I had a few. I moved in the middle of high school to a slummy inner city. I was laughed at, picked on &amp; called all sorts of names, almost immediately disliked. I don't know why. I became an outcast. 
I kept in touch with older friends but it became less and less. 

I've since moved back to my hometown. I'm a student &amp; I work. I haven't been able to reconnect with old friends. I try to go out &amp; I have met a lot of new people, but none of them are really friends. People at work make plans and the exclude me. This group of girls at work, who I did nothing to, seem to absolutely hate me. They try to turn everyone against me, etc.But I'm more confused by it than anything. 
 I sit here alone on Saturday. No one will ever call or text unless I do first. People I know always seem to have an excuse to not hang out. I've tried being social and inviting. I'm pretty much all alone, sometimes I feel like I can't handle my loneliness and I could end everything, because I'm beginning to not see a point in my own existence. I'm going through the motions with school &amp; work, but I have no one to come home to, no significant other or family of my own  or no girl friends talk to things about. I don't want to seem like I'm an innocent, perfect person or anything, of course I'm not. But I also don't think I'm a bad person either. 

Bottom line is: people just dislike me or are uninterested. I've seen it within my own family. Especially with my mom she was very cruel to me. But other family members as well.  I don't have a disorder that causes me to precieve things the wrong way, this is just how it's been.
In my 23 years I haven't been able to pinpoint what it is about me or my personality that is so repelling or unlikable. I don't think I ever had a true, healthy connection with anyone.
What can be so wrong with a person ?? Honesty is appreciated..

32,"I really want some hard truths. I want to know if anyone else has gone through something similar and how they got out of it. So here goes:
 
I've always been a really successful student, I got a 2230 on my SATs had a 3.85 GPA and everyone kind of knew me as someone that got shit done academically. I also was good at sports and I loved them. By the time I graduated high school I played on a team that traveled all over the country to play other teams of the same caliber. The end of my senior year I got into Berkeley and am now a student there. I don't want to come off as bragging or anything. I mean I know I have gifts and I intend to use them, but I also don't enjoy flaunting them in peoples' faces. I just think that this kind of background is necessary to explain. So long story short, all the success I had in high school got to my head and once I got to college I thought I was the shit and basically neglected to do all my work until just before it was due which, as anyone can guess, is not good for grades. I had a ton of fun though, I went out every weekend and met people that I thought were my friends. They turned out to be super judgemental and polar opposites of what I am and it basically turned out to be similar to what an abusive relationship was. They would give me shit (they thought they had a moral high horse) and I would take it because I thought they cared about me. I didn't realize it, but now that I'm away from all of that I realized that staying there hit my self confidence really hard. Before, I knew what I wanted and my instincts were normally right. But now I'm in a transition period where I don't quite trust myself as much as I used to. My grades, obviously, tanked and I left freshman year with a 2.7 GPA. I knew that I had to get my shit together, and I had fallen in love with computer science in the Spring. I failed that class but Berkeley allows you to retake classes you've failed. I took it over the summer and got a solid B+ in it. I wanted to declare the computer science major but I need a B+ average in my three prereqs to do that. So my fall semester I decided to go balls deep and get my life on track once and for all. I worked at a startup, I did research at a government lab, and took a ton of stem classes including one more prereq for the CS major. I ended up doing too much with a work ethic that still hadn't quite caught up to my ambitions and I ended up getting a C+ in the class. I failed everything else too and now as I write, boast a 1.84 GPA. This semester has gone almost perfectly. My work ethic has finally caught up and my classes are going well, but I'm terrified I won't get the A+ I need in my last prereq to declare CS. I had the last midterm yesterday and I think I bombed. I made a ton of dumb mistakes even though I knew the material back to front. I'm terrified I won't get into the major. I was planning on doubling in CS and Math and am confident I can do math, but I've had my heart set on CS and don't want to be the guy that talked a big game but failed. I guess I'm just scared of the consequences of being a math major rather than a double major. I have these huge dreams for myself, I tell myself that I want to get my JD/MD joint degree and then eventually work in politics at a national level. Dreams that sound incredible in my mind, but in practice I constantly question whether  I'm good enough for those dreams.",09Apr2017,1

35,"continue from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5jii96/good_grad_school_friend_is_broken_i_need_help_to/)

So things have really gone to shit recently and i need some advice again.

Continuing from the last thread. I come back from the winter break and I found my friend still at my apartment. To be honest, I was really hoping that she would be gone from my mulling over everything. Especially what people wrote in the previous thread. But I just kept to myself and left her alone.

Eventually we did start talking again, slowly, and returned to good terms but I still had the thought in the back of my head. She wanted a treadmill to exercise indoors, I said ok, and we rented a pickup truck and grabbed a used one for $50. It was a very pleasant trip. We went out to eat a bunch of times, things were good. But a few times of me talking to her about her talking too loud too early/late (waking me up) made her stop talking to me again.

There were other things too. 

1) She was going out late into the night which made me really uncomfortable i guess because i still had some feelings for her. I was on a break with my girlfriend at the time (now ex) and I really wanted to not feel those things so perhaps it was best that she moved out. She had constantly told me that she would never date me, and how much she hated me, etc.

2) She was going out instead of studying, and even watching tv and such instead of studying. I spoke with people about the license exam she was going to take and it seems she has barely made any progress. Added to that, she told me about this boy that she was seeing back in her country that was on his knees crying when she left. I assumed that the person she was speaking to late at night was this person due to the time differences. Why would anyone who admittedly tells you that it would not work between her and that boy still talk to them? To take advantage of them for emotional support is what I thought. One thought led to another made me think that she is just taking advantage of me as well and I think I lost track of why she needed to stay at my apartment in the first place. If she is dating other people, she could just ask them for help too.

3) Before I left for winter break there was a lot of yelling. It was very uncomfortable because she was just telling me how much I ruined her life. I really honestly wanted to help her because she was my friend. I gave her the analogy that a teacher inviting a student after school to tutor her out of his own free will. But the student ends up resenting the teacher, telling her how much she has ruined his life. The teacher doesn't think she did anything wrong (refer to last thread) but is actually pretty depressed about how she has made his life. The teacher ends up wanting to back out of the situation because of not wanting to stick her hand in it and also because of the emotional pain from the accusations.

So one evening, I saw my non-stick pans and non-stick rice cooker pot was put in the dishwasher for the 2nd?3rd? time, and I went to tell her that she shouldn't do it and that it would ruin the pans. This led to a large amount of yelling and to me telling her that I was very uncomfortable in my own home and that she should move out.

The next 2 weeks were a bit of a blur. Basically we talked about it. She actually made an effort to discuss everything at length to why I was feeling these ways because she ""wanted to see if she still wants to be friends with me"". I took back what I said to her and that she could stay with me.

A few days later, I can't really remember. She was drinking heavily due to her wanting to use alcohol to suppress her anxiety/depression. We drank together. One thing led to another and we slept together. Many times over the rest of the week.

But... She was convinced that I was not on a break with my girlfriend (B) at the time and so we had another fight. She insisted that I text her to break it off completely while I wanted to speak to B a few days later. I knew I had to do the right thing but since I think I was B's first serious boyfriend and I wanted to let her off gently. In that period of time there was a lot of yelling and in my half drunk state I told A that perhaps it was still best that she moved out. I just needed some time alone after everything had happened. 

I found out that time she had already been looking at apartments and that was why she was drinking so much, because she was so scared she couldn't sleep. For a moment in time she was canceling her search after we got together but my telling her that she needs to move out again made her continue.

Now you will have to trust me that it is not likely the relationship aspect that has her wanting to move out. She has straight out told me that she has never loved anyone and never really feel much emotions towards the many guys she has dated. Never cried, never cared if they left her. She tells me that she is committed to moving out because she doesn't want to have the roller-coaster of depression/anxiety from staying in my home. I do believe her and honestly, I regret putting her through all those things. 

Even if I am right on some things and she took it too hard or that I was completely wrong, I think in the end I just lost track of why she wanted to stay in my apartment, because she had a friend and that she was safe. At this moment, she has already moved out and has signed a contract for some length of time. It has been almost 2 weeks since she left. I spent the whole day together with her, bought her a bunch of stuff to take with her.

**The ultimate part which i need help on is this.** The problem is that she is really tight on money and because she was out of grad school for a while had to pay back student loans and no she has to pay for rent and for food out of pocket. She has explicitly told me that she was looking to become a sugar baby or to even go into prostitution to make ends meet. Explicitly she told me she has already met a sugar daddy one evening for dinner and made $300.

At first I begged her to stay again but she would not listen. Gradually I found out that there are actually a lot of college student sugar babies out there and that you don't actually need to sell your body, but only your time. But these days I get so messed up just thinking about it. I feel so much guilt and regret for pushing her out..

I told her repeatedly that we can just not interact while she stays, that i'll be away backpacking for a few months, etc. Last thing I told her is that she should end her lease after 2 months (first/last payment) and move in again in June when I will be away from the city backpacking for 1-2 months..

Right now I'm not sure what to do. She said to not contact her. I've been sending her messages on IM and of course she doesn't reply. I think i still have her phone # from way back so i can call her... I think i'm just feeling very messed up about the whole situation, the kind of position I put her in...

42,"Hi! 

Important things to note: we are all high school girls in our senior year. 

Loooong story short:

* I had two close friends, us three hung out all the time. 

* One time, we made plans, I couldn't come, and I said ""I can't go there, it would be cool if we could find a place we could all go together, but it's okay if you go without me""

* they stopped responding in our groupchat, and I found out through snapchat that went ahead and went out without me

* I felt left out and messaged them about how I felt

* they received it very poorly, and attacked me, saying that I admitted it was okay that they go without me

* they convinced me I was wrong for expressing my feelings and then I apologized profusely

* I asked them out to coffee a week later, both said no, but then went out to coffee together without me and posted it everywhere 

* ever since then, they have gone out without me every weekend

* a week ago, a friend and I went to that same coffee shop and they found out and called me ""petty"" behind my back because I went to the same coffee shop they went to (I had no idea it was the same coffee shop)

* I asked a friend to work out with me on her Instagram post and they saw it and said I was ""copying"" them because apparently they went running together the other day

* despite ALL of this, they're still insanely nice to me at school and it confuses me so much, I don't know how to act. They treat me so poorly by leaving me out, attacking me for expressing my feelings, gossip about what I do with other friends BUT they're still extremely (fake?) nice to me at school. 

* I've talked to a few close friends and my mother about this and they all say it's jealousy because I have friends other than them but the only have each other. BUT I don't think they have anything to be jealous of? I'm jealous of them! We were all so close and they randomly left me out of everything and now that I'm finally getting over them, I'm hearing all of this gossip about me?

46,"I really don't understand how this is done. I am 30 years old, I am in grad school, and the only real reason is that the only job postings I've ever seen that advertise what seems to be a living wage require a master's degree at a minimum. If I could imagine a job I would be qualified for with a BSc. that I could somehow acquire and be adequate at, I would take it today.

I see other people with jobs that are like just jobs, and they're the same age as me, and they own houses and raise kids and shit. I have had jobs in the past, but I've never not been absolutely scrounging every last dime (and no, I don't mean I waste all my money on new sneakers, nights out at the club, and expensive mods to my shitty car. I mean I ride the damn bus, buy second hand clothes, stay home on weekends, and never travel).

I'm not stupid, I'm probably too lazy to be successful but surely not too lazy to survive. Right now though I see being in grad school with a grant to cover my living costs is the only thing standing between me and being homeless.

Is it really possible to go from an entry level job up to something that pays a living wage? Is it really possible to get a job that pays a living wage with a bachelor's degree? For that matter, is it really possible with a master's degree? Many of my colleagues I see doing 2 and 3 post-docs, and doing back flips of joy when they find *a* job, any job, even if it means relocating to some backwater podunk craphole, and it's not like these are especially high paying jobs.

So can it really be done? I mean I know I'll never own a house, be out of debt, or retire, but at this point I doubt I'll ever even have groceries, heat, and electricity.",09Apr2017,1

I'm a bit confused though, because I've read in a few places on the internet that Lowe's switched to ACQ-treated lumber after the industry shifted away from CCA lumber in 2002 or 2003.

58,"So I am a 21 year old guy who's just finishing up community college and has the opportunity to transfer to a a university with a large population. I've always lived with my parents, i've never been independent in my life but I've always wanted to have the full college experience but my family seems to be flat out telling me not to do it due to me having to take tons of loans to pay it off seeing as I haven't gotten any scholarships. I don't know what to do. The only alternative I have is going to a school that I do not want to go to due to the fact that it does not have my major for undergrad. 

So my questions are:

1) Should I move into the dorm despite me having to take loans to pay for my tuition and dorms?

2) Will I be the odd guy out since I am transferring in instead of going to the school as a freshman who left high school?

3) How long will it take for most  to adjust to being in a dorm and being independent when the person has been dependent on family for their entire life? ",09Apr2017,2

I've been out of the shower for an hour and I put my shirt on it and do my ritual of wiping my armpits with toilet paper every ten minutes. Check my armpit the whole sleeve is covered in sweat. I took off my shirt and wore just a hoodie and I then put toilet paper bundled up underneath my armpits. 

Check my armpits again half the sleeve is covered in sweat. I just changed shirts and I'm guessing I have 30 minutes until it swears through again.

60,"Earlier today, I was driving about 75 mph in the left lane of a two lane highway and the guy next to me was doing about 73. I looked up at my rear view mirror and I noticed a BMW Suv tailgating me. I thought it was because I was going to slow for him so I sped up a little and moved into the right lane so he could pass, but he just jumped into the right lane behind me and started tailgating me again. I kept trying to think of what I did wrong to piss him off so much, but I couldn't think of anything(I was driving pretty normally earlier). Suddenly out of rage, I sped up from the 75-80 I had been doing all the way to my car's top speed 120 mph( yes it was a stupid thing to do but I thought I would lose him) but the BMW driver was still on my ass. I changed my lane several times while going this fast( hoping for him to pass me or stop following) but he also changed lanes right behind me and continued tailgating me for about 10 whole minutes until the freeway ended and split off into two separate freeways when he took the ramp for the freeway I didn't take. What should I do in a if something like this ever happens again?

Edit: the highway was pretty clear until about the part where it ended and split into two separate highways",09Apr2017,1
62,"I've been engaged for over 2 years. Reasoning being I hate the idea of planning a wedding. I hate being the center of attention, to me the cost is a complete waste of money.

Both sets of parents are willing to pay and plan the whole thing for me because I have no interest in planning anything. Even though they are being generous financially, i don't want a huge wedding.

67,"This is really difficult for me to talk about and I've kept it from everyone in my personal life for about 8 years now because I don't want them to treat me different.

I went through a horrendous bout of anxiety and depression before eventually developing something that I’ve seen best described as dpersonalization/derealization (DPDR). In an instant the most horrendous, terrifying sensation washed over me. The best way I can think to describe it is like being conscious in a dream. I felt disconnected from the world around me and my own body. It's like being a goldfish, and my body is the bowl walking me through a flat, hazy world on the other side of the glass.

I was convinced it was just an extreme panic attack, but when I somehow managed to calm down the sensation persisted. I talked my doctor and therapist and they both attributed it to my anxiety and depression. I decided to deal with the two med free because I realized after a lot of self-reflection that this was all a long time coming. I was afraid I’d lose my incentive to improve my life and fall back into the same rut if I took a med and it worked on the first try.

While I was dealing with my anxiety/depression I kept looking into the DPDR. I didn’t know what it was at the time and describing the symptoms just got me offers for meds for the anxiety and depression. I was convinced, and ultimately ended up being correct that they were separate issues. As my depression and anxiety faded the sensation of DPDR stayed the same.
Along the way I found a support group for DPDR where I ended up learning that it goes into remission at random if at all. Very few people found relief let alone a cure, and often time it would just end up coming back anyway. There were some who had spent decades trying every imaginable test and cocktail of drugs to never find any answers or relief.

In all honesty I felt completely fucked. Eventually I fell in line with a bunch who believed it was all purely psychological and there was a lot of terrible arguing between this group and the people who were convinced it was a disease that could only be treated with meds. I went along with it because I was terrified that I had drawn some sort of genetic short straw and I could do nothing except play the victim and wait for someone to cure me while suffering uncountable disappointments. 

This went on for a few years and I improved my life substantially. I was afraid I’d be 30 and living with my parents, but while dealing with all this I managed to (barely) graduate college and was hired into a secure well paying job before I graduated. I haven’t had a hint of anxiety or depression; I got over my fear of driving and moved into my own apartment. My life is for the most part perfectly normal and healthy; I feel like a different person then I was when this all started, but the DPDR is still there. I’ve learned to cope with the feeling and simply coexist with it for the most part.

Something changed in me for the worse because of this experience. My strict opposition of med use to treat my personal issues twisted into a bitter hatred of drug use as a whole. Partly because of the people I chose to associate with, and partly because after all the effort I put in and terrible things I said to people suffering just as much as me I could never comeback say I was cured. I’m afraid to admit that I was wrong, that things could have gone better faster if I had. It’s turned into a horrible fear of people surpassing me using drugs, plastic surgery, steroids, the list goes on. I’ve turned into a bitter person over the years lamenting my wasted youth, thinking what if I did things differently and being spiteful of the people who did and proved my years of hard work to be worthless.

I’ve long accepted that I’ll probably never feel normal again; I don’t even remember what normal feels like. If I can’t have that then I at least want to be happy, and that means I have to purge these deeply entrenched feelings, but I have no idea how.

68,"I am going to be living my dreams by studying abroad in Wales this september. My mom particularly is worried.

In addition, I want to do a couple of trips alone in the UK, like london for 2 days etc. I can find friends to do big trips with but small niche ones I probably wont.

69,"About two weeks ago I received a knock at the door of my college dorm. When I opened it, I was greeted by two furious looking guys I had never met before. After a discussion with them they told me that a man had recently been creeping in the girls restroom of my floor, taking pictures of women showering, and that a witness had seen someone near the bathrooms matching my physical description (skinny, white, tall, all very basic things). I told my RA about what happened and he told me to tell the police. I explained to campus police about the two visitors and they assured me they would look into it. Then next day I was called into the station where they proceeded asked me about the incidents and my whereabouts on the day of the shower creeper incident. After going through my phone with programs that show even deleted photos and following up my statement that I wasn't on campus during the time the crime was committed, my name was cleared, but apparently only in the eyes of the law. Today I was approached by a kid on campus asking me what was up with me peeping in the showers, and told me people in the dorms were saying I was the culprit. He told me people that know me don't believe it, but many who don't know me do. I feel sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do, if I should tell my friends and girlfriend about it, if I should tell my parents about it, and I am uncertain my reputation will ever be the same.

70,"I am currently in a full-time graduate job (in a top tier company for the industry I am in), where I work extremely long hours, but has very promising pay in the near future if I remain in the position I am in. 

I still have a couple of years to go at university, however, next year is my last chance to go on university exchange. I have the opportunity to go the Berlin in Germany for 6 months, where I can travel other parts of Europe in between my time there (I have never travelled before).

I feel as though I would regret not going on exchange, as it's not something you can do once you graduate. But at the same time, if I were to go, then I would need to resign from the job that I am in, and I'm not guaranteed a job once I come back. So my question is, for those who are older than me (I am 20), with what you know now, if you were to be 20 and in my shoes, would you stick with a promising graduate position, or go on a 6 month exchange trip that can potentially cost you the chance of getting a job once you return?",09Apr2017,1
72,"For years, I've wanted to become a screenwriter. I've written TV pilots, features, etc, nothing of which has ever been produced. Moving to Los Angeles is an absolute necessity to becoming successful in the industry, so naturally, I'm looking to go to college down there. 

Unfortunately, money is quite a problem. Tuition and living combined will be a nightmare. I got into a college down there and with the scholarships I've received, I'll only have to pay about 20k of the 50k tuition, but that doesn't include food, rent, or transportation as the school is fairly new and doesn't have dorms. 

On the other hand, I'm able to go to another college fairly close by to where I'm currently living, which is quite a distance from Los Angeles. The tuition is close to nothing, I'd be able to take a film program meant to be transferred out of after two years, giving me the time to gather money to move to Los Angeles, and I won't need to pay for living. Unfortunately, I won't be in LA. 

I know that the smart and obvious choice is to stay here for two years, but I have been waiting for this opportunity for years. The Los Angeles college was my #1 choice and is very hard to get into, so I don't know if I will be able to get in two years from now. 

At the moment, I'm leaning toward Los Angeles, but I'm not sure I would be able to get by or if it is even worth all the loans I would be taking out to live down there. This is my dream, but I don't know whether or not I'm ready to go after it.

73,"Basically the title. Kinda long... Sorry I just found this Subreddit.

Everytime I feel down and look out for my friends for comfort it just seems that anything they want to do with me I just simply shoot it down. This is irritating. I want help, I  *need* help and comfort. But I just don't allow it, my mind just closes and I am **pretty certain the mistake is on my end**. 

Good example of today: I was feeling lonely, useless and everything I did felt bad or wrong. Pretty much depressed and demotivated too. Went for friend's comfort, ended up in a fight because I flat out refused to get helped (""Wanna go out? Wanna play with me then? Answer: Always no, don't trust."")

About the lack of trust response, it just feels like everytime someone shows up to lend me a hand. I go for it, but there's always something that goes wrong and feel worse then the person ends up leaving me in the dust, so I end up dealing with the problem on my own, but it's deteriorating me. It always happened among friends, and I really don't blame them considering how resilient I am to receive help to begin with.

It's not really a pride thing, as I come begging for help from anyone. It's already hard for me to speak about how I feel. But I'm tired of it. Figured speaking to random Internet strangers would help me behave more and see the problem in another perspective.

So I came here, what can I do? Since the problem is so consistent with me it can't be my friends. I am just convinced I am the source of the problem and seek for advice for a possible solution.Thanks for reading...",09Apr2017,2

76,"I was told about a job fair from college instructor, there was a support technician role that I apparently fit the bill for and he suggested that I go for it.  Friday rolls around I go in, me and a few others were in the media conference room waiting to be interviewed.  The guy running the fair was apparently the founder of a company called Gynesus, he had us come up to the tables and he ran through this whole speel about how his company helps small businesses.  At the point I'm already concerned because it felt more like some seminar than a job fair.  He got to me and this other guy and basically explained to us that we would be doing telecommute support with helping people setup point of sale systems.  Didn't even really interviewed us, just kinda skimmed through our resumes and asked if we knew how to do server shit.  

At the end we're handed W4s and Direct Deposit slips, we apparently got the job.  I filled out mine but didn't submit the direct deposit just yet.  I was definitely not comfortable but I didn't think too much of it considering it was through the college career center.  I was just excited about getting my first job in years.

- Company website practically non existent
- No BBB record
- There's different people listed as the company founder
- No other info on the company could be found

I've decided that if they do call me back for training Monday I'm gonna pull out and also take what I found and report it to the career center.

80,"This is an issue that has been present for a good portion of my life, but has really come to the forefront since coming to college (currently a junior). Basically, its the feeling that the further I go into most interpersonal relationships, the more I am undervalued, ignored and only sought out when I have something to offer. Even after being friends with people for a long time, I can't help but fear they have some kind of agenda or secretly hate me.

At a glance it sounds like it might be a problem with the way specific people treat me, but this is a feeling I've had both with my family and multiple friend groups over the years. I won't say that I never have people checking up on me or inviting me to do things, but I feel that it's very disproportionate compared to how much I have to do this for them. In other words I feel like I'm always putting in more work than the other person and that I value our relationship more than they do. I often get the feeling that there's something else they would rather do, someone else they would rather be spending time with and that overall I'm the last person to cross their mind in their day to day life.

This of course raises the question of what kind of person I am and whether I've earned this or not. It's hard to talk about yourself without sounding biased, but I'd say I'm pretty average and would probably be perceived by others as such as well. I get about the same grades as everyone else, have a job, a reasonably sized group of friends, go to parties and have a balance of niche and mainstream interests, which no one has ever really taken issue with. 

I'd go as far as to say that people usually like me a lot on the outset, and for a while they're more eager than I am to want to talk or do something together. But give it enough time and its like switch flips, the novelty wears away and they seem to have heard some bad secret about me that changes their perception of me. If we were to chart it, I feel like the level of connection goes down over time, rather than going up over time as things are supposed to go. This has pretty much resulted in me feeling more at ease with strangers or acquaintances than longtime friends and preferring dating to being in a romantic relationship. 

I feel like this is getting quite long and I have delivered most of the points I want to cover. I'm hoping someone can tell me if the change I have to make is in my behavior or in my way of thinking. This isn't something I see an easy solution to so I'm hoping for a fresh set of eyes on this dilemma.

81,"I'm 18 years old. Accepted into University. I'm going to be graduating high school in a couple of weeks, starting college in a couple of months, and along with that, I'll be taking on massive student loan debt, and I don't have a single clue what the fuck I want to do with my life.

All over the internet, I've read the horror stories. People leaving university, learning nothing useful, who paid tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition, all in undefaultable loans, who go into the ""real world"", and find out that there isn't a single fucking job out there that will pay them more than enough to hardly have a roof over their head, at the cost of 40 hours + commute of monotonous hell that they never thought in their worst nightmare they'd have to put up with.

The real world is a scary place. Society has told us all that the only way to make it in today's world is to get good grades, to make it into a good school, to get a good degree, and then wave it in someone's face, so that they'll take us seriously enough to give us a job that if we're LUCKY will start at just around $40,000/yr, before taxes and living expenses. If you major in the wrong thing, you're fucked. If you took out too many loans, you're fucked. If you have a kid, or god forbid, you marry the wrong woman and she divorces you and demands alimony for the rest of her life, guess what? You're fucked. Even if you DON'T do any of those things, it seems like most people are fucked. Do more than two or three of them and you might as well just call it quits and bike off the edge of a skyscraper. What the fuck?

My family doesn't have any money. I haven't seen my dad in years, he's cutting the child support as soon as I turn 18 and bidding us farewell forever, and my mom is an alcoholic waitress hanging onto her last bit of sanity so that she can let me loose on my own two feet before she kicks the bucket in whatever hellhole she's going to end up dying in while my sister and I fight to survive out there. I know, I know, I'm being a bit dramatic. As a person of Irish descent, I know with almost absolute certainty that my ancestors came over here with little to nothing, working as indentured servants (aka white slaves for those of you who think that they were anything more than just that - slaves to the 1%, who were often worked to death before their contracts were up) and coal miners, who lost their teeth before the age of 35 and died of black lung before their children hit adulthood. I know, I know, I'm not some African child, starving with AIDS and malaria, drinking swampwater and hunting elephants in the congo. But still. I've had it rough and I know a hell of a lot of people have had it worse than me. It seems like if your parents can't pay for your education, or unless you're some Ivy League genius who got a full ride scholarship, you're in for a world of hurt upon your exit out of the system.

It's ironic that both my finance teacher and my economics teachers, with all of their ""knowledge of the economy"", were both quite vocal about the fact that they left college at 22/26, hoping that their degrees would pay for themselves, and yet here they are, 30 years of age or more, still paying them off, driving the same shit car they had in highschool, with mortgages that they MIGHT pay off, assuming they live long enough to do so. What's the deal with the job market anyways? It seems like there are all these different jobs out there, but how the fuck do you get them? It's just that: the job that you want? Someone else has it. Want to be literally anything other than a doctor / lawer / engineer / programmer / accountant / etc? Sorry. Those jobs ""don't exist"". Well, someone's doing them. But nobody knows how the fuck to get into that position because the very people who are telling us to go to college and get these fucking degrees are the same people suffering from the system itself! They don't know any better, and they were raised in a generation where you could pay off university working a summer job bagging milk and doritos.

The second wave of indentured servitude is among us, so be warned. I'd have probably taken up trade school, but my mom would basically kill me in my sleep if I don't go to Uni because according to her, ""everyone will consider me a humongous loser if I don't go to college, and if you can't get a job with your degree, you're just not looking hard enough"". Yeah, funny coming from someone who's never worked a real job in her entire fucking life. I love her and respect her, but... I just don't know who to trust anymore. The entire world is saying I should go to school and yet everyone who gets out complains about being on the verge of living on the park bench outside of their local starbucks.

It really makes me wonder what it's all for. What the point of it all is. I try to think about what I find to be meaningful. I like to read. I've been getting into philosophy and psychology. Dostoyevsky, tolstoy, piaget, freud, Jorden Peterson, you name em. I've been writing recently for a YouTube channel I'm going to start working on, documenting stories, experiences, and education on psychedelic drugs, how to succeed in highschool, along with some sketch comedy and other shit. I want to get into MMA. I want to make a rap mixtape one day. I want to do so many things. Those are the things I love. Getting a job isn't on my bucket list. I know, you have to work to play your part in the big capitalist gangbang that is the west. But having ""things"" has never been all that important to me. I'd be more than comfortable living in a two bedroom apartment with one of my bros, driving a car that works, having a phone that WORKS, and just spending my time doing what I love DOING. It's never been about ""having"" for me. Yet everybody says, ""OSSXHollow, you've got to make a lot of money! If you don't make a lot of money you won't be happy and you won't ever get laid and you'll die miserable like me and everybody else!""
It seems like even just living as a minimalist is near impossible. I don't even comprehend how some people can afford to have an apartment of their own, in an expensive city, a nice new car, a brand new phone, with a data plan and highspeed internet, cable TV, expensive computers and 4k flastscreens, pets to take care of, eating out and going to movies constantly, nice brand clothing, you name it. My mother works so fucking hard just to let us eat, and that's with the money my dad pays us, and we can't even afford to get a drink of water that doesn't taste like it's been pumped full of minerals. We never go out and I've never been on a real vacation. Not on my own, at least. It's a fantasy.

I guess I'm just angsty. And nervous. I think the worst part of it all is that, according to the tests I've taken, my performance in school, my scores on IQ tests / GPA / SAT, I'm in the top 10% of people intelligence wise. And I built my entire ego around that. I always felt like being smart would help me find my way through the world. And now I feel like I'm staring down the barrel of a sniper rifle because apparently it's ""not about what you know, it's about who you know"". I feel like I don't know shit. School can't prepare you for what's out there. My teachers themselves weren't even prepared. NOBODY knows how to make it, and those that somehow figured it out aren't sharing their secrets. Most of them are probably just profiting off of the rest of us, reaching into our pockets and fingering our buttholes while they're at it as is.

Anybody got any advice? I always had this notion in my head that university was a place you go to ""find yourself"". I was going to join clubs, build a nice schedule, play intermural sports, hang around with dormmates, go to parties, fool around with girls, do all of that shit I never got to do in highschool. Now I'm thinking it's going to be more along the lines of keeping panic attacks at bay as I switch between classes, homework, and a full time job, as I get 2 hours of sleep per day, fueling my decaying body with electric shocks and redbull so that I won't have to spend an extra year or two working off the debt when I get out in four more years.",09Apr2017,3
84,"I'm in my late 20s, I really miss the fun I used to have with my friends in my late teens and early 20s.

I miss staying up late and watching movies or anime at a friends house.  Streaming anime on laptop by myself just isn't the same.

I miss having nothing specific to do and just hanging out with my friends looking for something to come up.  Whether it was just walking around the neighborhood or going to the mall to browse around.

Gosh damn I miss walking everywhere.  Life would be impossible today without a car, but sometimes the journey to where you're going is half the fun when you're walking around with friends.

I read all this and it feels like I'm just being immature and missing being a kid.  But is any of this really worse than what people typically do with their time?  I don't mind going to a bar or seeing a show, but I really can't see the fun in doing it every weekend like some people do.  So most of the time I sit at home and browse around the internet and try to keep myself entertained with netflix or video games; all my friends from back then have either moved super far away or have made the kinds of changes to their life where doing the old stuff just isn't practical.

Even if I'm not crazy to want to keep up my old habits, how exactly does a person find new friends at this age to do those kinds of things?",09Apr2017,0

 Stuff in life lately aren't going well to say the least. Not usual stress for a high schooler but it's pretty upsetting. Latley I've been feeling void. Empty. I feel like I'm floating and not in a good way, like I'm in some weird alternate dimension. Like nothing goes right, everything is broken and I fail at fixing it. I play a game, a video game that I am, or I guess, used to be extremely good at. Now I feel like a fail on every level, like every fight I get in a lose, every match I play I make mistakes and simple foundation level skills are not executed correctly. I'm losing interest in my passion of art, not because it's not fun, but because I feel so bad. I know it's normal to hate your art, but latley I feel like I've been drawing the same picture metaphorically, like nothing changes, I don't get better or worse, I'm stuck.

90,"So im going to try to not make this too long. Ive grown up as an only child. I got really good benefits from it. When i turned 16 I was given a car. I got a really good job at my moms work (which im so thankful for) basically all of that. With that said when I turned 18 they stopped paying for anything for me, which was a really cool experience, it taught me how to fend for myself in a way. The issue is, im still treated like im 16, im 20 for the record, I have to be home by 10:30, cant do a whole lot. Im very restricted in a way. I tried to talk to my mom about it and all she said was as long as i live in her house i have to go by her rules. My dad told me he would try to talk to her but my best bet is to move out. Im really worried that im going to let her down or hurt her by moving out. Also the thought of being alone kind of worries me as none of my friends are wanting to move out and im not comfortable living with random people. Financially I can afford to live on my own. I guess my biggest fear is being rejected by my mom or having her get upset about it. Im not sure how to approach this. Any advice would help :)

92,"I'm a senior about to earn my bachelors (after summer term), and I've begun job-hunting. Aside from my worries about even being able to get a job, I'm wondering if I will be happy anywhere that I don't already have friends. I transferred to my current school junior year and was friendless fall term until I made a friend via Yik Yak (social media app if anyone is wondering), and then made another friend when she saw my post about roommates for the next year on the school housing website. Essentially, I would probably be friendless without social media... Because I have massive issues making friends. It's hard for me to be friendly with someone I either don't know well or who isn't bold and friendly with me. I've undoubtedly missed out on many friendships because I wasn't friendly enough with someone.

This is going to sound trivial, but I really would like to enjoy the nightlife of my future city while I'm still young (have not done much at school because this city has limited options + my friends have different ideas of fun) and I currently only have one friend who I club with, and she lives in my hometown (2 hours away).

I don't even have my future planned but if I move back to my hometown I will have to live with my parents. I just don't know what to do... Of course this isn't *that* important, but it's a major part of my happiness and I've spent countless weekend nights alone and depressed.",09Apr2017,1

96,"My wife and I have been married almost 6 years now and I recently found out she is sexting with 3 guys, sending them explicit pics and love words etc. I found out when my wife asked me to fix her gallery app in her phone (I'm a electronic technician and I love to fix anything electronic) because it was ""messing about"". When I first enter the gallery i see the share button is a keepsafe button (an app to hide anything you don't want others to see) and I got really confused. So we know everything about ourselves even our passwords and the password for keepsafe wasn't working, so I entered her file explorer and went into the sent WhatsApp images folder and boom it hits me..... My wife is sending naked pics to people through WhatsApp and I didn't know what to do. The next day I bought a spy app and installed in her phone just to understand where we are standing and in the end I was right, even when we sit near each other or after sex even she talks to ""them"".

7 months ago I had cancer, removed it through surgery and now I've been sitting at home ever since then and I had no idea this was going on. I found out who these guys are and they live 300-400 km away which is pretty far but what will happen when I get back to work? 

I gave up everything for this woman! My family my religion my friends my lands ""money"" everything and we have a 3 year old daughter. I feel betrayed....

97,"For years I've struggled with not being able to turn down guys that I'm not interested in. I was stuck in a relationship for nearly 4 years with someone I was not attracted to at all, but stayed because I felt too guilty breaking up with him, as he was a nice guy.

I keep getting myself into these situations where at first I continue to chat with them because I don't want to seem like a bitch, but I'm starting to think that saying anything back to them just leads them on. 

My question is, mainly to ladies, do you find being a straight up bitch to guys that you have no interest in, works out better for you in the long run?

I'm currently in a situation with a guy at work (I just quit the company, for reasons unrelated to this) and some co-workers tried to set us up, very uncomfortably I might add. He has asked me out twice through facebook message, which at the second time is when I told him I am just not interested in dating right now, but that I'm cool with just chatting and being friends  (only to be nice, deep down I have zero interest in ever hanging out with him, because I know he wants more). 

He has now asked me out a third time, to his house to watch a movie. Why would he ask me that, right when I said I'm not interested in dating? Is he just not getting the hint? Or am I leading him on by saying I'm fine with being friends?  I've been trying to give more subtle hints, being short, taking a long time to answer him. 

I'm just sick of getting myself in these uncomfortable, awkward positions where I get anxiety and feel terrible and guilty turning them down. I'm about to just start being a total bitch because this is just a constant cycle because I'm always ""too nice"".

I keep running into people who make fun of virgins and girls who consider guys who haven'd had sex after 18-20 years old 'weird' and 'pathetic'. I also keep hearing about how I am a failure of a man just because I haven't done what I was programmed to do, AKA have sex. 

I would like to say that none of this bothers me and i'm going to keep working on myself until I get a date, but the problem is I can't. This shit is making me so depressed it's not only making it impossible for me to be positive when TRYING to get a date, it's also ruining my life and mental stability. I'm a good looking, fit guy and I somehow can't get any girl to be interested in me. Sure, a big part of it is the social anxiety, but how can I continue living while doubting myself and my own value as a man?

I've also posted this on /r/Sex, as a follow up to ANOTHER thread by another user yesterday, where he was talking about how it's wrong to virgin shame. And guess what? People flamed him and called him a whiney bitch loser who needs to go out and get laid before he becomes even more of a weirdo!

Tbh, i'm just posting this here because i've exhausted all other options and i'd like for someone to talk to me about it. It's making me suicidal and having to hide the fact that you are a virgin because people will mock you and your value as a human being because of it makes me sick.

And I found out that I may have a brain tumor. I had been waiting to get the MRI for two weeks now, and I've just been thinking and thinking about it all the time. My prolactin levels were high, and so the doctor ordered an MRI to check. I wanted to google it, but the doctor told me not to, which has made me feel as if it may be more serious than I thought.

I haven't been able to sleep well lately, I wake up tired. I want nothing else but to sleep. I've been feeling naseaous and sometimes feel weak all of a sudden. 

I burst out crying at the dumbest thing possible. The teacher mentioned something about using our brains, and then a while later I just get the urge to cry.

Bit of a back story as to how I got where I am now. 

I had a traumatic accident which left me in ICU and bed bound for several months. I tore my pancreas and went into organ failure. The pain was (and is) horrendous, it's basically taken control of my life. I was prescribed fentanyl and that is where my life was changed. This was almost 5 years ago. 

My health is not amazing, I have chronic pancreatitis every couple of months so I spend a lot of time in hospital. Ok I'm going off a bit now. 

I ended up addicted to opiates and other pharmaceutical drugs. I have been using party drugs and weed since I was around 13. I was a complete train wreck and just stopped caring about life. I put my self is horrible situations and I was raped Nov 14. This was a turning point and I ended a 6months rehab. 

I have always suffered from mental health problems, this was mentioned a lot in rehab and they basically tore you apart and helped you to rebuild yourself. It's a surreal feeling, I was finally my shit together, I had so many opportunities to help other people in similar situations. But.. I met a girl. 

I guess my addict behaviours kicked it and I just threw myself into this relationship. Things got very heavy very quickly, my SO moved out of her ex's house with the kids and started to make a new home, with me. From that moment things started to deteriorate. I stopped volunteering so I could be at home with her youngest (2). I pushed SO to go back in to education so she could study in the medical field. I'm really proud of her for following her passion. I'm jealous that I don't know how to do that.

I loved playing stay at home mum for the first few months, it was fun. We have different ideas on how to bring up kids. So it caused tensions. I would just like to point out that I adore her kids. 

I guess I put everything into making this a happy family. I didn't speak to anyone, everyday I sorted the kids while SO studied or worked. I haven't been able to work since the accident. This is something she often likes to remind me. She has all the financial control. 

I'm sorry if this is not making much sense. I'm not really in a good place. But I'll try and get to the point.

My health and mental health have really deteriorated in the past 6months. I can't handle being around the kids. My SO is incredibly frustrated as our sex life has gone and we're just miles apart. 

I've moved back in with my dad for a couple weeks to try and figure out what I'm doing or who I am. 

I feel like a shell, I don't know what I want to do or who I want to be. I don't even know if I'm gay. Thankfully the suicidal thoughts have calmed down a bit. 

I still see my SO but it's not the same, we barely speak and when we do, it's normally my SO asking what I'm doing and when will i be normal again. 

I'm going to stop now, sorry if this makes no sense. Thank you for reading if you got this far.

I think he just shuts himself down infront of people (both family and friends) but ofcourse being family we talk to him.

Now ofcourse we could accept him for who he is and make peace with the situation and just be there for him no matter what he is like and not push him to be social and stuff but i just feel like he will not amount to something good in life like this.

When i first saw him it wasn't really that much of a big deal i mean i am pretty outgoing so it's not like this is the first time iv'e ever seen an attractive man! 

but as i kept seeing him in the office every single day i couldn't help but develop this crush quickly. 

when he is in the office i just can't stop thinking about him, what is he doing, does he notice me too!! 

the problem is as much as i'm social and all that, when it comes to crushes i'm suddenly this shy polite girl with the stupidest comments ever -_-, 

He does look at me while i'm passing by him and stares but with no smile or anything, although i do notice he stares for longer than usual eye contact.

He also owns a small business on the side with a couple of people, i know that off course because i freaking googled his ass like a million times, so because i'm stupid i emailed his business email asking the question if his business sells alcohol! just wanted to know, but the problem is i forgot to change my name in google!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so he probably saw that i was the one who sent the email, i was so embarrassed when i realized what iv'e done but adapted myself to forget i ever done that shit lollllllll!

I really can't stop thinking about him, what can i do to stop! also do you think it's a good idea if i actually tried talking to him? wouldn't that make everything way more complicated?

For the past 10 years before I got this job I was working in a pizza place. The only reason why I hate the QA job is because it does not challenge me, I barely do anything with js and there is a 4 hour commute. A monkey could do my job.

146,"Hello everybody,

For the past 2 months I have been through a very complicated period in my life. After a girl I fell in love with left me, I have realized that I need a deep, blunt change in my life, something that will create a ""before"" and ""after"".

I have confronted all the things I was always scared of facing: I have calmed down my anger against my father for neglecting me and my siblings for years, and I've taken steps towards fixing that in a way that will be best for all of us involved. I have apologized to the women I have hurt in the past and I have acknowledged my errors towards them. I am truly digging into myself to fix all the wrongs I've ever done to others and trying to preserve integrity in everything I do.

It is being very painful and I feel very unstable even though I feel I'm doing what's right.

However, I feel that I will need some form of closure, some way to close this situation so that I can move on, forget about the girl who left me, who is constantly on my mind. I feel that I need some way to cut into the way my life is, start a new chapter, leave everything behind and continue living with the new values that I am discovering. I am finding it truly difficult to keep my spirits up and to keep my confidence and self-trust.

Can anybody throw in some advice on how I could achieve that? what can an individual like me do to alter life forever? I really need the feeling that the previous ""chapter"" of pain and turmoil is over because I don't know how I will keep handling the constant stream of pain and doubt that I'm having.

152,"TL;DR: I think I've become socially and financially dependent on my older brother and I'd like some advice about it.

I couldn't have asked for a more supportive older brother. His name is Bryan, he's 26, and he's a high-up manager that hops around between bars and restaurants within the bar and restaurant company he works for, so he makes a lot of money for someone his age. He supports me socially and financially, but I fear that I've become dependent on him to the point where if he left my life, I'd quickly fall flat on my face.

Firstly, he's my social crutch. I'm a social failure: in my three years of college I've made like four or five friends through it, and I use that term loosely. I go out and have fun maybe once a week, and at least 80% of the times I do, it's with Bryan and his friends. I'm also a total beta, and he's an alpha, so when we're out, I just meekly follow him around, do what he does, and not talk much. I haven't even really made any friends through him. Without him, I'd be even more sad and lonely than I am now.

Secondly, He's my financial crutch. I recently quit my job of over two years, that he got me, and he's poised to get me another one. My former job was in the same company that he works for, but he thankfully (I guess) has a personal policy of no nepotism, so I've never directly worked FOR him. As you may have guessed, he gives me money when I need it. A good example of this is last summer when I had to take a chemistry class at a community college that isn't my regular school, and thus had to pay like $800 out of pocket, which he did for me. He also always pays for my food and drink when we go out. He insists that I eventually pay back all the money he's spent on me, and justifies this with the fact that I'm an engineering student who'll supposedly eventually get a really good job. But my future as an engineer is very uncertain. I've been getting screwed-over and screwing myself over in my education to the point where I basically have to find a new school. So he's essentially investing in me and I'm not sure I can make good on that investment.

I found a birth mark and the first thing I thought was skin cancer, I got a cold recently and first thing I though was esophageal cancer, my poop came out a little skinny I thought what if its colon cancer. When ever I get phlem in my throat I'm thinking what if its lung cancer even though I'm 27 and I've never smoked a single pack. Writing this I know it can sound very silly but for some reason I can't shake this fear.


Recently he ate something that didn't set well with him and all I've been thinking is does he have stomach cancer.

154,"Hey guys,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

a few days ago, a close friend of mine said he made cake to celebrate the end of the school semester, and wanted to share it with us. I was suspicious from the beginning, but trusted him. There were SO many give away signs that there was something amis, but i ignored my own better judgement... because why would a friend drug me. I trusted him. I kept commenting on the fact that it was kinda odd for him to do, and he kept invoking that it was just to share with his friends. He made me feel bad that I didnt trust him. 

we ate the cake and then he suggested we go for a walk, and after a bit, I noticed it starting to effect me. I've never had weed(or any drug) before, but I could definitely tell i was high. I brought up that I was oddly tired, and he started laughing and told me that there was actually weed in the cake and kinda started laughing. 

I told him how fucked up that was, and when he realized I was angry he started apologizing. we took the bus back to my place so he could grab his stuff, and I didnt talk to him the whole time. But he kept on saying, ""i'm sorry,"", ""I didnt think it would do anything"", ""you're not supposed to feel weed the first time you try it"" and other bullshit excuses. 

I'm not against weed. I think it's stupid for the government to make something illegal that they could profit off of and make the market safer. But its not something I want to do at all for various reasons. 

* its finals season, and I'm in engineering. I need to study. 
* I probably had a slight drinking problem at one point, and am now trying to stay generally away from heavy drinking. I dont want to develop an addiction to anything else. 
* I work for my country's federal government, and while I havent been drug tested, they do ask about drugs in security clearance forms. I also want to work in aerospace/defense, and drugs are not something I want in my life. 
* I hold a pilot's license, and I'm not sure how long it takes for weed to leave your system. I dont want any of it in my body when I go flying again- its not responsible. 
* I'm currently dying from allergies and have taken some reactine thats  been expired for almost a year.. I dont know what thats doing to my system, but i dont want to mix drugs. 

He started using the excuse that he hasnt slept in 2 days, and wasnt thinking... and that his roommate and him wanted to prank me. but between the two of them, there should have been something that made them stop and think it was a bad idea. The whole lack of sleep argument was bullshit, because this was something he's been thinking off for a while- He brought up earlier this week how it would be funny to unknowingly drug someone, and that he wanted to try it one day. I figured he meant a friend thats been talking about wanting to try drugs, but hasnt yet. we also agreed that person would probably never talk to them again if they were drugged.

169,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons


This is a long story but I'll try make it short 

My roommate has been a very good friend of mine for a long time, but in terms of personality he always sees everything as a competition; in discussions it's not about finding truth but being right, even if that means discrediting me, my study, or resorting to plain insults, if I ever tell him about a success of mine he either acts completely uninterested or feels the need to one-up me; he wouldn't let me finish talking before he'd mention something he did or does, In general some traits would revolve about being very egocentric, Mr know-it-all, but also very insecure about his appearance and the high standards his parents set for him

Yes he is a little bit strange and has lost some friends due to his bragging and conflictive personality


Over the holidays he badly ruined a relationship with a good friend of his (drunk, involuntary, touchy-touchy.. I think I even didn't get the full story because that friend immediately cut ALL contact) which made him suicidal and I was effectively the only one to support him because his relationship with his parents and sibling isn't great, he also doesn't have any other very close friends, he also visited a psychologist for depression during that holiday, although his parents were unaware of the depression and pills to overdose beside his bed

After that holiday his negative traits seemed only amplified, so many conflicts over the tiniest things, he's not interested in a thing I do, he only talks about himself, he says the worst people on earth are hypocrites but he is truly one of the worst himself (for example, how he is disgusted by ad hominem arguments but uses insults in arguments with me) and slowly the balance has shifted from it being fun to be around him to simply being tense and uncomfortable, I couldn't say a thing without receiving a conflicting reply in some way, I didn't want that negative personality around me anymore 

I confronted him with the fact that some of the behaviours I mentioned earlier are really not chill for me, he replied saying that those behaviours weren't his, but mine! That I act like I'm superior, brag, engage in belittling and know-it-all behaviour.. I shared this with my other two roommates who know me and him well too and they were shocked; he's convinced the bad traits he possesses are actually mine

I started taking distance, saying that I was busy when he wanted to chill or go out and we spent less and less time together, I felt relieved of stress

Then recently I confronted him about leaving trash around the house whilst we have a rodent infestation, and he exploded with rage yelling that he would punch me in the face if I would keep putting the trash he leaves around the house in his room, I went away and a roommate talked to him about the trash and he'd keep it tidied up, I was shaking for 30 minutes afterwards, I had never seen him that angry, and over such a trivial thing 

That for me was enough to take more distance, because it genuinely made me feel afraid, if he's convinced I'm such a bad person and holds such anger against me, although I'm not like that at all, I don't know what else to expect from him

Now the final thing was when last week I confronted him about the trash again via WhatsApp, which resulted in bitching back and forth and ending with him sending me a massive message saying I have problems/issues and need help, that I constantly look for conflicts and cannot communicate normally.. He told me he removed me from all social media and told me the friendship wouldn't work until I acted normally again.. Our whole apartment knows the problem doesn't lie with me, but him 

I honestly don't know what to do, I'm genuinely afraid that he wants to hurt me, he despises and hates me and he seems, honestly, delusional, he has suffered from manic depression and I'm convinced that that still isn't fully over, he's failing courses and can spend 11 hours per day playing video games, he spends full consecutive days in his room, pees in his sink so he doesn't have to leave his room, hasn't cooked food for 3 months although he used to cook every single day, if anyone asks him how he's doing he says he's doing great with his study, spends a lot of time with friends: basically that he has the time of his life, which is all simply not true, we all know it isn't true! I cannot start a conversation with him because he hates me and would never admit something is wrong because that'd mean I'd be doing better than him, he can't vent with his parents because of their relationship, and he has no further very close friends

It seems like a ticking time bomb and I feel like he'll either unleash on himself, or me 

What can I do? 

I've been thinking about sending an email to his dad about his mental health and our relationship but if he'd find out I did that I am sure he would explode with rage, he keeps up the pretence to everyone, including his family, that he's doing great, but then it'd be me 'ratting' him out.. 

Could someone please give me some advice? I honestly don't know what to do ",09Apr2017,9

I've been feeling really down and like none of these classes are worth it or will benefit me in any way. It's just about making the grade. I haven't got any good friends here either so most days it's go to class then go back to my dorm. The two classes I am passing are german and digital imaging which i really enjoy.

I haven't told my parents because they get so angry when i fail something, they'll threaten to take away my financial support. Having depression is in no way an excuse for failing in their eyes.

We live in the capital city, which currently has as 0.01% rental availability, hence why I feel I should be able to stay in my home. 
Of course I love him, and there wasn't really any other problems in the relationship. I could maybe look past the heavy drinking, but seeing as he's started up with coke and meth again, it points to an underlying issue he needs to deal with. I would hope he seeks counselling of some sort as numbing out isn't a long term solution. 
I do plan on talking with him, and letting him know I'm not comfortable with any of this. But I know from experience you can't ask someone to quit a heavy addiction like this, it has to be their own choice. I have to keep myself happy &amp; safe first.
I guess I was just hoping to hear from anyone with similar experiences.",09Apr2017,2

177,"My brother goes to the same wrestling class as this underweight (60 lbs, he apparently shouts it around like he's proud of it) kid bully aged 11. Apparently he pinned him down at lunch, spat on him and took his shoes; so all-round pleasant kid.

My brother told me he'd be in the park after school so I met up with him to get the shoes back. He reacts by being racially abusive (I'm black, he's white) and aggressive which surprised me since I'm so much bigger than him (6'2, 18 years old).

As I was talking, the kid sucker punched me hard in the throat and I dropped. He then wrapped his legs around my neck and squeezed, I was 'tapping out' but he continued and I got knocked out. Took me about 5 minutes to stand up and didn't notice the crap running down my leg until he and his friends started recording me and laughing. The internet being as it is, I later found myself on FaceBook looking like an idiot trying to stand up for 5 minutes while crap was running down my leg. And yes, he stole my shoes as well.

Anyway, my question is how the hell is my brother going to cope with the bullying now? He's probably the laughing stock of the entire school. He says he doesn't want to go to the teachers and I'm going to respect his decision. What can I do to rectify the situation?",09Apr2017,70

181,"Recently, several friends of mine suddenly started to ignore me with no explanation. Just totally out of the blue. One day, I was chatting with them like normal. The next, they just totally stopped responding to all attempts at communication, or at best, responded with one liners. I can tell they are reading my messages, but not responding (ever). I don't mean ""not responding immediately"" but they just do not respond...ever. Not the next day or the next week.

E.G. I message a friend once, he doesnt respond but i can tell he read my message. Several hours later, i send a second message asking ""hey, are you free to talk now?"". Again, he reads it, but doesnt respond. A week later, he is still not responding to any of my messages.

I know they arent busy because they are still talking to mutual friends and hanging out with them. One of them only talks to me when he wants help with something, but otherwise just ignores my messages or pretends to have not received them. When he does message me, he acts super nice and pretends that he didnt get my messages, etc, but the moment I finish helping him with something, he goes back to ignoring me again.

One other guy will only respond with random gibberish like ""my pool is on fire"" or ""my fish are drowning"".

I cannot think of anything that I might have done to cause this, since the last time I spoke to them, all was fine. We did not have an argument or anything. Its honestly baffling. None of our mutual friends who still speak to me has any clue either, or if they do, they aren't talking.

I have had issues with a certain stalker before and my friends who stopped talking to me are friends with the stalker and/or his friends. I have a suspicion this is somehow related, but I dont have any proof and the people in the know aren't talking obviously. But its the only thing that I can think of.

Especially since the stalker's friends started cozying up to a group of my friends right before this happened...and now those friends are either ignoring me outright or talking to me a LOT less. The timing is very ""coincidental"" to say the least. The friends in that group who still speak to me are either being very evasive when I ask them if anything is wrong, or saying they dont know anything. But we definately dont talk like before ever since the stalker's friends started to cozy up to them.

Personally, Im pretty sure that the stalker's friends are badmouthing me to my friends and convincing them to stop associating with me somehow.

Im not sure what I can or should do. If i leave things alone, its obviously going to get worse...but communication is a two way street and if they don't respond, I can't do anything. And all our mutual friends are just saying they dont know anything, etc.

Any ideas?

I'm currently in running start, and I had to register with my local school district to do the running start program. So even though I don't go to my local school, I'm allowed to join their proms, dances, and other school activities since I'm technically registered.

On one side, I want to go to prom, mainly because I've missed out on such a huge part of my young life, and prom would be an everlasting memory to have because I'm a huge believer of making memories.

190,"Hello Reddit,

So, **quick intro** to me: Me and my parents are expats in the UAE, and this is the time where I'm looking for a college. I don't like to talk to my parents much (I'm also really shy/have social anxiety in general), and I know I've done absolutely nothing about this problem for a long time (it came up in mid-late November 2016), but now, **I'm really desperate.** My parents have always taken care of me so far, and so, they are of the opinion that I cannot live by myself.

So, **problem**:
I've always wanted to go to New York University, Abu Dhabi. It's been like, my entire dream. My parents were also fine with it before this all happened. However, in mid-late Nov '16, they told me that due to job problems here in UAE, they cannot let me study here alone. They now suggest that I go to my home country, India, with my mom, while my dad continues to work in the UAE so long as his job remains. But, I *really, really, REALLY* hate India. Really, it feels like torture, or much worse. I don't think there's the slightest chance I can study there, alone, or with family. I've been in the UAE since childhood, and it is very luxurious here. I'm totally willing to study here alone if need be, but how do I tell/convince my parents, given that they don't think I can stay/study alone? I'm just too afraid to, and by the fact that I've done absolutely nothing about this for so long.

I have an entrance exam in India in mid-May, so I'll have to tell/convince them before that. **Honestly, I'll do just about anything to avoid going to India.**

Again, **I'm REALLY desperate. So thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for taking the time to read and reply.**

I'll keep updating this post as I receive advice. Thank you, again.",09Apr2017,1
191,"Okay, so this is a monumentally stupid scenario but I genuinely am wondering about hypothetical (worst-case scenario) outcome:
Last night, as myself and two coworkers were leaving work, I did something dumb. We were all about to leave the parking lot (each in our own cars) and I pulled out first. As a joke (a really, really stupid joke...), I blocked the two of them in (by parallel parking about 6 feet behind their parked cars). It so happened that one of them did not see me and, after about 30 seconds or so, backed out of her spot without looking an hit my (parked) car.
Both the coworkers are friends of mine, so I really don't think there will be any issues but I want to know anyway.
My car sustained most of the damage (both cars were minimally damaged, on that note). This morning I messaged the girl who hit me and apologized and, as a response, she apologized, as well. Like I said, I don't think this is at all going to be the scenario but, if she wanted to, could she make me pay for the damages to her car?

My dad got his first job at this same ymca as a lifeguard in 1988, my mom has worked here off and on for 20 years but got an office job here about 7 years ago and has worked the past 7 years straight here. I went to preschool, gymnastics, cheernastics, softball, soccer, simming lessons, and pretty much anything else offered here as a kid and learned nearly every skill I have today from this ymca. Most of my co-workers have similar experiences of growing up here and later working here so a lot of us went to camp together or something like that and we have a great family atmosphere here, almost like a mom and pop business, that is up until about 9 months ago. 
We got a new local CEO aka manager (he is only in charge of this one ymca) This new ceo.... Lets call him ""t""... has been terrible to everyone I cant begin to list all the terrible things hes done but ill say the most notable ones, he hates my mother (who I still work with) and kicked her out of her office because he wanted it as a meeting room and demoted her to basically my job. hes putting unrealistic goals on my supervisor and threatening to fire her if she cant acheive these insane goals, hes fired a ton of people most of which were our 16 year old staff for insignificant things, fired my supervisors kid, demoted several people  so he could hire all new staff (also pays new staff $12/h at minimum while i and everone else gets paid $7.25/h) and constantly makes it obviously that he wants all old staff gone. A good bit of staff, some  high paid salary people, have already quit due to the lack respect and many other things. He hasnt said much of anything to me because I keep my head down at work but its heart breaking to watch him berate and belittle coworkers ive called family for most of my life and watching the atmosphere of a place ive always called my second home be destroyed is awful.
 So, should I walk away from the place that raised me and say goodbye to coworkers I've known most of my life? Or should I try and hold out and see if things get better? Also I have 2 other jobs one at $10/h and the other at $13/h so money isnt a deciding factor in this, ive only stayed this long becuase its been such a great place. 
P.s. we werent a failing ymca or anything when he got here our numbers were higher than theyve been in quite a few years 
P.p.s. the new staff directors are wildly unqualifed none have degrees most have little to no experiance compared to who they've replaced so hes fired great people to replace them with people who legit have no clue what they're doing and our numbers are getting lower and lower with all the new guys talking over ",09Apr2017,1

In high school I had a fair amount of friends. I wasn't popular by any means but I had a group and we all hung out together. As well as other friends not affiliated with each other. Time went on and I lost every single one of those friends. Friends I gained through work, etc, We would stop contacting each other since we barely see each other.

As of right now I have 4 acquaintances, two of us play in a band together, one of them I cannot stand at all. The other 3 all have serious long term girlfriends, they obviously spend their free time hanging out with them. 

Anyway, I have really become increasingly lonely and depressed since I broke up with my last gf back in january, further cutting me off from a group of people, and I've come to realize I really have no friends. What can I do? It's like the 8th weekend since I broke up with her and I have sat at home (my parents home, to make things worse) doing nothing. I have a cousin who invites me to parties and gatherings with his friends every now and then but I really don't have anything in common with them so I barely ever go. Also his gf is kind of annoying and she's friends with one of my other ex's so dodging them is also a reason why I don't go

How can i get friends? The only social activity I do is go to concerts in the city like 1-2 times a month with the band members. One of them is a complete jackass and acts like an idiot in public, which further makes me not even want to go and do that either.

I was approached by a former acquaintance from college yesterday asking where I was and that they needed a place to stay. This person has traveled to NY and is now homeless and without a job despite them saying that they have applied to many positions.

Here is the problem, my in-laws neighbor pops up, comes to their backyard and says, “my basement is flooded and it’s because of your property so pay me 1200 to fix the issue so flooding doesn't happen again”. Is this a viable complaint? Is this my inlaws problem to fix?

My father in law asked me for advice and I told him not to pay anything because of the insane amount of rain in the past week or so. Also, the fact that my inlaws have been in that house for 20 years and this has never been an issue and now all of a sudden the neighbor pops up asking for 1200 to fix an “issue”.

222,"At age 18, my younger brother found work at a fast food place and worked there for a little under a year. The work environment was not great so he quit, which I totally understood.

The issue is that for the past year, he's mostly been sitting at home playing video games and browsing the internet instead of doing something productive such as going to school or going to work.

Two months ago he found a job at a fast-casual restaurant. However, within about two weeks of being hired, he was let go and the manager went on a long rant telling him that he was horrible and should never work in the food industry. Understandably, that hurt his morale but it's been two months and he hasn't shown any indication of going back to work.

The entire family is offering suggestions to him of places to work or even other things such as school or a gym membership to simply motivate him to do something productive.

He always responds negatively. He says that he's actively applying to jobs and does not need our help. He's the type to walk away from you or slam the door on you when you bring up a valid point and refuses to hear anything that does not make him happy.

I'm not sure what to do and neither does my family. We are trying to be accommodating but looking at the past year, that does not seem to be the solution.

Has anyone else encountered this? Any ideas for solutions?

Note: Before saying ""cutting off all financial support and kicking him out of the house""...that simply won't happen. His mother would **never** do that to him.

So yeah, with that caveat, any advice?",09Apr2017,1
224,"Ok, so, let me talk about myself a little so you understand the situation.

I am a student in a high school who pretty much is under constant stress when he is there. I also have a few problems with my family which gets me double more stressed out.

I am pretty much afraid of people, and school doesn't help it at all, so I've been trying to avoid it as much as possible to avoid stressing even more.

Due to that, I've even started taking antidepressants for my stress, which.. doesn't seem to affect me much. Really.

Internet is the only place that makes me feel better, by watching good funny stuff to help me calm down and feel better about my life.

Now, here's the problem: I have literally no motivation in schoolwork anymore and I just can't put up with the stress anymore. Due to that, I had to see a few of the workers in my school for them to 'help' me (which they do by forcing me to go there in the crowd which doesn't help, at, all) and now they've gone as far as to tell my parents that they're going to call social services on them due to me avoiding schoool.

I **don't**, and I repeat, **DON'T** want my problems to also be part of my parents' problems. And they're making it theirs too much. Not only that,  but what they've done is just.... dumb.

Here's what they did due to me skipping school: They've made it so I have to do a medical certificate every time i'm not at school, even if it's for half a day. Which means that if my alarm clock stops working and that I'm late for half a day, i'm doomed and I have to go to the doctor just to get a certificate to say: 'oh hey, i wasn't at school because my alarm clock is broken'

If I don't do the medical certificate and keep skipping school, my parents and me are going to get the social services on us. And I may NOT get the job I want.

If I do, and try to go to school as much as possible, I will just make the stress worst and ruin my mental health. Which is REALLY, REALLY not what I want.

So basically, in both options, it's a bad thing for me. So, tell me, wise people, what should I do?",09Apr2017,2
225,"I'm always so tired I can't even move. Every time I open my eyes I feel like one of those fetal babies being taken out of an incubator. I need at least 12 hours of sleep to feel good for about 7 hours. I need to nap or at least lay down for a few hours each day on top of that. My body is so desperate for sleep even when I first wake up that if I close my eyes I feel my head like pulsating just from my brain trying to recover. Literally even a minute of being awake is too much pain if I could sleep 24 hours a day I would. 

I'm thinking I need to give up on life and apply for disability there's no way I can live like this. I can't even function normally being able to sleep 12 hours a day whenever I want let alone getting 7 hours and being told when to sleep and shit I'm literally a zombie at that point and it gets to the point where I can't even talk good and I do shit wrong if I don't get 12 goes of sleep like I put the cereal in the fridge and I put the milk where the cereal goes type shit.

226,"I always hang out with the same people in and out of school, but lately, whilst we're on school break, the thought of hanging out with them makes me fed up and bored. 

I've been coming to terms with who i am as a person more lately and i'm sick of living a life to make others comfortable and happy whilst bringing myself down. Yet if i imagine myself being 'me' in school, i can't see myself with any friends. I feel like i'm getting bored of everyone in every friend group. I get too irritated too fast and so i understand i'm not the happiest person to be around. I just don't know what to do to make myself happy. Everything seems repetitive, time consuming or hard work, even if it's really not! 

Also, i understand that if i'm getting sick of being around these people that they're not really my friends, but that thought scares me a bit as then i wouldn't have any at all. ",09Apr2017,2

I really hate it when people do that but they say I'm acting all weird and laugh at me saying ""He doesn't like it if people show up at his house without calling"".

In my culture it is normal for grown men to live with their parents and I'm the only one in our group who has his own apartment so everyone is trying to make use of it for smoking pot. I don't mind pot but 12-15 people smoking all at once is like my house is being fumigated and they have no concern for my pets.

Out of frustration, I've stopped answering everyone's calls but they still show up anyway and start calling their friends over. How do I deal with this? Should I just pretend I'm not at home by not answering the door?",09Apr2017,1

234,"i'm 20, i have 1 friend, but we talk superficially never about anything, never had a girlfriend, i'm introverted and can hardly carry a conversation, it's better then it used to be tho and i'm thankfull for that.

these days i'm feeling aimeless, same routine every day, don't have a job so i wake up after mid day and go to the gym, eat,take a walk,play a game , watch a movie ,sleep.

I want adventure, i went to amsterdam last week with a group of friends of a friend, and i liked it there, in the hotel there were 3 20ish people, all 3 of them cleaning hotel rooms,2 girls and 1 guy, now i know that it isn't a good job, but i was envious, here are people who have adventures,and choose in life, in a city they probably diden't know.

maybe good to know, i'm doing a 3 year course to get a diploma in IT, i'm not passionate about it , but i guess it's better then nothing.

what should i do? travel? stop living with my parents and move? to where? an amsterdam like city? or maybe a smaller version?

i've been feeling this way for a while, it's depressing. I need something new, or is this just a phase? and should i ignore it.

238,"A couple nights ago, I came home from volleyball (I'm a senior) and my parents were at dinner for some thing for my dad's work. I knew my brother was home but I thought he was doing his homework or something so I ate downstairs and didn't announce myself when I got home.

Long story short, I walked upstairs and saw my brother (sophmore) dressed head-to-toe in my skirt, my top, and wearing makeup. He stared at me for a little bit while I sat there staring. I started laughing and found it hilarious (and kinda flattering?) but I obviously had a lot more to think about.

So I forced him to talk about it and yeah.. He full on wore my clothes for a long time. He wore my panties, and that is super gross so I told him this had to stop... Well at least some of it. I told him the following things: His makeup wasn't awful but if he wanted to do makeup, he could just ask me. He shouldn't wear my clean clothes and then put them back in my closet, cause I wouldn't want to wear them anymore. And that he needed to stop wearing my underwear completely. 

After talking until my parents came home, I decided not to tell them and my brother begged me to keep it a secret.

So here's what I'm thinking... I really want to treat him and take him to the mall one day, but I don't know where he would ""hide"" this stuff or if he would be too embarrassed. He's shy about it but I can tell he enjoys it, he's not gay but kinda acts like a girl. So yeah that's my rant about my brother.",09Apr2017,2
242,"I've been with my girlfriend about 5 months, although it seems like its short, we already know everything about each other, so the relationship is starting to feel a bit bland. I havent told her that i love her yet either.
Before I had a girlfriend I used to develop feelings easily for girls just for a couple of days and get over it.
I went to the beach with some friends yesterday and i met this girl, she was beautiful, blonde, tanned skin, green eyes and she seemed sweet and caring. She laughed at all my jokes and i started to gain a liking towards her. The same day i went to a party and she was there, I spent most of the time with my girlfriend, I barely talked to the other girl, apart from asking for her snapchat (idk why i did this), (it helps to say i was a tad drunk). The next day i had a lot of conflicts in my head, I didnt know what i wanted, i knew that i really liked my gf because she understood me in ways that no human ever has. I understand that i only liked the other girl more because she was new and shiny. I made up my mind that i wanted my girlfriend.
Later i proceeded to tell her about this stupid fucking crush (before reading reddit and learning that its completely fucking normal and to not tell your gf because it creates insecurities). I told my girlfriend about this, she's not mad but now she will doubt me on everything i do, plus she saw the other girl and feels insecure because she doseant feel as ""sexy"" as the other girl, and the other girl dresses how i like girls to dress, etc.
I honestly have no fucking clue what to do, please help, please.
Im going to see her on Tuesday to go on a fucking roadtrip with HER friends, god im fucking scared now...

245,"College Senior, 21 Male.

I recently decided to start going out to a local club with a some of my friends after spending the rest of my college career not going to drinking because I don't really ""get"" the obsession with drinking in this country. The place we go to has a dance floor, and late into the night everyone starts ""dancing"" with each other. My friends always try, to little success, dancing with girls and encouraging me to do the same.

But to be honest, I don't really ""get"" this either. I don't consider myself very attractive, simply based on how many women have declined my advances, so I don't really have the confidence to just approach hot women in skimpy clothes and start grinding on them like men are apparently expected to do. And I don't really understand how people talk in a club either, at least this one, because of how loud the music is.

I'm especially lost as to how to approach women that I know. There have been a handful of girls I've seen that I know, I like, and would like to dance with--and not necessarily grinding, either. But I'm really not sure how to approach them, since we aren't strangers but we aren't exactly friends either.

Anyone have any advice for me? I've tried approaching women normally around campus for years with no success, which is why I ultimately decided to go out.

249,"This will likely be a very long strain of text. I don't know how to make it shorter with getting every detail in but I would greatly appreciate it if you spent a few minutes reading and giving me your two cents.

About me: I am a 14 year old, starting high school at the end of this year. My hobbies include music (Playing piano for 7 years), gaming, and i'm not the best at social situations but I try not to let it weigh me down.

I'll start with the basics, I am most certainly depressed. In some way or another I am depressed because of a lot of things, most of which I have no control over. I really want to help myself out here, but i'm constantly reminded of every single one of my problems in some way or another.

My friend who I feel as if I am the only thing convincing her to stay alive: She is crazy. I'm not gonna lie, she is actually insane. Every single day she has 1-3 panic attacks, at school, home, wherever she feels like it. And I hear all about them, and am expected to help. It's my fault too, for being stupid enough to promise I'll always try and help. In the beginning of her relying on me, all she did was cry a lot. Then she started cutting her wrists, which I tried my hardest to get her to stop but its her drug or whatever she calls it. Then she gets scared and nervous over the stupidest shit. She had a panic attack because she had to go play putt putt with her Sunday School class. She constantly texts me about how shes feeling, and i'm honest with my answers. Every once in a while she'll get fed up with my answers and call me an asshole, among other various insults, then she wont text me for about an hour. Then she'll come crawling back with her problems. Yes she does like me, and shes open about it, such as touching where the sun don't shine when she thinks nobody's looking. I want a break from her and I don't know how to get it.

Moving on to my crush/potential girlfriend in next couple weeks: This is the only thing that makes me happy anymore. Texting/talking with this girl makes me happy in a way I can't describe. A few other friends have talked to her about me and she apparently has feelings too, which is the only good thing iv'e heard all month. The downside? She too, is friends with psyco-problem chick from earlier, and I have to take time away from talking with her to help psyco-problem chick. But a few days ago was the 8th grade dance at my school, and it was awesome. We hung out basically the whole time and it made me feel like I was on cloud nine. Until psyco-problems chick got bored and wouldn't leave my side. Once again, how do I politely get her to leave. That would be an incredible help. But advice as to ask a girl out would be nice, as I am inexperienced with that kind of stuff.

Mother with potential cancer: For years now, my mother has had spots on her face/upper back cut out because of potential skin cancer, and I thought to myself the whole time ""This is fine, if they keep cutting it out she'll be fine."" Not until recently, when she decided she was gonna stay out in the blazing heat, soaking up UV rays, until she was burnt so badly that she was purple, and blistering. She's a ginger, and her pigmentation isn't like it used to be so she should know better. My whole family and family friends tried to convince her to get out of the sun, but she wouldn't listen. She was too ""cold"" or whatever. After that I really saw how bad things could get if she didn't listen to us. I'm now reminded about that every time I see her. I want to help.

Asshole friends: Have you ever had a friend who got pissed at you for buying a Nintendo Switch (lets call that one Bryan). How about another one who constantly tries to get in between you and my crush from earlier (that one can be David). Well those are my two asshole friends. Bryan gets in these moods where he gets pissed and rants about anything you tell him. If you make a comment about his mother while hes in that mood, he'll probably curse her or something is how bad they can get. He's hilarious, and a good bro when he's not like that, but it's almost like he has a split personality half the time, and it's upsetting to hear him say such awful things about me and the people I care about. And David, I have so many stories about David, good and bad. He is the most passive-aggressive guy you will ever meet. He does stuff passively that has an aggressive effect. Like one time when I told him to stop interrupting me whenever i'm talking to my crush, which he knows I like. He told her, about that and made himself sound like the guy who was just trying to have a normal conversation, and me the asshat who wouldn't let them because I don't want her to talk to other guys. That's not at all what was happening. Not even close. I got that cleared up with her as well, and David has apologized since and tried to make things right, but that wasn't the first time he's done shit like this.

But that's about it for what constantly upsets me. I always feel depressed whenever these things happen, and I always try to at least help, but it doesn't always work, and in truth I will never be able to fully fix them. If anyone has ANY advice, I would love to read it. I need help with telling problem chick to give me a break and learn to deal with things herself. I need help asking my crush to a movie, or whatever she's in the mood for. I need help dealing with my mother, who I'm worried might end up with cancer. And I need to know what to do about my asshole friends, Bryan and David and how to either drop them as friends as a whole, or to get them to shut up whenever they do something to make me mad.",09Apr2017,5
