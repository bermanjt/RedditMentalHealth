0,"It's only been two weeks and I already want to change my major. I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering and I strongly dislike engineering. I enjoy Computer Science but the Computer Science major at my school requires all these engineering classes that I don't think I'm cut out for. I have taken many career tests and I always end up matching with Law and Political Science Fields. I love liberal arts but the problem is I want to be able to make money when I grow up. I enjoy Political Science, Psychology, Businesses and Economics. I'm just not sure what I should Major in. My adviser has told me I need to make the decision myself and has not been of much help to me. I have also been told that I have great speaking skills and am likable. I am willing to strive for internships and might go to Law School or some other form of Grad School so long as I like the field, but I am lost. I am a first generation college student and need help. Summary: I don't really like Engineering, am just really in it for the money. I like fields more related to Liberal Arts but I want to be able to support myself when I grow up with a nice income. Thanks

I was gonna go to Home Depot, but, my neighbor just got his door replaced. He said the manufacturer ran out of business and he had to get his door replaced and it costed him 18,000$. He also mentioned that he went to Home Depot, Lowe's, but, this is the cheapest he got it for. All I was thinking was around 3,000$.

8,"So i'm on the high school swim team and right now they are doing all of the prep for the start of the year. Now here is the ethical debate I have, i received an email yesterday that was the standard beginning of the year stuff. But once i got to the last paragraph it says:
""New this year in the S&amp;C facility is a fingerprint check in process to let me know when you are using the facility and let you track your success in the S&amp;C room!""

It also says that it is mandatory, but i have always had a strong stance against forcing people (especially minors) to submit bio metric data and especially not to track us and see what we're doing.

Should I send back an email or just go with it? I'm so torn on what to do, any thoughts on the subject would be appreciated.",12Sep2017,1
9,"so my boss came in today to the cubicle area and said he's leaving. A coworker said have a good day. And then he said good job today to me. and I was trying to say have a good day as well but it came out as 'you too'. And i said that right after he said that to me. I guess what the coworker said had some subconscious effect on me and i just blurted that out. can someone please just tell me what they think this is making me quite stressed. this is also like my 3rd or 4th week at this job. this has been on my mind all day.

edit: it is possible that he said 'im leaving have a good day guys' and then the coworker said have a good day. and then he said good job today to me. and then i said you too.

maybe i should talk to him and explain the situation tomorrow? ",12Sep2017,1
10,"Anonymous for obvious reasons. I am in my last semester and knocked out all of my algebra class in my first two semesters. Now I am on the verge of graduating, but one of my supposedly non-math classes is heavily focused on calculus. I don't even really understand long division, it's unnecessary for my industry, let alone calculus. I am so far behind on knowledge and don't think I can catch up; I work full time and am a full-time student.

I have a pretty good GPA (3.4) and I am already a supervisor in my industry, so it's not like I don't know what I'm doing. I just absolutely have zero understanding of anything in this class and have more likely than not gotten close to a zero on our first test (~30% of our grade).

11,"So I met this girl on fb and it was long distance and we talked for 9 months and we never talked about sex or anything it was all platonic and she was surprisingly nice to me and we were perfect for each other

I messed it up. It's been awhile now and I've been thinking of it on and off and this time it's been worse than ever. I think it's different because we had such an innocent relationship and it's the first time I'm not thinking of a girls past and shit I usually dump girls just for that. 

Usually in my relationships all I think about is sex and looks but with her all I think of is doing cute stuff and snuggling on a couch and watching movies or eating or something. All I want is a cute pure relationship but we haven't talked in months like a really long time and I'm a loser and she has her life together and stuff and she doesn't reply to me or anything and doesn't like me.

12,"Firstly, I just want to apologise for formatting (on phone) and if this is long and jumps all over the shop. I can be a bit of a scatterbrain when trying to get thoughts down. 

Anyway, onto the story. There is a bit of a back story to get through, sorry. 
I didn't have the greatest childhood. Definitely not the worst but I was never wanted by my mother. She told me every chance she had. She blamed me for sexual assaults that happened to me both when I was a small child and an adult. She was horrible and mean and encouraged me to kill myself on more than one occasion. She's not a nice lady. My father enables all that crap so I feel like he is really just as guilty. 

I just put up with it for the most part. You don't realise how not normal it is until you can step away from it. It was only after I started having my own children, that I grew the guts to stand up to her. I had a son and she adored him. She treated him like her own, to the point where we had genuine concerns she would take him. Nearly 2 years later a second child popped out and she treat him like garbage. After about a year and another child being born, I called her out on her shit and stuff basically blew up. I haven't spoken to her in about 4 years. I've since had another child she never met. 

When things were going down with her, extended family got involved and called me nasty things or told me I'm being a horrible child and that my mother loves me and how could I treat her like this. Long story short but I've not spoken with any single person from my entire extended family, on both sides, for years. My father's parents send a happy birthday message for each of my children, every year on their birthdays however I've never actually ""opened"" any of them. 

Before I ceased contact, my grandparents on my father's side were ill. They have multiple cancers as well as my grandfather having worked with asbestos when he was younger so has complications from that. I can't imagine they have too much longer on this Earth.

My dilemma is that while I don't miss them really as we were never close (have lived interstate from them my whole life) I don't know if it's the right thing to do, to contact them. Now would be the perfect opportunity to open a conversation as I'm pregnant again, with twins. They love big families and pride themselves on their many grand and great grandchildren. They would be ecstatic to find out. It would be simple to pop an ultrasound photo up in a Facebook message and say ""just thought you would like to know you have two more great grandchildren on the way"". 

If any contact were to open with them, I would immediately shut down any conversations about my mother. I'm not interested in talking to, or about her. Ever. It would purely to be to make some old people happy on their death bed. I'll never see them again, they live a 25 hour drive away and it's just unlikely to happen. I just don't know if it's a decent thing to do, to satisfy some old people who aren't inherently bad people. I guess I'm looking at it less from a guilt point of view (I don't feel guilty) but more from an empathy view. If I were old and dying, I would rest easier knowing all my family were talking to me and there was no burned bridges. Is it the right thing to do, to give that to them? 

If I contacted them, I would also do the same for my mothers step-mum. She was also a nicer lady but got caught up defending my mother. 
I would NOT contact my mothers actual mother. She's just as evil as my mother and I have no interest in satisfying her. My mothers father died after my first was born. 
I don't care what information gets back to my mother. She knows where I live (same state but about 12 hours drive away), if she was going to do anything, she would have already. What she knows about me and my life, doesn't affect me. She can dwell on it all she likes. So I'm not concerned about that. 

One other point is that I have significant social anxiety and a perpetual fear of being in trouble. I've had panic attacks before when asking a doctor for something and they've said no, because I felt like I was in trouble. This is all thanks to my mother as well, of course. So while I don't think anyone will have anything nasty to say to me, the possibility of it is moderately stressful. If they did, my husband is supportive enough and would likely just jump on and block them for me. But obviously, a multiple pregnancy isn't the best time to have added stress. 

What should I do? 

TL;DR
Haven't spoken to dying grandparents for years after a family falling out. Not sure if I should contact them about expecting twins to make them happy before they die.

13,"I recently made the worrying realisation that all my friends are kind of losers. Specifically the lazy, unemployed pot smoking kind that wakes up in the morning, smokes a bowl, and then watches TV all day. 

Even more worrying was the realisation that they were moulding the person I was becoming. My weed consumption has steadily increased since hanging out with these people (Been friends about 3-4 years)

It didn't bother me too much at first. Loads of people smoke weed, no big deal. But recently this group has started to idolise a slightly older and more pathetic group, and at this point I think they are beyond help. I see my friends trying to impress these people constantly, both in person and on FB.

Slowly but surely the drug use has started to include things other than pot, and I know where that can lead. They're going to go down that path. That's fine for them, they make there own choices. But it's not for me.

So, I guess what I need to know is... How do I break up with my friends? I don't have other friends, so I guess I need to make more friends too. I've never really had a problem like this before.",12Sep2017,9
14,"hey all. so i'm a new transfer freshman at my university. i took a couple years off after high school and took some courses at the local community college. i only had enough credits to transfer in as a freshman and am therefore titled awkwardly as a 'transfer freshman'. i am twenty years old and a major introvert. i wouldn't say i'm socially awkward but i definitely struggle to start conversation. however, if someone introduces themselves or starts the conversation then i have no problem carrying it out. i like to think i'm an approachable person but i guess that's for others to judge on not me. i've been in college for about a week now and am already concerned with the socializing aspect. for everyone around me ( in my hall, etc ) people seem to be thriving in the making friends department. being as i'm older i'm put with a lot of people who are upper classman and therefore already have their group of friends from prior years. my roommate is super nice but she too has activities she's involved in and friends that she spends a lot of time with so i feel as though i'm always pent up in my dorm with nothing to do. i'm starting to feel homesick and kind of like a loser and am unsure of what to do. i plan to attend the clubs fair on wednesday but aside from that i am worried i'll never make friends. is it too soon to panic? am i late to the game? any advice from transfer students or other introverts is very welcome. thanks so much! sincerely, a very lonely college student",12Sep2017,1

17,"**BACKGROUND**

I live with my boyfriend and our roommate, and none of us are pet owners. We live in a house with hardwood floors and very little in the way of upholstery/rugs. 

Earlier this summer, I took in a mother cat with her young kittens through a local fostering program. According to vet records, the mother cat was treated for fleas right before I got her. Long story short, we all loved having the kitties here, but they brought fleas with them. 

The timeline has been weird because the fleas only became noticeable after we gave the cats back three weeks ago, and we all went out of town for half of that time and they were worse when we got back. When we got home I started trying to treat the infestation, but it has been a lot harder than I expected.

**THINGS I HAVE TRIED**

* I picked up [Richard's Organics Flea &amp; Tick Home &amp; Pet Bedding Spray](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/dog/dog-and-puppy-flea-and-tick/flea---tick-spray--1/richards-organics-flea-and-tick-home-and-pet-bedding-spray) on the recommendation of a PetCo employee
* I sprayed that stuff on my mattress and couch THOROUGHLY, I washed the couch cushion covers and vacuumed under the cushions. I sprayed underneath the couch. I sprayed the curtains in both rooms
* I threw away my front rug, and I washed all of the bath mats, and those are the only rugs in the whole house
* I wiped down my bed frame with bleach, moved the bed to mop underneath it, and washed the duvet
* I'm still working my way through a mountain of laundry as quickly as I can, but all of the blankets in the house that haven't been washed are in that pile, and I've washed any clothes that were laying on our bedroom floor


------------------------------------


**Now, walking into my house is like getting punched in the face by a whole pack of Big Red**, and I'm sitting in my clean cinnamon bed, and like four times in the last two hours I've found a flea on me.

I'm losing hope. This cinnamon smell will last longer than my great-grandchildren will live. 

What can I do? Do I have to wash all of my pillows? Do I have to wash all of my clothes? Should I force my roommate to cinnamon-bomb his bedroom too? Should I buy a better product? WHAT CAN I DO?",12Sep2017,3

25,"Background story: We've been married 6 yrs, have a kid. Due to pregnancy hormones or whatever plus just having a kid around all the time, we went from sex almost everyday to a few times a month to maybe a couple times a month.

So a couple days ago while looking for something else,  I found a chat log on his phone with a person I had previously mentioned to him that I didn't like and was not comfortable with him getting too close to. So being nosy and suspicious, I read it and found out that he's been asking her for naked pics, ""joking"" about meeting up during one of his out of town trips that took him past where she lives, alot of sexually charged suggestions including trying to play a cyber sex game (where he tells her what to do to herself sexually). Some pictures were exchanged, none bad enough for me to get too mad about but still not happy about his comments.

Won't go into too much detail here but while the log was mostly fairly mild stuff and nothing that is blatantly cheating, I'm still very upset and am seriously questioning our relationship and if I even know him at all as I had never thought he was capable of doing this (I've made it clear that we can discuss anything). Its not enough to make me go banging on the nearest divorce lawyer's door, but a whole lot of trust is now in shambles. I've taken ss on his phone of the most incriminating stuff, sent them to me and left it on his phone. Its been 2 days and he hasn't said anything about it and is acting like nothing happened (including trying to have sex with me). I have mixed feelings, have no idea how to approach him, no idea what I even want at this point. Help.",12Sep2017,2
27,"My situation is a very complicated one, so I'll warn you in advance that this might end up being a long read. 

I'm 34 years old, am a high-functioning autistic, and have a lot on my plate. I have a sister who lives with me who is also autistic, but like me, you wouldn't know it to see her; we both just seem ""off"" for lack of better words. In addition to our parents both having a myriad of mental problems, we were also both carried to term very close to a chemical plant (now defunct) and several children born in the area ended up having a lot of issues. 

In addition to my autism, I've been further disabled by a traumatic brain injury and I have severe arthritis, near constant headaches, nausea, and several other physical issues that I won't bother getting into in extreme detail. 

My sister is a violent alcoholic who constantly attempts self-injury at the slightest disturbance. Often, she attempts injuries toward others. I've been supporting both of us for the past few years as we rent a house and I work 50 hours per week and she is unemployed. 

My parents are aging and are requiring more care as well, in addition to their mental states badly deteriorating. A combination of these various stress factors was starting to make my work performance worse, so out of desperation, I ended up going to a neurology clinic for help.

I was entered into what's called a Neurofeedback Program, which tries to stimulate areas of the brain that have either been damaged or never worked properly to begin with. The treatments have helped me a little, but the real gain was meeting my nurse, who we'll call Heather (not her real name). 

She's the most beautiful woman I have ever met in my entire life. She's also the best person I've ever known on every level. She's exceptionally kind, caring, selfless, devoted, compassionate, intelligent, engaging - in short, she's the type of person I never believed to exist. 

We've often had long conversations unrelated to treatment and we've both opened up to each other a lot about our pasts (we've both had a lot of misery thrown our ways), current struggles, and what we do to keep sane. We're both animal lovers and we always have pictures of our dogs to exchange every time we meet. 

I'm nowhere near the person she is, but our hobbies, interests, and preferences couldn't possibly be more similar and needless to say, I'm 100% in love with her, a feeling I've never felt for anyone in my life prior to now. It doesn't come so easily to most of us on the spectrum. 

Here's where the trouble and ""what to do"" factors come in.

As I've mentioned before, I present very oddly. I'm unable to modulate the tone of my voice (I sound like Lurch from the Addams family and that's not an exaggeration), I have very limited ability to show emotion/facial expression, and on top of it all, I'm just really ugly. I don't know if you've ever seen a Mongolian/Swedish crossbreed before, but we ain't pretty. 

Between my unattractive appearance, social deficits, and many family challenges, very few women would ever want to be with me, as I've learned from painful experience. Add my family responsibilities to the equation and it's no mystery why I've been single going on 6 years. 

Many people have told me for years that I need to get away, have my own life, and let my family care for themselves, but it's so much more easily said than done, in terms of guilt, worry, and accusations of abandonment. 

I'm set to move into an apartment sans sister on Oct 1, but it's only 2 blocks from where I live now, so I'm close by and can help when there's an emergency. I don't make a ton of money, so financially managing one home is challenge enough, but now it will be two.

Anyway, even if by some miracle Heather did have feelings for me, all of the problems I bring to the table would likely dissuade her. Additionally, there's the whole nurse/patient rule, which pretty much excludes us from ever being anything more than that. I've heard descriptions of hell being that the thing you love and want most in the world is right in front of you, but it's forever out of reach - you can look, but not touch. Right now I'm living that hell. 

My neurofeedback treatments ended in February, but due to recent family stressors (two suicide attempts, multiple alcohol based hospitalizations, and violent physical altercations)have made my pre-existing depression grow even worse, so I'm still once per month attending the clinic to speak with the psychiatrist there. 

Heather often will email me during the week to check up and see how things are going and we text back and forth a bit as well. Going into the office and seeing her for a few minutes to talk before seeing the psychiatrist is both the high point as well as the most painful part of my month. 

Basically, here's where I am - I'm in love with this insanely perfect woman, but know I can never be anything more than her patient. I don't mistake her kindness for romantic attraction - I'm 99.99999% sure she views me as a sick creature to be pitied. She desperately wants to help me and see my life get better, but I'm all but certain her feelings are strictly platonic.

Even if she were interested, any attempt to pursue anything would cause her to lose her job, which is tremendously important to her. I know I'll never have her heart and I know I'll never meet anyone like her again. It would be much easier if I could just forget about her, but my monthly recall visits prevent that from happening.

Again, I won't go deep into the details of my past, but it's been an exceptionally painful one. Somehow, despite all I've experienced, this hurts more than anything else ever has. What can I do at this point to try to repress my feelings for her and somehow handle this constructively? I've tried numerous dating sites, but have received only rejections. Please, if anyone has any advice of any form, I need it.",12Sep2017,1
28,"I won't lie, I'm suicidal. I also have attempted suicide twice this year.

The reason for this was because for the previous ten years, I've been bullied, had friends betrayed me and teachers watch without doing anything. However, I graduated and made good friends. But I had a poor attitude and got into arguments a lot. Now, I've lost many of them and I wish I could redo everything. I've apologised and told them how much they mean to me but nothing works.

More importantly, I want this one friend back. She was so good to me. During our orientation camp, there was this group of people who kept making fun of me and all my class did was tell me to ""laugh it off"" and that I needed to chill. I didn't want to be with anyone and she was the only one who went out looking for me and understood how I felt. There was a time when people found out about my grades(It was much higher than the entry criteria) so people assumed I was smart. But the reality was that I worked my ass off and it was really draining, I didn't like that people were just calling me smart and suddenly had these expectations for me. She realised that and listened to my problems.

Now she hates me and I have no idea what to do. I'm being counseled by my school but I really just don't know what to do. I don't want vague BS like ""Oh things will get better"" because you've got no evidence and life has never been easy for me. I just need to know what to do. I'm NOT gonna forget her and move on.",12Sep2017,2
31,"That title sounds horrible but it was the only way to sum up my situation.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years. The reason I've been staying at his families house for the last few months is because it's the only place I have a ride to my job. I've been working for a while and I've saved up a lot of money and I also make a little extra online too. My boyfriend works too but only online. I've saved up a lot of money and I plan on buying a car for myself soon and together we are also saving up for a down payment for a house. Once I have my own car I won't have to live here all the time and I can go back to just visiting sometimes. Our relationship is amazing. We don't fight often, we have fun, we listen to each other.

Here is the problems. My boyfriends mom has been sick with a lot of different problems and no health insurance. They pay out of pocket for all her appointments and have never asked us for a cent even though they are below the poverty line and on welfare. There was only one time my boyfriend asked if he could borrow money to buy his mom saline solution to clean the hole in her throat and of course I said yes because her life depended on it. If she dies they lose one source of income and they become homeless. My boyfriend was talking about how worried he was about his mom and the whole situation to me. He mentioned them becoming homeless and that if it happens I won't be able to get a car and we'll have to ALL move into an even smaller crappy place and barley scrape by. 

I don't want to be in that situation. I don't want to be responsible for my boyfriends entire family and risk being financially crippled by them. But as the one who makes the most money out of all of them I feel like everything is gonna fall on me. I'm young, naive, have no credit and don't need to be financially scarred by this. I don't see a way to avoid this unless I get my car before his mom dies and I'm praying I have enough time. I'm not gonna break up with him to dodge this bullet. I feel like a bitch for thinking like this. No one has said anything to make me feel like they're looking to me to save them other than my bf saying it would affect me getting a car.

I really do with my boyfriends family the best. They're not bad people and they allowed me to stay with them so I could work and I am grateful. So I hate to say it but they are a hazard to my financial health and a potential burden. It's hard for me to see my own family and I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. I really hope that I have a car, house and large amount of savings before something happens to them. I mean if they become homeless while I'm still around them there's no way for me to dodge this without looking like a bitch. I don't want this to hurt my relationship with my boyfriend either.

At work, my boss asked me for my business (Windows) username and password. It is commom for my peers to exchange their own passwords when others go out on vacation and I believe that it is a unsafe and risky practice.

So I don't want to give her my password. She gave me her password before she went out on vacations, and now she is back and wants mine, in case I have a sick day or go on vacations. My computer is linked with my department's software, so someone has to log in everyday.The person previously on my position gave their password to my boss.

The HR manager is very close to my boss, so I'm not sure if I could ask him about it, as this will probably turn against me.

Lastly, I cannot change my password since the IT guy is sick and is not at the office, so the closest person to deal with this (changing my passoward or so) it will be the HR manager.

35,"So, this is an issue I've had my entire life that has never been resolved despite overcoming things like depression, self harm, a short stint of substance abuse, and being a general ass.

I don't fit in.  Even when I have ""friends"" we never really connect on the same level it seems everyone else does.

I was raised in a military family and I think my formative years led to this predicament.  When I think about my interests throughout the years, only one ever really involved other people.  Everything else has been a solo activity and even then they've been uncommon in many ways.

For example, when I was around 8-10 and first played video games I had no idea what things like Quake, Diablo, Warcraft, etc were.  I knew like Mario and Sonic, but I never played those.  There were no consoles in my house until after I moved out.  So I was playing things like Aces of the Deep (a WW2 submarine simulator) and various WW1/2 flight sims.  Those games contained quite a bit of information on their respective aces and wars so there I was reading about Wolfgang Luth and trying to break the tonnage record while the 'Happy Times' were still afoot.

Then I grew up watching Babylon 5, S:AAB, The X-Files (when I was allowed), and a lot of Star Trek.  Yes, lots of people watch the latter two shows, but B5 is still probably my favorite and I have never encountered anyone that actually watched it anymore.

I feel like being introduced to things like this discussion on religion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_oQkSh2lq8 and the four fundamental questions (Who are you? What do you want? Why are you here? Where are you going?) at an early age led to some developmental issues.  If only in the sense that I questioned everything and because I couldn't figure out an answer for myself I distanced myself from the world in the pursuit of idle pleasures.

And now, as an adult, I feel as if an issue I have in general is a lack of commonality with others.  Part of it is undoubtedly me being a bit of an ass.  I'm not patriotic because even though I was born in America I think democracy is a farce and more importantly our shared humanity matters more than what country we happened to be born in.  I have enough sense to not say things like that in public, but it always gnaws at me.

It's like I'm on the outside looking in.  Not just ideally watching because I do have fascination with the human condition so it is a constant learning expert to see how we interact with each other as time goes on.  I'm sure it sounds trite, but I'll try to explain what I mean.

Everyone is unique in the sense even if we have experienced similar events every person is made up of countless experiences that no one else has actually had so at best we can only have a shallow understanding of the other.  You can divide this up into how they internally process things and were conditioned to do so (this is where I think psychology and nature v nurture comes in).  But then we also have the impact of society at large both on that individual and that individual's family (anthropology and sociology I believe) and all of this comes under the umbrella of human history.  At least that's how I look at it.  It's an anthology of individual stories that all tie in together.  I love storytelling and I have a tremendous itch to write if only to create a believable world that reflects the one we live in.

So now that I've gone entirely too long...I don't know what to do.  I understand the importance of connections, but I can never form them.  Am I the one holding back?  It's surely not for a lack of superficially shared interests, I've dabbled in music, played entirely too many hours of video games, was once very strong, athletic, and lean, learned a great deal about physiology and nutrition in the process, love reading, write some, and so forth, but it just doesn't seem to matter.

I know someone else has to look at things the way I do.  ",12Sep2017,1

I am a 16 y/o guy in 11th grade. My parents always tell me that this is the most important year, and I cant do anything but study. While i do agree with the first point, i disagree with the second. They know I am applying myself since I have been on honor roll since I joined, and I am taking 4 AP's and 1 honors class this year (the last class has no option for ap or honors and is mandatory), and to get these classes, I had to talk to a lot of people to convince them to let me. AP's are very restrictive in my school so I had to take tests and talk to 5 or 6 people, and fill out applications. Not to mention I stay at robotics 3-5 times a week for 1-3 hours since I am a lead of one of the departments.

The point I am getting at is that I am trying but they want me to play 0 games (literally 0 on my phone, ps4, or laptop), and they want to shut off my internet so i can only do homework at certain hours.

Its like people are literally incapable of being able to see things from my perspective.

The other day I was in a pretty bad mood, but I never really gave anyone attitude or took little jabs at anyone, I was just super quiet the way I always act if i'm upset. However usually if i'm really upset ill take it out on the people I consider closest to me (I know its not right but i'm trying to work on it). So I distanced myself from one person that I ALWAYS talk to, and now they wont even respond a text to me, its the first time ive ever done something like that to them, i'm always outgoing around them and never give attitude, will generally do whatever they say, take them out places etc.

Now that was just an example, my friends as another example do and say some pretty shit things to each other and always are forgiven or its almost like it just completely goes unnoticed. So why is it whenever I make the smallest mistake or even a mistake in general I just get slammed for it every time???

just facts about myself in case it provides any insight or help:
I get invited out with friends often, if I ever ask someone to go out with me its usually a yes, i'm generally outgoing/funny, incredibly loyal etc, I legit never do anything I think would potentially upset someone i'm always very careful with that.

53,"Here is the situation...



My roommate (we are in the basement), 50 year old, Iranian complains that the liquid [soap](https://www.google.ca/search?q=irish+spring+original+body+wash&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG8r-00p7WAhXCxVQKHdHgAOwQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=699&amp;dpr=2) (The first image you see) that I use has a scent and apparently he gets headache from the smell.



The first time he complained, I just said, ""ok, I will use a different one,"" as I didn't know what to say, I thought that statement/comment was pretty retarded. Let me tell you about this body wash if you haven't used it before, it obviously has a scent, if you open the bottle cap and put your nose close to it. I mean every soap has a scent unless you are using straight Animal/Vegetable oil, which obviously has it's own smell that's why the manufacturer put a scent in it and you have different scents, original (close to or no smell) and the other kinds with scents. Back to the body soap, when you use it on your hands and smell them, you don't get the scent anymore.



When he first complained, I used the body wash in the kitchen area as I am a germaphobe because I felt the body wash kills germs (not even sure, if it does) after doing dishes.



After that, I talked to my landlord seeking advice on what to do (they live upstairs, with his wife and three other people), his wife apparently has severe allergy issues, and as a result put it in the rental contract saying we can't use, ""perfumes, colognes, body sprays, room deodorizers, scented candles, scented bathroom sprays must not be used on the premises and only use non-scented laundry detergent.""



So, the landlord told me to use the body wash when I am showering and not when I am in the kitchen.




Well, I am thinking about letting my roommate win in this situation because we share a fridge and I don't know how he was brought up but I don't want him to be messing with my food in the fridge (if I don't let this go). I have no intention of getting at my roommate through his food, I consider different issues separately.



He complained for the second time today.  What kind of soap/body wash should I be using in the kitchen after doing the dishes and before preparing my breakfast/lunch box? I forgot to add, I think my roommate is a bit disgusting, he uses/touches the garbage disposal (compose, recycle and garbage) under the sink, doesn't wash his hands and touches everything else, fridge, stove, and cupboards. That's why before/after doing the dishes, I use my body wash as sanitizer to kill germs.




What if he complains this shit again after using a different brand, how do I know which body wash scent/smell he is okay with? Cause I don't know what he expects me to use (the one that I am using has no scent/smell, I could be biased but I am pretty sure I am not).




Which other soap do you recommend that kills germs? Thanks a lot. Could you also share you opinion on this on how I should go about this? Thanks again!

54,"Hey reddit. I need your help. I've been incredibly isolated lately thanks to a 2 year stint with homelessness, a few years in the military where I didn't felt like I belonged or fit in, and a pretty dark and rough child - young adulthood. 

After staying in a homeless shelter mostly comprised of senior citizens , I began to realize the importance of keeping healthy and preserving my youth. With that being said, I feel so disconnected from the world. I don't know what people in my age group (18 - 26 I suppose) that I don't think I would be accepted socially very well. 

I have no clue what people are into nowadays, what's cool or what's lame. I don't know what's in or out of style in this day and age. I don't know what young people these days value or represent, how they think,  or what their focus is on  (parties, career, money based adventures like road trips and concerts and things, maybe some mixture of all of it). I even out of touch with the general disposition of the youth nowadays 

I feel like I'm a 50 year old parent trying to be cool and hip again when I'm half of that age should be that anyway. I don't know what to do.  

I live right in the neighborhood of a huge CO campus and I see peope around my age all the time, but I have no idea how to connect with them on their level and in a way they can relate to and connect with.

I am not totally lame. I walk with confidence that the ladies definitely notice, I dress well and oft complimented. But outside of that I'm pretty behind the times and I have no clue how to get back on the saddle and pick up where I left off. 

So my fellow redditors , if you have any ideas I'm all ears. 

Some info that may help: 
1. Getting back into college seems pretty unlikely at this point. Just too expensive and I seperated early so no GI Bill. 

2. I don't have a car at the moment but I  am saving.

3. I don't have any friends besides my brothers and my old high school FB friends. Though I don't think that counts since they are on the other side of the country from me. 

TL;DR: Due to a 2 year stint of homelessness i became very socially isolated; now, that I'm back on my feet--and in a new city, no less--I'm having a little trouble getting back in the loop with people my age. Anybody have any  ideas that might help ?

68,"Hi, this is my first post here so please forgive me if forget something.


For the past 2 weeks or so I have had this thought of death in the back of my mind and it doesn't let me be in calm and keeps me really nervous. It came from many reasons I guess. My parents are getting old, the news always mentions deaths, here on reddit you see death almost every day on the front page, and it makes me think about it. About death finality, and eternity. I have had existential crisis throughout my life, but I always shrugged it off, but now its in the back of my mind.

Please don't think I have any suicidal thoughts or anything like that. The point is, I don't want to die, so it makes no sense to inflict death upon myself. This fear of death raises other questions about the existence of everything and an afterlife and God and many other things all at once.

I believe in an afterlife, this existence wouldn't make a spec of sense if it weren't. Either a God exists and our soul goes to another plane of existence, or we are in a simulation or many gods exist, but I cannot bring myself to believe there's nothing.

I try to think about it, and it raises a myriad of questions. If there's nothing, what is then the purpose of reproduction? why do animals strive to make more of them if it'll come to nothing? why do humans have evolved to be conscious beings if we also will come to nothing? Why do we think about this questions of death if we don't need to do so? What is the nature of this Earth, so suited for our needs if it'll come to nothing? 

If living things did not exist, the universe would be the same, we are nothing in this vast existence, yet we are here?. I cannot find sense in it.

69,"So I have an important question. I would prefer if this answer is provided by someone who actually knows about this kind of stuff and the FBI. So as you know, when applying for the FBI you apply under one of five categories sort of. They are different professions including accounting, language, law, computer technology or whatever, and diversified I think it's called. So obviously, depending on which of these you apply under will determine what role you play in the fbi. For example, if you speak a second language you'll be dealing with deciphering things from other countries or whatever blah blah or if you are an accountant you'll be dealing with things like that under the FBI and so fourth. So I want to make it clear that I will not be applying under the diversified category because it's too competitive. So my plan is to major in psychology and get my bachelors. And obtain my JD in law school and get my work experience then apply. What my QUESTION is, is if you apply under the law category, what type of work will you be doing?

81,"I was sent to a Christian alternative education program by my parents from 2nd grade. It was a decent enough place at first but as I grew older it didn't really suit me anymore. I was not an edgy atheist by any means but I was also not a fundementalist Christian. The teachers kind of picked up on this, not because I argued or was obnoxious towards them but because they could tell my mind kind of wandered during discussions of theology. Some teachers accepted this and some did not, instead choosing to either ridicule me, fail me or ignore me. 

I struggled a lot with depression in 9th and 10th grade because of my desire to believe in God conflicting with how I was treated by the Christians in my life. In the middle of 11th grade, this January, I dropped out of this ""school"" because I couldn't take it anymore and I wanted to finish high school in a public school. Unfortunately I learned that my previous credits counted for nothing in a public school environment. I should've figured it out beforehand, I know, it was my mistake. 

I considered getting a GED but I've heard that isn't too desirable so I skipped that and took the SAT in May 2017. My results were decent (pretty bad math score, good reading score, good essay score). I will probably do the SAT again next month

At this same time I had started making YouTube videos and maintaining a blog, practicing writing as I would really love to be a writer when I'm older. I have 750 subscribers and my website gets a few thousand hits per month. I write and make videos on whatever academic/culutral topics interest me at the time and I think this could be a great boon to any application since I am already working on my goals in life. My writings have been noticed and praised online by multiple professors and academics. 

I've also completed National Novel Writing Month once and plan to do it again this year, I got accepted into the IAPWE (whether or not thid is actually prestigious I'm not sure), I play 3 instruments and I taught myself to read/write German and Esperanto and some Italian. I have graphic design, motion graphics, analog photography and narration portfolios. There might be more I'm missing but I'm pretty tired and I don't really like bragging anyway. 

In my free time I bike, work out, read fiction and of course I have a bit of a social life. 

I'm just really scared that relatively poor high school grades in some areas will fuck me over. I should've been starting my senior year of high school right now but instead I'm floundering around trying to make something of myself.

Can anyone give me some advice? neither of my parents went to college (they are very successful carpenters) so they can't and don't really care to help me. I have my eye on NYU, an ex got in there this year and she also dropped out.

92,"About two years ago (my sophomore year), I moved to a tiny 600 people town in central Idaho from my hometown of Boise Idaho. The schools I went to in Boise were much more populated with Democrat students, so it was easy to voice my opinions and get some people to agree with me in class and out. Rural Idaho is  completely different. I am one of very few democrat students, so I'm picked on quite fequently. I absolutely dread going to economics, government, or psychology because I know the entire class is going to attack me verbally. 

For one example, last week my psychology class was talking about what common sense is, and my teacher was telling us that not everyone has common sense and thats why we out warning labels on coffee now. 
So I raised my hand and asked if she was referring to the McDonald's Hot Coffee lawsuit. And she said yes. 
I tried to explain to her that the poor old lady who won the lawsuit was in the right because McDonald's shouldn't have been heating coffee near the boiling point to serve to people, and that it caused her severe burns after spilling it on herself while going over a speed bump in their parking lot. 

Immediately everyone turned around and started yelling at me. (This might sound like an exaggeration, but our classes are so small that the teachers usually let kids talk without raising their hands, and dont even try to keep stuff like this contained.) 
The teacher laughed at me and told me coffee is always hot and the old woman was stupid and probably only wanted money, and  so the kids were siding with her and continued to yell at me. 
After they stopped, the class was waiting for the bell to rang and I started to cry. Usually I don't let it get to me, but it's been everyday something like this happens, and it makes me feel stupid. Sometimes its everyone yelling at me like this, and other times a couple people laughing or rolling their eyes. 
It doesn't help that I have Borderline disorder, so this is all messing my head up really bad. I think it's hurting my boyfriend too because people ask him why he's dating me.

Is it a win win for her? Her motivations are murky. Being that I have a renewed, powerful focus in my life, what do I do with it?

99,"This reminds me a lot about starting college after high school. High school felt like it lasted forever after 4 years with friends and classes. i never felt like it was going to end until graduation hit me. I went to a community college and lived at home because my grades were meh, at college i got good grades and transferred to my High school dream school after 2 years. But again it felt like forever, it felt like it would never end, even though i applied ago transfer a year ago.

I don't know how to leave what i'm so used to. Like leaving high school classes for something less restrictive was nice, college classes were awesome (i could show up if i wanted to), work sucked but i got paid, i had control over my week, i learned how to drive and went out more often, but i always had my home, my stuff, my room. I leave in 2 weeks and it's just so surreal.


I had a sister that left for uni and i was sad, my family was sad, my little brother still had me at home but now i'm going and our relationship is not what i want it to be. He's sad i'm leaving and i feel guilty. My dad gave me shit about not transferring to a closer uni (i applied to one but got rejected even w/ my grades, the other i didn't like), now he's accepted it and offered to help pay my rent. My mom has always wanted me to go to uni and accepted it when i first got in. It's just i'm having trouble accepting i'm leaving. My best friends, my family, and i'm trying to make up with a former friend to bury the hatchet, but i'm having anxiety reaching out.

I'm going to have 2 roommates and i hate sharing a room. I won't take my car this year so it'll limit how far i can go (and visit home), i'll still do plenty of intramurals to keep me happy, but i just don't know how to do this change: one night i'm home, in 5 hours i'll be in my new apartment. i'm worried i'll struggle to meet people, especially as a transfer. I'm worried my classes will overwhelm me, i'm registered in only 3 classes as opposed to my usual 4 but i hear 1 of them will especially be hard. I'm going from being one of my college's top students (i was in the top 8% all 4 semesters, never even close to that in HS) to probably getting my ass kicked in Uni.

I don't know my hometown well, i don't know any street names by heart, but i know my home, and i've wanted to leave since i was 10 and found out i could when i was 18. i half assed it at 14-17 (my peak years of wanting to go to uni) and now that it's actually happening i don't know how to accept it myself. I can't cry, i don't think it'll hit m until i actually leave.",12Sep2017,5
100,"Hey there this is my first time posting so please help me if you can. Long story short I took 2 days off of work using the excuse of Jury duty. I had told my boss about a month before that I was going to need the first day at least off. Obviously I took the second day off. My boss is now asking me for proof that I was at Jury duty. I do have a jury summons that is a little messed up mainly cause I wrote all over it and just left it on my table so you cannot see the date any more but you can't see the year either (well you can barely see the 7 if you hold it up and look at it from the right angle) so I do not know if that will be useful. I did find a picture on my phone of one of the sides showing my date and I'd number and group number. Problem is the date is also incorrect. Not by much it is still the same month probably could change it on photoshop or something. Any way my question is this. Do I legally have to prove to him I was at jury duty or do I legally have to prove anything at all? I figure it is 2 days maybe I do not have to prove anything like when you are sick. I live in California so would need an answer that would fit to their laws.

The only reason he is even asking is because one of the guys I work with who thinks he is in charge is telling my boss to get verification from me. Only time my boss brought it up was right after he got off the phone with him.

103,"I've realized over the past couple years, that I've become very oblivious when I walk to/from locations (especially at my university). It's quite concerning, and I feel that it may put me at risk in the future.

Let me explain. When I walk around and people say ""hi"" to me or things of that nature, I don't immediately pick up on it till almost after I walk past them.
This also goes for me seeing people (literally seeing people) until they say something to me. For some reason, I don't focus on the faces walking towards or next to me.

I noticed that when I walk around, I'm not really on my phone, but rather constantly thinking about a mental agenda or checklist.
I.e. What I have to do later in the day, things I have to get done, etc.
I believe this is what's causing me to be extremely oblivious to the things going on around me. 

However, I find it odd because I'll stop to look both ways to cross the street, or other things that come by instinct, it just seems I'm oblivious to people.

104,"Hi,

My father passed recently. We hired a lawyer prior to his passing to draft a will and trust so that everything would be taken care. We were under the impression that the $3k we spent will be a one time fee.

However, since his passing, our lawyer says we will need to hire a CPA for estate planning for tax purposes. Our assets near $5 million. I understand this fee.

However, our lawyer will charge an additional $2k-$4k for administration. This is the fee I'm curious about. I thought my father already paid $3k to handle all of this. Now he's asking for more money to do work that I thought was already taken care of.

Also, I've been email him. Will he charge us for that?

Any advice would be gladly appreciated.

105,"I rant enough elsewhere...I'm not going to justify anything. All I am saying is that almost nobody these days wants the same things that I do from life. I am 20 and have never been in a relationship before. Somewhat involuntary, but I have turned down people because they don't share my values. I want somebody who is focused on ultimately getting married and making that their primary devotion in life. Somebody who truly thinks a successful marriage is the most important thing in life. I would like to get married moderately young (preferably 25 or younger) and *build a life together*, not have to spend the next decade in misery waiting for someone. I also do not want to have any sex until marriage.

I became a Christian again around 6 months ago but haven't picked a denomination yet, so I don't go to church. I am probably going to graduate school in two years and try to get a PhD. I was actually thinking about teaching English after I graduate college in some place with a younger marriage age (e.g. Vietnam) but I would constantly worry about whether they actually love me or just want money and a green card. Online dating is worthless, but I've only used OKCupid and Tinder.

Unfortunately, nobody these days my age wants anything to do with any of those things. They just want to ""focus on their career"" or have a drawn-out series of short-term relationships etc. If you're going to suggest I imitate what those others are doing (or tell me some shit about needing therapy etc), save your breath.

106,"So a new housemate moved in; and, frankly put, the guy is a pretty inconsiderate person to live with. He 'misplaced' his keys to the house about two weeks ago. I asked him if he lost them, because, you know, that would be dangerous for everyone living in the house; but, he insists that he has them laying around in his room somewhere, but just can't find them. Okay, no problem, but everytime this guy needs to get into the house, he rings the damn doorbell. I was trying to go to sleep at 11:55pm tonight, and he rings the doorbell for three minutes straight waiting for someone to answer. Not cool. He also stomps like a damn elephant when he walks. He has woken me up almost every damn day past midnight and around 5:30am whenever he goes to pee or do his grooming. I've talked to him about the stomping several times, and he has apologized and said he is going to be quieter late at night and early in the morning. I've told him that I don't care about him stomping during the day, but if it's late at night past like midnight or before 7:00am, I'd really appreciate him being more mindful of how he's walking because it's shaking the house.

It's additionally frustrating because I'm expected to feed the kids and when they leave, they aren't required to clean up after themselves. - regardless of my requests for them to do so. 

The favor is returned maybe once every 4 months, for a couple hours with my one child being treated to a movie or play date.  To make matters even more annoying, when I travel for work, they ask my husband to basically watch their kids non-stop. 

I love my friends very much but I can't keep being a free babysitter. I do WORK from home &amp; being a contract employee &amp; consultant means I only get paid upon performance. So when I have to stop and babysit kids for free, I'm losing money and I'm also paying for food, activities, etc. and while I'm assuming I make more money than them, that doesn't mean I can go without an income.

I broke it off nicely and politely because it would quickly turn into a toxic relationship and I love that girl too much to do that to us. 

3 years later, we still love and feel things for another quite a lot. We spoke and we understand each other better. We seem to be more mature and better people overall. There's a chance that we may get back together on a ""take it a step at a time"" basis.

Thing is, her sexual activity troubles me a bit. Not in an insecure way as we're all human. I sort of drunkenly asked her number of partners and she shared it. Assuming she's not lying, it's a ok healthy number to have for a gorgeous girl of her age and it's around the same levels as my number so I believe it's ok. 

Maybe I'm afraid that she did silly things out of hurt when we first broke up, like finding a dude every weekend. Maybe I'm possessive. Maybe I'm a cuckold. Maybe I just love her so much and can't stand the idea of her with others. Maybe I'd like to know that she is indeed the person of integrity that I think she is and that she didn't go with 'unworthy' people while we were not together. Maybe I'm just guilt-tripping myself.

So first of all I going to begin, this isn't a very big for some people but to me this is very fucking annoying i guess. So I'm currently a 17 year old who is 7 weeks out of graduating school, I don't live with my parents and I will in another city from them for school purposes (Living with step-sisters). Sounds very casual yeah? Wrong. I have this awkward fucking problem that I legit cannot change and I didn't create. I was born to Flipino mother and Australian father, sounds normal but when I say this. My mother is 52 and my fucking dad is 85. Like what the fuck cunt. Growing up with them in a rural town wasn't really that bad, people kinda of accepted it because it didn't change who I was. But I notice that fatherly bond that my friends have with their father never existed for me. I wasn't interest in that sorta shit cause I had a fucking old dad and now I look back on it, I really wish I had a father bond, (with someone fucking younger). But at my age now I haven't offered my parents to meet any of my friends from high school. (They only come up for a week or so every 2-3 months). One is dumb &amp; asian and the other is dumb &amp; old. I don't want them to come to graduation because I know i'm just gonna get so many weird looks and I just don't want that fucking feeling. Its a problem I had no control over, being born to retarded parents. Anyway I know this sounds so harsh but If you were in my boots you would understand.
There are so very funny pros to this. Since my dad is 85 he had previous partners, which involved having 2 kids before me like 50 years before my age. So when they had kids I technically their step -uncle i guess. So i'm a 17 year old who is an uncle to a 40 year old. How fucking funny is that. (and im also a great uncle ;).",12Sep2017,0

And it sucks because I am lucky to have a life that is safe, and lucky to have the things that I have. So why can't I just enjoy that? I live in a city/state that is very small, and very quiet. I dream to live somewhere else but money is tight, of course it is. A likely story. 

It's just, in little ways my mind is trying to get me to wake back up. To do things that are thrilling, to show that things can be amazing. So I decided to go skydiving (in a different city) because I wanted to feel alive again. I didn't. In fact, I don't remember the last time that life felt worthy and that I felt alive. That's sad... 

Sometimes I feel like the world doesn't want something for me. Sometimes I'm reminded to wait for things to happen and make them happen. But they never do, and my patience for life has disappeared.

131,"Let's set some context:
We've been dating for 4 months now
She's Catholic, I have no religious preference
I've just turned 24 and she turns 21 soon
We met in, and are still in, the military 

 So my woman at the very start of the relationship stated the she won't have sex before marriage, and I'm cool with that. Personally I feel like if I change that, she'll regret it and relate me to her regret and what have you.

I have noticed however that she's very...independent? I'm not sure the word to describe it, but we can go for days without talking unless I start a conversation.

I feel like emotionally she has some walls built that are there to prevent her from someone leaving her, OR she simply doesn't understand deeper levels of intimacy because she is abstinent, and therefore seems more unattached.

I feel like I'm putting in far more effort in our relationship than my fair share, because it feels like she doesn't care, but as well as I know her I know it's not the case, but despite that I can't help but feel this emotional weight (like, it actually feels like my heart is heavier) that I'm shouldering for us both.

I just think I shouldn't be the only person making an effort or showing I care. What would y'all do in my shoes?",12Sep2017,1

133,"I bought a piece of furniture from an Italian middle-man company. They sent me a second one by mistake. I let them know about their error, and asked if they'd like me to send it back. The item is still in the box, as it was when it arrived at my house. All I need is a shipping label.

I have gone back and forth with the customer service rep for about a week. She is asking me to remove the item from its package, assemble it, and send her pictures so that she can inspect it for damage. I understand why she thinks this is necessary -- part of the package was ripped away when I received the item, so she reasoned that there could be some internal damage.

But this particular item has a lot of packaging, and some of it will probably get damaged if I remove it. I will probably need to go out and buy some packaging supplies in order to get the box back in ship-ready condition. Also, the item takes about an hour to assemble and disassemble. I don't really feel like I should have to devote this much time, effort, and money to fixing their mistake.

I know legally I have a right to keep it (at the very least until they send me a shipping label). But morally -- and to protect myself from credit issues in case they try to charge me for it -- what should I do?

Update: I sent them a version of the message that /u/TheMeisterAce proposed. They got back to me immediately, stopped asking for pictures, and said to stay tuned for a label. So, thanks!",12Sep2017,26

136,"I am an intermediate visual artist, and have been painting/drawing digitally since I got my first tablet. (Been using a mouse before that, but then I was much younger). The choices for me right now are:

- an iPad pro, 2nd gen. Around $1200.
- Surface pro, newest version. $1100.
- Intuos pro, 2017 version (L). $600.

They all have huge pros and huge cons. 

___

- iPad Pro has a very good screen. Also, the stylus has dynamic pressure modes, which is very wanted. The 256GB version costs the same as a surface pro, but which is 64GB at the same price. The con is that I can't use windows apps on it. Although, my main goal is to get a device to paint on, and an iPad works very well for that.

- The surface pro is basically a tablet, but with a stationary OS. The screen is a little worse than the iPad, but is still very good. The stylus is a little worse, but it does have side buttons. The pressure sensitivity is a bit worse than the iPad. It offers most multi-functionality from among the other choices.

- Then there is the Intuous 5 pro, from 2017. It costs about half of what I talked about. It has the best stylus and best pressure sensitivity. It has no screen, and requires external hardware (virtually increasing its cost by adding the hardware you're using). Eventually, it is not as mobile as the iPad or the Surface. Has least additive functionality, but is a very mid-high end device for professional work.

___

These are for the most part very different devices, but they share a common usage for me, which is digital art. The cost is kind of a big deal, but at the same time, I want to get most out of my investment. I have a plan to upgrade my PC in a couple of years, and eventually get a something like a Cintiq, or an improved version of microsoft surface studio. But that will be in 3-5 years at most. I am at the moment leaning towards the Intuos, but after some thought, I have been leaning towards all of them. (That's why I am asking here, and vil maybe ask/

I have used an Intuos 5 (M) from 2013 until these days. It has been worn out and I am after something new. 

I live in Scandinavia, so other types of devices like Huion are not available for me here.

Married with one child.
Before i begin i beg you to excuse my English as it is not my mother language. 
Ill try to make it short, my mother died like 5 years ago from breast cancer (her father and mother died shortly before that) , she was at that time still married to my father but they were separated since i was 10 or so (they didn't divorce because of lack of money is my guess since my mother had a man.) since than i had recieved several times money from property that my mother owned and me and her brother sold. At that point even though my father on papers still owned half of my share he did give it to me as it is right to do so. After some years passed i knew i have 1/6 from the apartment from her brother. But i didnt have any intention of going after it at least not for now. 3 months ago i recieve a call from my first cousin and he tell me that my father is suing them for 1/12 basically half of 1/6 behind my fucking back. As i live in another country than my father and cousin i could not go there and confront him, and still cant because of financial problems. I told him in the phone that i would not talk to him nor he will see his grandson just because he dissrespects my dead mother this ugly way. I had intentions of beating the shit out of him when i manage to get there... But i dont know anymore i dont know how to handle it... 2 months ago it started haunting me like literally all i could have thought about was that ans i couldnt get it off my mind what kind of scumbag would do that... Now my brother went on vacation there and i told him before he went that if he goes and acts friendly to him i wouldn't accept that as it is unacceptable. Well i saw  pictures where they arw fishing together. I wrote him that when he returns he is not to contact my anymore and that hw should ask for his money (i owed him like 1500 euros) from our beloved scumbag father... I really don't know how to tackle this shit... My son is 16 months old and we are not living with much money anyway... I even send my best friend to try talk him out of it, hes feedback was -""he doesnt give a fuck pretty much"" ""he told me you would forget and forgive""... Now i really dont know what to do... I cant get it out of my head and it ruins my life sort of.. Any advice would be appreciated to what should i do with both of them... Its fucked up situation i dont know as a father what kind of father you must be to betray and backstab your own son that way so he can keep smoking cigarettes and drink Alkohol and play on a computer 24/7......

146,"I'm going to try to summarise this, feel free to ask for details.
My parents and my wife haven't gotten along for a long time. My parents want to be included in a lot of our decisions, and usually cause a huge argument between my siblings and I whenever they aren't. One of my brothers and his wife are able to tell us about all the nasty things that they say about my wife and I, mostly my wife (like being called a bitch for being a little more silent than usual to compensate for her ""talking over everyone""). Some things were said in the past that my wife cannot easily forgive (like letting the post-partum depression set in and ""whatever happens, happens""), but the way my family has always dealt with that is to just forget it ever even happened, while my wife grew up where you acknowledge that they've done wrong and apologise. My parents never acknowledge that they're wrong or say hurtful things. We recently stopped bringing our daughter over to their house or inviting them over because of all this, this of course hurt them and they tell me how it hurts. Although my wife reassures me, I can't help but feel like I've ruined my relationship, they're still my parents and I miss them and I want them in my life, but I want to do what's right for my daughter. I suggest that we have a sit-down with them and discuss what's bothering us and see if we can figure something out, but my wife refuses to talk to them.
Other things that my parents have done:
Blame my wife for me not finishing college. It was my decision, I hated it.
After being given a chance to try and bring my grades up to passing, we went out for me to take a break, and slept over at her parents' to clear our heads. They came screaming, banging on the door threatening to have our stuff on the lawn.
Always making snide remarks about decisions they weren't involved in, mostly because they had other plans that would have also benefited them.
We fed our daughter avocado, according to a few parenting resources, its a good, safe food to start on. They said we're going to kill her and wake up to a dead baby one day.
A lot of these examples, I really had to rack my brain to try and remember and my wife did help jog my memory, probably due to the ""forget and forget"" way we've always done things.

We are going to talk to a couple's therapist about this, but I just need either reassurance or advice. If you need more details, just ask.",12Sep2017,1
147,"I'm not sure where to start here. Probably some TMI coming up but I think this needs context. I've been struggling with depression and porn addiction for a while now and the porn had been a big issue with my fiance and I since last year. I was using it way too much and it was hurting her so I told her I would stop. I couldn't and lied about it. She found out and we had a big fight. I went cold turkey for a while and it was ok and we agreed it was ok for me to do it sparingly as long as I didn't lie about how much/what kind I was looking at (she was upset about the kind of porn i was watching too but I won't get into details). I was ok for a bit but after a while I spiraled back right where I was before and tried to hide it from her. She found my history yesterday. She gave my ring to her friend, asked me to find somewhere to stay for a few days and said she needs to think if I'm the kind of person she wants to be with. I don't know yet but I think I've really fucked it up this time. I haven't been able to talk to her in person so I don't know what's going to happen yet, but that's where I'm at today. 

I have contacted a counsellor and a sex addiction group in my area to get this under control but the main problem is that she can't trust me anymore. Nothing I say will have any meaning to her because she'll never know if what I say is true or not. I haven't lied about anything else in our relationship outside of the porn usage, i have never cheated on her and would never cheat on her, and have been open book about every other aspect of my/our life but that could be a lie too as far as she is concerned.

[Now one of my friends have said(at a different date) they dont want to hang out with my gf, they want it to be 'the bros'. Likewise Ive told them to let me know in advance so we can chill more accordingly. I wasnt going to leave my girlfriend home because i was chilling with her first.] 

We get there we have a few drinks but no real convos goin on. My friends and i were sitting in the back the entire time. While i talk to one friend, my girlfriend chimes in on another convo my friends are having about 'relationships'. Friend #1 is talking about his new relationship and Friend #2 is giving him unsolicited advice about HIS version of relationships. He cheats(hes also trying to have a baby with this woman). My girlfriend hears all of this and wants friend #1 to know that that isnt the best idea. She shares her opinion to Friend #1 just like #2 did. When my girlfriend uses the word 'bitch' shes trying to use it the same way #2 is, but he takes that to mean that she is calling HIS girlfriend a bitch. So far Friend #3 and I have nothing to do with this.

So she leaves tho convo because she can tell there is no gettin through to him, and while shes gone says, 'if she had called my girl a bitch one more time I would've slapped her.' Then i get mad. I say, 'hey she might not have meant it the way you took it' and all three of my friends 'nah man we heard her she called his girl a bitch'. I feel torn.

171,"TL;DR - I wanted to prove to myself and to the world that this alpha/beta capitalist popularity contest game wasn't the only way to live and I am having a hard time thriving because of it. Can it be done or is pop culture too strong to fight against?

20 years ago I was an attractive but not athletic guy. I was fit, but I wasn't muscle building fit. I was also a very silly and fun minded guy, not a stoic and hardened through trauma guy. Because I didn't fit the norms, I was invisible to everyone at my school. I had great morals, great manners, and my heart was in the right place, but no one found me interesting because the dominant culture was all about the captain of the football team and the homecoming king (if they weren't the same person). Fast forward to now and these guys can throw a mean party but they are construction losers who make less than me.

I am 35 now and I have a 15 year old son. Yay, round two in the same city!!! He is attractive and is a skinny guy (I had more muscle tone than him) and he is a silly guy who has a good heart but just like me 20 years ago, he is invisible to his peers. WTF!!! I thought the SJW and feminist movements would have fixed this problem, but it didn't. And don't give me b.s. about it beinf the natural order of life because that's not our nature. Our nature is to make sure we all survive, not compete for resources. Resources aren't scarce, there are 1300 people at his school and 3/5 are girls. The main issue is that girls want older men not men their age. They also want a guy who makes them fight to attract him. A guy who proves alpha dominance like in the movies and the books they read... Which again, is not real, it is man made to force people to become soldiers to defend their religion or government or business and then die in the name of war or protecting some rich guys assets...

Lately though I've been feeling like a failure. My war an alpha culture hasn't been fruitful for my son. When he acts passionately and boldly and threatening or violent (all alpha traits) they reward him with attention, but when he acts calmly and gentlely and certain of himself but not violent (all beta traits) people ignore him. I feel like I failed him...

I guess the piece of advice I need is this: should I carry on and fight dom/sub culture but in a different way that you suggest to me, or should I give up and accept that whether it is nature or nurture it doesnt matter because the system is in place and no one is going to take the risk to go against what they were programmed to do because it has resistance and force my son and myself to conform?

I hate competiting for resources. It does not give my life purpose or meaning. It makes me hate my competition and hate the system that is stuck in Julius Caesar ways of running a civilization. We have moved beyond this, I don't know why this is still a thing....",12Sep2017,0

Any tips?",12Sep2017,1

So my options are tell her asap, tell her on Friday, or tell her when she gets back. I really want to quit as soon as possible but I'm not sure if telling her on the day she comes back ok. What are your thoughts?",12Sep2017,7

181,"I met a guy via a popular dating app. We talked lots and have the same interests and views. Only times I met him were booty calls when we were both drunk. But we continued to text each other a lot. I started noticing him being more distant and leaving me on read a lot so I called him out on it and his responses were basically: ""oh haha sorry didn't realise"" or ""didn't know i'm supposed to answer you straight away everytime you write to me"". I felt like the conversations were always on me, I had to make sure they didn't die out etc.
However the last time I met him it was him who wanted to meet me (drunk in the middle of the night). He wrote to me first asking if I wanted to come to him, which I did. So I took an uber to him and when I got there he just wanted to sleep and in the morning he basically kicked me out saying that he needed to get a train. This hurt my feelings incredibly cause I had just spent a lot of money on the uber to him only to sleep next to him in bed and then go home early in the morning so I wrote to him the next day saying that I thought it was shitty what he did. He never replied to that text. A month later I saw him at a bar but didn't really speak to him (only said Hi) as I was with friends. When the bar closed my friends were leaving and I went over to him. He was very distant and I told him that I didn't know how to get home and that I didn't have enough money for an uber home (and that I didn't want to take a bus home alone in the middle of the night in one of the biggest cities in the world lol) and it was really obvious he didn't care and didn't want me to come with him home. 

I still really like him even though I probably shouldn't as he hasn't really been nice to me. He is always looking at my instagram stories and is constantly at the tops of the viewers which means that he is my ""biggest fan"" which makes me think that he might still like or think of me? I'm contemplating if I should write to him and just ask how he's been but I don't want to seem clingy... But I haven't had any contact with him for two months now and he's still constantly on my mind and he's obviously still looking at my instagram..",12Sep2017,2
184,"I am a 21 year old Canadian and am in my third year of university. I have jumped around from justice, chemistry, geology, and sociology, and therefore am still only taking first and second year classes. I don't really know what I would want to get out of university. The fall semester just started.

I feel like I am going nowhere with uni. I have been thinking of dropping out and taking a primary care paramedic course that starts in the winter. It's a one year course.

I feel like I want a job on my feet where I can use technical and intellectual skills, help others, feel rewarded, and be proud of what I do. I know this is not easy or the best paying job.

If I choose this I would immediately drop out of the semester and work until winter and the program starts. Does anyone think this is a good or bad idea?

I eventually would like to get work abroad, I speak English and basic Spanish. Perhaps I could get a job in Europe, New Zealand, or South America. Or even find work in big Canadian cities. How much of an opportunity is there? My hobbies include hiking and climbing, so maybe I could find work as a remote EMS or search and rescue or something of the sort.

Any input is appreciated. I'm just trying to make my mind up before it is too late, as I feel like I'm growing old and not getting anywhere with my life. Thanks everyone. ",12Sep2017,2
185,"Hi, thank you for reading in advance. This has been bothering me for the past 5 years or so, since I came to the age of reason. Having trouble getting this out (I've always felt I am invalid and I should put up with things), but I think it's the best decision I've made for myself in my life.

A little background information, I've been living in an oppressive place for a good 18 years. My lifestyle has been stifling to a large extent, burdened with excessive schoolwork: school on weekends and holidays (yes, I live in Asia).  My father and I exchange barely 5 words per week. It's a rancid atmosphere: he cracks rape jokes and forces ideas on people. He used to be hellishly discouraging when I was a child. Raised me to think I wasn't smart enough, which I still have trouble fighting despite various tests and real-life situations. Tension within the family is at an all-time high. I go to school, then get home to shouting in a language I can't comprehend. Contemplated suicide for a long time in this pressure cooker. 

I mean I'm alive still. I get to learn and read. I get by, have friends, very lovely and supportive, but there's nowhere to be alone to think for myself and find myself. Everywhere I go it bores the hell out of me. It feels like quicksand. I live in a city-island sort of place, so there is no breaking away. (Imagine a slew of tired people, like bacteria in a petri-dish. There is no countryside in the edges of the city.) 

So I'm the kind of person who reads about things but has never experienced them. I'd like to experience them.  

I'm graduating high school end of this year, and have decided to book a plane ticket to Vancouver. I don't know. A fresh start. I want to find myself in a new place, see who I really am. I guess I am set on it. The ticket is affordable anyway: $900 and I currently have about $3500 in my bank. 

I have plans to get a bachelor's in Science and learn entrepreneurship. I'm 18, 5 feet 2 girl, don't command any attention at all and need to work on myself desperately by throwing myself into the deep end. Very pent-up and frustrated.

Am I able to find a university education while trying to settle in the new place? How do I start at all, finding work, starting a business, travelling, finding a place to stay? Anyone living in Vancouver/ Canada, any tips? Anyone who has done this before, any regrets or advice? Any advice at all is appreciated. 

TLDR: depressed. Getting out of my country, have never experienced living alone in a new place (Canada) and would appreciate advice for settling down. I would have finished high school by then. ",12Sep2017,1

187,"My whole life premise has been based on the Hippie movement that my parents participated in and then used as my upbringing to face the world - Peace, Love, Happiness. The influence to be non-violent, non-aggressive, non-hateful, non-argumentative, and non-competitive was in everything we did. From movies, to shows, to music, and even the games my parents bought me or let me rent. It was based on the ideal that ALL people could live in peace, love, and harmony....

But is that even real life?

Did my parents raise me on an ideal that had no future? Did I then in turn raise my kids with an ideal that was long dead?

Is the secret to American life all along war, hate, and destruction? Is that what decides if you are a good person? Your ability to start a hate war, fight it to destruction, and survive to impress everyone? I see no honor in that. But I dont see the Hippie movement succeeding so is this what we have become?

193,"Hey all, 

So I live with 2 roommates currently, let's call them Jon and Mike. Mike is cool and we get along great and while Jon is OK and all I wouldn't be his friend or acquaintance in any other situation except that we have to live together. 

We live in a GREAT place. 4000+ sq ft in a great location and for the price it's a steal compared to similar places. So naturally I don't want to leave or move out... but.... 

Jon is basically [Pig-Pen](https://imgur.com/a/19Xrg). (link for those who may not be familiar with the reference)

He is probably the dirtiest person I've ever lived with. He literally leaves a trail of grossness on everything he touches. We've had the talks and he does try to be clean every once in a while but it just exceeds him. He does absolutely no cleaning around the house. On top of that he works from home so he's ALWAYS home, which blows. 

Anyways, Mike finally got fed up and he's moving out next month. We talked about it and he's bummed to leave cuz the place is so great and all and the location but he just can't take it anymore. Fair enough. 

Which leaves me to my dilemma, but first a little backstory:

Jon has been living here the longest. Mike moved in after Jon's ex roommate left mid-lease and I moved in when the other guy bailed too. So Jon has an thing of ""this is my place"" and It doesn't look like he's planning on going anywhere soon. Jon also has a girlfriend who is over EVERY SINGLE DAY. And worse, she's as dirty as he is. 

So after Mike decided he's leaving Jon said his GF was gonna move in with us, which I wasn't thrilled about but whatever. Turns out now she's not going to move in, but he doesn't wan't to live with anybody else because ""he doesn't want to deal with another person"" so he's ""gonna leave my rent the same"" but wants me to put Mike's utilities under my name cuz ""he can't cuz he can't have more stuff in his name"".

So, here comes the juice, and the reason what I'm seeking advice. I travel A LOT for work and I'm out traveling about 14 days out of the month. So half of the month I'm not even home. Because Jon works from home, utilities are HIGH AF. We've had talks and he's been cutting down on AC use and all, but still, waaayyy too high for what we should be paying.

I don't know if I should just move out, or try to get him to leave, or talk to the landlord and see if he kicks him out, or what. I don't know 

1: I'm tired of Jon treating this place like it's his and feeling that he makes all the decisions regarding the house. Like who moves in and all. It's to a point where he wants US to PAY HIM and then he goes to the landlord and delivers the money. 

Our landlord is a shot in the dark, he's great and all but a total hippie, and I haven't decided the best move to go ahead and talk to him or what I can expect to gain from going to the landlord.

2: Jon said he would cover Mike's part because I don't want to pay more rent. I would rather have a third roommate and have everything be more equal than share this place only with Jon. But I'm done paying for such high utilities if I'm never home, AND I'm certainly not OK with splitting utilities between the 2 of us. It's not what I signed up for.

3: I don't want to move out because the place is great and SO convenient for me, but Jon is just such a sleaze bag. 

4: Basically I don't know what's the best way to work all this out. Utilities are incredibly high, his GF is over every day to the point where it's really annoying and he/they haven't cleaned anything a single time in the last 9 months I've been living here. 

5: I feel it's unfair that people like Mike and I are in a way forced to move out when we're the ones that clean, contribute, and overall take care of the place. I should mention that I'm subleasing, so my name isn't on the lease. But why can't we kick Jon out? Can landlords do this? Should I?

Anyways, thank you all for reading and any ideas or question or comments are welcomed!! 

tl;dr Basically roommate is a sleaze bag and I dunno if to try to kick him out or if I should leave.

199,"So about a year ago in freshman year of high-school I started a business called Valu. I started it with 1 of my friends called R, and we were serious about making shirts to sell to people. Well R decided to add another one of my friends called B. We started discussing the ordering process and how to get and sell the shirts. And stuff started to get heated because R and B decided to add another person called P even tho I told them not to. I told them that 4 people was way to many people for a small business and that we would never get anything done. We started arguing about paying tax and stuff like that, and I told them not to worry about it. Long story short R, B, and P kicked me out of MY company and added another kid called F. I kind of forgot about the company and I forgave all of them for it. But it turns out that R, P, and F quit because it was too hard and they weren’t going anywhere. It has been a year now and B has renamed the company to Civil Outfitters and he is actually making money. He has gotten a trademark and everything and he has all the equipment to make shirts himself and now the whole school knows about his company. I am kinda wanting back into the company. I have talked to him and he says that he is struggling with some things but he already has a plan for everything. I think that his company can get huge and I want to be apart of it again.

200,"Before I start. I do apologise for my previous post which was indeed politically incorrect. I was very angry at the time and understand how badly this reflects upon me. On Tuesday the 12th of September. I have decided to turn over a new leaf. 

I will be try and be as honest as I can here. So you can make informed choices regarding the information provided. I am 26 years old. For 8 months. I have/had been working for this charity retail store. 

(I have a mild form of Autism, called Aspergers Syndrome.) The manager seemed like a pleasant man, in February, I had an informal interview with him and he offered me a job. 

From February to April, my responsibilities revolved solely around moving stuff from the stock room, to the rubbish bins, and tidying the stock room up, as it was severely untidy, in those 3 months, I removed 50% of the stuff, single handedly. 

Alas to later found out I had accidentally broke a few things, as the stock room was so cluttered, there were a few scrapes. The manager, the deputy manager, and the deputy managers husband, got upset, in which, I over heard a phone call from the female manager to her husband saying. ''The boss likes him, if it was up to me, I would have to let him go.’’

Continuing on from that. The accident was soon forgotten, they forgave me, but the boss, (male), was upset about the fact that I wasn't able to stick to a regular rota. And he felt the employees who work there just turned up when they liked. So I offered to help out every Thursdays, which he agreed to. He seemed pleased with the fixed rota. Even though it was one day a week. I was planning on building on that rota at a later stage.

I seemed to get on with the male boss, this one time at the bakery, I caught him moaning about the female who works there, she has learning difficulties. He insinuated that he felt she was tiresome. (This was to a female member of staff at the bakery, where he goes for lunch. The lady with learning difficulties was 52. She seemed like a nice lady, and harmless , she used to talk to me in depth about problems which surfaced during her week. Which I found endearing and engaging. I offered her emotional support for an hour every week, for 8 months. Even though it wasn’t in my job description. I felt genuinely and empathetically unhappy that she was upset and anxious with life and the good person that I am. I tried to help her see the positives in her life and her situation. 

The male boss some times would ignore her on a few occasions. This one time she insinuated that the boss didn't trust me with her. Even though I hadn’t abused any trust. And was just trying to be friendly. 

This one time, during April, she was domestically assaulted by a male member of staff who used to work there, the same abuser was verbally abusive towards me, and I informed the boss straight away. The male abuser hit her, and as a result, he was let go, banned from the store, and was also arrested for assault and battery. Aggravated Bodily Harm, and Disorderly Conduct. I think, however, as I wasn’t the person reading him his rights. I can only make an intelligent assumption on the basis of the situation that happened during my stay at the charity store. 

This gentleman was sent to court. He seemed to have learning difficulties and mental health issues. He had a mental health crisis after he assaulted her, I presume out of guilt and frustration, and he was sectioned under the mental health act and was spending time in a psychiatric facility in the local city hospitals Psychiatric Unit. I have some degree of empathy towards this mental health crisis, and understand the challenges of mental health. Even though I don’t condone him hitting her. I did feel it may of been a manifestation of a detonating mental health issue. He also had a drinking problem, and at one stage, went into the work place under the influence, this was when he verbally assaulted me. 

The female in question, in which has learning difficulties, told me she had a strict support worker, the male abuser hit her in the stomach and in the chest. 

I enjoyed working at this shop, some of the customers were inconsiderate and could of shown more support and decorum, however, I enjoyed the rapport with the customers and liked talking to the staff employed there. The male boss didn't mind my accidents and during the first stages of months articulated how hardworking I was. He was friendly, amiable and approachable. But over the last couple of weeks, which is late August, early September, he seemed to be under a lot of stress.

He used, (the male boss) to bring his male son along, the male son was approximately 9. The male son, sat behind the desk. The boss's wife used to come in, and the assistant manager female used to frequently bring her children into the facility. I didn't say anything at the time, but I did find it slightly unprofessional they did this. 

Yesterday, which was Monday the 11th of September 2017. I went in at 11am, and there were some bags. I presume for delivery to be sent to a skip to be recycled. I mistakingly thought they were there to be sorted out into bags to be ironed, sold, and scrapped. I wasn't being flippant and was being quite conscientious. Or at least, trying to show some initiative. 

The male boss, walks up the stairs, starts whistling, and says ''How are we getting on in here then?'' He walks over to where the bags are and notices I have made a mess of them. He said. ''You have got to be joking, these were for collection, you have made a mess of this, you are not allowed to work up here anymore. I am just going to have you working downstairs mate.'' 

I finally went down and apologised to him sincerely. He said. ''Unfortunately, I am going to have to let you go and not have you in, I can't afford to be doing this. We need to sort something out with you.'' I asked him for clarification several times if he wanted me to go. Finally he decisively said he wanted me to go. I said. ''I will get my stuff then.'' He said. ''Fine, that is probably for the best.'' He also in this conversation mentioned how I just walk in ‘’willy nilly and mess the place up’’, his words, not mine, and he took umbrage towards myself. 

I walked upstairs, went out briskly. I didn't want to argue, as he had called assistant manager in to sort out the mess I had done. I went up to the pharmacy, and bought a toothbrush that is supposed to whiten your teeth, it has magic bristles or something like that, not literally magic, but it has whitening hair lines on the brush, that give your teeth polish and shine. I walked down the road. To go to the library, as I am revising for my practical driving test. I wanted to print some information off. I asked my Dad to ring the boss on my behalf. My Dad rang up twice, and the boss told my Dad he didn't want me. The boss then said he had an ‘’autistic brother’’, and that he sympathised with my condition.

I printed my stuff up at the library, me and my Dad had a disagreement on the phone whilst I was printing my papers off. Because I wanted my Dad to ring up a third time, unfortunately. He didn't want to do it. I tried to persuade him. He got annoyed with me. Whilst I was on the phone. I got accosted by a man who wanted to take the computer I was on, even though the computer was still ‘’locked’’. I said ‘’no’’ to him, and asked him not to use it. He told me he felt I was acting in a way which wasn’t civilised or to his level/standards of decorum. 

I went home. I rang my mother up to ask if she wanted to have a word with this boss, unfortunately she didn't, and she gave me her opinion on the matter, which is a shame because I wanted to see her that night. I made several calls, but overall I am upset by the incident that occurred.

It wasn’t my intention to behave in a way which was unacceptable, and I was working there for a good cause and with good intentions. As it was a charity store. Now I have to declare on my CV, I no longer work there, even though it was coming up to 1 year, and I had been working there for 8 months. I felt the boss took leverage of my good will, witnessed all the hard work I performed, and let me go.

I phoned him up later, after texting him. I tried to reason with him and he put on a false voice which I presume was his attempt to remain professional under stressful circumstances. He told me he was short staffed. That's the reason, that nobody could supervise me, and the reason nobody could supervise me, meant that he can’t trust me on my own. 

I told him the reason he was short staffed was because nobody seemed to like him.  (After making this comment, obviously, I appreciate it’s not politically correct to say these things to people. I just wanted to try to help him realise how even though the situation developed, the reason not many people work there, is because of his levels of flexibilities with certain roles and his professional judgement upon what is deemed acceptable and unacceptable. I was trying to point out occupational and tangible circumstances relating to the job in hand. ) He requested me to clarify the situation, and I said. ''Well, nobody likes you do they.'' He then retorted that he recorded that and he was going to send it to head office. I told him I didn't mind who he sent it to. Even though recording people without their permission is illegal under data protection act laws and is an invasion of privacy, not to mention that it’s also unprofessional of him to do so. Me describing to him an occupational hazard is not an admission of guilt on my part, merely an observation and a statement of interest. That he knowingly or unknowingly took umbrage to.

I am  upset. If I thought those bags were to remain on the floor and not to be moved. I wouldn't of touched them. He strikes me as a not very reasonable person, but unfortunately, it may not be my place to say that, because I don’t know him all that well, but I felt he wasn’t being very reasonable.  As far a I am aware, that place is dramatic. I have left the place, and we mutually have gone several different ways. 

I am upset. I don’t have a lot of sympathy for him. I don't try to hide behind my Aspergers Syndrome and on multiple occasions I have stated that I want to be like everyone else which means taking responsibility and not hiding behind a label. 

I am onto another stage of my career, but I was just wandering what is anyone's advice? I did phone up a consumer related job helpline that stated I can appeal the decision, in writing and ask him to reconsider, but as it's voluntary work, he has little to no obligation, and also because I haven't been working there for over 2 years, I have no rights when it comes to dismissal. However unfair or fair the dismissal was, would be subjective and under scrutiny I am sure, over the coming months. I enjoyed working there and have informed head office about this. This work placement, is upsetting.

201,"Ok, so it is wedding season, and I am so over weddings at this point.  I personally have never dreamed of a wedding, and do not understand the whole ""lets go into debt over 1 day of our life"" craze. But thats what some people want, so whatever.

One of my good friends is getting married this winter, she is 21yo, I am also standing up in the wedding. I personally think thats a young age, especially since her and her fiance dont make a lot of money, but its what they want, and thats not the point but is important to know. 

The point is that for the last year and a half, I have heard nothing except her complain about how expensive her wedding is turning out to be. Every time I would make a slight suggestion in terms of saving money or cutting costs, she would get upset and state that this is what shes dreamed of, and she will get what she wants, and she is only the bride once. Ok. Fine. So I know she won't take any advice on saving money. So I have tried being supportive and saying things like  ""it will all be worth it,"" and ""your wedding is going to be so beautiful"", you know, things she wants to hear.


So on top of her complaining about the cost, for the past year, she would vent to me about how annoyed she gets when one of her 12 other bridesmaids (sorority sisters) does something or buys something expensive. One went to California on a trip, the other moved in with her boyfriend, another bought a car etc... She would come to me and get uspet and say ""Don't they know how expensive it is to be in a wedding?! I am putting so much money into my wedding, they shouldn't be spending money when they have to save for my wedding! How are they going to pay for their dress, presents..etc?""
I was surprised, and said peoples lives don't have to stop for her wedding. And then she proceeded to get upset about that, claiming that they accepted the responsiblity of being in her bridal party, and they should know better. Like OK?

To add to this, our bridesmaid dresses cost $350, plus alterations. She wanted her bachelorette party in Las Vegas, which none of it she should pay for, so we would all split her cost of tickets and hotel (which I guess is common), but it is becoming very expensive to be in her wedding. Which she doesnt see as a problem, again because we ""accepted the responsiblity of being in her bridal party.""

Again, we are young, and none of us have quite established careers yet, and some of us bridesmaids are still in school. So a lot of us have stretched really far to do all of this for her. 

The whole point it is that we all combined are paying an insane amount to be in her wedding  over $1,000 each bridesmaid, and she hasnt done anything to help lessen the costs to us (like maybe not $350 dresses?), and then has the nerve to CONSTANTLY complain about how NONE of us know how much work, effort and money she is putting into the wedding. The wedding isnt for us, we dont care. We know weddings are expensive. But we arent going into debt over it.

I truly do not understand how the cost of the wedding is any ones problem, except her own. I know she is under a lot of pressure, and is very stressed to create a perfect day. But nobody is forcing her to have an expensive wedding, her family didnt force her, it wasnt expected. It is all her choice, and I am so tired of hearing about how nobody is realizing how much money she is spending and  how much debt she is in over it. 

So the advice I need here, is 1) Am I over-reacting to all of this (I have planned every detail of her bachelorette party with no help from other bridesmaids) because maybe I am stressed too? and 2) How do I tell her that nobody needs to know her financial state due to the wedding?

I always thought people are supposed to keep that private.

202,"I'm in shock. I shouldn't be, but I am. 

My dog was 18 years old. He was slow to get around, and a little lethargic, but not at a point that we thought his quality of life was low. 

My parents have been taking care of him for several years now, since life gets really busy for a teenager (and even more busy once you get into your twenties, as I am). They moved to Missouri with him and I stayed back in Oklahoma and got married. 

About two weeks ago, we got word that my great-uncle has a tumour in his brain. The same kind Sen. John McCain has, apparently. So they decided to go see him for a week while they still can. In the meantime, they put my dog in a boarding shelter. They left yesterday morning.

This morning at 7 am I got a call from the shelter. They said that the dog was showing symptoms of a seizure and they needed my permission to take him to an animal hospital, to which I consented. A few hours later, I'm learning that he's still unconscious with slight tremors, but the doctors considered him stable. Then just about 10 minutes ago, I got a call saying that he stopped shaking, then breathing, then his heart stopped. He's gone. 

I feel broken. I don't want to do anything. I'm at work, and can't leave because we're so short staffed. But I also can't bring myself to actually do anything. I can't eat and I feel sick. 

The doctor said something after telling me he passed, but I don't remember any of it. I don't know how to keep moving today and I don't know what to do about the dog. 

EDIT: Thanks for the advice and support guys. I ended up going home from work since I was so unproductive. I'm still not entirely sure what our plan is for him because my parents kind of want to see him before they cremate him. I do not want any part of that, it would just hurt way worse. But to wait a week like that they would have to (I guess?) cryo-freeze him or something. Which is a lot more money. I think for me, I'm just going to have to find a way to fully comprehend that he's gone and mourn him without going up there. Thanks again guys. ",12Sep2017,6
203,"Before I start. I do apologise for my previous post which was indeed politically incorrect. I was very angry at the time and understand how badly this reflects upon me. On Tuesday the 12th of September. I have decided to turn over a new leaf. 

I will be try and be as honest as I can here. So you can make informed choices regarding the information provided. I am 26 years old. For 8 months. I have/had been working for this charity retail store. 

(I have a mild form of Autism, called Aspergers Syndrome.) The manager seemed like a pleasant man, in February, I had an informal interview with him and he offered me a job. 

From February to April, my responsibilities revolved solely around moving stuff from the stock room, to the rubbish bins, and tidying the stock room up, as it was severely untidy, in those 3 months, I removed 50% of the stuff, single handedly. 

Alas to later found out I had accidentally broke a few things, as the stock room was so cluttered, there were a few scrapes. The manager, the deputy manager, and the deputy managers husband, got upset, in which, I over heard a phone call from the female manager to her husband saying. ''The boss likes him, if it was up to me, I would have to let him go.’’

Continuing on from that. The accident was soon forgotten, they forgave me, but the boss, (male), was upset about the fact that I wasn't able to stick to a regular rota. And he felt the employees who work there just turned up when they liked. So I offered to help out every Thursdays, which he agreed to. He seemed pleased with the fixed rota. Even though it was one day a week. I was planning on building on that rota at a later stage.

I seemed to get on with the male boss, this one time at the bakery, I caught him moaning about the female who works there, she has learning difficulties. He insinuated that he felt she was tiresome. (This was to a female member of staff at the bakery, where he goes for lunch. The lady with learning difficulties was 52. She seemed like a nice lady, and harmless , she used to talk to me in depth about problems which surfaced during her week. Which I found endearing and engaging. I offered her emotional support for an hour every week, for 8 months. Even though it wasn’t in my job description. I felt genuinely and empathetically unhappy that she was upset and anxious with life and the good person that I am. I tried to help her see the positives in her life and her situation. 

The male boss some times would ignore her on a few occasions. This one time she insinuated that the boss didn't trust me with her. Even though I hadn’t abused any trust. And was just trying to be friendly. 

This one time, during April, she was domestically assaulted by a male member of staff who used to work there, the same abuser was verbally abusive towards me, and I informed the boss straight away. The male abuser hit her, and as a result, he was let go, banned from the store, and was also arrested for assault and battery. Aggravated Bodily Harm, and Disorderly Conduct. I think, however, as I wasn’t the person reading him his rights. I can only make an intelligent assumption on the basis of the situation that happened during my stay at the charity store. 

This gentleman was sent to court. He seemed to have learning difficulties and mental health issues. He had a mental health crisis after he assaulted her, I presume out of guilt and frustration, and he was sectioned under the mental health act and was spending time in a psychiatric facility in the local city hospitals Psychiatric Unit. I have some degree of empathy towards this mental health crisis, and understand the challenges of mental health. Even though I don’t condone him hitting her. I did feel it may of been a manifestation of a detonating mental health issue. He also had a drinking problem, and at one stage, went into the work place under the influence, this was when he verbally assaulted me. 

The female in question, in which has learning difficulties, told me she had a strict support worker, the male abuser hit her in the stomach and in the chest. 

I enjoyed working at this shop, some of the customers were inconsiderate and could of shown more support and decorum, however, I enjoyed the rapport with the customers and liked talking to the staff employed there. The male boss didn't mind my accidents and during the first stages of months articulated how hardworking I was. He was friendly, amiable and approachable. But over the last couple of weeks, which is late August, early September, he seemed to be under a lot of stress.

He used, (the male boss) to bring his male son along, the male son was approximately 9. The male son, sat behind the desk. The boss's wife used to come in, and the assistant manager female used to frequently bring her children into the facility. I didn't say anything at the time, but I did find it slightly unprofessional they did this. 

Yesterday, which was Monday the 11th of September 2017. I went in at 11am, and there were some bags. I presume for delivery to be sent to a skip to be recycled. I mistakingly thought they were there to be sorted out into bags to be ironed, sold, and scrapped. I wasn't being flippant and was being quite conscientious. Or at least, trying to show some initiative. 

The male boss, walks up the stairs, starts whistling, and says ''How are we getting on in here then?'' He walks over to where the bags are and notices I have made a mess of them. He said. ''You have got to be joking, these were for collection, you have made a mess of this, you are not allowed to work up here anymore. I am just going to have you working downstairs mate.'' 

I finally went down and apologised to him sincerely. He said. ''Unfortunately, I am going to have to let you go and not have you in, I can't afford to be doing this. We need to sort something out with you.'' I asked him for clarification several times if he wanted me to go. Finally he decisively said he wanted me to go. I said. ''I will get my stuff then.'' He said. ''Fine, that is probably for the best.'' He also in this conversation mentioned how I just walk in ‘’willy nilly and mess the place up’’, his words, not mine, and he took umbrage towards myself. 

I walked upstairs, went out briskly. I didn't want to argue, as he had called assistant manager in to sort out the mess I had done. I went up to the pharmacy, and bought a toothbrush that is supposed to whiten your teeth, it has magic bristles or something like that, not literally magic, but it has whitening hair lines on the brush, that give your teeth polish and shine. I walked down the road. To go to the library, as I am revising for my practical driving test. I wanted to print some information off. I asked my Dad to ring the boss on my behalf. My Dad rang up twice, and the boss told my Dad he didn't want me. The boss then said he had an ‘’autistic brother’’, and that he sympathised with my condition.

I printed my stuff up at the library, me and my Dad had a disagreement on the phone whilst I was printing my papers off. Because I wanted my Dad to ring up a third time, unfortunately. He didn't want to do it. I tried to persuade him. He got annoyed with me. Whilst I was on the phone. I got accosted by a man who wanted to take the computer I was on, even though the computer was still ‘’locked’’. I said ‘’no’’ to him, and asked him not to use it. He told me he felt I was acting in a way which wasn’t civilised or to his level/standards of decorum. 

I went home. I rang my mother up to ask if she wanted to have a word with this boss, unfortunately she didn't, and she gave me her opinion on the matter, which is a shame because I wanted to see her that night. I made several calls, but overall I am upset by the incident that occurred.

It wasn’t my intention to behave in a way which was unacceptable, and I was working there for a good cause and with good intentions. As it was a charity store. Now I have to declare on my CV, I no longer work there, even though it was coming up to 1 year, and I had been working there for 8 months. I felt the boss took leverage of my good will, witnessed all the hard work I performed, and let me go.

I phoned him up later, after texting him. I tried to reason with him and he put on a false voice which I presume was his attempt to remain professional under stressful circumstances. He told me he was short staffed. That's the reason, that nobody could supervise me, and the reason nobody could supervise me, meant that he can’t trust me on my own. 

I told him the reason he was short staffed was because nobody seemed to like him.  (After making this comment, obviously, I appreciate it’s not politically correct to say these things to people. I just wanted to try to help him realise how even though the situation developed, the reason not many people work there, is because of his levels of flexibilities with certain roles and his professional judgement upon what is deemed acceptable and unacceptable. I was trying to point out occupational and tangible circumstances relating to the job in hand. ) He requested me to clarify the situation, and I said. ''Well, nobody likes you do they.'' He then retorted that he recorded that and he was going to send it to head office. I told him I didn't mind who he sent it to. Even though recording people without their permission is illegal under data protection act laws and is an invasion of privacy, not to mention that it’s also unprofessional of him to do so. Me describing to him an occupational hazard is not an admission of guilt on my part, merely an observation and a statement of interest. That he knowingly or unknowingly took umbrage to.

I am  upset. If I thought those bags were to remain on the floor and not to be moved. I wouldn't of touched them. He strikes me as a not very reasonable person, but unfortunately, it may not be my place to say that, because I don’t know him all that well, but I felt he wasn’t being very reasonable.  As far a I am aware, that place is dramatic. I have left the place, and we mutually have gone several different ways. 

I am upset. I don’t have a lot of sympathy for him. I don't try to hide behind my Aspergers Syndrome and on multiple occasions I have stated that I want to be like everyone else which means taking responsibility and not hiding behind a label. 

I am onto another stage of my career, but I was just wandering what is anyone's advice? I did phone up a consumer related job helpline that stated I can appeal the decision, in writing and ask him to reconsider, but as it's voluntary work, he has little to no obligation, and also because I haven't been working there for over 2 years, I have no rights when it comes to dismissal. However unfair or fair the dismissal was, would be subjective and under scrutiny I am sure, over the coming months. I enjoyed working there and have informed head office about this. This work placement, is upsetting.

205,"So I""m in this weird situation that I've never been in...

Without going into details, a higher-up at work is essentially asking me to break the law so a job related task can be completed faster.

The higher up is being impatient with the process but if the government found out that I violated this particular regulation then the company and myself will be fined. The regulation is minor in the grand scheme of things but there's still a chance that I could be fined.

I'm not willing to take that risk because it could potentially affect my freelance business. However, the higher-ups don't care and want to write me up for insubordination. Their thought process is that they paid for me to take this certification test (this regulation falls within the skills I learned from this test) to add to my skill set so they think they basically own me.

What would you guys do in this situation? I hate being bullied like this.",12Sep2017,6
206,"Hey all. This might get long.

I've had this issue for a long time now. In most situations, I find that my automatic response is rarely what I actually want. To put it bluntly, I'm somewhere between actually being concerned about what other people think and being a pussy.

Recent examples of this include:

* I was asked to fill at a part-time job that I took to help out a few hours/week (on a regular schedule) for people I know. I said no, but it took a lot for me to do so, even though I spent the time at my main commission-based job and made rent money for the month during the shift.

* I rarely ask for any serious favors, even if they're completely reasonable and from close friends. I've been trying to organize going out with a group of buds in the city, and I've been hesitating asking a couple guys who live their because I don't want them to think they have to host us. Even if I suggest we airbnb it I know they'll insist on having us over for the night.

* I turn my music down at stoplights. Listening to music is probably my favorite hobby, and I like to jam, but I feel like it might bother some people (though idgaf when I'm moving for some reason, and I'm rarely listening so loudly that the surroundings shake.

I'm not this way about everything; I don't dress any particular way to please people, I don't make major life decisions based on what other people think/want unless I ask for advice, and I can dance at pretty much time, in my car, on a dance floor, or in the market, sober or otherwise.

**tl;dr** I'm not trying to become totally aloof or lose all self-awareness, but I need to start giving way less of a fuck. Usually I can sort of force it/fake it until I make it when trying to change something about myself, but I need some help on this one.",12Sep2017,1

The thing is, I can't bring myself to text him and/or see that stuff disappear. I don't get it. I am losing a hobby, but I have so many other hobbies I can/are doing. Why can't I just sell off the non-sentimental pens to a friend for a cheap buck? Why am I hoarding these things?

I have been wanting to get into strength training but I know I am super lazy and haven't bothered to get involved with a gym yet. Going to a gym seems like a drag after work. However if it is at work, then I could go before or after and just go home later. My issue is mentally I don't know if I will go. I have been making small changes to my diet and its been fine so far, so in theory I could apply that to my free time right? Instead of biking + games I could do weight lifting and games after? I usually work between 7:30-5:30 times, so I could be home by 7 If I went for a half hour to the gym. (1 hr travel time to work)

231,"i have spent my entire life alone, the people closest to me; family, friends, it never mattered, they did not know me. in all my life i have only shared the real me with one person, but now it is time to be open to the world. this is the tale of my life, i would like to introduce you to the real me.

My childhood was mostly a happy one, i had both my parents, three older siblings, and by the time i was seven i had two younger siblings. We were about as close as a family can be, there was the constant arguing and bickering expected from a large family, but we were happy.
When I was nine years old i discovered something strange about me. I liked girls clothes far more than boys. i liked the bright pinks and purples, i loved the frills, the lightness of the material, everything. by the time i had turned twelve i had determined that i didn’t want to ever wear men’s clothes, but there was more, i didn’t want to be a man. What was wrong with me? This wasn’t normal, i was born a man, and so i was to be a man.
I spent the next 14 years pushing down every girly impulse. i forced myself into becoming the manliest person i could. I broke myself. i couldn’t find happiness, not the way i was, so i stopped trying. i distracted my mind, never let myself think, my thoughts would always return to what i was. I could never tell anybody, my family never would have accepted me, or at least thats what i have told myself. I fought a lot during that time, whenever anybody even suggested in the slightest that i was girly i showed them i wasn’t. Nobody would ever suspect me of anything. of course all that actually did was make people think i was gay. I wasn’t, i may not have ever cared about anybody, but i was definitely only ever attracted to woman.
I never dated. If i couldn’t like me how could i ever expect anybody else to? i was closed off from everybody. i had a few “friends”, but they never really knew me, and so the friendships never lasted. it didn’t matter, i never cared, i never cared about anyone or anything, not the way one should.
I long feared that i might have been a sociopath. perhaps by pushing all feelings away for so long my body didn’t know how to feel. But then i met her.
I will not name her here, but any who know me know who i speak of. She was immedietely everything to me. She quickly grew to be my closest friend, but that wasn’t all. my feelings grew to something i never knew, something that i couldn’t identify, much less figure out what to do with. I loved her, and yet, i still couldn’t tell her who i was. I don’t know why, she would have accepted the real me in a second, hell, that may have actually helped. She turned me down time and time again, though we always remained friends.
I spent the last three years trying to improve myself, not for myself as it should have been, but for her. it never made a difference, she was my friend and would always be, but she had no feelings for me.
That is until she got drunk one night recently and told me she was beginning to have feelings for me. Sober her denied the existance of these feelings, and yet at that point i had already made up my mind. I told her the truth about me. i told her how i hid everything away for so long. I told her how i had always wanted to be a girl and how i never had a relationship. I told her i was a virgin, i told her the true reasons why; i never had any sexual urges, not until i met her.
She accepted me for who i was. she has helped me more than i could ever have imagined one could. she wants me to be open, and she helped me to realize what i really want now. I no longer think about becoming a girl, but my love for woman’s fashion, makeup, and everything else that i had in the past considered too girly to like or do, all of that is now back from behind the wall i put up in my head. 
She still has no feelings for me, and she has a new guy in her life. I am so happy for her, and yet the jealousy i feel just keeps building. He is exactly what i would have been if i didn’t hide myself away for so long. I know that i would like him too, but i can’t give him the chance. I still love her and always will, but how can i watch the one person that i have ever felt anything for be happy with the person i never could be.
None of that matters though, because now i don’t want to push the truth down. i dont want to hide who i am anymore, but i don’t know how to open up. what if my family cannot accept me, what if my friends cannot? how can i expect them to when i am not the person that they have known, or in many cases met? i am not at all the person that anybody has known over these years?

232,"So I've been starting to date this guy from work for about 2 weeks now and we click insanely well and everything is just so perfect, we understand each other. We talk all the time, have similar experiences, so many similar interests, and we seem crazy about each other. More than I've felt with any guy. 
But last night he asked me ""what's the thing that you didn't want to tell me last time about your ex?"" And I told him.... I told him how I was waiting for my divorce to be finalized. How at 19 my ex convinced me to marry him and now I'm getting a divorce. He says how I made him into a hypocrite, into the thing he hates. He said how I made him into a cheater and the other guy. I hurt him, and I can see that. I hurt him so badly and that kills me more than anything else. He asked why I didn't tell him and I said because it's my single handed regret in my life, I'm ashamed of it and I don't know how to say it out-loud. Which is true but he wasn't happy with that answer. Truthfully I also didn't tell him because it was supposed to be finalized by now, but it's not. Do I give him time and space? That's what I'm thinking. Do I keep sending at least a good morning message to show that I'm still trying? I don't know how to fix it or what to do. I'm waiting on it to be finalized and then the divorce is official. I should have told him sooner but I can't change that now.

My mom started a relationship with someone 3 years ago, since the beginning my relationship with my stepdad its been kinda difficult, sometimes we get along and some others we hate eachother; we moved in together the 3 of us, he is the one who pays for the mayority of the stuff in the house, so does my mom too, months ago i was working and i was able to help at home with some money, unfortunately im unemployed now and of course i cant help anymore, my stepdad (lets call him richard) has a job and my mom too, they dont really make too much money so we cant afford too many things, richard's sister bought us a car to make things easier but he is the only one who drives the car because its manual (stick) and we dont know how to drive like that and for some reason he doesnt want to teach us, so if me or my mom have to do something we either have to walk or take the bus which i think its completely unfair, he helps with cooking but always makes a mess and never cleans or mantains everything looking good in the house, menanwhile i clean every week... Now there is this situation, he is a housekeeper and works for the richest man in town, richard wrote a book and showed it to this man's wife, she liked it and its been trying to make something out of it but with their crazy and busy life style nothing has really happened after almost a year since this whole situation started, what is his excuse to not quit this job and look for a better one? ""This is my dream and it will only come true if i keep having this job""... So until only God knows when this will happen (or not) he will keep working for $9 an hour and complaining about not having enough money to pay stuff, also complaining about me not helping at the moment... Last night my mom said something that made him mad and he exploted, he told her he was tired of me not helping or ""doing anything"" (which is not true, ive been looking for a job) and he also told her that he will not stand for this any longer, so he basically told her he would leave some day... Of course i dont want my mom to go through that situation and be sad, but also if he leaves we woudnt be able to afford everything in the house... I really dont know what to do, this is so fucked up... Btw sorry about my english, i speak spanish. I would appreciate some advice",12Sep2017,3
234,"I'm just a silly and lost 23 year old girl that can't make life decisions. So as usual I decided to post here.

I'm currently in school working towards my paralegal diploma. My goal was to go to law school after.

I work full-time in a law firm as a Junior Paralegal and I will make decent (really decent) money being a full Paralegal when I graduate in a year and a half. I will graduate with no debt as well, since I'm putting myself through university by working.

Option 1 - Lawyer. I need my degree first. To switch from diploma to degree, I will need to re-do eight highschool courses to get my average up to 85%. Basically: approx 5-6 more years of school, student debt from full-time school, but I will be a lawyer.

Option 2 - Paralegal. Much MUCH easier. Basically: A year and a half more of school, no student debt, but not a lawyer.

I keep trying to be satisfied with being a paralegal, because it is so much easier, but I keep finding myself dissatisfied. What should I do? Also, I live on my own and I'm an orphan (tear) so full-time school isn't an easy option, which makes schooling take twice as long.

The first time I met her was at a wedding(Where she snapchatted her shoes during the ceremony), and she would glare at me whenever my boyfriend wasn't looking. Her boyfriend at the time noticed it and I saw him look from her to me a few times. When I brought it up to my boyfriend he said that she was just protective because he had dated some not good people in the past. Well the next time we went to hang out with her she took a group picture, then tagged everyone else in the picture except me, got drunk and pulled my boyfriend away from me a few times, and when he went to the bathroom her current boyfriend also left the group but she only asked where my boyfriend was. But when I bring it up to my boyfriend he says that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. 
Despite not liking her I get that its his friend and that we are going to see her from time to time. However when we go down to visit her and a couple friend of his this weekend he said we will be staying at her house. I am 100% against this and when I said I wasn't staying there he said I could stay home. Am I blowing this out of proportion? It seems inappropriate to me.",12Sep2017,1

29/m here, college graduate -- post divorce moved back to my hometown and in with the folks to get a full reset on life/help them out with some things. now that I'm gainfully employed, and the stuff they needed me for is complete, I'm looking to get my own place. My question for you is, should I rent another apartment or look at buying a house? 

Happy to provide more details if this gets some comments, but i don't know what's relevant to include as of yet.

Pros:
-my whole family and friends are in this area, so it's where I'm looking to be long term

-my grandma is in banking and says ""home loan rates are super low right now and you'd be a first time buyer so i bet you could do well""

-would be nice to start to invest in something, despite not really needing the space a house provides yet (it's just me and the dog; kinda dating a girl but its WAY too early to be considering a live together situation)

Cons:
-idk shit about buying a house vs. renting an apartment i'm an expert at

-been with the folks about 5 months now, would like to get out sooner than later, and finding/buying a house I assume will take time.

239,"Hello, this is my first time using reddit, so I hope I'm not posting on the wrong board or breaking any rules. Anyways, on to the actual post.

I am (or was) a student at UCD (Colorado), and I've been out of school for several months now. I originally intended to study programming, but things did not go well. Because of that failure, I'm now forced to work at Walmart, and its been quite a horrible experience. I'm now at a point where I'm unsure what to do with my life. 

I was contemplating studying more artistic related courses, possibly somewhere along the lines of literature. Problem is, my family isn't very supportive of my decision. Ironically, my dad always keeps telling me that he just wants me to be happy, but he keeps trying to force me into electrical engineering like my older brother. Programming didn't go well the first time, so I don't see myself doing much better in engineering courses. To make a long story short, I want to do my own thing, but my family won't allow it.

242,"This'll probably end up being a long post, sorry but I actually do need some advice. I'll try to make it as short as possible.

I'm a senior in high school. I've never been a social butterfly or anything. I've always had my close circle of friends. On and off friends if I might add. Sometimes they just do things that make me want to have nothing to do with them, honestly. I'm an introvert, I'll admit. I usually won't speak unless spoken to, because 9 times out of 10, I have nothing to say or don't want to come off as more weird/awkward. And yeah, I've been like that all my life. I'm definitely not as shy/quiet as I used to be but I still feel like it's not enough.

In school, I just feel like I'm just there you know? Like this person is funny, this person is popular, that person looks good and then there's just me, being there. It's not like I'm ugly or have a bad personality or anything, that's for sure. People in school rarely go out of their way to talk to me, but I'll leave class a few minutes early to talk to them or break my back trying to do them a favor or be nice to them. And I'm honestly tired of it all. It all just hit me today out of nowhere and here I am typing this on Reddit.

I definitely do have a subconscious need to be liked and I hate that about myself. Again no one rarely ever goes out of their to speak to me first unless they need something or unless they just want to burn a few minutes until they find someone else better to talk to. And that really makes me feel like trash because it's like, Ok, am I not interesting enough for you? I feel that way literally all of the time and it really sucks.

People always say keep your circle small and I agree to a certain extent, but that doesn't always guarantee success. Cuz once the people in your circle, are off talking and hanging out with other people where does that leave you? That happens all the time to me. I will literally walk around the same hall three times just to find someone to talk to. I realize that it makes me look desperate and weird but it's like I'd rather do that, and find someone to talk to rather than be somewhere by myself and be labeled as ""the kid no one talks to"". Sorry if that doesn't make sense. And other times, I'll ""fake"" text someone on my phone, just to seem like I'm occupied and not lonely. Or I'll make endless trips to the bathroom, so I won't have to be seen by myself in the halls. I know, it's sad.

Please believe me when I tell you that there are barely any decent people in my school. I just want someone there that can reciprocate how I treat them. I can't be putting all the effort in all the time, it sucks, it really does. And the rare instances, when I am having a good conversation with someone, it feels good! Like I smile and think about the conversation hours after it happened. And I guess I come off as awkward because I'm ""too serious"" or ""stiff"" and I stutter (probably because I'm glad, that I finally get to talk to someone.). I'll admit though, I do have problems putting emotion into my voice, mostly because I just don't like my voice and I never have, to be honest.

The friends I do have can really be useless a lot of the times. I can't depend on them for anything, I treat them better than they treat me, they're hypocrites and yeah. Like sometimes I wanna cut some of them off, but then that'll just add to my loneliness. So now, I'm keeping around bad company just for the sake of not wanting to look like some antisocial outcast. 

I just feel like no one cares about me, at school that is. Like some of my friends will say I'm special to them or that they love me, but they don't even treat me like it. They can look right in my eyes or sit right down next to me and not speak at all because they expect me to speak first. I guess it's a pride thing but still, it really sucks, how there are no decent people in my school.

I know most of you guys are thinking, ""just make friends outside of school"" or ""worry about yourself"" but it's really easier said than done. Like even at my job, I'm from a different county, so I'm surrounded by people I don't even know. It's hard to talk to them because they all literally go to the same school or community college, when I'm from a whole different county. The minute I tell them what school I go to, they're like ""...um okay"" and go about their business. I swear I caught a few of them laughing at me, for just standing around, not talking. 

This post is already way too long but I'm just tired of feeling this way. Always super, super self-conscious about my appearance, or always trying to impress or go out of my way for others. It's been this way and I've felt this way for years, and I've honestly had enough. 

I feel like I have so much more to say, but nothing is coming to mind at the moment. But if someone could please, take the time to genuinely read what I've typed and help me out, I'd appreciate that more than you could imagine. Thank you.

243,"So I am now in high school and there are a lot of new people. At my school there are 2 lunches because there are a lot of people and I have a few friends that are not in the same lunch as me but most friends are. So every time I'm at lunch I sit with my friends and they also sit with someone that I don't really know OR that is ""cooler"" then me. Here's the thing about me, I am shy but when I'm with my friends I talk. But the thing is if you add one more person to that group that is ""cooler"" then me, then I talk way less and get nervous to talk. Also I like to stick with a small pack, so 2-4 people, but in my lunch theres like 6 people which doesn't really help. So literally everyday I sit at lunch and don't say a word, unless I'm sitting next to a close friend and I may say a few words here and there. And then I go home so bummed that I didn't talk with my friends, and fyi I don't hang out with my friends after school, I'm kind of a solo guy. But my friends hangout after school and so that means they are more comfortable around each other than me.

246,"Hey guys, I'm totally lost right now. 

My best friend (19m) and I (18f) were very close and almost dated (but he moved two hours away) and I know for a fact he has never had such a close best friend as I was. We have been friends for a little over a year and got close quick. Everything was going really good, and the last day before he left he admitted he was in love with me, and I could totally tell beforehand. 

Then, he moved the next day and things seemed odd, I know he was very emotional to leave and he can be very sensitive though. We were in contact constantly and talked everyday and then played video games. But it became less and less and he stopped talking as much. First of all let me say that no he hasn't met another girl, I'm pretty positive on this. 

He didn't really like his new work place but enjoyed his new home. He did mention that he kind of doesn't feel like talking to anyone or doing anything, and that he is unsure about everything. Including me. But still unsure about everything he was. Totally off character but I was there for him. During this time I stopped venting to him about my problems to give him less stress, but then he stopped replying to me and talking to me all together almost a month ago. He will read but not respond, and he opens my snapchats right away most of the time (never replies) and I know he doesn't really go on Snapchat because he has like 4 people on it. Don't know if that's relevant or not.

He won't really talk to anyone about it and when my mutual friends asked him he just didn't reply. Everyone who knows us both doesn't believe me when I say we aren't friends anymore, or that, it seems a waste because we had such a special relationship and everyone could see how much we cared for eachother. It's like he couldn't handle me anymore? But he won't give me anything and won't even delete me off social media? I'm just so confused, he's one of my favourite people I've ever met and I'm trying to get over him but I have nothing to go on or if he will ever come back, and no one really has any advice or thoughts towards it or why he is doing that. 

Question ultimately is, what happened? Why is he acting like this and throwing away someone who cares and who got along with him so well?

I just don't understand as much as I wish I did.

tl;dr : Best friend who had feelings for me moved away and stopped talking to me and won't give me a reason or anything to go on.",12Sep2017,1

Afterwards she started saying she was going to tell the staff or some shit that i ""Sexually hurt her"". I just ignored cause i knew nothing would happen. So then she started roasting me (i did not care) but then she said ""Just fucking kill yourself"". It didn't hurt me at first but then i was like ""wow, that was actually mean tf"" so now i'm thinking if i should tell someone and get her in trouble because i'm petty, or let it slide.

If i let it slide i know it will just make me mad/sad later on. If i snitch and she finds out her friends will probably beat my ass.

But she is an asshole, does nothing but play around and stop class. Honestly she should have been kicked out a long time ago. If i snitch (assuming she gets expelled or something) i'd probably be helping the whole school.

259,"Only one teacher at my high school teaches US History II Honors. There are 29 people in that class at the moment. When I made my schedule last year, I requested to be in the regular history class. Now I would like to be placed in the honors class because the regular one is way too easy, not challenging enough. *Just this morning, I sat in my history class doing work for ANOTHER class because the teacher let people do their homework today since they didn't submit it online LAST NIGHT WHEN IT WAS DUE.* **I was bored out of my freaking mind. Also, it would look terrible on my transcript! It would hurt my chances of being accepted at a semi-competitive university.** BUT my school said the class is too full, (*without specifying the student limit-a little weird??*). I took all honors classes last year. And the year before that. Except history because again, there was no space left! Last year, I finished history honors with an A and was recommended for the honors class. So of course, this year I will do amazing in that class. Recommended basically means ""yes, I, the teacher, give you the okay to be placed in honors once again."" 

Also, who the fuck decides who gets into that class or not? Like, if there can only be 20 people in a class, and 25 people were recommended for it, who decides which 5 are ""unworthy""? So it doesn't matter whether I had requested the regular class when I was creating my schedule last spring. 

**would it help if my mom called and talked to them? I think I should plead my case with them first. I cannot get stuck in a class with stupid people all year AGAIN.** 

Maybe I should also argue that harder classes prepare me more for college.

264,"Hi guys, I'm a senior college student studying exercise science, and my preferred career track would mean I need a masters degree.  I'd be getting an MS in Kinesiology or some equivalent (the schools I'm looking at right now are all kinese, but some schools have different names for similar degrees).  If I wanted to go to grad school next year then I would really need to get moving on the GRE.  Most of the applications I've looked at want your app in my January or February but one is in December, and I've seen recs to take the GRE at least 6 weeks before the app is due.  I was really good at standardized testing in high school with little preparation, but obviously I would have to start studying for the test now if I wanted to go next year.

My question is less about my field of study and more about the merits of taking a year or two to work before going for my masters.  My parents would help with some of the cost of living, but I would need a graduate assistantship or scholarship to help with tuition.  The programs I'm looking at are generally just two years, so it's not like I'd have to be ready to commit to an insane amount of schooling.  I know working first would help with finances but I'm worried about not having the motivation to go back to school after I've left for a while and whether or not grad schools prefer students straight out of college.

Right now I'm leaning towards working for 1 year and taking the GRE + applying during that time, but I was just curious about anyone else's experiences with this.  For anyone who's been to grad school (preferably not MBA because most people I know have that financed through work and/or work full time while they're going to school), did you go straight out of undergrad or did you work first?  If you worked, did you know you were going to go to grad school soon?  Any ideas on what universities here in the US prefer?  Am I basically too late for this cycle?

Similar things happen often, if he stops doing something that we'd together I usually stop too, it wouldn't be fun otherwise(at least this is what I think).  
Is this normal? I don't know what someone would think if they noticed that I'm not there when this guy isn't either or similar stuff.

267,"so my situation is like this.

I live in San Jose, California and work at a manufacturing plant. I work there as a Quality Assurance Technician. I have Alright health insurance, free dental, and great vision insurance. I also get stocks grants which vest at a rate of 25% a quarter and currently have $15,000 in stock that has not yet vested. 

Hourly I make $24.80 an hour (living in San Jose, this is a ""scraping by"" wage) with 12 hour shifts Monday-Friday. I have been here for about 3 years and I really REALLY do love it here. My team is great, the atmosphere is challenging and incredibly dynamic.

I have been presented with an opportunity though. 
Another employer has offered me $26/hr, 12 hours a day Monday-Friday. This job is currently a contract job meaning that after the contract is through there is a chance I could be renewed or brought in permanently, but there is no guarantee. As a contractor I will receive no benefits unless I am made permanent. If I do become a permanent team member I will also get shares of stock, although the company is not yet traded publicly.  

There is no guarantee this job will become permanent, but if I bust as much as as I did at the place I am now, then I have a pretty high chance of becoming a permanent employee. Another benefit is I get to try out a new manufacturing environment, I see gaining this new knowledge as a plus for my resume. 

What would you guys do in my situation.

270,"So I recently moved in with my boyfriend (23) and we are still in college. We have been together almost 3 years and our relationship is usually pretty great. We decided to move in together because we were tired of having roommates and thought this would be the best idea since it is cheaper and we had bad roommate experiences prior. Before moving in we had basically lived together; I would be at his place or he would be at mine. AKA- we knew what it would be like living together. However, I feel that our relationship has taken a turn recently and I can't figure out what to do. 

As a mentioned before, we are both in college so we do a lot of school work. When it comes to other activities, he either doesn't want to do them or we feel like we don't have time. We have a Husky that requires a decent amount of time and we play video games but thats about it. I am worried that our relationship is dying down to quickly. This was my biggest fear before moving in together and now I feel that it is coming true. I do not want this to burn out early because like I said, our relationship is usually pretty great. In the beginning we would go hiking, see movies, go for drinks, and be active. Thats just not how it is anymore and he doesn't seem nearly as happy. Any suggestions on how I can get him out to do more things or not be as bored around the house? Also, if any of you moved in with your bf/gf at young age I would love to hear your story!

I do have a very slight connection with her which is very strange. I run a meme page for my high school with over 400 followers. She always like the memes that I post. Only my closest friends know I run the page.

275,"Well, I find myself being in an interesting cross road in my life. Ive tried and failed at the adulting game so far. Many jobs explored but never commited to, struggling financially, jumping from apartment to apartment in hopes of a full-fledged place to settle down. 
Now I realize my behavior and trends have led me to the financial pit that I am in but I have to come and ask myself ""why bother?""
I'm still young, mid-twenties without a plan or goal. I've worked my way up from being on the streets at 17 sleeping in parks to now living in a nice apartment with a girlfriend and roommate.I have A job that will pay the bills and asperations of higher education, a career and one day a home to call my own.

How is it that we are expected to adapt and to survive in such a market? With school and all the instruments of getting ahead are cornered with debt. Now you might say ""other people are doing it, why cant you?""
Well that fault lies on myself, I just dont want to play the game. It feels rigged. 

So to the main point, I can continue trying to keep my head above water in this race that started generations before I was born or I can choose to opt out. Buy a rv renovate it and live off grid and travel until its no longer a viable option. Well its an experience at best, one not many get but it doesnt give me any economic gain in society. Taking a year off puts my 2 years behind amd without any desernable marketable skills to bank on I'm at a loss.

Now that I am an adult, I want to remove myself from these excursions. My problem is that my sister is hypercritical, quick to anger, and generally a pain to be around. I don't have a problem dealing with her for short amounts of time during family reunions and holidays, but it is hard for me to be around her for extended periods of time. She is the most judgmental person I know: she tells my how to dress, insults me for not always eating healthy, constantly critiques any mistake I make, and tells me how to live my life. She also acts like she should be in charge of every group decision, and expects me act like she's the boss.

282,"I'm 17 and I feel like I'm in a low spot in my life. 
Like most people my age, I finished school last year. 
Unlike most people my age, I didn't attend the last 4 months of school due to anxiety. 

For some reason, I choose not to do things that make me happy. It's hard to explain. Let me give an example: 

Music: I have been producing electronic music since 2014 and I think I have a broad knowledge of the field. But for some reason, if the song I'm working on does not sound good within the first hour of creation, I will delete the project and start again. Sometimes I won't even start again. Maybe once every month I will like something that I make and I'll continue until it is 70% finished. Then I'll start to hate it again and the progress will stop. This is why I haven't released any music in the 3 years I have been making it. A quote I really identify with is ""I don’t think I’ve ever made something that’s as good as I’m capable of"" - David Brown (Boyinaband)

It is basically the exact same situation with all of my other interests. Writing, filmmaking, art, photography. With things like filmmaking and writing, I have never actually tried them - I just love researching them. Whenever I think about attempting something, my brain kind of tells me that 'if I'm not good at it now, there is no point in trying to get good'. 

I have tried to narrow down exactly why I feel this way with no real success. Someone suggested that it is down to being lazy, and I actually just agreed with that for a while, but the more I thought about it the more I felt that if it was laziness, I wouldn't be so upset with myself for not reaching goals. 

Sometimes I'll have random sparks of motivation; usually late at night. I'll watch an inspirational video or listen to a song I love and it'll fill me with enthusiasm - like I have a desire to make something. As this is usually past 12am, I'll get to sleep and the next day I will no longer have that feeling. I try to push myself so that I'll start enjoying it once I start, but I never do because what I'm doing isn't 'good'.

Even stupid small things like making my first post to Reddit. I feel what I say wouldn't be as intellectual as what I read, so there's no point in posting at all. I have actually been writing and rewording this for over an hour now!

I don't know if I made sense during this, but I would really appreciate it if someone can give me some advice. I want to be able to do things and be proud of them

Thanks for reading.

283,"Okay, so I'm a 19 year old girl with chronic pain (I use a cane when I need to, but other than that you'd never know by looking at me) currently on my 5th week of an HVAC-R course with my boyfriend. The class has been pretty okay, I've been able to do everything with little problem and I get good grades. 

My issue is that my teacher seems to treat me strangely compared to the rest of the students. I think it seems like he believes I can't do things as well as the others. He gives me weird looks and acts completely awkward around me, my boyfriend and other students even think he seems uncomfortable. During class we spend a moderate amount of time in the ""lab"" doing hands-on things with a/c units. Most of the time this means that one student is pulling a vacuum, or recharging a unit, or what have you, and the teacher is there helping them. For this entire 5 weeks I've been confused as to how these certain students are always the ones that get to participate, because by the time we get our things together and get to the lab they're already starting their ""project"" so to speak. 

Well, yesterday I finally got to learn how to reclaim a unit. My boyfriend went and got his tools for me to use (I have my own but he grabbed his for some reason) and my teacher came over to help. He again was very awkward and came off like he thought I should already know how to do everything, he was very unwilling to tell me what to do and did some steps himself. Sometimes he sounded kinda cross, like ""well yeah you have to do that first, blah blah blah"" in a mildly irritated tone. Eventually he stopped looking at me altogether and it turned into my boyfriend doing and being told everything. At one point another student stepped in to help and then accidentally took over - my teacher told him so and said to let my boyfriend do everything. Meanwhile, I'm sitting there wondering what the hell he thinks just happened to me, I got my project hijacked too!! So just to see how it would go, I stepped aside and shut my mouth and he seemed a lot more comfortable. 

This whole scenario has really been bothering me and I don't know what to do about it. I hate to make waves because I feel that I've done that a lot in my life and I'm kind of embarrassed of it. I looked up the grievance policy on my school website and they say that to file a complaint, you first have to speak to the instructor and then the program director. I did complain to the teacher (alongside a couple other students) during one class about how we feel like we aren't being taught anything. I offered some suggestions for how to change his ""teaching"" plan, but it seemed like the whole conversation just made him mad. The only change he's made is he's been a little bit stricter on when our packets are due. Does that count as speaking to him, or do I need to speak to him alone after class? If so, what can I say? He's an older man who's worked HVAC for 15 years and only took this job teaching so he could go back to farming (he says that's what really makes him happy). I'm afraid that speaking with him will only make him angry. My dad is a factory worker and the same type of person, and I know that something like that would definitely make him mad, too. Mostly because it makes his life harder. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this wall of text. Any advice is greatly appreciated, I really need it. Feel free to ask questions if I need to clear something up. ",12Sep2017,2
285,"So me and this girl have been talking lately and we've only made out so far. I really like her and I know she likes me a lot... So far at least.

We've just started dirty talking and she recently told me that she really wanted to deepthroat me, that she wanted me ""all the way down her throat""... She said my dick would feel ""really good going down her tight throat""... Unfortunately, I doubt this would be possible with me.

I guess I've always considered myself having a normal size down there, and as far as blowjobs go girls can always take ""all of me"" in their mouth. I did reach the back of my ex's throat but I didn't really get deepthroated (where the penis goes past the back of the girl's throat and down into it, basically ""swallowing"" the penis, like in porn). My penis is not that long.

I feel nervous because I feel I won't fulfill my her expectations. It also makes me feel a little inadequate for her. As far as I'm concerned some penises don't even reach the back of the throat, apparently not for this girl though.

What should I tell her? Should I feel normal, is it common for penesis to be as long as to go that far down your throat? Girls... I would really appreciate your experience and opinion.

TL;DR: A little intimidated by my new girl...",12Sep2017,1
286,"I've been at my job for about 9 months now. It's my first one out of college. However, I have grown increasingly unhappy. There are a couple things that lead to this:

1. Not feeling like the ""company culture"" fits me all that well and vice versa, and one co-worker and I don't particularly get along very well. I have tried, just can't. Which is fine not everyone gets along, but it makes things really difficult. She's kinda passive aggressive, only talks to me when she wants something, or to talk about herself. Little things she does that just really rub me the wrong way. I came from a 5 year stint at summer job throughout college where I had great co workers, or at least got along with the majority, and it made the work better. This has been a hard transition.

2.   I don't get paid that well. I want to move out from my parents place, but any renting options are very pricey (like ~60-75% of my monthly income). No friends are currently able to rent with me, and I'm a little hesitant to rent with someone online. So, I'm stuck with an average 1-1.25 hour commute, one way. This has affected my physical shape, as I'm sitting a hell of a lot more, and it takes more time out of my day that was previously devoted to working out. It's a small company, so there's not much room to grow career/pay wise. 

3.   The work isn't something I know I want to do. It's not exactly fulfilling work. I find it boring in contrast other career paths in my major (I'm an engineer BTW) I could follow. Every morning getting myself up and motivated to go to work is a struggle.


I've talked with friends and my parents, and they say it's not a bad idea to apply to jobs postings. They've noticed I'm not happy there. 

However, I'm hesitant to do so after such a short time. I interned for the first few months, and became full time shortly after. So I really haven't been doing this work for 6 months or so. That and they went out on a limb and hired me basically at the interview (again it was for an internship that transitioned to full time) and have since been sending me to training for certifications (one next week I was trying to put off because of the reason for this post), obviously investing in me. Hell, just a few weeks ago, my boss handed me a bonus check completely unexpectedly. So he seems to like my work ethic/initiative. 

I was initially hoping to stick it out at this job for a  good year or two, but I'm not sure if I can see myself staying for another full year. Not without the negatives becoming to great. Yet I feel obligated to stay after how much they have invested in me. I'm also a little apprehensive to potentially accept a new job only to realize it is just as bad.. As making a habit of ""career jumping"" can be bad. 

What are your thoughts, comments, advice? Anything. What would you do in my shoes? I don't want to feel like I'm jumping ship too soon, but at the same time, I am very unhappy. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the job. I have learned a lot. I don't want to give the wrong impression about that. I also know I can make more of an effort on my part, and I have. Trying to at least. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this vast wall of text. Any input is greatly appreciated. ",12Sep2017,1

296,"Senior year high school came around, I never applied to any universities because I didn't know what I wanted to do. At the time I thought that was fine and I took a gap year after I graduated high school. I messed around and worked various jobs and I decided I wanted to be a welder based on certain hobbies I had at the time. I started attending community college a year after graduating high school to get my general education requirements out of the way. The welding program had a 2 year waitlist. In the meantime while I was waiting to get my acceptance notice, I started to work in the welding field. I worked my ass off 60 hours a week, trying to learn everything I could in the trade. I worked a few different welding related jobs in the 2 years. I got my acceptance into the welding program at the community college to start in fall 2016. 

I start welding school, flying through everything and acing every test because the 2 years working in the trade prepared me for everything. It is fall semester 2017 currently, I only have 1 welding class left to complete, it's going to be another breeze. I am just fulfilling other engineering classes such as Solidworks, and AutoCad classes to receive my associates degree in spring 2018. I've basically got school under my belt and have ""senioritis"" and breezing by everything ready to graduate. 

At this point I am only going through the degree so I can get a piece of paper that says I have an associates degree. I have only like 12 credit hours to complete.  I have zero interest in welding after I graduate for various reasons: 
1: Work/life balance. Most welding jobs have you working 60 hours a week and that's not a life I want to live
2: The pay sucks. If I want to stay working 40-50 hours a week, I'm going to top-out in my career around $40k-50k/yr. Straight out of school, for probably 4-6 years I will be earning about $35k/year. 
3: My body hurts. I'm 22, almost 23 and my body hurts every day after coming home from work. It's not a healthy trade, and my body isn't cut out for this type of work. I'm so young and I feel like I'm in my 40s already. Instead of getting home from work and wanting to be productive, hangout with friends, do anything, I just sit on the couch and watch tv because I'm too tired. 

I'll have an associates degree in welding technology, 2 years of trade experience, and 1 year of an internship for a highly reputable nuclear company under my belt when I finish. All that might yield me $17/hr if I'm lucky when I'm done and that's not ok with me. I never cared for my financial situation because I live with my parents in the meantime and life isn't about money. But I don't want to be working 60+ hour weeks for that money. I value myself higher than that, and I want to have a life outside of work. 

Part of me wants to pursue computer science. I'm not sure which side yet, either IT or software development. I like physically fixing things and hardware troubleshooting but also am trying to learn the software side. I'm trying to learn HTML5/CSS3 currently as a start and plan to dive into the basics of JavaScript, SQL, Python, Angulae, etc soon. I live in a huge tech metro area and people I meet my age/friends I know are just now graduating and finding jobs straight out of college for 60k+/year, some as high as 6 figures working for Microsoft/Google in their satellite locations here. That really makes me want to pursue a degree in CS or IT and start a better life not working as much, and making more money. Everyone I know in that field is amply compensated with a salary, time off, and other benefits which are unheard of in the blue collar world. But at the same time, the idea of attending a university for 4 years bores me. 

Maybe one day something will hit me and I will have an exact clue of what I'm doing, or what I want to do for the rest of my life.

297,"

So, hello. I don't really know how to ask this, but it's been weighing really heavily on me at the moment and I need some advice. I'm a pretty active user on tumblr. Specifically the true crime community (I know, cringe.) it's basically a group of users who enjoy discussing (and getting way to into) murderers and true crime cases. If know anything about it you'll probably have a bad impression of it, for fairly good reason. 

Anyways, that's not the issue. I've recently had some problems (I won't get into it because it's a irrelevant and embarrassing story that doesn't really tie into this) with another blogger and I'm extremely concerned that they could hurt someone or even shoot up a school. I've looked through a lot of their posts and it just gets even more worrying. They idolize Eric Harris (the columbine shooter,) say things like ""I feel homicidal"" and according to a friend almost shoot up their school. I may be being over dramatic, but I can't shake the idea that they will do something and I could have stopped it. (I don't know this person that well at all and they have no information on me as far as I know. I blocked them and I don't post personal information or my face on my blog, just factual articles, pictures and the occasional shitpost with friends) 

Please help me find a way to report them well remaining anonymous (I'm a minor.) thanks for reading, any suggestions help.
