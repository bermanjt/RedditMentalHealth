0,"Hey guys, 

I've been doing freelance writing work for nearly six years. Although I've tried to stay away from helping students cheat, there have been times when I've been in dire enough financial straits to give in to temptation. I made a decent living in university helping the international crowd out with papers. 

A long-time acquaintance and client contacted me several weeks ago. One of her friends needed a 100-level English essay written. Everything started off poorly - the student would not accept my rates, and spent an hour haggling (she eventually brought me down a whole $6). After I finished, she demanded that I revise her outlines as well. I did that for free, out of respect for the customer as well as her referral. 

Cue to a while later. She apparently failed her essay, with the professor scrawling ""plagiarism problems - see me"" as a note. Since then, she's been demanding her money back constantly. She thinks that I copied-and-pasted material or cited incorrectly, which I've never done and never will do. I told her that most likely her professor suspected her of cheating; I said I wouldn't refund her, because she had cheated and had taken a risk in outsourcing to somebody with better writing skills. 

Normally I don't treat anyone like that, but she's getting to me. I blocked her WhatsApp number and Facebook account, because I was getting 10 messages at a time at 4am and 5am (i.e., ""you have no right to ignore me,"" ""you used the same citation twice, is that okay?"", etc, without even having talked to the professor to find out what the problem is). In my opinion, I went above and beyond what had been expecting in doing her work. I don't want to block her and upset my friend, but at the same time, I've never had this much trouble from anybody else in six years. 

I never had these problems with American students; only the ones who are overseas when they request their work to be done. On the few occasions I've had issues in the States, I just work with students to identify the faults in their essays and turn in proper corrections. 

I want to be a decent guy, but I'm tempted just to block this girl and her boyfriend from my Facebook and WhatsApp. I don't want to upset the friend who referred her, but I also feel I'm essentially not getting paid enough to deal a stream of demands weeks after I finished the project. What do I do? 

(also, I know paper-writing isn't overly moral - I did it for a while, and I'm not doing it any more. My focus is on acquiring stable clients who need assistance with blog posts, news articles, and so forth)

tl;dr - girl paid me to help her cheat by writing a paper. Her professor seems to have caught her; now she wants her money back. I'm getting messages around the clock about what we could fix or revise, but I feel I've already gone above and beyond the call of duty to help her (for instance, revising her and her boyfriend's entire outline free of charge). Nobody else has ever given me this many problems in regards to writing. She's accusing me of citing improperly or stealing material online, despite the fact that she hasn't even spoken to her professor. ",17Jan2017,9
1,"So recently, both my bf and I were diagnosed with DSPD. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to go to bet at a decent time, or how to wake up early? I really struggle with these and it is intefering with my education.

3,"Hey all -- looking for some advice about how to get the smell of red wine out of my car. A bottle accidentally rolled under my seat and in the sub zero temps here in MN must have blown the cork out and spilled all over the carpet under my driver's seat. 

So far I've tried 2 different carpet/pet cleaners which have had little effect. I've also sprinkled baking soda on the carpet, left it for 24 hours and then vacuumed it up but the smell is still there. 

Thankfully it's still winter for a few more months but it gets HOT here in the summers and I can only imagine how awful it'll start to smell. 

Any advice aside from just biting the bullet and taking it to get professionally cleaned/detailed? Much appreciated!",17Jan2017,1
4,"Warning, this may be a tad long.  

So Thursday, my wife of 13 years informs me that she's ""done"".  I knew we were in trouble and we've had several talks about and I have been doing my damndest to make it better.  But I was the only one trying.  We have 3 sons (12, 10, &amp; 6), and it absolutely wrecks me to think about destroying their world and their idea of ""family"".  She's told me there's no hope of reconciliation but that she still cares for me.  And I know she still loves me, if not IN LOVE with me.  I'm a mess.  I don't want to give up.  I don't want to lay down and let my whole world just walk out of my life.  But I don't know what to do.  She doesn't seem receptive to the idea of counseling, and frankly, from the research I've done, it's a mixed bag of results anyway.  

To top it off, on Saturday, I found out my dad has inoperable pancreatic cancer.  I'm gutted.  My world is crumbling around me and I don't have the first damn clue as to what to grasp at first.  My mind tells me my dad should be my priority, but all my heart thinks about is my wife and my marriage.  

Can anyone offer some perspective that might help me get my mind in the right place to tackle all this, one step at a time?",17Jan2017,1
5,"Okay, this might be long. It could be short. I'm writing this off the top of the mind.
I have trouble talking to people I don't know. By trouble, I mean I straight up cannot talk to people I have never met. But I'm not exactly shy either. With people I know well, I am vivacious, sporadic, and most notably, swarthy. 

This really becomes a problem when I want to get to know a girl I find attractivein order to determine if I would like to date her. I For example, I have been wanting to talk to a girl since Freshman year, two-and-a-half years ago. I have class with her, and she quite literally sits right in front of me. Yet, I cannot bring myself to try to converse.

This is really just one of my myriad undiagnosed problems(I'm stubborn and traditional. Therapists ain't my game. That and I don't like to nor do I talk to my parents.) I am a wonderful ball of self-loathing/depricating, unconfident cynicism. 

I apologize if this was too long, or cyclical, or just ran together without making sense. That probably happened. ",17Jan2017,1
6,"I don't really know what to do.. it feels like only way out is to end my life
It will be long story about love, gambling and desperation

I'm 29 years old male, living in one of UK cities for last 7 years altough I'm not from England originally
I never been good with money even when I earned more or less decent wage, always spending too much however I still somehow managed to keep afloat. I also all my life I'v been bit of player. And most importantly I never learned to appreciate what I have.

Almost 4 years ago I'v met beautiful south - american girl. We hit off very well and we started to live together pretty soon. We had our problems but now when I look back she gave me everything. She soon noticed that I after paying everything off never really saved any money and confessed to her that I had a lot of phone contracts and some pay day loans. She tried to help me to manage them but I didn't really try hard enough and chose to lie about my expenses

About year and half ago I developed gambling issue and start borrowing money from everyone coming up with lies till one day I had no more plausable lies to tell and I told her everything. Instead of leaving me she still choose to stick with me.. even her parents helped me with rent which was overdue and she also helped me to find extra jobs so I can pay off my debts. I stopped gambling and for few months tried my best to pay off my debts.

About 6 months I had relapse and I gambled again significant amount and plus got sacked from my job ( working for one of mobile phone companies)... and she still sticked with me despite my lies. And then she left country to visit her family and I cheated on her. She somehow knew what's up and guessed my fb passport and there it was whole conversation with this girl with explit details. She still was ready to forgive me but my stupid pride was saying to her I don't deserve you she still tried to stick with me till she met somebody.

It turned my life upside down.. I begged, I cried but she wouldn't change her mind. Somehow I moved out and start working night shifts while being even bigger mess. Sometimes we spent some time together but it was never same as before..

I started to work for one of langunage schools which was good fun and somehow helped me but recently they started to cut my hours and since I didn't had plan b I started to take money from school untill I spent money/gambled it away meant to take students on trip. I still managed to take them on this trip however I made them pay extra even though they already had paid to school. that leads to situation where I will loose job and there is good chance police will be involved unless I return money somehow.

I'm 29 years old... I'm in debt with every single of my friend. Credit card, payday loans, phone companies, with not a single friend who can help me. And city is small so word will be put out about my actions. I also have £0 in my account and no real skills to earn money except perhaps exceptional people skills and no place to live
I don't know what to do and it really feels like only way is to end my life right here right now.
s                     

Edit: thank you all for comments and inspiring words. I still don't know how can I get out of all this mess.

I wish I could go anywhere in world and work for for place to stay and small salary in return. Farm or cruise ship or anything like that but nowadays it's ridiculous how long these applications take and I need way out now

I've literally not stopped working on the site and various, social media channels and getting things aligned and up to speed ASAP, content, content, content. 

For anyone who has been here, would you have any advice moving forward, my only thoughts on passive incomes are things like Amazon Affiliates program, but are there others, more passive maybe, I think it's all about building an audience before hand, but you can only learn to achieve through asking, I'm no expert but I just love to write about the things that are my passion, doing this all around a 9-5 so it's challenging.

10,"Okay for starters, no I don't have crippling social anxiety, nor am I depressed. I just tend to never leave the house unless its out of necessity (work, grocery shopping, etc.). 

I'm still relatively young (24), but I feel as if there's no point to living life if I continue to do it this way. My parents are always asking why I haven't met a girl yet, and as we all know - no one comes magically knocking if you sit on your ass all day. 

At the same time though, a part of me is content to just exist this way. There is so much in life to experience and I have done very little. 

I really only have 1 close friend who is busy most of the time, so I don't have much of an actual support system to rely on.

But! What's baffling to me is that people tend to really like me! I don't know if its because I'm aloof or not, but I've never really had a group of real friends to hang out with.

13,"So there's a guy at my office I work with very closely on the daily, we make up sort of a two-member team so we're together almost all working hours, and have gotten comfortable with each other because of it. 

It's been little over a year all in all, and being a very closed off person I very quickly got incredibly connected to him and (as is my natural reaction to a new person) I cared for him way too strongly after only a few months. It's worth noting that when I got the job I was very depressed and on the verge of leaving my ex, which he helped me get through and for some time was the closest thing to a friend I had, so he meant a lot to me very fast. In animalistic terms I suppose I imprinted on him or something, it's hard to explain. 

Nowadays, we're constantly having office banter that could easily be seen as flirty, I'm pretty sure he's not into me at all and is simply having fun at work - we've talked before about relationships and he doesn't seem interested at all, and is typically much less of an emotional person than me, so I'm really struggling to tell what's there and what isn't. 

We talk outside of work sometimes but it's minimal since I got over my ex, not sure if there's a correlation there but we talked a lot more when I was sad, probably because I was more pushy/desperate. Or at least worried less about seeming into him? 

Another catch is that he's 8 years younger than me, and semi-regularly makes jokes and comments about me being old and such, which only adds to the list of things I can't tell whether it really ""puts him off"" or not. 

Sorry for ranting, and thanks if you even read this far, but I'm just trying to figure out how to either figure out how to handle or get some advice on the best way to push it out of my mind and consider him only as a friend. I don't really see or speak to anyone else and I'm really, really bad at being social or making new friends (he's the first friend I've made in over a decade and that's because I was forced to work with him), I'm just not sure what exactly I can do to snap my brain into shape or maybe keep an eye out for certain signs..

14,"I have been at my current job for about a month and a half, and I already hate it. For a short background, I am a woman in my mid 20s who graduated with a bachelors degree in business administration a couple of years ago. I've been doing administration and hr jobs until I figure out what I really want to do/go back to school for. This job pays only okay, the benefits are so so, but I was between jobs (contractor position ended before) so I wanted to just take one that sounded stable and paid benefits. 

My boss is just berating and unpredictable, I'm being told conflicting things from different departments (and then have to defend myself constantly), and there's no room for any upward mobility. ALL of the directors (large company) are men. It is very much a ""good old boys"" situation and I feel like I've been transported to the 1960s.

It is making me feel sick (I have depression and anxiety) and I am tired of being in this rut with jobs taking advantage of me, yet I know it's not good to be a ""job hopping millennial"". I just have no idea what to do.

17,"Hi, i'm a 17m from the UK and I am pretty lonely. I've been diagnosed with Aspergers, ADHD, A genetic illness I can't remember the name of but it makes my joints weak. (Not too bothered about that one), depression and OCD and I have never really had many friends. I knew and spoke to a lot of people in High School but that was because I saw them everyday and since leaving High School none of them have bothered to keep a friendship going which im fine with (I pretty much expected it tbh)

I had to drop out of school for a few months and I had next to no interaction with people besides family and close family friends so that didint help much. (I am back in College now but it's a small class of like 9 of us.)

I did have a Girlfriend a few months back but she was emotionally abusive so that ended and since then I get upset when ever I see people in relationships because I wish I had a Girlfriend. An example of this was I was out today shopping for my parents and seeing all the people with their girlfriends or boyfriends looking so happy and enjoying themselves it made me feel really upset and I broke down when I got to the car. I have pretty low self esteem, I hated the way I looked because I thought I looked too thin or too weak but I started doing excercise to maintain general fitness but theres still other stuff that really gets to me. Stuff like because of my mental illnesses I am not able to drive, I don't have any friends in real life. (All of my friends I met online and I have known a lot of them for years)

When I think of this stuff I always think that no girl would want me and that I will never be happy and spend the rest of my life single and alone. The main thing that bothers me is that im single. 

I don't know why I care so much about it and it's getting to the point that I would probably date anyone that showed a tiny interest in me which I know is a terrible idea. Or when ever I see a girl or talk to one the first thing that pops into my head is ""Would she be a good girlfriend?"" which is a pretty fucking annoying thing to happen because it gets in the way of having a normal conversation with others and it's like im treating people like objects.

Another thing that I think of (I feel like a total prick every time this thought comes into my head) is that I would have to settle for an unattractive girl because no attractive ones would like me which is pretty shallow and hypocritical of me because I am not the most attractive person in the world.

I am on a waiting list to see a therapist but the mental health service is a joke so I am probably gonna have to wait months to see a therapist so if anyone has been through something like this or has advice for me that would be great.

I was extremely supportive during a major rough patch that they were having and provided many things, both emotionally and materially. They really clung to me during our off times, which to me was weird.

They have told me repeatedly that they love me and what not, however they admitted (lied through) perhaps finding some one else. That was fine, no worries, I just wanted them to be honest.

23,"Some context: I'm 21 years old and currently 4 months into a PhD. While studying, I live ~300 miles away from my home town in the city that I studied in during my undergraduate degree, which is just a short commute away from my new city and university.

The problem:  
It's approaching the end of the time I took away for Christmas and New Year, and I'm heading back to university at the weekend. However, pretty much since I started at university at undergrad, I've been chronically homesick. I arrived in my first term excited, and then a series of events quickly tore that excitement apart and threw it in my face, and since then, every single time I have to go back has been unnecessarily difficult for me. The build up to it takes weeks, where I stop enjoying things I love doing with people I love to be with because I know I won't get to enjoy it for much longer, and builds up to bouts of crying, anxiety, high stress, breakdowns and even nausea on some occasions. It eventually settles down a week or two after the move, but it never completely goes away until I get back home again.

It's exacerbated all the more by me not having any idea when I'm next going to get to go home again now. I'd previously have the next holiday to look forward to, but I don't have any of those officially any more, and going home is a long and expensive journey to make on a particularly regular basis. It's my birthday in March and with the commitments I have to my research around that time, I highly doubt I can afford the time or money to go home then, which makes me particularly upset (yeah, I know, it's just another day, but I've spent two of the past three birthdays alone and it does  make you feel like shit). I am chronically aware of how my relationship with home and my family is changing and will change dramatically over the next few years, but I honestly don't want it to. Sure, I know change happens, but I'm not ready for it emotionally.

It's putting a real dent in my confidence. I feel like I'm old enough and experienced enough that I should be able to cope with it just fine. But I can't, and I have no idea why. I know university wasn't the best time of my life - far from it - but this should be different. And yet I still can't disconnect myself from the feelings of loneliness and isolation and sadness that come with having to move back. A few other events have led me to question whether I want to continue my PhD at all, since I've lost confidence in myself since the holidays started, but that's just a small part of my reluctance to return, which reaches far wider. 

I know in theory that I just need to (wo)man up and get on with things, but I don't feel like I can keep going on like this any more. I do everything I can to distract myself or keep myself busy, but I never completely manage to stop feeling like this. I can't escape the need to go back, so how am I supposed to get on with it?

24,"Throwaway account because I never open up about myself and feel more comfortable this way.

So, my Mom and my Dad had been together for 20+ years before my Dad passed away from cancer (nine years ago). I was eleven. My Mom almost immediately after (about two months) started dating someone which I had a hard time with. My Dad was my best friend and all I had known, these years to come were VERY rough between my Mom and I. Without getting too too personal, I had always had issues with sucidal thoughts and depression for my entire life anyways, but with that included I was in a constant state of pain. 

Flash forward to about a year and a half ago, my Mom and I are in a much better place. Her and that boyfriend split up. She met someone on Match.com and they hit it off really well. They do end up splitting up once but get back together shortly soon after (nothing major to cause breakup, my Mom just needed some space).

About a week before Christmas they tell me that they're engaged. I've been having such a hard time dealing with it and I just don't know what to do. I don't really even know how to explain how I'm feeling, plus I haven't told my Mom how upset I am (for example: whenever I have a personal problem she in return makes me feel guilty for it, like when I was self harming she shamed me so hard for it. Not a bad mom, it's just how she deals with things).

So if someone could please tell me how I can deal with my stress and even maybe bring it up to her that I'm upset, would be greatly appreciated. I am happy that she's happy and I know that it is completely selfish of me to be upset in any way, but I can't control how I feel, I can just hide it. Thank you!

They try so hard to hold back from saying what they feel, saying its normal and you get used to it... No you don't, you never get used to living and caring for an autistic human... They are wretched creatures that have no control over emotions or actions... My gf thinks he's smart because he can do things a 1yo normal kid can do, in reality he's dumb as a box of rocks. I have to hinder time at my shop, my business, my livelyhood to get him out of school because he's being a piece of shit, or he hurt some other kid, and everyone calls this normal... I know It seems like I'm a Piece of shit for saying this, because some how she loves the kid more than anything, and I have zero ""like"" for the kid let alone love. I just need to know what someone else would do in this situation? I could just leave my gf, but being the love of my life would be a hardship alone, it's like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. pS Those who think I'm a piece of shit, you never dealt with true autism, low functioning spectrum.. Which means the autism is severe. It's like you wake up to a nightmare everyday... You can not go into public without the little kid screaming until you are deaf and bleeding from every constant scratching and biting. You don't know what it's like. If this were a normal bad behavior kid he would get his ass best into submission and respect.. But you can't do that with autistic kids, because it makes it worse or some thing along those lines, I think it's because they don't know they are doing wrong, so you can't punish them even though they are going to keep doing it until you or them die. I respect retarded people and those who take care of them more now, since being around this hell hound. But no one deserves this, you can't hide your feelings forever, which is why I'm posting this, to get set straight by one of you and get some sound advice, or get agreed with by I'm sure countless other people who have this same problem.",17Jan2017,2

35,"Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I make tons of spelling/grammar mistakes, I'm super tired and have been crying for hours so I can't focus. I normally write very well, so don't judge me by this post. I'm a 30 year old woman. Single. I have a boyfriend though.
I live in an underdeveloped country (where I was born). I never went to college due to financial/family issues. My mother is an abusive alcoholic so my main priority was getting the fuck out of her house, which I did at 18. But then I got sucked into the whole working and paying rent cycle and never went to college. Which is expensive too. And since I had to take care of my drunken mother since age 8, I never really had time to think about what I wanted to be when I grew up, so when the time came, I didn't really know what to study. I found work as an English teacher (as a second language, I live in South America), because I was good at it and required zero qualifications (again, South America). So between then and now I worked for many years, my grandparents passed away and my father told me to move into their house (which belongs to him), I did it in orer not to pay rent anymore and have a house that (kinda) belongs to me, or someday it might, I worked hard and renovated it with my own bare hands and it looks really cool. Like super cool, like decoration magazine cool, haha. I also got certified as an English teacher and learned a lot, gained tons (10 years!) of experience and good references from employers, and everything seemed to be kind of starting to work out for me. Then my mother (who is an abusive alcoholic as I mentioned) did a series of awfully abusive and horrible things I won't talk about now (mostly due to length) and I had to cut her out of my life because the things she did were extreme. My father decided it'd be a good idea to become her friend, after hating her guts for 30 years, and now he's trying to push her into my life, even gives her his spare keys to my house when I'm gone so she can go ""have a look"" around my house. They're both narcissistic and selfish awful parents and people, who I'm sure really enjoy making my life miserable or fucking around with me, and truly I wish they just died or something and leave me the fuck alone. Anyway. One day I decided to travel to Europe on a shoestring budget for three months. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I was away from my nightmare parents. I fell in love with the continent, and also with the idea of traveling the world as a backpacker. Since I came back home (2014) I've been saving money to go back and see all the things that I didn't have time to see the first time. Problem is, in almost 3 years I've only managed to save 3600 USD together with my boyfriend, and that barely covers the plane tickets. Anyway, now this year it turns out you have to be a native speaker to teach English anywhere, so I'm unemployed. I've been trying to teach online, even my native language, and do translations, but I'm basically working for peanuts, and I feel like although I try to stay positive, I'm lying to myself pretending I can make a living out of this, let alone save for my trip. I have 7 cats and a dog who make my life a lot better, they're really the only family I have besides my boyfriend (I realize how sad this sounds but it's the bitter truth), but they're also a burden when it comes to moving/traveling. There's no way I would ever abandon them, so I found someone who can take care of them if I travel, and if I ever manage to relocate I will work 24 hours a day if necessary and save every penny I make to bring them with me. But as a latina (who doesn't even look latina!) with no EU passport or citizenship, no degree, being a non native English teacher, I don't really stand a chance of getting a visa anywhere, so I'm stuck in this horribly depressing and uninteresting town, where my nightmare parents live and I have zero friends (because basically there's no people my age), which is expensive as fuck and there's literally nothing to do, not even working (my boyfriend is out of work too because the economy here is a joke). Other cities in this country aren't really much better. Am I completely fucked?",17Jan2017,2

39,"I started college at 24 and have really been half-assing it (taking semesters off, dropping classes, etc) and am currently only about halfway to a Bachelor's...in English. 

Considering I work for a living, I can only take 2 classes per semester if I want to remain sane, so even if I get my ass in gear, I'm easily looking at another 3-4 years before I have my degree in hand. 

I already feel crappy about the fact that I'll be starting a career so late, and almost all of my work experience thus far has been in cooking, a field I have zero interest in being in for the rest of my life. 

The thing is, I'm an introverted guy who really needs to come out of his shell and find some meaning in life - and I also want to travel, something I haven't had a chance to do. I feel a strong pull to quit my life temporarily, travel for several months, and figure things out when I get back (which means no job and some accumulated debt) - I feel like it will unlock something inside me that might help me navigate through life better, become more well-rounded, and become more successful in the future.

I'm studying ATM and have a low income, this holiday is easy 1000 pounds, maybe more and working out with my debts that leaves me with approx 17 pounds (21 dollars) a month to live on until june, I know it seems like a no-brainer and i obviously shouldn't go, plus I'm not amazingly excited to go on it tbh, I know it won't be worth the money, but I don't want to be 'that guy' who can't join in again because of money issues, especially due to the amount of times this situation has happened (cancelling due to no money), and me trying everything to give a better image of myself now I've quit my addictions, started getting fit and been studying computer programming for 5 months, but this will just reaffirm to them nothing has changed.

52,"I’m in a dilemma regarding whether or not to drop out this term at my university, and your opinion right now would help a great deal. Since last month, I have been all-consumed with a web application project that I have been planning on the side, in which I have a great desire to pursue at the moment. I do not believe I can balance both the project and school studies at the same time. School grades are very important to me for scholarship and admission eligibility in the future, and my studies take up a large amount of my time (I’m not the quickest to learning when compared to my peers). I believe I would regret my decision should I make the decision not to pursue this opportunity. Regarding the project, I have no prior web programming skills, and thus, I still need to learn how to program. I have already started, but this has only made me increase my distance from my school studies. If I were to discuss this dilemma with my parents, I could predict with very high probability that they would be against me dropping my courses and pursuing something that has not been even been marginally developed. If the project does not work out, then I will re-enroll back into school — I plan on getting my degree, anyways. I’m a full-time university student at the moment. I live in residence with a meal plan. If I were to drop out, I would continue staying here until April, while going full-time in learning how to program and work on this project. What do you think?

59,My sister has 3 children and 3 years ago her marriage ended after she found out that he had been having different affairs with women from work - even fucking them in his car during his lunch break at work.

My parents are nice to their face but behind their backs they say that they can't cope with it and how can she now 'just become a lesbian?' They're intolerable of it but not to my sister's face - however they can be quite cold and judgy to her. My dad tells me that he just comes from another time and to him it is just not right. I've argued with them and I'm really hurt and angry that i do not have progressive parents who are open to changing. I'm especially upset because she was with a lying cheating male and now they can't cope with her being happy in a faithful relationship just because it's same sex.

60,"I didn't really check this for spelling/grammar errors but I feel like I just need to put my ideas out there. I'm really just trying to put this existential crisis I've been having for so long into words instead of it just existing in a cell inside my head and just put them somewhere. This is a start, but this doesn't even really encapsulate 10% of what I'm feeling so I will try and make my experiences more condensed in the future, but for now here's this from a thing that I was writing just to try and figure it out:
1/13/17 Where do I begin? I do not know why I am writhing this, wether this is a journal or some kind of memoir, I'm writing this to try and extract my dark, horrifying and terribly boring consciousness onto this device in order to display my vapid thoughts and put them into something more tangible. I think about death. I think about death all of the time. I think about killing myself all of the time. I think about the suffering of those in abject horror in places less 'civilized' then the place in which I live. I live in (metropolitan city in US), by the way. I have no real way of getting into the topics that I think about all day so I think the best way to approach this is to start somewhere in the middle and then sprawl out in all directions. 
It seems to me that the only outcome that is consistent in civilizations that leave religion behind, is the state (usually the current head of the state) becomes a quasi religion. Take North Korea as a contemporary example. The fervor with which these people of miserable existences speak of the reverence of the Supreme Leader, would shock anyone on the outside. Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are both dead. The latter being dead since 2011 and the other since 1995, but both are dutifully serving together as the role of 'Eternal President.' Close to 70% of the population is irreligious, but yet people fall at the feet of Kim Jong Un and praise him as though Jesus, Buddha and Muhammad have all come back together riding on one another's shoulders to save the world from the dirty imperialists. I mention this because I often hear this of those who have ran out of ways to criticize a lack of a belief in god. The ""what about all those bad atheists"" argument. Stalin was an atheist, Hitler seemed to be a private atheist, Mao was an atheist. While I can't find any statement from the Supreme Leader about his religious beliefs, I don't think I would be making a great leap to say he probably doesn't have any. 
Death. Death is always on my mind. I suffer from depression. One of the things I realized in out patient at (hospital), was that it seemed like the rationalization of why each person felt the way they did, seemed to exist one unit out of their self-awareness. A girl who was an alcoholic, for example, said if her parents would just give her alcohol, she would be fine. I don't think I was the only person in the room who saw the problem in this thinking, especially the group counselor. But it does get me wondering if my rationalization for the way I think exists on the edges of my self-awareness. It probably does. I do not see any purpose in life. We live and die and live and die and live and die until we burn so many fossil fuels that we cook the earth, or build general AI that thinks 1 million times faster than us and would squash us with the same disregard as we do to a fly in our homes, or a military coupe happens in Turkey and ISIL-like death cult gets ahold of the nuclear button which it will gladly press (and knowing the mutually assured destruction and welcoming it) in the name of the one true God. Even if none of these things happen, we are still heading towards heat death in 10 to the one thousandth years where no transaction of energy can occur. When you get in this thinking one contemplates suicide. I will at some point try to write something more poetic in which to describe the dull and numb apathetic pain that I feel meandering through life like I'm jammed in a coffin on a ever too slow moving assembly line to be dropped into a wood chipper. Life is the game that everyone plays, and no one wins. You can see humans everywhere try to escape the reality of death. Religion is the most clear and prevalent example but it exists in more subtle ways, too. When people talk about survivors of tornadoes, mass shootings, ect., all they're really talking about are people who aren't dead. Yet.   (30 minutes writing, 724 words)
1/14/17 Not that I don't think these deaths aren't tragic, but it's so prevalent, even in our language, that we cannot deal with death. I think the reason for this is because while a frog might be aware that death can happen, it doesn't seem aware that it will happen. You can observe the same thing in a small children who are aware of the phenomena, but do not understand its inevitability. We are too aware of our own demise, so we make up excuses to not be aware. There's a danger in this. We don't recognize 1, how pointless it is but 2, fail to live successfully in the moment. We talk about tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, ten years as if they are inevitable. That there will always be a tomorrow for all of us even though we know there isn't. It is very likely that while I am writing this, and you are reading this, that there are several people right now aware that they are going to most likely die today. Wether it be from disease, impending threat of violence, or ending one's own life. This, to me seems to be the truth of the matter. We are avoiding death in everything we do. It is through the fact that I will eventually die, everyone who is capable of remembering me will die and the people who remember them and so on and so on till this species, like 99% of all other species that have lived on this desolate rock floating through the endless nothing, will die too. It is by virtue of this that I do not see an easy way to ascertain meaning. But I still feel it on some level. I still feel the need to snuff out the liars, to tell people the truth, to show people compassion, to live peacefully whenever possible, but I can't force myself to go beyond my self loathing. I can't get over how I look, I can't get over the feeling that I am worthless in a worthless world. This is the true tragedy of human existence. Being all too aware of our  shortcomings, but being able to do nothing about it. I can't see any other way to slice this pie authentically. I can't even compel my self to live in the now. I can't compel myself to face my fears. To talk to the girl I'm afraid to talk to, to live up to expectations others have of me. I want so badly to go out and better not only myself, but the world I live in. But I cannot find a way to push myself. I'm afraid, not of talking to people, I'm pretty good at that. I can make people laugh and being at least somewhat socially aware, I think. But to talk to anyone about how I really feel about any of the things about my specific identity, even the thought seems so anxiety inducing. I am even willing to talk to people about what I believe about religion, politics etc honestly but not talk about me honestly. It scares me. It scares me that opening up will make the people who don't understand confused and unable to comprehend my feelings. And the people who do understand, further away because it scares them to see themselves reflected in me. This is the dilemma I face. I don't know how to go about it any other way except just saying it. But I can't push myself to do it. I don't know how. Death is the only constant. Death is the only thing that seems real. I don't know how to get around death. My goal is to accept the pointlessness of living and dying and to embrace life fully and live in the moment. A pretty lofty goal for someone who doesn't see the point in anything. But as I said before, it is not as if I don't care, I just think. No. I know that's all fruitless. That there is no way to appease the suffering of others in the long term because there will always be more suffering. To sign up for this battle is to sign up for one that you know you will eventually lose. You sign up knowing that the battle to combat human suffering is one that you can't win. The only thing we can hope for is to make it better now knowing that it will end (probably horrifically) for us. But you either sign up for losing battle, you do nothing at all, in turn supporting those who actively impose suffering on others in the name of the God, the glorious party, or because of imagined evils. I am doing nothing and thereby supporting them. I don't know if, as much as I want to, am capable of being the person who says no to the void for another day. Who says no to suffering for one more day. Who says no to my death for one more day. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe I really can't understand it fully because I'm only sixteen and am incapable of understanding issues fully because my brain isn't fully developed. But this is how I see the world. And I've seen no one who has brought against it a valid counter argument. I'm not in danger of doing anything rash, but I am struggling with this nonetheless.",17Jan2017,1

When my dad died she wouldn't let me come see him.

Looking back, she's definitely who got me smoking daily, because we'd do it together, and it was fun. It got really excessive and for a year I knew I was addicted, I have asthma and I started having breathing problems all of a sudden so I've been forced to cut back so significantly on my weed use, and she says she supports me quitting when I've talked about it but later will offer me weed if I give her rides. I'm finding myself more and more feeling like I should cut her off. I've spent a lot of money on her when I'm high because I'm a generous person but I definitely regret it sometimes. She's always getting high and its come to a point where I'm trying to better myself maybe I'll smoke occasionally, but it really got out of control when I started seeing her. I can't blame her for my problems, but she definitely isn't helping them... The hard thing about this is that she's basically my only friend and we're planning on getting an apartment together in the summer... If I all of a sudden stopped talking to her it would be really like wtf, and I know if I tried to tell her the things that bother me it would start a fight and I don't see there being a solution coming from it. On top of that she can be a huge bitch when she feels attacked or hurt. I don't really know how to handle this, it aggravates me that when she's with her boyfriend she wont respond to me until she has nothing to do or she's bored, I've been thinking a lot about this and I feel like a lot of it is one sided.

I just stepped on a scale for the first time in a year. I'm 5'3 I've always been curvy since my teen years, but I was shocked when the scale read 205.5 lbs. I have a goal to get down to 150 lbs by the end of the year. Anyone have advice on how to hit that goal especially with a busy lifestyle. I work 4 10 hour shifts. I don't want to make excuses, I want to lose this weight, any one know a good way to do that especially since I sit down for all of my job at a desk all day. I know I could workout on my days off which are 3 days a week. I just don't know where to go from here  ",17Jan2017,1
70,"So a few years back I met this girl at school and becane friends. Later on I had feelings for her and vice versa, we would text each other quite often, she's a grade higher than me and was heading towards high school. After she started her high school year I didn't talk to her for months and felt like I have gotten over her. So I decided to text her to say what's up and how she was doing. She said she was doing fine and met cool people etc. Then someone I know said she started dating my cousin and I thought of ""Really? That's cool"" shit like that.

(And he's really close to me and my brothers, like he's like another older brother to us.)

So after a year I went and started high school and was kind of excited to see her. But as soon as I walked past her in the hallway I started to get very nervous. My heart would start pounding and I would not want to look at her in the eyes. In my head I would just think to myself ""oh shit"". 

A short period of time I would feel more comfortable talking to her. But when ever I would see her walk with my cousin aka her boyfriend holding hands I felt a little pain in my chest not. I know it sounds kind of dumb, but hey I really did felt that. 

Now towards the end of the year I had finals and was trying to bring my grade up to pass my classes. I would really stressed out by that and also my feelings towards her. It was pretty bad, I didn't wanted to talk to anybody like my family or friends for like at least 2 weeks. It was bad to the point where I wanted to punch something and cry out of nowhere. Especially I saw them 2 together, I just wanted to run home and just not talk to anyone and cry alone. I also felt a sharp aching pain on my chest.
I would still texted her when I was going through this. Now I'm a really private person and was actually been thinking about posting this for awhile.  But I would text her some private about me to her and she would say some private things she doesn't really tell other people about.
 So I told her that I was stressed out about finals and how I wanted to cry and stuff, I didn't tell her how I felt about her. 

I should've talked to someone cause my family were worried about me, especially my parents(for those 2 weeks/ finals week). At one point I was in my room just being sad and I had some money in my room just for saving and she asked me where it was, I'm pretty sure she thought I was using drugs or something. Well I did talk to one of my brothers about this situation and he knows both of them. I cried in front of him which was fine with me cause I'm really close to him. He said that I should just tell my cousin how I felt about her, but I didn't want to cause it would bring some drama and I absolutely fucking hate that. 

Now to present time, I still text and talk to her. Well mostly text to her cause we really don't see each other at all. We're really good friends, she would consider me her best friend. But I still have those feelings (but not as strong), but I always think about it every now and then. I want to talk to her but alone, you know? As of now I believe my cousin and her have been going out for about 2 years for now, which is cool and I'm happy for both of them. 

I have been thinking about how should I get over her. I even thought about just not talking to her again (which is a terrible/fucked up idea). 
I just need a solution. So please I need some advice!

tl;dr
Met this girl at school, we started talking and had feelings for each other. She was going to high school the next year. Stopped talking/texting her for awhile. Got back in touch to her and learn that she was dating my cousin, and thought I was over her. Met her again in person and felt nervous and realized I still have feelings for her. And I want to get over her. Need some advice! Please! ",17Jan2017,1
71,"Not sure if this is the right sub...if not, could someone please point me in the right direction? Thanks.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I'm in a bit of a pickle:

Due to some twisted goof of fate that I do not know enough about to properly explain *why*, I was the victim of several coincidences:

Firstly, I have an autism spectrum disorder. Specifically, Asperger's Syndrome (even though the diagnosis no longer exists in the medicine). Because of this, I went to a small, special-needs oriented private school for grades 4-8.

Secondly, the aforementioned private school featured several years of pre-algebra, but no actual algebra classes...

&amp;nbsp;

So therefore, I, like many others, take Algebra I in my freshman year of high school. That being said, my *years* of pre-algebra were not wasted...I didn't learn a single new thing for a whole semester...but because I didn't get to actually finish Algebra I (we were too busy familiarizing ourselves with Newtonian physics and college level economics at that point (yeah, Asperger's is weird. As was the school.)), I had to take it in high school to get the credit and move on...which leads me to my dillemma:

&amp;nbsp;

I am now in my junior year of high school, and beginning the process of searching for colleges. I am hoping to major in a STEM field (right now, it's computer science), but at the rate I am going, I will have to take calculus in college...

...**and my mom thinks this is a huge problem**. She has two concerns:

1) Can I get into a good STEM school if I haven't gotten a calculus credit yet?

2) If I could get in, would I be capable of *surviving* a semester calculus class in college? My older brother knew a guy who tried this (this guy probably isn't nearly as smart as I, but that's beside the point), and things did not work out well for him. 

&amp;nbsp;

Based on this sample size of *one*, my mom has expressed interest in me taking a pre-calculus class at a community college over the summer. And I do not want to do this at all.

The class would have a schedule roughly equivalent to a 9-to-5 job, but with *even more* work to do at home, no possibility to take a day off, I'm not getting paid to do it, it eats up 6 weeks of my summer vacation...and I can't even slack off and browse reddit once in a while! All the stuff I'm looking forward to about summer:

- vacations/travel

- seeing friends/all night sleepovers

- possibly getting a part time job that actually *pays*

- going to the pool/beach and getting a fabulous tan

- learning programming languages (because you *do* need to do that if you are going into computer sci)

- visiting colleges

- gratuitous quantities of philosophical introspection (two summers ago I deconverted to atheism, last summer I refined my consequentialist system of ethics and pondered free will and determinism, and I am expecting a  similarly massive worldview shift to occur this year)

- reading

- possibly coding a game?

- summer camps

- possibly writing a novel/novella

- etc.

Are all thrown out the window. And it's not even summer school, where several subjects are touched upon. No, it's pre-calc, pre-calc, and *more* pre-calc for ~7-8 hours a day, every day.

Suffice it to say, I don't want to do this. I also have an issue with my mom's logic on this topic:

That guy had a bad time trying to shove a year of caculus into a semester, so I should try to shove a year of pre-calc into 3 months?

Also, on top of the homework I'd get from this class, my high school has a massive project that is done over Senior Year to graduate, and much of the research/groundwork for that is done over the summer before it. Suffice it to say I'd be busier in the summer than I am *now,* right before midterms. And not in a good way.

&amp;nbsp;

So my questions:

**1: Is there any validity to my mother's concerns? Would I have trouble getting into a good STEM school because of this issue? So far, my PSAT scores have been ~95 percentile in pretty much everything, and I'll be starting honors chemistry in a few weeks.**

**2: Is it even remotely advisable to take a calculus class in freshman year of College? Has anyone here been in that scenario, and if so, what should I expect?**


TL;DR: My mom wants me to take pre-calc this summer, so I can take calc in senior year of HS for college. Taking this class would obliterate most of my summer, and I do not want to do it. Essentially, I'm looking for a second (or third or fourth or fifth, etc.) opinion here. Thanks!",17Jan2017,2
72,"So we've been married four years and we're in our late 20's early 30's. My husband has mild/moderate ADHD and sometimes has a hard time seeing things logically. He also has a huge heart and is a total extrovert. I am quite the opposite-a little more reserved (probably actually quite normal to most people but reserved compared to him), a little more logical and more of an introverted artist type. My husband is mostly attracted to women as friends-he is definitely more emotional than his male friends and he works in place with a majority of women. He basically generally feels closer to women-he does also have many male friends. He is very funny, charismatic and good looking, so women tend to love him. He is also the type of person who needs to have an extremely tight knit family and friends. He has a friend who he is especially good friends with, let's call her Jennie. Jennie has been hanging around us a lot for the past 8 months, and Jennie and my husband work together. Jennie hangs out with us together in a group quite often and is in a band with my husband. Jennie is the type of woman who just likes to hang out all the time with her friends, she doesn't have a lot of commitments besides her work. My husband and I are very busy-I'm an artist and he's a musician and we're both very busy with those interests outside our day jobs. Sometimes I get annoyed because Jennie just shows up at our house on a day we meant to be alone and then my husband feels obliged to hang out with her and doesn't want to appear rude (she's also friends with our housemate). Jennie is single and 6ish years younger than us.


Anyhow, I went away for a month for an art residency about 6 months ago and my husband told me that Jennie was sleeping over every once and a while beside him in our bed. My husband definitely doesn't want to live by standard societies' rules. He assured me that they were just close friends and he was lonely. He did admit that one night by accident he grabbed her boob in his sleep thinking it was me (he told me over phone a few days later). I totally believe him in this and he has always been totally honest with me. He is generally an extremely honest person and is the type of guy who can't lie even if he tried. She is a rational and trustworthy person and I don't believe she would ever try anything with him.


My husband recently had an extremely depressive few weeks last month and he was questioning our marriage. He wanted to move out for a couple months &amp; re-evaluate things. He spent his whole young adult life in relationships and felt like he needed to be carefree and alone. We have a few small issues (mostly stemming from us not spending enough time together)  but generally we're a great couple and I think we're great for each other. He tends to get obsessed over things during these episodes of depression--last time it was his tattoos- he wanted them all lazered off. After the depression got better he realized that this was just a delusion and it was related to his ADHD. The same sort of thing happened with him obsessing over our relationship-and after he got out of the depression, he realized that he definitely didn't want to leave me. It was the hardest and most stressful time in my life-I didn't connect it to him being delusional, I just assumed it was his true feelings. I love and care about him so much and would do anything for him. I was a mess for a month and I normally handle stress quite well. At work Jennie was giving him advice like, ""Mark I'd feel the same if I wasn't single ever and had time to understand myself alone"" basically supporting him in him wanting to leave me. I was so upset-he was being extremely tormenting to me and there she was giving him advice to leave me. She was just trying to be a good friend to him, but he needed the type of advice that said, ""Mark you're being completely delusional, your wife is amazing and it's the weather and your ADHD that are giving you these horrible thoughts"". Jennie has only known him about a year, so she isn't aware of how things really are.


While we were going through this fighting period he got obsessed and was texting her 50+ times a day (they are also together all day at work). He got so obsessive and was trying to escape the hardship we were going through. I got weird and jealous because he was texting her so freaking much. I looked through his phone because I was so annoyed that he was texting her when he should be caring about our relationship (I've never done that before). He wouldn't mind if I ever looked through his messages because he has nothing to be guilty of. Their texts were normal friend chat, but I noticed that she asked him to go ""on a date"" to a wedding together. He said sure. Normally I wouldn't care, and would know it would be just as friends but it was a sensitive time and I was thinking out of emotion and got super upset. It really bothered me that she used the word ""date"" even though I knew it meant ""friend date"". I just don't want him going to a wedding with anyone else. It bugged me and to be honest I was very jealous because he hates going to weddings. He complained about going to my brothers wedding. I was thinking irrationally and began worrying that she was trying to steal him from me. 


I later saw a photo of her in her bikini that he screen shot off her facebook in his phone photos. I got extremely angry and told him I wanted our relationship to end. I was so angry and confused. He then told me that he had a small crush on her before for about a week. He also admitted to having a few crushes on numerous girls at his work, but they were always just that-small crushes that flared up for a week and then disappeared. He said he screen shot the photo months ago and that it was stupid and just quickly saved and not thought about again and he no longer had those feelings. We argued about her for a long time (a couple weeks), and now I feel extremely weird and angry around her. About half of her instagram photos are of him, she went vegetarian because of him and started playing music because of him. I just feel like she's so obsessed and to be honest I just want her to back off. I truly believe that she wouldn't do anything with him, but I was so worried that she was hoping that we'd break up so she could date him. I don't actually believe that now, it's just when someone you love is saying they want to leave you, a person often gets irrational thoughts. I know now that my husband has no interest in her romantically, I just can't help these feelings of anger, annoyance and jealousy. (Before the whole event, they went on weekend trips together and hung out alone sometimes and it never bothered me at all). 


I feel angry because I don't think she should be texting my husband that much or giving him advice about our relationship. I don't think that she should be asking him on dates to weddings and shouldn't be so obsessed with a married man. I'm also not okay with them sleeping together in the same bed even if it's platonically. I'm jealous that he has such a good time with her and then I get the crappy grumpy, depressed real husband. 


It's very weird around her now-I get so angry when I am around her. I just wish she would disappear-I've even guiltily wished she'd just die but that was totally ridiculous and a one second thought (horrible I know). My husband mentions her (normal stuff like oh, Jennie's bass is here can we drop it off to her). I've asked him for a month to not see her until things calm down. My husband gets it and feels incredibly guilty, but also frustrated because he feels like I'm acting as if he cheated. I keep telling him it's not that he cheated-he just has no boundaries and is disrespecting me by his actions. He's actually a little bit innocent-he doesn't think he's ever doing anything wrong if he doesn't cheat. It's just that he doesn't know how to anticipate bad judgment. He wants to be a free spirit, and I want him to have that sense of freedom, I just need him to openly communicate with me so that I am aware of what's happening and I need him to have some boundaries and to consider me more. I feel so guilty that I'm angry at Jennie. It came up a ton when I was meditating, I was trying to send out feelings of peace, but still felt extremely annoyed to her. How can I get over this? I don't want to have ill will to anyone. 


P.s. I mentioned a few things to her a few weeks ago (that I didn't think it was appropriate that she asked him to a wedding and a couple other things) but she's a bit emotionally conservative and I didn't get back a huge response. She definitely knows that I'm upset because I've come home a few times and she's been there and I've been cold to her (I'm not good at hiding my emotions). All I would like is an apology and a promise that she will act differently in the future.",17Jan2017,1

80,"So let me dig myself out of this hole... It's been 3 years since we broke up. I know it's a long time, but when I tell the story I've heard from others, it makes more sense why this has been difficult. However:
TL;DR Relationship ended after a year, no closure, feels erased from my life, and cannot get closure. How can I get over this?

For the necessary longer more detailed story:
I knew this girl since we were kids, on and off. When we started dating, about a year of my life I spent the majority of my time with her. We were best friends. Drove to school together, walked to class, hung out after school, after work, went on vacations together. We liked the same movies, music, activities. Maybe only differed mildly politically and religiously, however this wasn't any reason we fought. Sure we fought every once in a while just about normal relationship fighting where you essentially get bugged by each other. But the last two months definitely tanked, it was nothing like the past year. We stopped spending as much time together. She stopped communicating with me as much too, I felt like she was hiding something. Maybe just because for the most part, she always told me everything. Like I knew every detail about her life and then started slowly decreasing over the next two months. But mostly there was a lot of stress about college that really accumulated these ongoing fights really about the same standard relationship ""bugged-by-each-other"" reasons, but maybe more intense. The only things I know is that her friends this new semester didn't like me very much (they were all single). This is still the only thing I really thing I know affected our relationship. Finally we broke up, mostly on my doing. I said it should just be a break, that we both need to re access ourselves and our relationship. She didn't want a break. For her it was all or nothing. Unfortunately for her, I was serious. About a week later, she was begging to get back together. I said yes, of course, I was madly in love with her. Two days after Christmas, about a week and half after she begged to get back together, she brought me to the mall. This was possibly the most awkward day of my life. She hardly talked to me, the communicating was almost bipolar. Like black from white, the day before. She didn't show me any of the outfits she tried on, sometimes didn't even hold my hand. Literally felt purposeful in making everything seem abnormal. Later we talked about it, and she broke up with me. Her reasoning was unclear, that she was going through ""things."" It felt like she was hiding things again, despite the past week and a half feeling normal again. I fought but accepted the defeat. I deleted her off facebook but that was it on my end. She took the step further to block me from every social media account, delete all facebook posts, tweets, and pictures. She wiped me from her ""social media"" life completely. I figured that maybe she's just being emotional and eventually things will get better. But NOTE, these fights, these conversations were hardly discussed when we broke up. There was this looming feeling of no closure. I really have no idea still TO THIS DAY why she acted that way two days after Christmas. Was it literally just ""college starting"" stress? It can't be. What happened? Well...we have had a couple moments of interaction since. I tried to text her on her birthday, ""Happy birthday!"" Her friend texted me in backwards texts (siht ekil), it was stupid, but the texts contained even more stupid immature insults (this was a friend who didn't like me, confirmed). Later I was accepted to the same college she was going to. This wasn't purposeful. Actually, because she blocked me on everything, and didn't talk to many people she knew anymore, I HAD NO IDEA she was going there. Even when we broke up, this wasn't the college she was interested in. I saw her walking to class. She got bright red and looked furious. The next day, walking from the same class, I saw her walk completely around the building to avoid me. I texted her a couple weeks later, pretty much saying that I think we should talk about something, because there is this thing that has essentially been erased from our lives. She said ""Don't ever text or try to talk to me again."" Literally. Copied and pasted. So now, I'm the most over this as I can be. I've dated a few people (shortly), I have a life, doing great in school. But every once in a while, a dream hits, and reawakens this absolute confusion. I guess, you could say I am hurt by it all. An entire year of my life I feel completely unconnected to.

Now I realize I am one party of this relationship, no one here knows what she would say. Trust me, I wish I knew. I'll be the first to admit that plenty of fights throughout the relationship were escalated by me, I have quick bursts of a temper. However, what I wrote above, the details, the events, is all 100% accurate. The only things I think would change from a third party would be detail of conversation, probably showing my temper. She never discussed my temper with me, so how do I even know this would a reason we broke up anyway?

Essentially, what I am curious about is...

How can I fully get over this? I guess I need advice on how to emotionally still deal with this. I'm never emotional about anything. I'm very much a classic ""man"" but this still hurts me to this day. I would really appreciate anything. Just comments, if anything. Thank you.

85,"Hey reddit, I need your opinions and advice. 

I've known this girl for 4 years, her and I have been working together for 9 months; several hours away from where we call home. We are working in a small town so after hours we spend alot of time together not knowing many people outside of work.

I want to figure out how she feels about me , and see if we can move forward into a bigger thing such as FWB or a relationship. I usually have no problem figuring girls out; on top of that I've never really asked for advice... but this is a little different.

(Keep in note, I don't wanna ruin the friendship)

You see, this girl she's different then alot of I've talked to in the past. If I pull a move on her (try to kiss her, etc) if she doesn't want it or agree with it , I feel like it would put a real strain on our friendship. I feel like if I were to try and talk to her about it with her, see how she feels the same would happen if she didn't agree with it or felt the same way, so what should I do? 

Some background about us:
- 2 years ago we had a one night stand. Which was me basically in a drunken stooper cause it was my 18th birthday, (I guess I was pretty rude) 

- she can be flirty sometimes but I'm worried to flirt with her cause she seems like the kind of girl to overreact about it and make a big deal.

- sometimes it seems like she's really into me and other times she doesn't what so ever. 

Basically I can't figure her out, and I'm worried about confronting her about it all due to the fact that it could fuck our friendship up and I don't need it right now

Any advice?

88,"So I'm 29 years old and come from a big family. 5 older sisters - all older than I. I'm an uncle many times(14 times, great uncle twice). Anyways, I get this weird message from my longterm gf saying some woman reached out to her asking me to contact her on Facebook as I'm not on there very much. I message her back and ask what she wants... She comes back saying she'd love to talk to me but to talk to my mom first. 

I'm like what the fuck is going on... I text my mom and she's just normal. But starts to just change the subject. I call her up after work and finally pry it out of her. My current dad isn't my biological father. I don't know what to do or say. So I make awkward jokes and pretend to be okay with it all. She knows I wasn't okay but you know... My dad's my dad and now he's not by blood but he still is. It's like being told that the color orange is actually blue but I've been taught otherwise my whole life till now. Some trueman show shit. 

All she can tell me is his name and that the dude died when i was 1. So I ask her if anyone else knows. All 5 of my older sisters have always known. I made a joke about that... They all have big mouths especially when drinking. Had to commend them for never telling me after all these years and all the drunk times. I'm glad they never treated me too differently. Or maybe they did and I'll only realize it now that i know the truth. 

Anyways. I have no interest in talking to my other half sister and brother. Not the sister anyway... She essentially told my mom if she didn't tell me that she would after all this time. Kind of speaks for her character and doesn't seem like someone I want to know. 

The most troubling thing about it all is how much I love and respect my dad. I respect him more than anyone. It breaks my heart to think that at some early point of my life he may have hated or resented me for existing. I don't know the circumstances of how something like this happened. I asked my mom how dad didn't leave her and she just went on to say he was the kindest, most forgiving , and big hearted man. He never held it against her or anything. 

I know this really doesn't change anything. My dad raised me as his own and he's my dad. I think I've always just carried my family name with so much pride and now I feel like I don't deserve it or something. I've always thought how I wanted to have a kid to carry on the name and bloodline. It's all just traditionalist nonsense, I know. Part of me thinks this is all a big deal and the other half of me is saying ""don't worry about it"".

Update: Ok, so Sunday night I invited ""Chanel"" to come watch the football game with us at a local sports bar, I told her prior to showing up that a couple of people from our high school days were going to be there. After some good food, the game, and 2 or 3 beers ( we were both sober) we decided to call it a night with our other friends. ""Chanel"" offered me to come to her place to talk by her fire pit, we both knew that she wanted to hear my answer so I took her on the offer and made my way to her house. I did notice throughout our little football viewing that ""Chanel"" was keeping a wider distance to all of our old friends compared to me. When asked what she was doing in her life or where she moved she responded very vaguely and not with a lot of details, I also noticed she didn't have that much designer on as she usually does when I see her in public( well we were wearing our jerseys). 

I followed her home and once we got there she invited me in so I could wait for her to change into something a little more warm, when she comes back out she leads me to her fire pit deep in her back yard (When I first came, I didn't notice how big her backyard was) . Of course while we walked there we made some small talk about our day, the game, and how we have been. Once we ignite the fire pit and get comfortable, Chanel began to cuddle with me in a huge lawn chair we pulled up to the fire. At this point we just kinda enjoyed each other's company for a good 15 minutes after that Chanel looks up at me and said ""this is exactly what I want."" I figured it was time to tell her what I had to say, I asked Chanel ""Hey, I want to know how you are doing. How you're REALLY feeling about everything."" Chanel kinda took the question with a little confusion, she told me that she was fine and that she was just thinking how things are different when you have someone to lean on. I explained to her that I'll always be there for her to lean on, but I've been given the thought of moving in a lot of thinking and I realized that half way through my thinking I never really asked you how you felt about everything. 

Turns out Chanel told her parents that she began modeling and stripping, to test the idea of sex for her parents. Her parents became furious that she threw away everything they had sacrificed for her in order to set her up for success so they kicked her out. She lived with one of her recruiters for a little bit while she was house shopping , she was devastated that her parents were so disgusted and mad about her stripping when in fact she was actually an escort. She began to notice on social media that her parents told her extended family because they began deleting some pictures of them together. She started crying, I didn't really know what to do besides just hug her and tell her it's ok. She just felt alone and that she became something disgusting, something that can't even be loved by her own family. This is when I finally decided to share my own 2 cents. I told her that she is not a disgusting women, that I've met disgusting women in my life and that she was far from it. Her career choice was eventually going to upset people close to you because they think you could do something ""better"". I told her that I wanted to see her succeed and be the best of whatever she wanted to be, though I told her I wasn't excited about hearing that she became an escort but as your friend all I was concerned about is if you were physically and mentally ok, I wanna support you as long as it's not destructive (of course she told me that she uses the proper protection to avoid catching anything and avoids drugs besides alcohol). I also told her that she had no obligation to pay me back for being a supportive friend because you can't buy genuine love from another person, I also told her I was willing to move in on a roommate basis until I finished school (coincidently, her house was way closer than my house to the Community College I attend). She then insisted she at least cover our combined food costs and utilities (I agreed)

We started talking about what we had between us. I told her that I found her very attractive and liked her personality a lot but in no way do I feel like we should have sex unless their are some type of strong feelings we want to share. She asked me if the reason we couldn't be a thing is because her job is basically having sex with other men. I told her I'm not comfortable with it. She seemed really bothered by my response and told me that I could have sex with other women in order to even the field, I kinda just said no even though I knew that was once in a life time offer. I told her lets save that conversation for another day. We then spent the rest of the night just cuddling and reminiscing on old memories. ( I also told her that I have to notify my parents I'm moving out and such, she said just to text her to keep her up to date)

I plan on talking about patching things up with her parents and thinking of ways to do it. Thanks for all the advice guys. I gotta just handle everything else as good as I can. I'll be probably soon grow the balls to tell Chanel I sought advice here. Thank you all.",17Jan2017,85
94,"On days I feel really shitty (today is one of those days), I always think about the stuff I wish I was doing, making Youtube videos, starting my own business, take photography more seriously, etc. I often fantasize about these things even at my day job. Lately I've been feeling miserable because I feel like I lack the willpower to reach my goals and desires. I sometimes feel like the best things happen to me when I force myself in awkward situations, like for example, financing a car without a steady job only to force myself to try harder to gain a better position at the company so I can pay for it. Like do or die. Right now on the spectrum of financial stability I am on the extreme low end of being dead broke and almost homeless and I want to reach the high end of luxury living (materialistic, I know, that's not what I meant about being successful/being a better human). I'm self conscious about showing my face to public but I really want to be famous in the future. So the question is:

Should I force myself to make Youtube videos about my current life and document what I do daily in order to force myself to do better and create the future I've always dreamed of?

I've tried telling my dad over the last two days and two years that I can't take it no more. I don't feel safe anymore and I don't want to be home. I am going to be 19 soon.
We sat down and talked today and my dad told me that I have to do everything they say and no questions about it. I can not ""question"" their parenting ( I have 6 adopted siblings). My opinions cannot be shared unless it doesn't affect my mother. I have to change! For everything else to change.
But the thing is I've done this 3 times already. My mom wont change my dad just says to me she will change if she wants to, I don't know what to do anymore. I want a relationship with my mom. Im envious of the people that do. It kills me inside everyday that I don't have that.

- I don't want to pay for all the tertiary expenses
- I like to take my time when I move about and enjoy the scenery

I never wanted to date any of them, so I've become rather herbivorous in my approach towards woman and I really notice it now that I'm in University. Thats not to say that I can't communicate with woman, I just don't feel a drive to create a romantic relationship with anyone I become acquainted with.

 I hate parties and a lot of the typical college kid shit, so I tend to be isolated to a certain extent. I want a serious relationship and I feel a majority of the woman in my age group are either too immature or are in the ""I'm waiting for Mr.perfect"" faction.

106,"Fairly new to Reddit. This is my first post, I've heard Reddit is a diverse community so I'd like to get some different points of view. 
Back story:
My parents have been divorced for as long as I can remember. My mom has always had custody but my brother and I would visit with my dad every other weekend. My dad was always mean and drank a lot. He would force me to come visit even if I didn't want to. One time physically pulled me out of my house and threw me in the car and kept me the whole weekend. Just all around not a good character. 

So flashback to my childhood. My dad was always going on dates and would make me come to visit just to drop me off at my aunt's house. I was a very innocent kid. And I was about 6 years old. Too young to know anything about sex or any of that. So when I would spend the night at my aunts house, and my uncle would sneak into the room in the middle of the night, I didn't know I was supposed to tell on him. I knew it didn't feel right but I had no idea to what extent. So I was repeatedly molested and I would try to hide under the bed and I would be completely silent if I got up to go to the bathroom or get a drink.

Fast forward a few years of this happening and I'm in my mom's room watching tv before bed. I'm about 8 or 9 years old. Moms tv is playing law and order: svu. A scene comes on with a little girl and they ask her where the man touched her. She pointed on the doll and I suddenly realized I was a part of something horrible. I looked at my mom all wide eyed and horrified and I asked her if what the man did to the girl was really really bad. She said ""yes, why?"" so I told her ""well my uncle Joe does that to me when I stay over""  She asked me why I never told her before and I explained that I thought it was normal. I had never really spent time with many other family members so I honestly thought he just treated me like an uncle would treat his ""favorite niece"" 

Okay so the truth is out. So much weight off my little childish shoulders, right? Wrong. My mom calls my dad and tells him what I said. He's furious. I know what you're thinking... ""I bet he went there and beat that guys ass"" wrong. My father punished me. He made me sit in a corner of my aunt's house all day as to publicly shame me in front of his family, including my uncle. Every once in a while my dad would come talk to me in my corner ""do you know what you did wrong?"" he'd say ""I'm not lying daddy please"" I'd beg, crying the whole time. Eventually I gave up and accepted my lecture. ""Its very serious what you said and someone could get in really big trouble for that I want you to write a letter and apologize to your uncle for making up such horrible things"" 

So yeah, dads a dick. Perhaps by now the thought has occurred to you that my mother wouldn't possibly allow him to put me through that. Wrong again. After all the trauma at my aunt's house and my hours of crying and being told I'm nothing but a liar, I go home and this is what my mom says. ""I can't do anything because you were in your dads custody when it happened."" YALL I FUCKING BELIEVED HER. I believed her for so long. I blocked it out never thought about it ever again. 

Fast forward again I'm 15 and I've got my first real job, first real paycheck. First time I can buy things for all my friends and family for Christmas. Now after my humiliation at my aunt's house I was never really the same around my dad or his family. So I never really hung out with any of my cousins. I was one of the family weirdos. But I had a cousin who's about 2 or 3 yesrs older than me, she was also a weirdo. We never really hung out before but she was going to be my ride to the mall. Blah blah blah we're in the car driving back from the mall been all buddy buddy the whole time then she hits me with this. ""Hey let me ask you something weird..... Did uncle Joe ever-"" ""yes"" so we talk all about how no one ever did anything to charge him and he molested her and paid her parents to stay quiet. 

No statute of limitations for this so we're like ""yo our little cousin is adopted and she's about the age we were we need to press charges"" do all that and press charges he gets dishonorable discharged from the military and he's all over the paper. No jail time cause my whole family told me they hated me for being an attention seeking whore and I ended up not testifying in court. Blah blah unimportant shit. 

Sorry I'm trying to get to the real question.... Through all the shit after I pressed charges I trusted my mom and I truly believed she had my back. And it wasn't until after all of that, until I was about 19, that I thought about it. MY MOM COULD HAVE PRESSED CHARGES REGARDLESS OF WHOSE CUSTODY I WAS IN AT THE TIME.  Wtf. Life changing shit. My dad definitely never loved me. I had come to terms with that at about 10 years old. Now I'm like ""damn my mom didn't even love me enough to have my back at 8 years old, innocent as shit.""

I want to ask her why. But I'm not sure I want to know. I don't want to be told again, that it was my fault. I also don't want to be told that she was paid for my innocence. But I feel like I need to tell her because it's been heavy on my mind and it's really ruined my desire to keep up any type of relationship with her. 

What would you do? ",17Jan2017,2
107,"Hi all. I'll try to be concise.

- I'm 31, work in the Environmental Industry, and quite like my job
- I agreed to do a 3 year masters in International Environmental Law, because my employers are happy to pay for self-improvement (it was also to keep me happy, I suspect, as I've been there 9 years) and it's a course quite relevant to my industry.
- Year 1 was a certificate, year 2 was a diploma, and the final year is the LLM via a dissertation
- I also graduated in English Lit and Creative Writing in my early 20s

So here's the rub. I've completely and utterly failed to commit to this final year. I've barely lifted a finger, constantly telling myself ""I'll start this weekend"". But then there are plans, or something needs doing etc. Every day, I walk the dog 45mins in the morning and evening, 20mins at lunch, and 10mins before bed. I also do the gym 3 times a week.

I work 9-5.30, I live with my SO but I do most of the housework (like 85%+, though she cooks) &amp; 100% of the dog walks. Bottom line is, I feel like I just don't have time. Now, I know that's bollocks - I've heard of plenty of people with two kids, two dogs, a full time job, and they're still doing a degree in their spare time. I get that.

I think I'm either too lazy, or just too prone to procrastination. Years 1 and 2 went well; I only really need about a 42 to pass, or about 56~ in the final year to achieve a merit overall. But it seems like, unless I can take an entire day purely committed to working on uni, I just don't do it. If I know we have plans in the afternoon, I can't focus in the morning.

And after work, by the time I've walked the dog, had dinner, and done a couple of jobs, it's the last thing I feel like doing. I do book the odd study day off work, but my job is always pretty busy.

The diss is due in May. I've done about 300 words of 15,000. I have no idea how it's meant to be structured, and my 'tutor' hasn't contacted me since October (nor I him) so it's been easy to bury it in my mind, but lately it's on my mind night and day.

So here's my predicament: 

- Cram like mad for the next 3 months, and hope I manage to achieve a pass
- Defer for a year; take the financial hit (£1300 or so) and do it properly next year (with the risk of screwing up in exactly the same way again)
- Just accept that this isn't what I want to do with my life, and move on. 

My future is in sales and high level client relations. It's what I do; it's what I enjoy. This masters adds nothing much beyond an interesting note on my CV. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be a failure; I'll beat myself up about it, but I just seem to be incapable of committing and I don't know why. It's like self-sabotage.

Any advice would be greatly welcomed... do I just need to man up and do what I can in the next 3 months? Or defer and do it properly for next year? I know a lot of people would kill to be in my position (free education etc) so I appreciate that I look selfish and immature.

Thanks in advance.",17Jan2017,0

I've wanted to leave this job for a while now, but I just can't bring myself to get any motivation to start applying for other jobs.

111,"So I'm an Australian who is very grateful to be Australian. However, I've always been interested in other cultures and was curious about my family history. Since I was a child I never knew my dad's family because of a falling out when I was 3. My grandmother was Dutch and I wish I could have met her properly and learned everything I could. My dad doesn't know anything about the Netherlands due to his racist Australian father who forbade passing any knowledge down.

In addition to this my favourite subject at school was Japanese because I was fascinated with the culture &amp; language, fast forward I went on exchange during uni and loved it but felt like I didn't belong there permanently because it didn't feel right. When I came back I wanted to get back into touch with my family routes.

I discovered that there was this latent Dutch option procedure and sons of Dutch mothers (aka my dad) born before 1985 (tick) could get fast track citizenship and then pass it to their adult children (and still retain Australian citizenship) and I got obsessed with the idea. This was basically perfect and we just happened to have a Dutch grandmother. I spent ages going through the national archives and ancestry.com etc

guess what: i missed out because my grandmother naturalised in Australia with her parents at 15 BUT if she did it at 16 she would have had her own certificate and I would have been eligible. 

I worked out it was 6 bloody months!!!!! It actually broke my heart seeing the email from the consulate.

I know it's ridiculous because I don't speak Dutch / know nothing of the culture but I feel this massive sense of disappointment and loss. I feel like there was this opportunity to re connect with my heritage and I missed out. I know I can always apply for a visa / travel / study there etc. but it's not the same.

I still can't get over it and it's been months. I'm probably just being a spoiled brat 1st world citizen of a great country but I can't help the way I feel.

113,"Hi all,

25y/o male here, married for approaching 2 years, together for 6. My wife's father has been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. He lives a fair way away so we rely on second hand info from him. Initially he told us the cancer was caught early, was operable and he had around a 95% chance of coming through it. Six weeks has passed and after diagnostic keyhole surgery and various tests we find it's spread to his lymph nodes and it's more like a 30%-40% chance. 

I work in a surgery and have spoken with my GP friend/colleague who has assured me the six weeks we were waiting for him to have treatment would be unlikely to have allowed the cancer to spread much, which was my wife's worry. Knowing my father-in-law it's likely he didn't listen properly or more likely was told *if* these tests show it hasn't spread you have a 95% chance and just cherrypicked that to tell us. That's the kind of guy he is. 

This sounds cold but I'm not overly concerned for him. I like him a lot and we've always had a great relationship but he hasn't taken care of himself, he's smoking even now and he's had a difficult life so honestly I don't know how much he really cares about the possibility of dying (beyond upsetting my wife of course). It's a great shame it's happened at this time though, he's 62 and without going into massive detail he's gotten past several of the material worries that have plagued him for the last few decades. We'd hoped he'd finally be able to relax for the last part of his life but he's been unlucky again.

Anyway my reason for coming here is this: I'm a person with below-average emotional intelligence. My usual way of dealing with people that are struggling is to identify what practical things they can do to help their situation and push them towards that. My wife is outwardly being practical, she's going up this weekend with foods that she's researched and found are good for people undergoing chemo but I know she's struggling on the inside. I know from talking with my doctor friend that the situation is bad. I wondered if anyone on here has been through similar and could advise on how best to support her? Thanks in advance.",17Jan2017,1

There's a girl i work with who i think is attracted to me but I'm not sure and seeing as how we work together it's a delicate situation. I'll try not to do a wall of text but I'm trying to be as clear about whats going on as possible.

When she first started she was friendly with me but I didn't read into it. In about october i changed shifts so i was relieving her most days and she would hang out for a few hours after her shift chatting with me. I thought 'hey this is a good sign and i really enjoy her company' so i had started flrting here and there trying to go easy so she wouldn't feel uncomfortable at work and she never told me to back off.

So company Christmas party rolls around and im full of dont give a shit juice throwing down game. Doing everything I've always done to make my intentions clear, she doesn't try to get away from me or tell me to back off in fact she seems to be trying to stay around me as much as possible. Even my coworkers point it out to me. I don't do anything other than give her a hug and tell her good night when i go home (we were both really drunk)

So fast forward to now, she still hangs out to talk to me every night she works. She's even went to the movies with me (couldn't tell if date or not) and occasionally texts me. I still flirt here and there but i don't know where to go from here. I haven't been dating in a few years due to depression so I guess i lost my touch or i need my confidence back. I feel like I'm just not being forward enough but the only thing i can think to do is just ask her what's going on between us. Help me Reddit, it's been a few years but in my experience girls would have made it clear what they want from me by now.

120,"As a bit of background, I will admit we took these steps in our relationship quite fast - I met him over the internet through mutual friends and found that we lived 4 hours apart. We began officially dating a month after we met, and I drove to see him nearly every week, and stay 2 or 3 days. It hurt so much to be apart, on both of our ends - we discussed moving in together.

At this point we had been together for 4 months - and we did it. He moved to my state - I moved into a new house with him. 

We are still getting settled in. He has applied online to 13 places looking for a job, and I have been struggling to support us in the meantime. We have lived together about 3 weeks. 

I have been stressed, of course, but coming home to him is wonderful. I thought everything was going just fine until he said he needed to talk with me today. It took a long time to get him to open up, but he finally admitted that he's felt alone, homesick and that he is having a really hard time making this place his home... He said he didn't know anybody, and he didn't have a clue where he was. He said that he's been playing a lot of games because it distracts him from those feelings, and that when I get home from work and we spend time together, he sort of snaps back into reality. He says he feels bad because I stress so much about work and money and everything in general, and all he does is sit at home and play video games. 

I can't even begin to describe how much my heart hurts at finding this out. And of course, I do not blame him one bit. I just don't have any idea how to fix it, or what to do - this is fresh on my mind and I'm still struggling to decipher most of this.

He assures me that he has no second thoughts about our relationship or living with me, he loves me more than anything, and that none of it is my fault. I just can't help but feel so guilty and helpless in this situation.

122,"I recently landed a decent job after 2 months scraping by. Yay for having an income again! It's in marketing, specifically social media and content marketing and at a medium sized agency. I've recently decided that this line of work isn't for me, especially since I've been experiencing increasing levels of anxiety and depression relating to working at an office, however it's a good job for now as I really could do with the money.

My anxiety has been getting really bad lately and ever since I last worked in a large office environment, I've been feeling pretty nervous about returning to that dynamic. I'm a quiet person with a tendency for awkwardness (I sometimes feel like my life is a comedy show sometimes and genuinely laugh about it haha) and I didn't have too much in common with my previous colleagues, so it was hard to fit in with the crowd.

Moreover, I'm nervous about being able to pick up things quickly enough to handle the workload effectively. I've never worked at a marketing agency before and this will be the first time that I handle multiple clients at the same time. It sounded like they'll be pretty much throwing me into the deep end as soon as possible!

Any advice on either side would be appreciated. Anyone else ever feel anxious about starting a new job? What's your experiences?",17Jan2017,1
123,"Ok Background: Me, my partner and our son moved 72 miles away from our families 3 years ago so that my partner could attend uni. He passed the foundation year, but he is on his third resit of the first year, because he failed the first year due to me working and not having appropriate childcare for our son, and the second time he tried to resit I had a nervous breakdown and he dropped out to care for me. 
Fast forward to now. He is on his third resit like I said, (he is doing physics) and the last few weeks he has kind of become consumed by a game, unfortunately he is in the middle of exams and I was worried that he was not focusing enough on revising this being his last chance, so while he was out this morning, I casually asked my brother for some advice... 
Well he started calling my partner a waste of space and said he couldn't stand him, he said there was no point in him even going to uni because he will never get a job as he doesn't have 'get up and go', he said that he blamed my partner for my mental health issues and said that he wishes I would just come home and I would have a better life. 
This all seemed a bit over the top as I was only asking for some advice to get my partners priorities straightened out. I am so upset that he could say these things out of nowhere, I am also attending university and doing very well so him saying that my life would be better back in the small town I come from I very much doubt. My partner has always been very caring towards me and loves me a lot, we have been together for 10 years and are incredibly happy together, I just can't understand why my brother would react this way just because of a minor grievance I had about my partners focus over the last week.

124,"Maybe this isn't quite the right place to ask this, but I'm just curious how often adult friends usually hangout? 

I've had very little luck making friends as an adult. Pretty much the moment all my school friends moved away I pretty much became friendless. 

A year ago I made a friend off of social media and we met  up in person. She's really awesome and I love hanging out with her. We were both single when we met and we'd hangout like twice a week and we got pretty close, platonicly. 

She recently got a girlfriend and changed jobs, and in the last six months we've hungout 4 times and with one exception it was always me, her, her girlfriend, and a few other of her friends. So not the personal touch I am used to. 

We text every few days, but I really feel far more distant from her than I did before and don't feel fulfilled as a friendship. But then I'm wondering if this is just normal as an adult. I mean I'm busy with work too. It isn't like she doesn't want to hangout with me, we just can never schedule a time to do it. 

As a side question, how do you make more friends as a busy adult anyway? In the last two years she's the only friend I've managed to make. Which is a pretty poor track record.

135,"Hi all,

I had a minor collission in my Suzuki Swift this morning, I had stopped in a queue of traffic and the car behind me (Honda Civic) didn't and went into the back of me. I'd say the car moved forward about a foot from the impoct.

I put on my hazard lights and made eye contact with the driver behind me, and indicated i was pulling over. When I did, the traffic ahead moved on, and he drove off, still making eye contact with me and looking panicked.

I've reported the incident to the police, and I'm, going to the station to make a statement tonight.
In terms of the car, there's minimal damage, barely any i can notice, but I'm concerned about unseen damage that may have been caused.

For myself, my back is very sore/tense today. I am unsure if this is from the collision, or from training last night, or a mixture of both, but it is a noticeable/abnormal discomfort.

Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar scenario and they have any advice?

150,"Hello, 

I'm going to try to keep this short. My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 8 months, but we've been best friends for over a year (we are both 17). I live with my grandparents and they are very strict so last summer, I began sneaking out in order to see him because I was *literally* never allowed to. Everything was fine. A few months ago we decided it would be easier for him to start sneaking into my house instead of me sneaking out. Again, everything was fine with that. However, if my grandparent's found out, I would obviously be in a massive amount of trouble. His mom knew that I snuck out and she was fine with him sneaking into my house. 

A few weeks ago, someone randomly messaged his mom on Facebook accusing him and I of smoking pot. We don't know who messaged her. He has smoked before in the past and so have I but we are nowhere near drug addicts or anything like that. His mom takes away his phone, car, etc. I find out through my boyfriend a few days later that she read ALL of our private text messages (sexts included) and because I happened to drink one night, she now thinks I am not only a drug addict but an alcoholic as well, who won't ""make it to age 60."" She's also implied that she thinks I'm a sl*t beccuae we have unprotected sex. However, I'm on birth control and it isn't any of her business in the first place. 

Last night my boyfriend decides to sneak out so he can see me, despite me telling him not to. His mom finds out and texts me at 1:00a.m the following:

Her: ""I really hope tonight was worth it to you guys""

Me: ""What?""

Her: ""I'll be calling the school tomorrow so they can get in touch with your grandparents""

Me: ""Can you please tell me what you're talking about""
Me: ""There was no ""tonight"" because (my boyfriend's name) didn't come over he told me he was going to Winco""

Her: ""So he locked the front and back doors, piled pillows in his bed to look like he was asleep, and climbed out through his bedroom window to go to Winco knowing he was grounded from his car. How unbelievably idiotic do you think I am?""

Her: ""Don't bother replying to this message. I'm done arguing with a couple liars. You'll be blocked""

During this whole thing she has never given me ONE chance to speak to her. If my grandparents find out, I am so, so, so incredibly dead. I don't know what to do. Is there any way my school counselor would be able to keep her from contacting them?",17Jan2017,2

We went to my ex's house, got smashed and for her mother to drive us to the party.when I rocked up I was happy and friendly when all of a sudden I get pulled aside by a guy and from what I remember he took my things like pack of smokes and wallet. I woke up on the ground with a bloody head but I was fine and because I was so drunk I was still partying and having fun.
After this occured my anxiety went thru the roof and I was finding it hard to cope with going out and leaving the house altogether. A month ago I got dumped by the girlfriend, this really didn't help the anxiety but ontop of that she started to fuck my friend which played with my mind even more.
I keep getting messages from her and she's harassing me but I just ignore it. I'm not willing to argue because my confident and will to speak out is at an all time low. A few minutes ago I got a friend request from the guy that attacked me. What do I do? I need urgent help",17Jan2017,1

158,"I had physics and calculus with this girl all last semester and thought she was really cool. We didn't talk much or anything until finals were coming up, and then us 2 and some classmate friends started meeting for study groups (we all only studied half the time, the rest of the time was gossip and wine drinking). I was always charming and talkative with her when our friends were around, but it got a lil funky feelin when the two of us got stuck alone together

So just as we got to meeting up regularly to study and hang with friends, winter break started. Given that we'd only just started hanging out like 2 weeks before winter break, we didn't really exchange more than a couple texts over break

Fast forward to yesterday, I thought it'd be cute to DM her from an anonymous Insta account and tell her I had a crush on her and to guess who I was. It might sound weird/middle-schoolish, but it ended up being really funny and non-awkward and cute. So she figured it out it was me and I asked her on a lunch date today and she said yeah

The problem is, I've never been on an actual date before *and* I happen to know that she hasn't either. Plus, since most of us hanging out at this point has been with our friends, the two of us haven't spent much time alone together before. *Plus* plus, it'll be the first time hanging out since I told her I was crushing on her. My mistake was doing that shit over DMs because I'm way more confident online than in person

So my question to you, /r/Advice – what can I do to make this date go well? Like I said, it's basically the first time either of us will be going on a real date. We're both really passionate about physics and we're both lighthearted and pretty goofy, but I tend to overthink things and just wanna make sure I have some small talk or something to fall back on if things get quiet at lunch.

The problem is that she self-diagnoses people in my family, so it is unclear what medical advice is coming from an actual doctor, what is coming from a naturopath, and what is coming from some mommy blogger that Dr. Google referred her to.  Then she starts implementing treatments, and it's hard to determine where she is finding them.  

She has subjected everyone in the household to a wide range of restrictive diets, has tried to chelate my autistic brother, subjects them to all kinds of extensive and unnecessary blood work, a long list of supplements, and has caused them anxiety and psychological distress by telling them repeatedly how sick they are. 

That all sounds relatively normal for a worried mom in the age of the internet, but  for years she has been telling my brothers that a virus is attacking their brains, that certain people are carriers of the virus, that certain foods inflame their brains (seems to come to this conclusion at random), and has repeatedly vouched for extreme treatments such as bone marrow transplants. 

The current thing that's happening is an autoimmune paleo diet.  No grains, no dairy, no nuts, no ""nightshade family"" (potatoes, tomatos, eggplant, etc), no beans, very very limited amounts of fruit sugars... it seems like every few days she finds another thing to add to the list.  They are miserable. 

Is there anything I can do to get my brother's out of this situation?  Any action I can take?  Myself and my adult brother are both frequently in psychological distress and I worry that this environment will inadvertently cause mental health issues for them.  Additionally, I suspect that young brothers (one special needs) are missing out on treatments and therapies that would actually help them.

171,"Hello guys.This is my story:

I am currently 20 years old.

My father was an Engineer himshelf so from an early I was kind of pushed over to taking up engineering myshelf.

From when I can remember myshelf I was never doing pretty good in school.I wasn't a bad student or anything but I was never really into school in general.In junior high I would spent most of the classes drawing and daydreaming.

I never really liked maths or science in generall too.I was very bad at it.Up until the age of 14 I didn't know the very basics.At around 15 or so I decided I should focus more and get my act together so I busted myshelf and filled the gaps I had from all the previous years.I still couldn't find any real interest in maths or physics.I always did the minimal I could to get my head around those classes.

Final exams came and I ended up scoring pretty good so I got into Mechanical Engineering.

Funny right?What was I even thinking.You always hated math but still you choose M.eng? Well in my country (and I guess everywhere else) if you manage to get good grades at the final exams everyone tells you to go either to Medical School,Law or Engineering.So I do that thinking I made a good choice.For a while I didn't really gave too much attention to my choice.2 years in and I have failed a lot of classes and cant find any real motivation to study calculus or Physics.I find them so frickin' dull.

The only option I found is to drop out and go either to a culinary school or start working in a kitchen.For the past year Ive been reading about cooking and making recipes etc.I even try to make my own.I know that cooking in a restaurant is way different than cooking in your own house and that the job is hard.But I can see myshelf investing 12 hours a day in a kitchen learning new skills and slowly progressing that spending 12 hours a day studying calculus and thermodynamics.

When I told my sister about what I was thinking she told me that she felt this way about Architecture for the first 2-3 year but eventually she loved it.She also told me that I may be looking for an easy way out because I am too bored to study.That's not really the case.Im looking for something that will make me motivated and wanting to learn more.As of now cooking is the only thing I found.My other friend told me that I may regret it in the future.

What do I even do? For the last weeks I feel so down and unmotivated about everything. I know that I pretty much answer some of my questions but I need to get these thoughts off my chest.

While she doesn't like her job, she has had no success applying elsewhere and feels trapped, especially because we're doing pretty badly financially right now. Last week, someone stole her keys while she working. Given the circumstances, it appears that it was one of her coworkers, who is notorious for lying, stealing from the bar, and spreading enough rumors to get my mom threatened by a customer.

 

My mother went through her manager and boss, pleading with them to look at the tapes and at least figure out who it was if not the coworker, but they sort of just brushed it off and didn't. In the mean time, she's searched everywhere and has been terrified at the thought of someone breaking in. Now that they finally went to look at the tapes, it turns out that they waited too long and the memory has been erased. So, there's no real way of knowing what happened, and no evidence even if it was the coworker. We have to replace the car keys, which she was told would cost $750 and get new locks on the house. Overall, she's estimated that it will be $1,500. Honestly, we don't have that money. Right now we're even living with no fridge because ours is broken and we've been saving up for a replacement.

175,"
Two of my friends, both of whom I deep down want to have in my wedding, I am skeptical about asking because of how our relationships have transpired the last several years.

These two friends (Ron and John), including myself, were the best of friends for probably around 5 years; and I still have a lot of love and compassion for both.

Within the last 4-5 years we have slowly grown apart, taking somewhat different directions in life and moving around an hour away from each other.

Here are the problems:

Ron, I am convinced had a bit of a mental breakdown about 7 years ago due to some relationship problems with leaving his spouse that he has still not gotten over; on top of his  mental illness, Ron is also periodically so physically ill that he claims he cannot leave his home when we plan times to hang out.

Me and John tried to be there for him as best as we could since the time of his breakdown, but Ron commonly, without provocation, became hostile and would take jabs at me and John, pointing out our flaws and shortcomings; I am assuming to make himself feel better.

This went on episodically for years after the breakdown, and I would periodically try to get to the bottom of what was wrong but to no avail; eventually we had a falling out when his behavior continued and I harshly emphasized how much of an asshole he had gotten to be.

We eventually moved on from the falling out, but Ron still has his moments, and 90% of the time I try to make time for us to hang out he is claims he is too physically ill to do anything, and he will almost never initiate contact first to get together.

I believe him when he says he is too ill usually, but without getting into details there have been a multitude of times where I am convinced he wont leave his home due to mental health issues he is having or simply laziness, not wanting to leave his couch. Ron does not have job either so he is always home. I truly feel bad for him.
 
On the other hand, John has a new family with a wife and kids, and he often will not answer his phone or texts when I ask to hang out or catch up 90% of the time; he is very unavailable, which I understand as he has a family, but I feel that the effort to continue our relationship on his end is super low because he never contacts me to talk or to hang out ever basically.

He has not attempted to initiate contact with me at all for a couple years, and I am always the one to contact him first, but sometimes he is available to get together, usually about 3-4 times a year.

My question is, two fold, I still have love and compassion for them; on one hand, I wonder if it is even worth putting energy into these friendships because of the lack of reciprocation, and secondly, if it is worth putting any energy into these relationships at all, is it worth placing the confidence in my unavailable friends to actually show up at my wedding and trust in them as groomsmen?",17Jan2017,2
176,"I'm sorry if this feels like a bit of a rant, but I'm rather annoyed at the events of last night and how overly familiar this friend is with me. Some background: we both started uni 3 months ago (which is when we met), both in early twenties (no financial independence). My boyfriend and I are both fairly frugal while she is a bit of a spendthrift. She likes to plan for us to do expensive activities, like sushi or eating out a lot and things like that, which I usually find some way to get out of. 

I will preface this by admitting that she isn't a horrible person or anything like that, but she has very little self awareness. 

It was her birthday yesterday, and last week she had mentioned wanting to celebrate it but no actual plans had been made. I had been wanting to spend time with my boyfriend last night, and I was tired as it was a long day of classes, and I had intended on doing some work as well. She basically told me that she'd be coming over later after dropping some stuff off at her home (she lives off campus) and that she had invited some of our other friends to join us. I know and like these people, but the fact that she expected me to host it at such short notice irked me a little. At the same time I understood that it was because I had the biggest room.

Later on she said that her boyfriend had driven down to surprise her and that he would be coming as well. Keep in mind, I had only met her boyfriend once and he was now coming to my place. We bought drinks so they would have something to drink, and while everyone else chipped in, they did not even offer to. On top of that her boyfriend stayed on his phone the whole night and made no effort to speak to the rest of us, despite the fact that we made an active effort to include him.

We also split for pizza, which her boyfriend paid for first. When I paid him back for mine and my boyfriend's share, he didn't return my change, and I was too polite to ask (keep in mind, I have to keep my expenses down as my parents are financing my studies).

After all that, they left my room in an absolute mess (crumbs everywhere, ketchup and crumbs on bedsheets, dirty plates lying around, empty cans and trash on tables). I had to do laundry at 1am. Her boyfriend also picked up the leftover bottles of Coke to take home with him. My friend asked me AFTER he took it if it was alright, which I felt was so incredibly impolite. Shouldn't they have asked BEFORE? Keep in mind she didn't ask any of our other friends if they wanted any. 

Is this just me being petty? Either way I just felt like I needed to get it out there. The money isn't that big of a deal, but the way they handled themselves and the intrusion on my time and my space was very much a problem for me. ",17Jan2017,2
177,"I had a cool job but it ended as it was a temp job and now I'm essentially applying and living at home with my folks.

I apply constantly, have interviews but nothing. I've been out of work since October and I feel like a loser and a failure.

179,"I'm 26 right now. I'm about to graduate law school with $3.5k in savings, some internships, and extensive theater experience. I hate law and want to leave it behind to pursue acting/writing full time. 

Trust me, the guilt and shame has already done a good number on me so there's not much to add there. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

A few details:
-I've never lived on my own (room w/ parents to save on rent/grad school)
-I'm absolute shit at law (constant Cs and C-s throughout school, probably because I'm not interested in it but even when I am I'm still bad at it)
-I don't like working as a lawyer (day in and day out office life is suffocating as previous internships taught me)(Plus, the hours are way too long for something you don't like, incl. weeknights, weekends)

-When law school started, I took acting classes on the side and have since become a member of a theater company, written comedy sketches for the theater's shows, and performed on a weekly basis
-I love acting, writing, producing, pretty much most things that have to do with a film set mostly 
-If there's ever a choice between working in the same office for 8 hours or working on a set nonstop to get a scene shot, I'd pick set any day


Still, the thought of leaving a stable job choice I suck at is terrifying compared to the risk of becoming a penniless actor or comedy writer. I feel like I'm doing myself a disservice to want to do something so foolish. 

I have four months till graduation to figure out whether I'm going to study for the Bar or move out to LA to give this risk a go. I've got no dependents, no prospects, no debt, and all fear. Please help me out! ",17Jan2017,1

I'm 21, I workout a lot I guess you can say I'm a bodybuilder and I'm 15 to 17 percent body fat can see abs but not quite there right now like I use to be, but fairly buff, some fat is on me. I have anxiety and for some reason didn't at this particular moment, this women who was working I'm sure though I was cute or something, probably close to my age, she was talking to my mom about something ""shoe related"" then went on to another person and has she turned around looked right at me and I was looking at her, eyes locked for a good few seconds but she even looked at me more than once, even when we walked in I think.  Me and my mom walked out and my mom says ""that girl though you were cute."" And I said "" you're probably right, I thought she was too."" So anyway flash back a few weeks, I'm having a music video filmed and we need a beautiful women to play the part, my dad asked if I know of anyone and I said not at this particular moment no I don't. Anyway I thought this girl was down right beautiful and not only do I want to probably get to know her, for some odd reason yesterday evening she popped into my head and I thought what if I went back and asked her is she would be interested in doing it for us? I just don't want to creep her out haha. I'd start the conversation with ""I was in here a few days ago or week and I saw you and thought you were pretty, I have a music video needing to be filmed for a producer in Nashville TN and would like to know if you would be interested?"" I'd say something like that, ""technically I'm acting has a talent scout I guess"" and also playing in the video, And if she said yes I give her the details on it. I want to know if y'all think it would be OK to ask her after all the business talk was done if it would be ok to get to know her has well, I don't want to come off creepy because I think she was drop dead gorgeous. Like I said I thought she was pretty, I was told to find a sexy woman for the part and I think I did, and my mom said she thinks she thought I was cute who knows?

182,"This is going to be a long one so bear with me. I live in Southern California.

My husband and I moved into this guy's, we will call him ""frank"", garage in june 2016. There was no written contract or anything it was all verbal. We agreed on $650 a month for rent and $30 for utilities. So about $680 a month. We were renting a room and the people we were renting from weren't able to renew thier lease so we were desperate and jumped on the first thing we could get. 

We went to go see the place and Frank had converted his garage into 2 separate rooms. Our room has a shower and a toilet in it and nothing else. Theres a sink outsided on the side of the garage. Like I said we were desperate so we took it. Moved in the same day we gave him the money for the rent. Everything is fine, the place is falling apart but we really didn't think too much of it. 

Fast forward to July frank comes for rent and utilities. He says the utilities will be 50$ for the month. Okay maybe it's a little higher than expected so we give him rent + the $50 for utilities. Don't think anything of it.

Come August frank comes for rent and this time he wants $80 for utilities, we start getting annoyed with the sink, there's no hot water running to it and it's all torn apart so every time we use it water splashes everywhere. We asked him if he could fix it. He says yes, asks for the rent and utilities again so we give it to him (we didn't want to start any problems). He didn't get it fixed for 2 months and to this day it still has no hot water to it. 

September comes around he wants rent + $100 dollars for utilities. We pay. Like idiots.

During this time he also has all his friends living in the actual house for free. So we assume that's why he keeps charging us more and more for utilities every month.

October comes around then rent + $120 for utilities. At this point we tell him no. We aren't going to keep paying whatever he asks. We told him that it's getting really cold now as well and we never noticed the window was missing the sliding part to close it since we moved in during summer so it was always really hot and we never thought to close the window. We tell him we are holding onto 150$ of the rent this time and only give him $500 since last time he took so long to to fix the sink we are going to keep the money until he fixes the window. And that we aren't going to pay the utilities anymore until he shows us some sort of meter or something that proves that we are the reason his utilities are going up and not the frieds he has living there for free. So he ends up half ass fixing the window still leaving gaps and stuff around the window around november. 

November comes around we pay him $550 since the window still isn't done. We are still holding the utilities. (Which now he wants $200 for)

We have been looking for a place to move to since October. We payed December's rent and called code enforcement and have been holding onto January's rent due to him not fixing anything and constantly rating our payments. Code enforcement came finally on Monday 1/16/17 and basically told us everything he is doing is illigal and that we should hold onto our money untill he evicts us because the place we live is unhabitable and it's illigal to be charging us for utilities without a meter or even be renting the garage out in general. They are going to force him to evict us and he is going to have to tear down the garage and restore it to its original state...

My husband wants to sue frank and I want to know what steps we should take. We have been looking at the housing laws and he is breaking literally ALL of them. 

Are we going about this the right way? What else should we do and where do we start? We have never been through this before. We are trying to move out but haven't been able to find anything. What steps should we take now? If you need any more information or have any questions please ask and I will answer as best I can. TIA

184,"Like most people out of college, finding employment without much experience was difficult.  I finally found a bottom level position in an accounting office, as an internal audit clerk.  Using this as a stepping stone to hopefully move up in the office if something opened up.  
Near the end of the summer a position opened up in the office and I applied.  I didn't get the job.  I sat down with the accounting manager and she explained that it was because I could not slide into the position as easily as someone else.  I took this to mean that she did not want to have to train me in a new position, as well as train someone to replace me.  
At this point I decided it was time I start looking elsewhere, clearly I made myself to valuable in my position, and she wouldn't willingly hire someone to replace me so I could move up. It has been 4 months and there has been nothing.  There have been very few job postings, and not a single interview.

193,"Let me give a little background story:
Basically, I'm 19 fresh out of High School waiting to be drafted in March (In my country everybody gets drafted to the army after School for around 3 years). since I'm being drafted in around two months I am staying with my parents (Which might seem strange to some American people reading this but it is fairly common in my country and others outside the US too.) anyways, lately my parents and I have been having more and more fights about the fact that I basically don't really do much and just stay at home all day. I do go the gym during morning time and run during in the evenings but other than that I mostly stay at home, all my other activities such as playing guitar, video games, books and such are done at home.

I want to find ways to get out of the house to kind of get back at my parents, although they are in fact right with their accusations, the way they tell me is not very nice/thoughtful. To get back at them I want to be out of the house in the mornings, come back for lunch, then leave again, only to come back at night time. Go for a run, have some late dinner by myself and then directly to bed.
 
So basically, I need to find activities that will fill my day up so I can stay out of the house all day long. 
 
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WORK:  two months back I worked for a little bit and I would work again but unfortunately it seems that I cannot find any workplace that would accept me as a worker for only two months.

I switch interests every week to 1 month. For example, one week, I may be interested in becoming a Biologist, the next, I'm a fervourous follower of Islam. It constantly changes like this, I have followed every religion, every, moral philosophy, wanted to have every profession, and every hobby under the sun at some point in my life. I had hoped it would get better as I matured, but I am more mature now, and nothing has changed. I realise this has to stop, I have to settle on something.

 A year ago, this 'interest' of mine was Buddhism, and lasted about two months, one of my longer interests. I chose this 'subject' as what I wanted to settle on, because it was the only subject which really made me a nicer, more compassionate person, while also helping me give up my addictions that I had at the time. Meditation is one of the few things that truly relieves me of my stress, and practising the Buddha's teachings has changed me from some one who pretends to be kind to someone who is honestly kind. 

But I know if I pick it back up now, it won't last. Not unless I have some kind of technique or method. Sorry if this is nonsense, or too long-winded. There really is no other way I can explain it. Can anyone give me any tips, or advice to help me 'stay' in Buddhism for good?

She even broke into the house once when I was there and she didn't realize it...(she knew where the spare key was...), stole some of his shirts and socks, and then contacted him a couple weeks later on snapchat saying she 'found' some of his things and asked to have him pick them up and when he blocked her she messaged him on Pinterest. I went with him after we had a date for him to pick them up from her apartment and waited in the car, he was gone 5 minutes. She later tweeted that they had sex, which was par for the course. This was back in May/June and she's been blocked entirely since then with zero contact.

In response to her antics we have never responded, and generally don't tell anyone about it. We sort of just keep tabs on it while simultaneously ignoring her and writing her off as crazy. 

While we told his mom SOME things, and she was aware because she caught her stalking him several times in the past after they had broke up (when they were out shopping), we haven't unleashed the knitty gritty, and didn't mention that she broke in (at the time we were staying with his mom, she needed help financially). I only recently told my mom about what was going on, and she is very worried now and wants us to get a restraining order, but we've been hoping she would get a fucking life by now and move on...

So, his Aunt is kind of the family matriarch. And did something very dumb yesterday. My bf and his mom had been cleaning out her house and garage which she had lived in for 12 years and was basically my bfs storage, and they found some of her stuff she had left there 5 years ago. His Aunt insisted on returning it to her personally, since he refused to do it. She is completely unaware of the stalking and harassment that's been going on for the past year. 

And of course, his ex is bragging about talking shit with her on Twitter, such a class act. 

There are a lot of things she's done over the past year, and she continues to do so...we sat down and made a somewhat chronological list of what she's done. It's a long list. She was also emotionally abusive towards him during the relationship, attempted to throw a knife at him during an argument once, and threw their cat off a second story balcony after they broke up to get his attention, then refused to give him his cat...

So, we're sort of at a crossroads, because we did decide that, obviously, his Aunt needs to be aware that what she did was not just crossing the normal ""don't be friends with your nephews ex and invite her over because it's none of your business and that's shitty"" line and more along the lines of ""if you were even slightly aware of the situation you'd be disowned right now"". 

But a big part of me just wants to continue ignoring the whole thing, because it's worked okay so far. Maybe. 

Oh, and I should mention, we have AMPLE receipts. So, that's not an issue.

tldr; My boyfriend's ex has been stalking us on and offline for a year, his Aunt, unaware of the situation, invited her over yesterday to hangout and return some of her old belongings that were found in their storage.

What do you think we should do? Should we send the list of dirty deeds or keep ignoring it and see what happens?",17Jan2017,1

228,"I need help with my Dad. Ever since I was little, I've been closer to him than my mom. She resents us both for it, but there wasn't a way to change how I felt. He is my hero, the guy who knows everything. 

Well, my senior year in high school, during the first semester, my parents fights peaked in their extremity and he left. Dad moved into my grandmother's house just a few miles away, and mom stayed home. While there, he went to therapy (a major milestone for him, considering his reluctance to do so for years). This lasted a month or so, and he came back. Things were good, then bad, and he left yet again, this time saying that he'd only come back if my mom went to therapy.  She finally agreed, and went twice, with promises to go more, and he came home. (She didn't go more) 

They both went to marital therapy for a time, and although things were strained they seemed better. The negative energy in my house stems from my mother, and my father put up with it for years on end. She gets meaner with age, and he gets softer, wanting to garden and raise livestock as a way to bring life into the world. 

Things are getting bad again, but in a different way. Whenever my mom wears on my dad he drinks (only when she's at work because only she's allowed to drink at the house). His drinking was never a problem to us - his children - because he just became extra loving with alcohol. (Hugs, movies to watch, serious talks about how much we mean to him). As of late, he seems less and less happy. My mom and sister went on a weekend trip and he drank, as expected, and when he did he said some terrible things to my brother and I. Personal insults to me, which offended me deeply, and secrets to my brother. The event embarrassed Dad, who told me he only remembered about 15% of that night, and it has changed how I feel about him. 

Now whenever he drinks I get irritated, and when he senses my irritation he tells me I'm like my mother, and I'm never on his side anymore. I have tried talking with him, which made things better up until his next drink, and I don't know what to do. I hate feeling any sort of negativity towards him, and I'm terrified he just may give up on life. His health isn't the best, and he may actually die if he doesn't get happier. 

I'm worried that my frustration with his drinking habits may be unfair to him. He doesn't seem to want to listen to me, and today I told him I felt he didn't like me, the feeling had been growing with his continued insistences that I am like my mother. He expressed that what I said was the most hurtful thing he had ever heard, and left. What can I do to help him? How can I get over how upset he made me feel when he insulted me while drunk?

230,"My boyfriend of 2 years and i took a break because hes an alcoholic and it was taking a tole on our relationship, constantly being ditches because he drank, lying about it, messaging other girls when he was drunk.

231,"Sorry - this is muddled. I'm not a good writer. 

I have a good, well paying job.  A wife who loves me.  I’m comfortable and have anything I could wish for….

Yet I am really struggling to get through the days. Over the last year or so I have built up routines that I do every day / week / month.  If I don’t do them I am starting to get quite upset.  But without those markers I’m just ghosting through life.  Weekends are the worst when mid-day I realize there is literally nothing I “want” to do after I have done all the routine things (clean house, run etc…).  I don’t have anyone right now I would call a friend outside my wife.  They seem to have evaporated years ago. Not that I blame them. 

Over the last three or four years I’ve “accomplished” a lot.  Lost 90lbs, quit smoking etc… but I don’t give a shit about those things.  I miss who I was.  I miss not caring about not smoking and eating right and going to the gym and all the shit people praise me for.  I could die tomorrow and have left nothing of value.  Worse, I could die in 50 years and have left the same.  

I’m a systems admin / developer. I make quite a bit of money.  I can’t just quit and try something else.   And I’m so tired by the end of the work day that a side project seems unimaginable.    I feel guilty feeling this way because its not like the work I do is difficult or problematic or anything.  People here generally seem happy with me.  Its not like I have savings anyways since I have a habit of buying shit I don’t need.

What do I do?  Am I depressed?  I tried to commit around 15 years ago, but that depression was simpler.  I just felt sad and never left my room etc… This is different.  I just don’t see any way out.

232,"The past 4 days i have been experiencing a bit internet problem. I have been using a ethernet cable the past year to help get better internet on FPS like Overwatch and Counterstrike to name a few. My Ping was low and I have never lagged since I made the switch. Because I am far away from the internet adapter in my house i have a £100 wireless adapter plugged into the wall that I plug my ethernet cable into.

Recently though I have been getting weird lag spikes. The easiest way to describe it is, I Play for 5-10 mins and then my ping shoots up and all my team mates stand still or float in the air. This happens for 5 seconds, then resumes, but to normal. The worst bit is when you are in a heli on Day Z and you just dsync all over the place.

236,"There's a guy in my neighborhood that I think might be a serial killer or might want to kill me. He's young though. In his early 20's if I had to guess. He always has this blank stare like he's a million miles away, but still terrifying.

The last time I saw him he had bruises all over his face. At least I think they were bruises. Maybe not though. They were very weirdly shaped - not straight - like maybe he accidentally stepped on a rake - but slightly curved. Maybe from a belt? Also the coloring is very light, like bags under eyes color.

If I had to guess I would say he probly gets abused on the reg. I think he lives with his alcoholic uncle.

And this face coloring is just the latest of several exponentially creepy transformations I have witnessed from him since I moved to this neighborhood.

First, if I cross paths with him (I'll call him Jeremy) while I'm walking my dog, he won't look at me or say anything to me. He'll just start petting my dog. For an unsettling amount of time. I'll try to make small talk, he responds to nothing, but just keeps looking at my dog, right in the eyes as he pets him. This has happened 3 times so far. He has never said anything to me, looked at me, or made eye contact.

Second, he had this haircut for a while that looked like he had done himself. It was shaved in most places, but there were a few splotches of hair and a big section on the back. Like he walked around like this for a few months. I think the last time I saw him he had cleaned it up. But he was walking away from the direction of my house as I was pulling up to it.

Third, I just get a bad feeling about him. Like maybe he was dealt a really shitty hand, and wants to get revenge. Everytime I see him, even if he doesn't see me - I get chills.

I don't know what to do about it. I don't even know his name, but I could figure out his address if I had to.

And, in case you're thinking I'm a woman or small person, I'm not. I'm fairly large and intimidating, even though I try very hard to not be intimidating. I always try to say something goofy if I can sense someone is frightened by me. I used to live in bad areas of rough cities. I have been screamed at by crazy homeless people a few feet away from me, I have been on subway trains with a gang of loud and rowdy youths. I have nearly been mugged multiple times, but have never been scared of someone like this.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? 

I'm thinking about hiring a PI to get some information on him, just so I can know if he is dangerous or not, but they're pretty expensive.

Any ideas?",17Jan2017,2
237,"I am sorry for the rambling.
Before I start I should get into a bit of a background about myself. I am currently 25 years old and I have been a student at a post secondary institution for the past eight years. I have always studied hard and I never really went out. My family started acting very bitter towards me because school costs a lot of money and I would spend every waking hour outside of school working a number of part time jobs. This really started to bother me. I began to hate myself because of the things that they would say to me. Basically, I wanted to die. I thought that these feelings were caused by my job. So I decided to work a lot less and maybe things could go back to the way that they once were. When this happened I initially would spend some time with my family but then I wanted to give myself more alone time to do some of the things that I love. Like playing video games, and reading books. They would come up into my room and start yelling at me. I started to get very angry. I would spend more and more time secluded in my room. When I came out, if I came out the conversations that I had were minimal. They started to become more aggressive towards me. Now I am not the type of person who is able to defend myself from the ones I love very easily. I would let them win every argument and retreat back to the safety of my room. I guess this lead to the big moment where everything went downhill. While I was at work one night, they decided among themselves to go through my room and clean it. I guess they thought that it was a nice gesture from their side, but to me I felt betrayed. It was the only place where I felt safe in the whole world and now it was violated. I came home and started screaming at them. I wanted nothing to do with them. They screamed back at me and escalated the situation. These incidents increased in frequency and went from occurring every other week to every other day. This got to the point where I needed to set aside time and get professional help from a psychologist. He prescribed me with some antidepressants and diagnosed me with a severe case of depression. After that I went to counselling every single week for a year, and all the good that came of it was instantly removed the minute I came back home. Except this time because of the drugs I couldn't feel anything anymore. There was no emotion or care. I couldn't live like that, so I talked to my doctor and we slowly went off the medication and were trying to approach more different types of therapy. For a while things seemed to stay the same. School was going great for me, I finally found myself doing something that I loved and was very passionate about. I would spend extra hours doing the things that I love. My therapist encouraged it. Because I was so happy I met someone. I instantly fell in love. I would spend as much of my time as I could with her, because she made me happy. Anyways one day I start talking to my family about graduation. My parents want me to become a Lawyer. I just want to graduate and have a break from school and do what I love. I tell them my feelings and they get angry with me. The feelings of sadness return in full effect. I spend more time with my girlfriend and even went away on trips with her for weeks at a time. I have never traveled before, but going on a road-trip with her was a dream come true. But eventually I did have to come back. I want to move in with my girlfriend but I can't until I have enough money to pay for some of the rent. However that is incredibly difficult to do because I also have to pay for school. Now I will occasionally spend one or two nights at my girlfriends house then the rest I spend at home. However, when I have to come home I make sure I don't come back until everyone else is asleep. My mom stayed up one night. She confronted me with a speech about how I shouldn't be spending so much time away from home and how I am the most selfish human being in the whole world. She made a comment that I was basically paying for everything in my girlfriends life and how she is using me. I cried for a whole day. Then I didn't come home for two days. I contacted my girlfriend and told her everything. She started inviting me over more. My mom called me and told me that if I didn't come home she would call the police. So against my better judgement I went back home. My Mom got mad at me again for spending no time with her or the family. She told me that she knows a lot more about the world and that I should be around more often. She also told me that my girlfriend is controlling me. The time that I spend with her makes me overjoyed, whereas the time spent at home makes me despair.

Is it wrong for me to pursue what makes me happy? or am I being selfish? ",17Jan2017,1

249,"TL;DR- I need a new job that pays decent (mid-level) but I am not sure which job titles I should be looking and applying for based on my past duties.  Plus, I hate my current job in a customer service based field.

Throw-away account for reasons.  So I had a great job.  For five years I worked at a small company specializing in legal support services.  I started off with this company in an entry level position and eventually I ended up as supervisor in remote operations. I basically ran a few small offices (2 -7) employees in a four cities across the US.  I loved my job, the company and my team.  Aside from supervising the everyday operations of each office (ordering supplies, maintaining equipment, reassigning work to make sure everything got completed in a timely manner), I was also able to travel to each office to provide training, hire, and open new offices as the business expanded.  In addition to that, my management team was supportive and seemed interested in helping me grow in my role.  

So why did I leave?  Well, the office in my city closed and I was asked to move to a new city.  I felt my pay wasn't good enough for me to justify being uprooted from a place I love to a new city where I don't have friends or family.  Also, because the pay wasn't that great, I had always worked a second part time job that I didn't t like very much, but provided me with awesome benefits like free health insurance and money towards my education.  Because my full-time job was so laid back and enjoyable, I  was able to balance working a full-time and part-time job without too much effort. 

After I closed down the office in my city, I was able to find a job working in the insurance industry.  I thought it would be great.  It is not, I really hate it.  At first I thought I would get used to my new role and once I became more proficient at my new tasks, I would be fine.  It has been four months and at this point I dread going to work everyday.  Not to mention that I am having to work 12 hour days several times a week.   Although there are now more opportunities for growth at my new job, I am still getting paid around what I used to at my previous job.  And I am salaried, so I don't get paid for all those 12 hour days I put in.  Also, I hate the public.  I am on the phone all day and it stresses me out when I am trying to help someone and they are just plain nasty for no reason.  I don't think I'm cut-out for  customer service work, I enjoy a smaller team with more project based responsibilities.

At this point, I have decided I should probably look for a new job but I don't even know what to apply for based on my past job experiences.  Also, I am still in school part-time completing a BA in Political Science (will be done by the end of 2017).  

Does anyone have any suggestions for me?  What are some mid level positions that I could apply for that might be similar to my first job?  What job titles should I look for?  Please help!

So I'm a 16 y/o boy and I have dabbled with drugs as much as any teenager has, but about a year ago my family found out I smoked weed. they absolutly lost their shit and sent me to counciling and thought I was addicted (Yeah, they're really anti drugs) my mum was constantly crying for weeks and I really y broke her heart by doing that. I never want to go through that again and cause my parents that much pain again ever.  

fast forward to about a month ago. I'm smoking weed again however I'm doing it more incognito and making an effort to hide it. I buy some acid off the deep Web and arrogantly post it on my snapchat story. about 5 minuets later an old friend hits me up asking if I can get him some drugs off the deep Web.   I agree as I think I'm very soft and don't like letting people down or how to say no. I buy him 100 xanax pills and a pot brownie and sent it to his p.o. box. this continues every week with him giving me cash, me putting it in the bank, buying bitcoins, buying hi. 100 xanax pills for him to sell. 
I occasionally orders weed twice while this was happening and I had it ordered to his po box and he considered this his payment to me as I was making no money off this xanax buying. 

now he wants me to buy him coke and as I do think have a vpn all i can see is this increasing the likelihood of me getting caught. as I deeply broke my parents heart with abit of weed, I can't even think what would happen if they knew I was ordering coke. 

how can I tell my friend no? what excuses can i use to tell him I don't want to order for him any more?
