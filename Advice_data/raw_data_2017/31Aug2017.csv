0,"Ok team. Help me relax a bit, and teach me your wisdom

So, I am a junior at a good research university. 
Majoring in cognitive psychology, with 2 language certificates.
I have 3 years of solid lab experience at biology labs, as well as internship experience for clinical work, and cancer research at a well-known research hospital. I currently work as a policy researcher for my university (looks good on a resume, pay is shit.) and am very involved in my university's climate activism group. I have presented for them at divestment committee, along with talks about diversity in student groups.
I have also presented my labs bio-psych research at undergraduate conferences.

My gpa and GRE scores are competitive as well.

I come to you because, well. The title. 
I was so sure I wanted to continue on to graduate school for my Ph.D. in Cognitive neuroscience, but I am worried about the cripplingly low stipend, especially since I am financially independent. 
To make this rambling mess down to key questions:


1. Should I go to graduate school, even if the pay is shit for 5 years?


2. With my experience and degree, would I have any shot working as a data analyst for someone like the EPA, or NRDC, or any other environmental non-profit


3. Should I graduate early, or stay in, and finish a minor in environmental policy?


4. (not a question) but open to any suggestions.


Thanks for listening to me panic.",31Aug2017,3

5,"I don't want to make this too obvious as idk what subs he browses, so I cant go into huge details
A few days ago I posted a picture of myself on Reddit (roastme) and a guy PMd me asking if i was ok and if i received any creepy PMs cos i put my face out there (I'm a girl). I thought this was pretty nice of him, we had a conversation for a while and he seemed like a good guy.

We've continued to speak for the past few days, and idk why but something about him is confusing me. For a start, he appears to have really similar interests to me. Whenever he asks me what I'm into hobbywise, his are really similar. He asked me what kind of things I think about, he said his are the same. We have a very similar music taste. I'm really into a certain cause, he tells me he is too. He always says its great we're so similar, and I did first but now I'm thinking its a bit strange? Maybe I'm paranoid or something but is this not a bit weird somehow? Its like he's mirroring me or something. It could be a complete coincidence but its a undeniably a bit odd.

I remember at some point he said he suffered PTSD from an accident of some kind and he lost most of his memories but this hasnt been mentioned since. At some point he mentioned his girlfriend is a pornstar. Both of these big things have been casually dropped into conversation and never mentioned again. We live in different countries, and he said he's sending something to a country near mine, and asked if I wanted anything. Again, very kind but...is this a bit forward? I don't actually know him, I know him as a Reddit presence.

He also replies IMMEDIATELY. Whatever time of day I message, his response is straight away. Idk if this is weird or not, but anyone else I've ever messaged isnt this fast.

He asked for my social media, I gave him my instagram and fb links. He followed me on ig, I requested to follow back and havent been accepted yet. I noticed he has 1 follower. He added me on fb, I made a mental note to accept it later when I was at home on my laptop (because my phone is v temperemental) but he seems to have removed the request as I now can't see it anywhere.

Not really sure what I'm asking for here but is this weird or am I some sort of paranoid weirdo for thinking its weird? If he is acting odd then I don't even have a reason for why he would be. I do like talking to him and he's interesting but idk..something seems strange somehow. Am I being over the top or would this weird you out a bit too? Or am I just being dramatic, its only reddit after all, I can just stop talking if I'm uncomfortable. But then I'd feel bad. Ah I don't know!!! This is my dilemma lol. Any input is appreciated",31Aug2017,25
6,"When I had my daughter I was in a great spot. I was working from home and making pretty great money. Her dad and I have always gotten along great despite not continuing a romantic relationship. 

Fast forward a year and a half, I lose my job. Ok fine, I'll find another... in the meantime, my sister passes. After several months of unemployment and alot of grief, I do. Its not as much as I made before. However, its something to me. I figure I will apply for state assistance to help with daycare payments (as I now have to commute to work). I can't. I don't qualify. I make a total of $16 above the threshold per month. I also cannot afford to pay a minimum of $254/wk for full time care. I live in Illinois. 

My daughter's father pays me $400/mo in child support which I am very grateful for. I can use that for daycare. However, I now have to pocket out the rest, and 2x the diapers, 2x milk (my daughter cannot tummy whole milk so shes still on toddler formula), and 2x the baby wipes.

I literally do not know what to do. I am stressed beyond belief and my eyes are dry from crying. To make matters worse, I called my mom for advice (whom I support financially but cannot add to my childcare application because she receives SSI) and she has threatened to call dcfs on me if I do not find appropriate childcare within a week, as I'm an unfit mother to her (and given the circumstances she is probably right). She thinks my daughter should live with her instead. 

I already considered everything from quitting my job, to letting them repo my car(and ruining my credit but then I can't get to work. I live in the suburbs) and taking up a second job. I attend school at night so I would not know how I could squeeze in a second job but I could try to. 

Does anyone have any advice? Have you been in a similar situation?
There has to be light at the end of the tunnel. I am just trying to find hope. 
I cannot see myself giving my daughter up to my mom and I cannot see myself quitting my job with no idea how to continue providing for her. I have had so much anxiety over this that I am feeling that I cannot go on. ",31Aug2017,7

10,"Ok simple story, was helping in work with new starters person who I was helping is either dense as no ones business or honestly lazy but regardless they made off comments to a co-worker later that I might be sexist as I wasn't acting that way with the ""men"".

To elaborate further on this I got a bit curt because after 15 minutes of standing over someone stating the obvious of pc use, ""click this, click that"" etc, and them blatantly ignoring me and the set procedures / gudiance. This was brought up in an informal manner and outside the guidelines for our business so baseless accusations can't stick but it has the potential to go further. I'm covered by pretty much every female in my section that I'm not what shes claimed but I'd still like to take precautions but I don't know what steps to take outside of a physical log.

In summary got accused of being sexist as an off remark, it won't / shouldn't stick as I'm backed up by manger / other staff but want to take steps in case this person trys to take it further and harder just to cover their own incompetance.

12,"I work in a large company but in a small, almost unrelated project. It's very technical quality assurance equipment but falls under the umbrella of sales, so the sales manager boss is overseeing the project.

The project is generally comprised of two individuals (with admin and customer service in the background), one who is back at 'homebase', building spare parts or doing R&amp;D, and one traveling putting on seminars/training and calibrating equipment in the field, on the road 60% of the time. I am the latter and am looking to move into the former - more of a role at home.

I have mostly overseen decisions and moves made by the project for the past year. My boss approves items/expenses as needed and justified.

The project traditionally has not been hugely successful (~450,000 per year, divided by expenses, travel, labor - not a profitable business), though there is some potential on the horizon as a major customer base will open up in another market, potentially tripling our annual revenue.

The individual doing R&amp;D is retiring at the end of the year. The plan all along has been to hire another individual to replace my duty in the field. I was on board with this as I would support him/her remotely while caretaking the business, which would be a massive relief as I currently do it all and sometimes from thousands of miles away.

However, my boss called me with a thought out of the blue. He questioned whether an unrelated company would be interested in taking care of the field work (only equipment calibration, not training, installs, etc.), while I am just managing things from home. This took me by surprise, first because the field work on the whole wouldn't make much money, and also because this would leave an incredible burden on my at home. I'd be managing 40+ customers, performing R&amp;D, building equipment, managing inventory, troubleshooting, etc.. This is in addition to any field work that can't be done by the third party. As it stands, there's a major learning curve I have for the role I'd be going into.

I already am highly stressed and working 80 hour weeks. I think my boss thinks with the majority of the field work done, I'll be fine to take on the remainder, but I will only see myself being unable to leave or be away from my phone, being the only technical person available should issue arise. Because of this, I anticipate that I'll succumb to the stress and find another job, which I would not like because I love this one so much and would be leaving my customers on an island, many of whom I've built relationships with.

My inclination is to tell my boss just that - that if they don't hire another person, I'll likely quit in the future. I feel like this is the most forthright thing to do and will mitigate the decision later if it does come to that. But I've heard you should never tell your boss something like that, as they will look to replace you. Should I not tell my boss my concerns? Or should I be forthcoming? Thanks in advance.

TL;DR Boss doesn't want to hire replacement, I'll quit if he doesn't, do I tell him that?",31Aug2017,1
13,"Basically I don't have a personal twitter or Instagram.. Facebook? Sure but I think it's past its prime for most of us younger people. I have what I would call ghost accounts.

It's just like you have to fake things to simply fit in.

  I'm not acting like its *everything* but I'm positive being connected on social media builds better relationships. It's fucking ridiculous that I'm even contemplating something like this but it's the truth. I don't know.. I'd love to hear what anyone else has to say.

She wants to get herself better before she can be my girlfriend.

She doesn't think it's fair for me to be with her right now if she can't give 100% that she knows she can give me. She also thinks that we should try with other people. Reason behind it is b/c I'm 21 and she was my 1st and only girl I had sex with and the fact that I want to committed already with her thinks that I might just get tired of her. As well as in her situation, we started talking not even a month after she broke up with her ex. She hasn't experienced anyone besides me. She doesn't want to talk to anyone and she knows I don't either, but the main thing is that she wants to better herself so she can give me more and to give me the amount of love she knows she can give me with time. It breaks my heart cause I really love this girl and she told me as well that she loves me.

25,"Title says all.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I made the account for school a while ago, and then I never used it since. I completely forgot it existed until I went to ""have I been pwned"" and OH NO I GOT PWNED on that same account I had forgotten about.

At least 70 million records were compromised and posted on the web, mine included.

I have just contacted support and asked for the account to be deactivated. The site was set up in such a way that I could not deactivate it by myself. The support team has to deactivate it.

I do not know what else could have been compromised, but I know that at least my email address and real name associated with the account (first and last) was compromised and made freely available. The password was also compromised, but it was so weak as of to be a joke. It would have been breached anyways. I have since changed to much stronger passwords on other sites (including Reddit), so the fear of ""same passwords on other site"" is gone.

Given that this is now known, what would you suggest I do?",31Aug2017,1
26,"First Reddit post. I just feel so lost and emotional and feel like I have no one to turn to so here it goes. PS I am so so sorry if this is long. 

**To sum up events leading up to now:** In a serious relationship for 6 years. Introduced him to my whole family (who by the way, live halfway around the world). Been dating since first month of college. He was my first everything. He was also going to propose and was coming home with me in December to get parents’ approval. After college life took us to two different cities. Hardly saw each other. It was stressful, but still felt love. 

My degree is in business, specializing in marketing. My first job out of college was unrelated. It was with a fortune 200 retailer that had a very stuffy/archaic way of doing things. I hated my stressful old job. It was 100% in the numbers. I feel like I'm both left brained and right brained, but longed for a more creative or social career.  

In the long run, I aspire to be a novelist. I’ve been taking this hobby very seriously, and in a year and a half am 70% complete with my first draft. Sometimes, I find my head is in my book a lot because that is where my whole passion lies and that is something I have discovered I am good at. 

I hated the state I lived in, so my friend and I moved half way across the country. 

So, **I moved here** to the new (expensive) state on my savings without a job. I knew it would be hard getting a job I wanted because my post-college 2 years of working were far from marketing with hardly any transferable skills, and my old company culturally was different from a start-up. 

In the meantime, a series of unfortunate events started happening, from getting a ridiculous $600 traffic ticket to mushrooms growing in my bathroom. 

My boyfriend came to visit. We got along so well. But it still **felt odd romance-wise**, we hardly had sex.

After he left, **I started a new job** as a marketing coordinator for a small startup. I took a **$10,000 pay cut** for this role, it was hard, especially because I didn’t budget a pay cut that high, but it would be worth it because I would gain the knowledge and experience I wanted. I really liked it! My boss assigned a variety of tasks to me and I liked them all. He mentioned working for a startup meant being flexible about your job description changing, and I was flexible because I loved trying new aspects of marketing.

2 weeks ago I got drunk and called my bf to tell him I love him so much but the lack of a sex life for the past two years is not ok. Fast forward a week, we have a talk (via text). He said we should take a break. I felt very sad the whole week. So, the next Sunday I texted him. He continued only talking to me over text and said he had been saying “I love you” out of habit and **didn’t want a future with me**. He was also very cold and short answered in his texts (no call). I never saw that coming and I felt **completely devastated**, as if our whole 6 years meant nothing, while I still loved him. But I told myself at least I finally had I job I liked. 

**This Monday:** Presentation with boss goes badly because misunderstood I misunderstood a prior request. I said I would redeem the mis-communication. 

**Tuesday:** Calls me in and says he has a completely new role for me. Not a new task, but entirely *new role*. **“Content operations management”** - based on process management and hitting number-optimization targets. “Oh no” I thought when he was talking. I felt like I was losing control of my life: first money, then boyfriend, then my apartment (long irrelevant story), then my will/emotions, then my job! 

I hadn’t told my boss that I had just ended a 6 yr relationship because I didn’t want to sound like I was making an excuse, although my roommate recommended I tell him because I had been seeming “loopy” to her. 

For some reason (heightened emotional state, or ptsd from last job I hated) it just felt crushing when my boss was talking about the new role. He thought I would be the best fit for this based on what he saw. It must’ve shown on my face that I was not happy about it. I expressed that it would be ‘exciting to try something new, but I really enjoyed doing something creative’. He said maybe that would be down the line. 

After I left the meeting, I realized the person I would’ve normally spoken to about it was my (ex)boyfriend. The rest of the day I kept on playing this tape player in my head that my life was going to shit and how sad I was that my boyfriend cut me out and now I was losing the job I wanted and I was going to be miserable again with my job and now I had less money. So I didn’t get a lot done, and to be honest, I felt very bitter that my boss was completely changing the role when I had taken a pay cut to be in marketing. 

**Wednesday:** He gives me my main priority of the day and that we would me sometime in the afternoon to meet about it. He had mentioned to me the week before that I was too formal (coming from a big corp) and that I didn’t have to come with something prepared to present when we met. 

I spent the morning not doing the priority, but something else, partly because I was still bitter, partly because I had gotten really into the other task, and also partly because I thought I had the whole day to focus on the priority. When we met at 3 I didn’t have as much of the priority done as I wanted, but I didn’t think it would be a problem because I still had 2 hours of the work day left and he had told me last week he didn’t want anything formal. I’d still felt distracted and sad about my boyfriend. 

IN the meeting, **boss wasn’t happy** with what I had to show him. I’ve only been **at my job for a month and a half**. It brought the first hard conversation.  

He said he felt like I was unhappy when he talked to me about the job change. I then apologized and said I had been initially unhappy because I was worried to see the marketing coordinator role totally out and I had really loved it.

He admitted I was innately creative, but he felt it was creative-artsy vs the creative marketing way. Though he thought that was something I could improve on, he found someone when hiring for a different role who would be better for it and since were a startup, **why waste time teaching me when he could put me on something I had more experience with** (the analytical stuff he now wants me to do vs the marketing stuff)?

In his eyes I wasn’t currently fit for the marketing stuff and this new role would be my main role go forward. He said **he needs to know whether or not I would love it**.

I then decided to tell him about my personal life outside of work, I thought he should know in case it had been playing a factor. I also told him I was sad to hear that doing the stuff I wanted wasn’t an option because there was no room to improve at the startup. And I was unsure if I’d love my new role, but I would let him know in two days.

**It sounds like if I don’t love it, I won’t have a job. But I took a $10,000 pay-cut for this, and if I have to job search again, I don’t know how to explain leaving a job after one month and a half!** 

I also feel like he didn’t communicate dissatisfaction with me enough before for me to really get the message &amp; to even have a chance to improve. He said I can keep the title of marketing coordinator, and maybe every once in a while, down the line I can take small projects, but that he expected me to really own this new role. My spirit is not in it. It’s a demanding role. And right now, I’m still devastated about my boyfriend to motivate myself to want it. I’m worried I won’t be able to do well, or that I’ll end up without a job. 

**What do you guys think I should do? Tell him I don’t like it? Lie and force myself to do it? Start looking for another job?** 

Oh shit **this is really long I’m so sorry**, I hope someone still reads it. I feel like I just have to get everything out. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I don't have a lot of people to talk to, so I've just been crying because I feel hopeless (I'm not normally a crier, but ever since the break up I've been so emotional).",31Aug2017,1

So, I may soon be getting a new job.  This job will have much better work-life balance (from the way they make it sound) than my current job, including an option for a 4/10 work week (work 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, get 3 off).

I will probably be making ~60k a year, single, no debt, so my second question is that enough to afford to take these vacations?

31,"So backstory: I'm in my sophomore year at college right now. My freshman year I joined a sorority to make friends and they weren't the kind of people I liked so I left and lost all my friends there. 

Before this year started I changed my major to theatre and it's a really small major so everybody knows everybody. Everyone I met has been so nice to me so far. One girl I met even told me that I'm everyone's favorite new member so far because of how much I want to get involved and how much I try to talk to them. But other than that it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I talk to people before class and in between classes and they talk to me, but after class when everyone goes to hang out with their friends I never get invited anywhere. They always text each other and are always doing something and I just end up sitting at home doing nothing. I tried texting one girl I know to do something this weekend, and she sounded interested but then after I responded to say ""oh hey awesome!"" she never responded. I didn't want to seem weird by texting her again so I haven't spoken to her since besides in person occasionally but she hasn't brought up the possibility of hanging out and neither have I because I don't want to seem too desperate. I know I have to put myself out there in order to make friends, but since I have bad anxiety I'm constantly worried that I'm just making an ass of myself and coming off as really desperate. I didn't have many friends in high school. I went to a really small high school and I didn't have anything in common with my classmates so we never talked, and all I want is for college to be different and to finally have friends for once. Anything specific I can do to help me make better friends? It's only the second week of classes so I know friendships do take more time, but I'm worried it'll never happen. ",31Aug2017,1

35,"I met this guy about 2 years ago by taking him into my place.
Several months ago, i returned to this state and made contact with him and since have helped him out of a deep hole.
He just turned 22 and i will turn 28 this january.

He introduced me to his mother and there were sparks.
She will be 45 this december.

He told me later how he felt his mom liked me as more than a friend.

I havent been sure how to feel about the age difference or that this is my friends mother....

But, her and i spend more time together than my friend and i do and i am extremely comfortable with her.

I want to speak to my friend about how i feel..
But i have no idea what to say to him.
He is homeless and i travel in a van by choice through self employment.
He stays with me in tbe van on many occassions including tonight he will be staying with me.

I just want to say ""what would you think of me liking your mom?""

What do i do if he becomes upset?

And how should i lay this on him?

I thought i might speak to his mother about this first but really think i should just mention it to him first.

Please any advice!

36,"Hey,

I live in South Texas. My job is closed until the 5th. They are saying we have to use up all accrued PTO to cover the days we can't work. 

Can they force us to do that? I don't want to use my Paid time off. I have a baby and need those accrued hours in case she gets sick. And just, reasons. 

The only bank we have is PTO, no sick. We get 2 mental health days per year. We can use those too.

38,"My SIL has suffered from a seizure disorder for most of her life. Two years ago she had a seizure while driving, and ended up totaling her car in a ditch, but walked away unhurt (and fortunately didn't harm anyone else).

She has decided that the side effects from seizure medication are undesirable for her, and, thus has opted to remain untreated for her condition, and, since the time of the accident has not driven.

Last week she sent an email to the whole family informing everyone that she was going to start driving again. She said she is now aware of warning signs before a seizure, and has found out how to mostly control them by getting enough rest, and, therefore, she feels confident in her ability to drive safely.

This absolutely terrifies me.

Sadly, the state of Ohio doesn't have a law mandating a minimum seizure-free period before being legally allowed to drive a car, so I'm not too sure of any legal way to compel her to not drive.

My wife had a long phone conversation with her, expressing concerns, and trying to convince her sister to not do this, and I followed-up with a lengthy email pleading with her to reconsider, laying out logically the high probability of a catastrophic accident that will seriously injure or kill her and/or others.

She has not responded.

I need advice. The rest of the family feels at a loss as to how to convince this grown, independent woman to hear our fears and concerns and pleadings for her not to drive. What can I do next? Is there a way I can have law enforcement speak to her, or have some other authority to intervene? She won't listen to reason, or learn from her past experiences, so what can I do to keep her from making a potentially extremely harmful decision by getting back behind the wheel while untreated for this condition?

tl;dr: SIL refuses medication to treat her lifelong seizure condition. She wrecked her car during a seizure episode while driving two years ago. She believes she knows now when a seizure is coming on, and can safely navigate it, so she has decided to start driving again. We've pleaded with her not to do it, but she won't listen. What can we do now to keep her off the roads?",31Aug2017,1
39,"It's in the title. I'm 21 and was bullied all the way through school and it still affects me majorly today. I have so many problems because of it. I'll try and list some:

* I struggle to make new friends at work, and mainly at work, or any place where I'll be spending a lot of time with the same group of people. I always expect that they're going to pick on me straight away.

* I don't have much of a backbone (but it's getting better)

* I overreact to everything by getting really anxious and making the wrong decision, which just escalates the situation and causes a scene or draws attention to me.

* I'm angry. Very angry. I don't know how to express it but when I'm alone I get really pissed off. I've tried talking to my friends about it but it's just not letting up. 

* I seem arrogant when people first meet me, because I'm trying to ""fake it til you make it"" but don't do it well. I think people hate me if they don't immediately get drawn to me.

40,"So we have been dating for almost a year and a half. I mean like we care for each other, we love each other, the whole shit. Honestly she is one of the best things to ever happen to me, we are fairly opposite which has been great for both of us to grow.

So when we started dating I had a couple of ground rules. No tats, no drugs. Look, if that is for you, then you aren't for me. Just how I feel. Oh and be a virgin like me.

SO we have been running into friction recently and it finally came to a head. She told me the reason she had been distant is she is afraid how I would react when she was doing weed. She up front told me that she has been doing it for about 5 months now, couple of times a month. We both go to the same school and she lives on campus and mainly does it with co-workers from a campus job. There have been times when I have spent 4 or 5 days solid with her during that time so I tend to believe she isn't lying about frequency. She is on zoloft and takes it to a tee, and gets made fun of because she will switch to water in drinking games once she hits her 'relaxed but not impaired' level.  So addiction has not to this point been on the radar, she is very responsible.

She has cried twice in our relationship, both times when it had to do with leaving me.  Shit, she saw her best friends house under water due to Harvey and didn't flinch. So she obviously cares very deeply about me.

I told her that I would be willing to forgive her but that I really didn't want to date a drug user. She said that this is what she is going to do, so I said you would rather use drugs over me? She said that wasn't it, that is was different.

You know it is weird, if I had found out when we had first met I would have dumped her ass so fast, but I really do love her. She has said to me that she is willing to compromise on a bunch of stuff for me if I compromise with her on this. Our relationship is built on it and it has been strong, so this is not out of character.

I don't know how I feel. I told her the other night that if we do continue that I would want her to quite for a month and take a drug test to prove she can quite whenever she wants, which she was fine with. I also asked her if this was a permanent thing, and she said she felt like it was a college phase. I said that if I were to marry her (way down the road) I wouldn't want to be with a drug user. Period. She said that ""if it gets to that point I would have no problem making the adult decision to stop"". 

The point: She lied to me and I am worried about trust. I am worried that if a friend could convince her that weed was safe and ""a pretty good time"" that she could be convinced to do harder drugs. I fear her unwillingness to respect a few basic things. I am also concerned that my public image would be hurt with people knowing she does drugs. I honestly wouldn't care too much if she did it in just her apartment, but your significant other is an extension of yourself. And of course I don't want her to hurt herself or get hurt. 

What should I do?",31Aug2017,1
41,"Hi i just moved to a new state for high-school. This is my junior year and 3rd year away from home. Last 2 years I lived in a dorm so I never really had any problems but this year absolutely fucking sucks.

       I have no friends and its my third week of school. Pretty sure a couple kids fucking hate me and the two friends I do have don't even compare to the 2 friends I had back in boarding school. The worst thing about living here is that I'm living with a host family. Two random people that needed the income. Its a dad and his son. The son is now my room mate and he is one grade below me. But hes a prepubescent cunt that complains non-stop to his dad about me. Because this fucking kid is living here with his dad the dad of course now hates me because his son is non-stop feeding him shit that bugs him. 

       I am completely alone. The past two years I've ranged from 0-4 room mates depending on the season (I go to school to train for snow-sports) Non of them were this shitty to me, and if we had any differences we could address the dorm staff. They didn't have any student preference so we could always work something out but because I live with some random ass people that don't want to change the way they live to accommodate another person.

          I had to quit smoking because my school drug tests and I don't want to risk losing everything over some shit like that. I used to have severe depression and medicating was a great coping mechanism. I can't tell anyone here how shitty my situation is because I'm a student athlete that gets to explore his passion and I'll just seem like a fucking disgraceful piece of shit.

        I don't want to go home because I worked so hard to get here, and my family doesn't want to move up because my mom has a good job. I have nobody to talk to besides her and she loves me but I don't feel like I can confide everything I'm struggling with. She split up with her partner last year and my dad left when I was three to start a new family in another country. Nobody in the world cares about me. I am more depressed than ever. I want some escape but smoking isn't an option and I'm not ready to kill myself yet. I don't know what to do.

What would you do if you had a good friend who would just pop by your place with no warning, on a constant basis?

Knowing him, I believe he gives no warning deliberately, to come across as a fun-loving and go-with-the-flow kind of guy. (His confidence is on the little side so he works hard to give off a larger impression.)

While I appreciate the spontaneity, his visits are becoming downright annoying - I can't make other plans because I know he might show, and sometimes I'm just plain tired and want to be alone and he shows up. 

This friend has been there for me when I needed him and I don't want to offend him, especially considering his confidence level.

48,"So I am a male, and I am 17. My friend, who is a female, is currently 16 right now. Anyways, we have both been friends since 7th grade, I think on January. We are very close to each other and she is like my little sister. I am very protective over her as she is with me. We have always supported each other through the tough times. Well, there has always been these rumors at school that we were both together. People would say we are dating and stuff and no matter how many times we tell them that we are just friends, they still keep spreading the rumors. Normally, I would have been fine with this. We would ignore the rumors and go on with our lives since they never affected us very often. 




Well, last week there was this other girl in class who confessed that she had a huge crush on me and she asked me out. I said no and she wasn't happy about it so she walked away. Well, because of the rumors, she would constantly message my friend and try to hurt her mentally. I would tell the girl to leave my friend alone but she doesn't listen. My friend has blocked her several times but the girl would usually make more accounts and/or would get other friends to start harassing my friend at school. Whenever my friend and I talk alone, the girl would come in and start butting in the conversation. My friend is currently going through a really tough time right now and really needs someone to support her, which is supposed to be me. She needs advice and her situation is really personal but because the girl won't stop butting in our conversation, we can't talk about it and I can't help support her. The girl would leave notes on my desk, saying that she loves me and her friends would constantly try to convince me to talk to date her. I am fine with this girl bothering me since I can just ignore her but the fact that she won't stop bugging my friends makes me feel like I have to do something. She (my friend) is very shy so she tries to avoid confronting people and dealing with social situations. Lately, she has been getting more quiet and has been being careless lately (not doing homework, stabbing herself with the pencil randomly, etc). She doesn't have other friends to go to for support with her personal situation and the fact that I am not able to talk to her about it because of the other girl and support her bugs me a lot. 




How do I get the girl to stop bothering my friend and I so that way I can help my friend with her issues?

We both loved talking to each other, and we did a lot for two weeks strait, played steam together and such (again not stabdard as I lose interest quickly.) But then we actually met over the weekend and went drinking downtown which went well until it was time to leave. I ended up awkwardly at her friends place and we slept on separate couches.

53,"Hi! First sorry I didn't see any big subreddits to post for help on cats so I am here :0 if you know of a good subreddit for cat help with lots of subscribers then please let me know c:

This is on my cats Mimi and Moomoos diets and change of their diets.

Anyways I have a pet cat her name is Mimi she is a Russian Blue and 16-17 years old. She's generally pretty healthy she's plays with her ribbon if we take it out she's sleeps and sunbathes a lot and is still feisty as ever and can jump and run around. 

However, recently we've noticed she has seemed skinner. Her whole life she has always had a diet of having dry food out 24/7 and has done pretty good and for as long as I can remember she has been know  for her barfing. Though I recently found out this barfing is probably because her dry food is not nutritious and to add onto that she is always begging for human food like jumping on the table, opening containers, pawing at food, crying for it, etc. and my sisters and I recently discovered that's also due to her bad diet of only dry food. So her barfing is probably because she is so malnutrition from the dry food.

So we recently bought her wet food so try it out. We feed her two times a day mixing it with a bit of dry food and some water to mash up the dry hard food. She do this in the morning and night with each time a little single serving of wet cat food. She eats it but she also has gone a day without food and today barfed right after having the food so we tried to mash up the hard food more and she then ate some and got distracted by a bug.

I can't tell if she's just trying to adjust or doesn't like the wet food? Can someone just give some advice on this overall situation? I don't know what to do and I want to be doing the right thing since Mimi is so old.


I also have a 6-7 year old tuxedo cat names Moomoo and she is very overweight as she used to share the same diet as Mimi, but has not self control really... 

We began the same diet as Mimi with Moomoo and Moomoo isn't eating very much. The only difference is we don't mash moomoos food up as we only do that for Mimi as she use to barf up whole chunks of food and have trouble biting it. 

Is Moomoo also just adjusting? I don't want to be starving her or anything or stressing either cats out :(

So TL;DR what are some insight on this situation for both Mimi and Moomoo? Is two times a day for meals enough? Why haven't they been eating their food? What else should I know or do you guys realize after reading what I typed out? 

Please help. I really want to be giving my cats a proper diet to help them stay healthy/grow healthy. :,c ",31Aug2017,2

She also said she wanted me to send her inappropriate images and it feels as though no matter what I do, I cannot get her to stop thinking about her intrusive thoughts. Additionally, she is not in therapy and will not be able to go at least until September 13, and I believe the reason she has turned to me is because she feels as if I am the only person she can confide in because she has angry outbusrts online and has been banned from several forums due to her behavior. I am a rather empathetic person and I felt bad for her and listened to her because I was also severely depressed when I was about her age due to similar reasons, though I was not banned from forums; it was more due to being bullied when I was in elementary and middle school becuase of my own Autism and anxiety. Our second to last conversation ended with her implying that she is at the very least romantically attracted to me, which I find extremely inappropriate considering the fact that I am about five years older than her--admittedly, it may have sounded as though *I* am also interested by giving advice despite the fact that I am absolutely not.

I'm not smart really, but I'm hard working and i love physics and my engineering classes. this isn't the case for my colleagues. everyone i go to school with are either naturally gifted geniuses or party people who are on the verge of switching to easier majors. Now i learned not to be picky with friends, but people seem to leave me in the dust as i never fit into any of these groups no matter how much i try. Im always too smart, or too dumb or too much of a ""tough guy"" or not enough of a jock AND most importantly: I seem to be just a big joke. I'm not trying to say im just better then people by any means, its just people see me as too different to relate to or they think im just a joke, nothing they should bother with. I always try my best to be nice, im considered good looking and in decent shape. i avoid bringing up politics or anything that starts conflicts and im always willing to lend a hand. I try to be everything i think a good person should be. I walk around campus and i seem to be on good terms with practically everyone, but no one really wants me to be more then someone to greet when they walk by me. 

To rephrase what i said above: 

I am friendly with just about everyone, but not friends with anyone. 

Part of me desires to have at least one good friend, and the other justs wants to be respected. I have always had to deal with these problems since grade school and no matter how hard i try, i never have gotten anywhere, close but no cigar. It has given me some on and off depression throughout my life which currently kicks in every couple of weeks for a couple days. 

So i really need advice, how do i make friends when no matter how nice or confident i am, people don't bother with me and/or think very little of me. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",31Aug2017,1

76,"Hi Reddit, this is my first ever post on Reddit, and a throwaway account. Two weeks ago, I came to college. I decided on the far away school over the close to home school for a few reasons.

After two weeks here, I hate it. I cannot seem to make friends, no matter how hard I try, and I am a very social extroverted person. In high school I had a large circle of friends and now I feel so empty and alone. 

A large amount of my friends went to the large university that is near my home, and they are all loving it. Every time I talk to them or see a photo of them on social media, I feel jealous and like I am missing out. 

On top of all this, one of my friends going there is a girl I developed feelings for in the last couple weeks of summer. It's difficult to see her thriving and meeting all kinds of people while I'm doing just the opposite. 

I don't know what I am asking and I don't know the purpose of posting this, I guess I thought it might feel good just to type it and let others read it. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",31Aug2017,1
77,"Alright so.... My friend  (Who I've been friends with since before I work at my current job) let it slip to our store supervisor that I have been interviewing for other jobs. I have *no* intention of leaving my current job! This job only requires morning shifts from me, so I was looking to fill up my afternoon-evening time.

Well, apparently the supervisor got very concerned that I was going to be leaving. My other coworker just quit tonight and we definitely don't have room for anyone else to leave. 

I'm thinking of going up to supervisor and saying ""hey, I apologize for not letting you know I've been interviewing with other jobs, but I was looking to get a *second* job, not leave this one. I really do love the work I do here."" Since my co-worker just quit I can assume they'll need me for more hours now until they can replace her, so should I mention that I won't be looking anymore? Should I not say anything at all? I don't want to be pre-emptively fired or something. I don't know this supervisor that well, she hasn't worked at the store very long.

TLDR; supervisor is afraid I'll leave my job. Do I let her know I've heard about her concerns and tell her she has nothing to fear or do I pretend no one ever told me that she's worried? What exactly do I say? I've never had this sort of situation before",31Aug2017,1
81,"My wife stopped talking to her mom last year for several reasons. Her parents divorced when she was 13 and her mom later remarried a complete psychopath who brainwashed her.

The guy would just constantly yell at my wife and her younger brothers, making a big deal out of everything and forcing them to do all the chores in the house. He really screwed up her self-esteem and confidence through years of telling her that she wasn't good enough and refusing to support her in anything.

She was Valedictorian in high school and attended a prestigious east coast university on a full-ride scholarship. During her 4 years of college, she only went back home for the holiday breaks and the scumbag always made sure she had a hellish time. He kicked her out at least once during her stays there and even once on New Year's Eve.

When she and I started dating, it became clear to everyone that it was a serious relationship, a first for my wife, and the scumbag made it his goal to ruin it. He convinced her mom that I was ""evil"" and refused to let us see each other. Before she left for college that last summer at home, she didn't have a cellphone yet so we chatted using her Zune. The scumbag found out about it (it was a secret gift from an aunt) and took it from her for a while. After he let her have it back, he would disconnect the Wifi so that we couldn't communicate.

After she left, he would constantly text her, threatening her with leaving her mom if she didn't talk to him. Her brothers received the same treatment. Only the youngest still lives there and only because he's still in high school.

Her mom NEVER, not once, stood up for her or defended her against this monster. On the contrary, she would go out of her way to upset my wife by using the daughters she has with the scumbag. Her mom would let the girls text my wife while she was at work. Obviously, my wife couldn't respond until later in the day. This didn't stop her mom from calling her ""a selfish bitch"" for not talking to her ""sisters"", never mind that they're from a different father. Keep in mind that her brothers were never allowed to speak to my wife. She hasn't spoken to her youngest brother in several years.

What kills me about all of this is that her mom and that scumbag will never get what they deserve. They tell all their acquaintances about how proud they are of my wife and how much they supported her through school without knowing the horrible truth. There are many other injustices I could mention but I think you get the point of how messed up this ""family"" is. I shake with rage and impotence whenever I think about this. The crazy thing is that he never treated his daughters this way, at least not yet. Only my wife and her brothers. The sick fuck simply got a kick out of making them suffer.

Now that two of my wife's three brothers are out of that house, they're still suffering. The elder one used to have a credit card under his name that he let them use. The younger one gives half of his paycheck to them. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. It's been like a year since my wife cut her mom off and she's still damaged by everything they did to her. I would like to help her brothers out somehow but it seems like they're just too afraid.

Sorry for the wall of text but I needed to get this out there. If anyone has any ideas as to how I can help these poor kids, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.",31Aug2017,6
82,"So my life has gotten a lot better these last 2 years, but basically half of it was shit. The short summary is that my childhood was filled with emotional abuse and general neglect, and I was a pawn in some adults' arguments with each other, among other bad things like untreated mental health problems.

Every time I try to tell people (I thought I trusted) about my problems, it goes badly. Literally every time. So now I also have trust issues. I basically had no support network because I had no friends (also due to one of the shitty things going on in my family).

I think I've recovered from most of my problems on my own, but sometimes I get reminded of sad things but can't talk to anybody about it because it'll just go badly again. How do I bury the history so that it doesn't ruin my day? And in general, when something bad happens that I can't do anything to change, how do I deal with it? I used to have a cushioned wall for punching but I feel that it isn't a productive way to deal with problems (and I don't have it anymore anyways).

84,"So, 3 years ago, I met this girl. Super nice girl, she just hung out with my guy friends, because she didn't like hanging around girls. Cause she thought ""they caused too much drama"", so I started to get to know her, and thought ""yeah, she's a nice girl"", I kept getting closer with her, and then one day, she was walking with me to my car, and I looked over at her, and it was like looking at the face of angel. It was then I knew I cared about her. However there was another girl that I'd liked, and thought I loved for a few years before I met her. So I ignored it, hoping it would go away. Two years later, still wrestling with my feelings, I realized that the girl I thought I loved, was a self absorbed girl, who thought all me liked her, just because she had a nice rack. (It wasn't why I liked her. I really liked her personality, and other things) she showed her true colors, and I let go. Those feelings for the other girl that I tried to bury came back a few days later. And I decided, that since I did care a lot about her, that I'd try and do something about those feeling I've felt for 3 years. However I found out that she was moving 3 states away, because her parents got divorced, and she was going to finish school there, (she wants to come back here. She hates it there.)  I didn't tell her how I felt, I wish I'd did. Now, I send her jokes every now and again, but I want to tell her how I feel. She wants to come back here, because she likes it here.

Today i did the hardest thing i have ever had to do and broke my mothers heart by telling her our plans. Her reaction crushed me when she ran to the bathroom tears in her eyes, when she returned she could barely look at me. she told me she felt anger towards our choice and it was selfish to take her grandchild away from her and most of the family that lives around here just to go take care of 2 family members 6 hours away.

93,"So to protect names here I'm just gonna call them A and B.  These two are my best friends and have been for a really long time.  They started dating about 2 years ago, and anyone can see that they really love each other.  B's birthday is coming up and A told me that she was hoping the 3 of us could get together for to celebrate.  I said of course, I was coming home from college that weekend anyway.

So a few days later A texts me and says that she plans to propose to B while we're celebrating, and since I was their closest friend she wanted me to be there.  It left me really conflicted.  On one hand, it's clear they love each other, and in all honestly I fully expect B is going to say yes and they'll live happily ever after.  But at the same time, I'm slightly nervous about what will happen if B turns her down.  It's only going to be the three of us hanging out, so if something goes wrong, I'm gonna be the only one there to try and diffuse the situation if emotions get really high.

I figured out that it was him by comparing his language usage with my language usage and the language used in the leak with a program for doing so. I found a 95% similarity with the language of him and the language of the leak, my language is 80% similar where the average similarity is 85%. I could show this evidence to the members of the server I am still in contact with and I think I would be able to make him lose his reputation in the server but I care more about my relationship with the user who is currently going against me than the rest of the server (I really don't care about the server at all). I am debating between exposing him and potentially risking him releasing my personal data and not being able to reconcile with him vs sacrificing my reputation on the server and waiting several months to recontact him and try to reconcile with him.

102,"Yesterday I went to a carnival with my little brother. We decided to go on one of those gravity rides, you know, ones that spin and you get stuck to the wall? I had gone on one many years ago when I was a little kid, I thought it would be just as fun as back then... well, I guess my adult body did not agree with it because not only did it feel like all the air was being crushed out of me, my back felt like it was being pulled in two different directions. In short, it hurt. A lot.
&amp;nbsp;
Still, I toughed it out for the most part and waited for the ride to stop - operator probably couldn't hear my screaming in agony over the loud pop music and other screaming passengers, I don't blame him--BUT! What happened after the ride stopped is why I'm posting here now. After the ride stopped, the pain continued and I couldn't move. I called out to the ride operator and asked him if he or somebody else could please call first aid. He didn't seem concerned, more incredulous than anything, like he didn't know what to do in this kind of situation. I honestly don't remember his exact words but after what appeared to be moment of deliberation he decided instead of calling for help, he was going to play doctor and ask me what I thought happened... well, I'm no doctor either, so through my pain and utter confusion toward his lack of concern, I simply said I didn't know and that maybe I threw my back out or something? It was all I could think of, I didn't care if it was correct, I just knew that it really hurt and it felt nearly impossible to move.
&amp;nbsp;
I guess that answer wasn't good enough for him because he laughed, rolled his eyes, then shook his head before informing me that it was impossible to throw out your back on this ride... um, okay, sir, but that doesn't change the fact that I am in agonizing pain and I don't think I can move on my own.
&amp;nbsp;
Luckily my brother was there to help peel me off the wall and let me lean on him so we could exit the ride and look for help. I said nothing at first but Dr. Carny just seemed too amused by my misinformed diagnosis to let it go. He kept rolling his eyes, chuckling to himself, and once again repeated something to the affect of that I couldn't put my back out on this ride. I couldn't take it and I guess my pain was talking when I said to him, and I quote: ""You don't need to be such an asshole about it.""
&amp;nbsp;
That's when I hear from back on the ride ""EXCUSE ME?""
&amp;nbsp;
I guess he didn't take too kindly to the implication that he was being an asshole and he shouted at me as we got off the ride. I don't remember all that he said, we were leaving and I was in too much pain to really take in anything, but I'm pretty sure, once again, he insisted it was impossible to throw your back out on his ride...
&amp;nbsp;
After that we got to the first aid tent and the people working there were amazing. Highlight of the entire carnival, even better than the ice cream. They took down my information as well as filed a report for that guy.

107,"Tried to buy a cat from a breeder four months ago which died a week before we were allowed to pick it up. This was the second cat we tried to buy from this breeder because of the first one unfortunately passed right after it was born. During the months leading up to our pickup the photos we received the cat made us concerned for the cat's health. We were told that the cat was fine health and we were not to worry. After the cat passed they offered us a different cat than what we were looking for for a discounted price. We respectfully declined and were refunded our money. After about a month we decided to leave a mild 2 * review. Nothing harsh. Just the fact that we were disappointed with time it cost us and that our concerns were pushed to the side. The breeder said that our review was fake and a lie and had it removed from their page and then blocked us. 

I'm pretty frustrated with the whole situation and I'm worried that if I post another review on Facebook it will just be removed again and our frustration will go unanswered and unnoticed.

They claim we never asked anything about the pets health. That we lied in our review and that we were looking for problems.

We have the photos of the animal and screenshots of the conversation to the contrary.

TLDR: a breeder made us wait four months for a pet that died and then called us a liar in our negative review and had it removed.

It's not in the town they promised me.

It's about to be winter, they allow dogs, it's not 2500 a month and I just need a home.

I get sketched out but he acts like it's fine and they will/are in the process of fixing it. 
So I see the house. It's awesome. 
But that is weighing on my mind. 

I see the house again the next day, and actually talk to a roommate..and they said they were drinking the water without knowing ANYTHING was wrong with it, and they personally had it tested and it went over the Colorado limit for manganese. They also said he never lowered the rent for them after figuring it out, and it wasn't until they hired a lawyer, that he started to get it fixed. 
I called the landlord and he told me it was fine and he himself would drink water from there.

117,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can. 

I have an... ex-friend, R. We became friends in high school due to common interests and that lasted for four years and beyond. During that time we had an intense relationship, as R struggled with abuse from her family, newly diagnosed bipolar disorder, and thoughts of suicide. During the time she tried to drive me away by saying shitty things to me, because she felt she shouldn't have anyone around her due to terrible thoughts about herself, but I didn't really care and we ended up remaining friends throughout college.

It was through her I met my girlfriend A. For a while we were all friends and it was good.

Then a few years ago - maybe 2, 3? We started running a roleplaying game with us three and a few other friends. I don't want to go into too much detail, because it's not that important. What is important is that, because R and A were the only two who were very familiar with the game, they ended up acting as the leaders, my gf more than R, and this ended in a bunch of drama where R felt that my gf was turning everyone against her and was abusing her power over the other players.

To be clear, from my perspective, I think basically everyone involved did some shitty stuff, including myself and my gf. But the one causing the most problems was R. She ended up leaving the game and cutting off contact with everyone, including me.

Well, that was kind of shitty, but I got over it. And then a couple months ago she randomly messaged me again, saying she was sorry and wanted to be friends. Having dealt with her being shitty in hs and still caring about her, I said sure, and we chatted a bit. I figured she had done some time reflecting and was too embarrassed to reach out to everyone else, opting for me, the long time friend.

Then a couple of weeks ago she messaged me and we finally actually did talk about what happened. I discovered that she in fact does not seem to think she did anything wrong, she has come to terms with ""what happened to her,"" does not regret cutting off contact with everyone, and also remarked that she's glad she's not friends with my gf anymore because it was making her a shittier person (which, okay then).

And it just made me realize that... no, I don't want to be friends with this person.

Long story short: I tore down a ceiling without a dust mask, which took about 15 minutes. Later as guys were putting it into the skip, they saw that there was asbestos on the chip rock.

I went to doctor, but they said there's nothing really that can be done. They said chances are I'm going to be fine, and if anything was to happen, it won't be until years down the line.

Anybody else have an experience in being exposed to this shit? I'm kinda paranoid because I like to have an occasional cigarette, which is what increases the risk of disease even more when combined with asbestos exposure.

120,"Hey there guys. Thanks for stopping by. So I'm a 19 year old male who just graduated from high school and I moved out of my grandparents house to a much larger city. Reason I lived with my grandparents is neither of my actual parents are really involved in my life. Don't like to use that as a crutch, just figured it was vital information. So I moved out and into with my aunt who is going through a divorce and asked me to move in, though initially she told me I should move in with her soon to be ex husband because it was a bigger house and I'd have my own room but I said no because I wanted to help her and because she's a blood relative. So after a few weeks of staying we get into an argument over some dumb little things, just how she is really so we usually worked it out and she eventually asked for payment to stay. I agree to start paying $200 a month to share a room with my cousin in a bunk bed. In the midst of this, I meet my current girlfriend who quickly becomes my outlet. Being around her makes me very happy however we have very little privacy which I accept and contend with. My aunt soon starts going on drunken rampages and destroys the apartments whilst fighting her new boyfriend and everything it's me cleaning and trying my hardest to act as tho is doesn't bother me. Keep in mind I'm paying for groceries, picking up my cousins, etc I'm trying my hardest to contribute and I understand she's going through a divorce. Eventually I decide to move in with her previous husband who she thought i should move in with and I tell her and she seems fine with it at first however soon she gets upset and tells me we should have lunch tomorrow so we can talk. I'm super anxious my aunt is very hard to talk to because she uses me staying there as an excuse to scream and yell at me while this didn't have all the time it happened enough to fear speaking with her and is actively keeping me awake tonight. I have so much stress and anxiety and I've been taking it on my girlfriend who I love very much and I'm scared to lose her and also scared im gonna fuck up and be left homeless. Also scared I'm gonna have to move back to my hometown which I will not do under any circumstances. I will sleep in my car if I have to. I'm also concerned about future career aspects I can't keep working minimum wage jobs I need my own place. How do I achieve my goals and how can I relieve stress? Is there a different approach I should take. I apologize for not making a concise post. Thank you. ",31Aug2017,1

She said some nasty shit last night, claimed I didn't show her any affection unless sex was involved.  Sex goes both ways!  I could get sex on the street from anyone I wanted, theres plenty of single women gagging for it from someone who can fix shit for them.

All I am is a fixer of things, she's crying about not being shown affection.  I fix her phone fix her computer fix her TV do her washing at my flat, I wake her up with a coffee and see her off with a kiss.  What the fuck does she want?

It really hurt being accused of using her for sex, what we have as sporadically as it is is all good but now she's ruined it.  Can't dump that which isn't a solid relationship, so no dumpage.

Unfortunately due to a few crappy circumstances I am still living with him.
He was very controlling and still tries to be and the other day I came home to find my furniture in my bedroom had been moved around. I found out he had been snooping through my room and using my computer to find out what I have been up to.
I also went into the bathroom and noticed a small chunk of hair that looked like it had been chopped off but it was blonde and we aren't blonde. 
I then went back to my room and found more long bits of blonde hair in my bed. It felt fake and kind of like a wig hair rather than a human hair but when I questioned him about it, he got mad and refused to tell me. It's been a few days since and when I bring it up, he yells at me and refuses to tell me.

Is it possible that it's from a girls hair extensions (I've never had them and the girl he is seeing is blonde)? Again, the texture doesn't feel like a human hair but it's bugging me so much not knowing what it is and whos it is.",31Aug2017,1

I am a closeted gay (mostly gay). Like to the point that I don’t see coming out as an option for a long time. A long time…. I understand that is unhealthy but it is just my life right now while I am under my very homophobic family’s roof. 

So heres where its honestly a potential disaster and I am so fucking scared right now I don’t know what to do.
I have been talking to this guy for the past couple of months and its been great. but now a few family members were curious one day and well it was proven at that point that it would tear the family apart by the way they reacted. 
The guy is amazing and we’ve been talking for a little bit. been sexual a few times. But now its hit me that if someone found out I would absolutely not be mentally ready and be destroyed inside and by the ones im closest to. 

We’ve even gone as far as to say I love you. 

Right now I’m so scared now that its ruining my life with stress, and I need a way out of this relationship without crushing this guys heart and/or him doing a revenge thing or something like telling everyone. We don’t know each others friends. 
He’s really nice and one of my favorite people in this world.
As far as what I am worried about is that sometimes he gets a bit emotional. nothing more than just being short with me or something similar, but it does happen sometimes. 

I’m dying for a nice way to ask him that he never tells anyone and that he has to promise me.
And worst of all, that we can’t talk anymore. I know a lot of people will hate me for having to do this and yes I hate me too for it. I am going insane right now.

I already might cry right now and when I talk to him, but I just need a direction to go instead of just bawling to him. 
Ive been gone for the last month or two and have been back for a little over 2 weeks, so that also worries me about him being upset. 

I know it is a dick move to break up with someone over this, however, I am just so worried its tearing me up inside. 

Once again sorry for my poor writing I’m just dying for an answer.
Basically I am terrified right now and would love some advice in any way possible.

Sam has been angry. We've had a lot of stress in our lives including dealing with shitty drivers on the road and in parking lots, plans that we/he makes that fall through last minute, his family hating me (in-laws are very hostile toward me since nearly the start of our relationship), troubles getting his work done in time, trouble sleeping because our bed is old and uncomfortable but we can't afford a new one, the hot summer weather overheating our apartment (air conditioner isn't helping), etc etc. His frustrations have been affecting me, and I keep feeling more anxious and depressed in part because of it.

Yesterday, we were pulling out of the parking lot at a Wal*Mart where some woman was angrily honking her horn at us to go faster because she wanted the spot. Usually we ignore that sort of thing but Sam blew up, screamed, and flipped her off. It's very much unlike him. I asked him not to do that, and that it was a dangerous because some people get psycho over ""road rage"" situations. He ended up yelling at me over it. 

I don't know what to do. Some of the stressful situations are out of our control (such as bad driving, and my in-laws hating me) so we can't do much about it even if it upsets him.

We had a pretty good plan on me finding a new job, quitting my current one, all that. I have an interview tomorrow for a job at his company (different department) that I think I'll get (but obviously absolutely not guaranteed).

Anyway, my plan was see if I get this new job. If yes, quit and that's that. If not, tell boss I'm very serious about moving, ask one more time if I can move or if he knows other managers down there with open positions (an option he mentioned the first time I asked about moving). But yesterday at the very end of the work day, he told our (small) group that one guy is being moved to a different group for 4-6 months to help a project finish on schedule.

In a nutshell: I can't make friends. I don't know how to, and I don't know why. I don't think I'm a bad person, I barely brag about myself and try to be as modest as can be. While I am capable of establishing acquaintances, I am having the damnest time actually making a friend. 

I don't think I'm introverted, I've always lied to and convinced myself that I am, hence why I don't talk and socialize much. But I've come to the conclusion that I'm just shy and socially awkward and need to be more outspoken. And I've been doing that for the past few months or so, I can meet and talk to so many people, yet it never seems like the kind of conversation that may lead to us exchanging numbers and hanging out.

159,"I'll try to keep it short. I am American and my wife is Japanese, we met in Japan, got married, got her a green card and then came to the USA.

When we were dating, I knew that she was a lot more shy than most people, and that she had a case of body dysmorphic disorder (constant obsession about her appearance not being good enough), but she still seemed like a normal person. But from our very first day of being married, she started getting worse and worse and I slowly came to realizes how mentally ill she really is.

Jump forward to today, she can't work, she can't study (so she doesn't speak English even though we live in America), she can't handle social situations at all (we never meet people or even go to church), she hyper analyzes everything that I say looking for an insult and if she thinks she finds one she explodes in a fit of rage, and just say the most hurtful things to me every chance she gets.

But the biggest problem is that she will often have berserk rages where she screams, yells, slams her head against the wall, claws at her neck, and beats herself until she is covered in bruises. By no exaggeration, it is like a demon possession.

I once called the police and they had her hospitalized for 10 days, but she didn't speak English so they didn't really do anything to help. If anything she came back a lot worse.

She also abuses prescription medication, drinks 1-2 bottles of wine a night (she is 110lbs), and sometimes combines the alcohol and medicine. I try to stop her, but if she doesn't get exactly what she wants, she goes into another berserk rage. 

She is also extremely suicidal, and won't stop talking (sometimes screaming) that she wants to die. That just being alive is painful. She has tried to jump out of the car while we were on the highway, and out the window from the 16th floor.

I try to get her to see a psychiatrist or a counselor, but she is so picky and I really have to twist her arm to get her to go.

I decided that I regretted marrying her during our honeymoon. No matter what I do, she will not show any love to me, and I don't think she has the mental capacity to do so.

But I can't get rid of her. I tell her that I want a divorce all of the time, and every time she goes on a rage and then says she wants to die. It is this horrible, violent experience, and then she acts like nothing happens. And then I have to bring it up again, and she just repeats.

I want her to go back with her mom and live in Japan, but her mom doesn't want to take care of her anymore either. (Mother-in-law is a whole separate problem). 

Thinking of solutions, if I could somehow get her to Japan on a visit to her mom's place, I could file for divorce, send her her stuff and be done. But our dog and finances are such that this couldn't happen for a while.

If I could find some other super cheap place to live and just not go home anymore, she would definitely die. I have seen her just completely broken, sobbing on the ground because I had an hour of overtime I forgot to tell her about. If I was gone for a day with no contact, she 100% would cut her own throat.

If I told her ""here is your airplane ticket, we are divorced, get out"" she would go berserk, refuse to go, and kill herself the second I wasn't looking.

We've never been able to put away much money, and every time we do it seems that something comes along to cost us all our savings.  And now we don't even have a vehicle - though the public transit in our area is able to get us pretty much anywhere we need to go.

We recently had a baby boy, he's two months old now.  Our landlord is making us move into a larger apartment, which we move into tomorrow.  I sell phones for a retailer and make $10/hr plus commission, but after rent and bills I've figured I'm going to have practically nothing every month.  I'm already on food stamps but I just can't seem to save any money.

In short, my job is soul-sucking and will barely be able to pay the bills, much less allow me to save any money back for a safety net or any eventual forward progress for my family.  I wish I could just pack us all up and move somewhere else.  This area is just a quagmire, I feel so stuck.",31Aug2017,2

164,"My husband has worked for the same airline for over 10 years as a ground service agent (he waves the wands).  6 months ago he took a position as a team captain (TC) - essentially like a unit supervisor.  When he took the position, he kept his seniority.  As a 10 year agent, he has the ability to choose almost any schedule that works for him as there aren't that many people with more seniority.  This is important for us, as I'm a night shift RN so my work ""day"" spans essentially 2 different time periods.  

A little bit of background (I worked there for 8 years also, so we've seen a lot come and go) - when they first created the TC job position, they made it so seniority changed to when you took the TC job.  Meaning if you got in on the first hiring, good for you.  However, they quickly found out that the small $1 raise was not enough incentive for anyone with more than 1-2 years seniority to apply for.  This meant that the people in charge of leading an area typically had little seniority compared to those who had been there for much longer.  At some point (and I don't know the complete details), the HR department said that because all other city stations used company seniority vs position seniority, and they needed to change.  So the TC positions were restructured to follow company seniority.  

The station manager they had when he was hired quit, so the regional manager is currently filling the job as a temp.  She has decided that she wants to restructure the TC pool back to the way it was initially (apparently even though HR already said it couldn't be that way).  He initially planned to just step down back into his prior non-leadership role, but now they are telling the TCs they don't have the option to do that (even though they are short staffed and actively hiring for that position).  With the change, my husband will go from the #1 seniority position to #10 and more than likely his schedule will no longer work with mine.  

We are waiting to see this if this officially takes place, because as of right now, she's just talking about doing it.  If it does, he plans on going to HR to see what his options are as we relocated from another city for this position (we started in this city, moved away for awhile - he still worked for the company, just a different city, and then came back with the promise of the promotion).

Just curious if anyone has any experience with a restructuring like this.  Does he have any rights to his seniority since he was hired knowing that this was how the seniority was granted?  Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.  ",31Aug2017,2
165,"So i moved across country and I'm trying to find a job at the moment. I told myself coming here i don't want a repeat of my last job where I would have to go in at 2am and work on holidays and sometimes weekends. A few interviews later I get a job offer for Frito-lay. Going to pay pretty darn well to just be a merchandiser. Only problem is I have to drive my own car from store to store. 

But they require you to work on weekends and holidays...and I probably have to start my shift at 3am. This is exactly what i didn't want. I need a job and I'm going to get paid pretty well, but i don't wanna be apart of that anymore. 

I know school is the only answer but I don't even know what to major in. My first major was art because I can draw really well. But then I figured I won't make money because I'm not driven or competitive. I wanted to try and work for a comic book company and draw characters all day but me and everyone else. 

Now I'm doing computer science but only because I'm good with computers. I have zero passion for it. 

I wish i would of joined the Air Force after high school like I wanted. I applied to the local PD where I moved too. I took the written exam. But probably won't make it as I hear stories of people applying to over 75 departments just to get in. 

Maybe I should go back to school and become a art teacher. I don't know what to do with my life. I don't want to be a warehouse jockey for the rest of my days. ",31Aug2017,2
168,"So I have a friend we'll call her L she and I met years ago when we started a band. During that time I met a woman we'll call S,who I dated for 3.5 years. Throughout the time L and I were band mates, I felt we got very close. I've considered her one of my best buds. She also met my (now ex) S during this time, however they weren't close and rarely hung out.
So 1.5 years ago S and I broke up, because of her selfish reasons (money) but shortly afterwards, S and L and L's boyfriend were suddenly good buds and hanging out. Flash forward to last week, L is marrying her man in her homeland (Ireland) and S was invited and attended! I however wasn't even fucking invited! which hurt like hell.
I was invited to an after the wedding party in Edmonton, which feels like I was given a damn participation trophy. So naturally I was pissed off/hurt/rejected so I reached out to some mutual friends.
Guess what? S has been defaming me to our mutual friends after we broke up (saying I was abusive and she had to pay for everything - which are 100% lies) I found this out from more than one mutual friend of S and I. So now, I feel that L, has not only decided that she'd rather be friends with my ex than me, I feel like she's probably listened to, and believed the straight up lies from S who broke my damned heart which I haven't fully healed from. I feel like my friendship isn't reciprocated, or that L has chosen a side.
Am I wrong? Am I being selfish? Do I bother trying to save this friendship (I want to, I hold L in very high regard) If I do try to save it... how?",31Aug2017,2
169,"So my friend has been becoming more distant for about the past 4 weeks and I had no idea why. I asked if she was ok or if she wanted to talk about anything multiple times and she just got annoyed and angry that I even asked. 

From this I assumed she didn't want to know me anymore and she wanted to end the friendship so I just went along with it and didn't try to reach out anymore.

We went to reading festival together and the whole time it was pretty awkward for me. We were supposed to be going to Portugal with my family the next day but she texted me and cancelled 2 hours before we were supposed to leave. 

Her excuse was that I'm too negative and my attitude is draining. I had no idea that she felt this way and I was really hurt by it. That night we were texting trying to find out why she felt that way and she said that she thinks I have serious anxiety and I should get medical help. I was really taken aback and shocked bc I had no clue that she felt that way about me. Yesterday she told me that she also thinks I rely on alcohol and drugs - which I don't.

Now I can understand why she feels that way and I can see that I might need to work some stuff out but the way she said this to me was so rude and it seems like she just doesn't care about the result of her actions

185,"TLDR: Moved in with mom a year ago to help me financially, now I'm back on my feet but am feeling guilty moving out and leaving mom high and dry. 
A year ago I separated from my now ex husband. The separation left me in a very bad financial mess. I moved in with my mother, who rents a 2-bedroom apartment with my aunt and her two kids (12 yr girl and 17 yr old boy). The area where we live can be considered a bad neighborhood. My mom has been a pillar, she's been very supportive in everything and financially too; she charges me practically nothing for rent. Of course, there have been hiccups along the way. We share a room, her and I, so we are very cramped and have no privacy. My aunt's oldest, the boy, has gotten so obnoxious and is a know-it-all smart ass. My aunt herself is no picnic, she is always in a bad mood and bitches about everything, especially to my mother, which I find very ungrateful of her because my mother is always helping her financially or cleaning up her messes. The apartment décor is that of ""old lady"" with a touch of ""hoarder""; in this aspect my mom is not all innocent, she does like to save a mason jar or two. Anyways, a week ago, a co-worker mentioned that she was looking for a roommate. Her apartment is bright and in a beautiful, affluent beach city and it's close to my job. The rent is really reasonable, considering the area. However, it is more rent than my mom's. So in essence, if I stay with my mom, now that I am financially stable, not only can I pay all her/our part of the rent, but I'll have a good chunk left over for savings. I talked to my mom about it and of course she tells me I should do what ever makes me happy, she supports me and she will be ok...yes, I know, my mother is a saint!

So after I left the military I pretty much duh myself into this big hole of debt for about a year. Really all dumb mistakes as most young people do.

In case you are wondering how I did that here it is: 
 I left for the military the summer after I graduated highschool pretty much stayed on deployments spent my last year in the states where I bought my own car. That was actually a smart move I have no car payments. I got out did the stupid thing of trying to help my now ex when he got get kicked out. I moved back to my home state and got my own apartment.
The problem was I didn't know how to budget my money and never actually lived on my own. The only thing on credit cards I was taught was put all your bills on it then pay it off with your paycheck to build credit.  The problem was I didn't understand what 17% APR actually does and the credit cards kept ""charging"" themselves the interest and the payments and I didn't realize it.  Yes I should of been looking at my statement yes I know very dumb. 
Then I had problems with the roll road. I kept an automatic payment with the txtag but when I changed my license plate it didn't update in their systems so when I getting bills I would call they would check my account number say I'm good. Turns out the new license plate made a new account. So they took my to collections so instead of $400 in tolls and fees (50 in tolls) it's became $2,500 for the collection fees. I made a payment plan I'm down to 850 now. 
I also got into a car accident so $1,000 deductale (that's part of the credit card debt) but when I driving the rental the tire popped. I didn't do anything I was just on the highway it popped I pulled over got it towed and got a new rental. They went after my insurance I tried to fight it and lost so $1000 to enterprise. Thanks enterprise. So I made a payment plan with them. I think it's no $500 to pay off. 
I also have to pay back the VA my first semester in college I was working full time and going to school full time to get the extra GI Bill money so I dropped my classes over the first two months and eventually I failed some ( damn you college algebra and anatomy). So I have to pay them back for the classes and the housing money they gave since I stopped being a full time student (like 4 credits short) 
So I owe them $ 2,500. 


TL:DR 

Anyways here I am $23,000 in credit card debt ($3,000 on one with a 18% interest rate and the rest on the other with 17% interest rate)

$850 to txtag
$500 to enterprise 
$2,500 to the VA 

I know how to budget now. I'm trying to pay everything. I make monthly payments to the above stuff and use the rest on credit cards.
I just got a roommate and a promotion at work so I have some extra money to spend. And my question is which should I pay off first? Should I stick with monthly payments on the 3 places I owe which each are about 150 a month and out the rest of my money in the credit cards? Or should I put the majority of my money into paying off the three things and pay above the monthly payments then take care of the credit cards after? ",31Aug2017,1

195,"I'm a 17 year old female. My parents are traditionalist Christians, but a few years ago I left the religion, so now I'm the ""odd-one-out"" atheist of the family. It can get very awkward at times, especially during family gatherings. Growing up, their mentality was always ""masturbation is wrong and you shouldn't have sex before marriage"". Even now, my parents still treat me like a child when it comes to the subject of relationships, so I avoid talking about it at all costs.

Now onto the main part of the post: I have a reasonably high sex drive and even though I'm still a virgin, I have tried porn and masturbation on many occasions, but I always back out straight away. Not because I don't enjoy it, but because I instantly feel ashamed and embarrassed due to the ideas my parents instilled in me as a child. It's hard to describe, but it's like I have a subconscious/instinctual desire for sex, but on top of that there's a taught idea that tells me sex is bad/wrong. Also, every time I do try something, I'm held back by the fear of being caught by my parents (yes, I still live with them) since I know I'd get in huge trouble for doing anything remotely sexual (even something mild, like looking at a picture of a guy's chest. Yeah, my parents are pretty strict), which is another reason I can't enjoy anything.

Over the years, this has led to me never being able to explore my sexuality beyond watching porn for 5 seconds before closing the tab, half-heartedly masturbating but stopping before reaching climax, and feeling nothing but shame and embarrassment when browsing the Internet for ANY information related to sex - I'm not even talking about super-NSFW stuff like positions and techniques, I mean fairly innocent stuff like advice on how to use a condom or how to prevent STDs. It's getting worse too. I used to be able to control my desire easily, but recently it's started to reach a point where my lack of sexual fulfilment and constant fear of my parents is actually causing me a lot of stress. What should I do?

By the way, I probably can't move out of my parent's house until my early-mid 20's for financial reasons. Plus, even with the issue of my parents out of the way, there's still the fact that they've conditioned me to think of sex in a negative way, which is an idea I somehow need to learn to overcome.",31Aug2017,1
196,"So this morning on my way back from the store I got pulled over. The cop told me I was driving in a school zone so instead of driving 37 in a 35, I was going 37 in a 20.

Interestingly on the citation under offense information it says 'school zone: no.' Which being in a school zone was the only reason for the citation so this makes no sense.

Then I go back to the street I turned from and find out that the school zone sign is a mere 15 ft from stop sign which I turned out of (the sign is for the end of the school zone.) Upon testing I was only able to reach ~25 mph between the stop sign and the school zone sign when going max speed.

197,"Would like advice from anyone that's been in a similar situation.

So, I broke up with someone, over a year ago now, and although I'm pretty okay now, which I wasn't for a while, I realise I'm still not completely over them. I know logically there's no such thing as 'the one'. But basically, I have never felt as compatible with anyone else in my life before them, or since. And I've never been with someone that I was attracted to as much as I was to them.

I still think about them more often than I should. If I were to ask myself 'who is the person you most want to spend time with?' the answer is still them. And I don't want it to be. I really want to believe I'll find someone I like as much, I really have no choice.

I should maybe add that I also don't really understand the reason we're not together. We seemed really good together, but broke up I think due to poor communication, and complications with their ex. When a time came when they got back in contact with me, and we could potentially have gotten back together, they didn't want to, but wouldn't explain why. I've accepted it's not going to happen a while ago. It would be great to finally get an explanation - but if I never get one, I need to be okay with that too. 

So, that's the situation. It feels like no one will measure up to them. I don't want to feel like that anymore.",31Aug2017,1
198,"Hello, I'm a 28-year old male working as a computer programmer in the IT department of Fortune 500 company in suburban America. I have been unhappy in my career.

I see my friends getting into best companies like Google or getting their advanced degrees around my same age and looking very happy. But I feel like I have been a headless chicken for the past 6 years jumping from one job to another, never really happy and always ready to change jobs. 

It's only been 6 months since I started at this new job but I don't feel like I fit in here. The employees are mostly older employers, married or with families, who want to make a stable living and talk about their pets and weekend vacations. I don't find anything wrong with that, but it's just that I can't find anything to relate to them. I do miss having my job in the city but I moved out here to the suburbs because of the pay. I feel bored, uninspired and unstimulated, but stay here because in a way, I feel like I should still feel grateful to have this job. 

I actually started out with a business degree from a good public university and then worked for a few years, and then transitioned into a full-time programmer. The reason for that decision was that I was excited about technology and curious about what it's like to be a developer. I've spent the last 3 years programming and earning money in different companies, and did enjoy some of my time in this industry, but I think now that I'm 3 years in, I see that not all IT is the same. I did enjoy the startup environments far more than I do here at my current company where they put their programmers into these cubicle environments with gray walls and fluorescent lights.

I am very confused about my career. I do want to build something that I can call my career but don't feel strongly toward any field to go back to Master's Degree for as that will be a huge financial investment. I do know that I want to get out of this company but I don't particularly know how or what to do. One option is to focus really hard on my job and get a better job somewhere else but honestly, I think my passion for development has gone away as well. I love interacting and communicating with people from all walks of life and am passionate to learn about different industries that exist out there ... but computer programming I am beginning to realize is pretty heavily siloed and it's hard to get visibility into other worlds besides just tech and coding.

What would be your advice? My vision for the future is that I get to do some meaningful work, become more socially enterprising and create something that I can contribute to the world and pride myself in. I would love to bring my communication skills and technical experience to the table too. My parents just tell me to stick it out, spend few more years in a stable company like this and then perhaps I can find a new job somewhere else. I just want to live a more inspired, purpose-driven life ... and sooner rather than later. 

Thank you in advance,

It's not a nice hotel, it's one of those fleabag hotel you might stay at if you take a road trip and need to go somewhere that accepts cash or looking for the cheapest possible bed for one night. Recently it seems like the woman is hiding, she will barely open the door (literally only opens it a few inches and hides behind it) and send out a boy who looks to be about 10 years old maybe give or take a year, to handle the transaction. The boy never smiles sometimes his face is dirty, and even though it's afternoon he looks like he just woke up. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing a little girl there previously, but I have not seen her in weeks. Other drivers also notice  but the kid looks distressed  and the lady is sketchy . We've discussed our theories of what is happening, and I suspect the lady is on drugs or something and possibly prostituting.

So, my boyfriend and I are planning to go Universal in Orlando at the end of next month. We are both residents of Ohio. I have grandparents who have lived in Florida for over ten years now. I have spoken with them and they have no issues providing their Drivers License number when I order the ticket. However, I just read through the page that it says you have to have proof of residency when you go up to get your tickets. ([Site for reference]( https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/tickets-packages/park-tickets/fl-resident-prices/index.html) ) I asked a few friends who have been there before but they didn’t use the Florida resident price. Getting Florida Resident tickets saves $100 per person. 

Florida residents, do they actually check your ID? Non Florida residents who have been in this situation, were you able to get around them checking your ID? If I can save $200 for other things, I would love to, but I also don’t want to deal with trouble if they do check your ID.

215,"So there is this girl at work that I'm pretty into, we share a lot of the same interests and all that jazz, the only problem I'm having is approaching her. We've had a few quick chats, nothing special, and I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how to just strike up a good conversation with her.

First off, I'm a big guy, 6' 4"", overweight but told by literally everyone I carry it well and they usually guess my weight wrong by -75 pounds. Anyway I'm a big dude, so approaching anyone, they naturally become apprehensive. So there is my first problem, I don't want to come off creepy or anything like that.

Second, she works in a different dept than me and even though we can see each other from where I sit, walking over and and stroking up a convo is a little difficult because of work problems.

 The only thing I can think is to use our in company chat to try to strike up a convo but then again it's a little weird when some random dude you've barely talked to just messages you out of nowhere.

I would try on breaks but she usually sits alone and I can't tell if it's a ""leave me alone"" or ""I have no friends here"" kind of deal.

Basically I've made a few of these problems for myself, but also the workspace has and I just need a second brain to pick at the situation and give a clear solution

I tell him no, there has been a bedbug problem in our apartments so i feel it makes sense to leave bedding found in the trash where it is.  He brings it in anyways, this pisses me off, he and his friends get pissed off at me for getting pissed off.  Another example, weed.  He smokes weed, i'm okay with this.  but we signed a lease that said we wouldn't have any illegal drugs in the place.  I tell him find somewhere else to smoke it.  He doesn't.  I get angry, he and his friends get angry at me for getting angry.

And they want to supply a ton of alcohol (keep in mind we are underage).

I am 100% against this new plan, partly due to the large number of people but mostly due to the alcohol distribution. Our backyard is easily visible from a main road, and having 30+ people underage drinking outside will surely cause a visit from the cops. Plus we live in a crowded neighborhood so I'm concerned that someone may complain about any loud music.

My reasoning is like this:

Say he has $100,000

He spends $1,200 on a TV, which brings his total down to 98,800

He has 98,800 and is happy with his TV

I break the $1,200 dollar TV, It will cost 800 to get a new one

If I pay him $1,200 dollars, He will have 100,000 again

He pays for an $800 TV and now has $99,200

After I break and pay for the TV, he has $99,200

Hi all.

So I've been living with 3 friends since the beginning of summer as we prepare to head into our senior year. I've known two of them since the beginning of my sophomore year when I transferred, and the third since this previous year. The first two(A and B) have been close since the beginning and me and the other roomate (C) have been new friends to them.

Roommate C has outside friends/a BF so she's out quite a bit when not in school/work, while me A and B used to hang out a bit before we all moved in together. Me and A became fast friends and I consider him my best friend here(I'm pretty shy so I tend to have a small number of friends), and me and B are close friends but more casual.

However recently it's been kinda awkward between me and A/B. I initially thought it was all in my head as I'm an anxious person but I read on A's twitter(He doesn't know I know it, I know I shouldn't snoop but still) about being annoyed with me(The post was clearly about me). We've hung out a few times since school started back up and it seemed fine then, and I just thought he was getting his alone time before but now that I saw that tweet I'm afraid I'm too annoying and they both don't like me anymore. I've talked to A before about my social anxiety stuff and he's always maintained that if there's an issue he'll tell me.

I'm not sure how to bring up something like this, or if I even should. I don't want to say I read it cause I know I shouldn't be reading something not for me, but I want to know how I'm being annoying so I can fix it and be a better roommate.

Right now I have a degree in science, a 2 year one and going on for a degree in art. I love illustrations and writing and wish to do graphic novels and stories. On the other hand I love math, physics, natural sciences,  bio, coding, psychology, philosophy and many others. Not in that order. Even to the extent to get degrees in many if not all of them. It is like I have an unyielding desire to learn, think deeply, and figure out difficult thought provoking problems. Since I stopped gaming I spent that time learning more about all these subjects and it has super charged my desire for them all, but being that I like them for the sake of knowledge and desire to figure out the never ending questions I have about everything I can't say I quite have the desire to push these subjects into a job field yet I feel frustrated not having the real means to get education in the areas even the ones I like the most out of those with how pricy things are.

I have been battling what to do since high school and am not sure I will ever be satisfied with any one or two things, maybe me.

Right now I am learning art and doing some coding on the side since its the easier thing to learn while doing my art major and stuff. If there is a way to get to be in all these fields and make money just learning and knowing that would be awesome.

One big factor of worry is time, just not enough time to play with during the days to work with all this. Then the money of course, and even if its practical. What reasons would there need to be this outside of just me knowing and my deep thinking habits. I guess the desire for knowledge can be fruitless. 

Ive been thinking to use code and art to fund this life long expedition, mostly code. I have little worry about having a family. Never been quite interested in relationships and such so that has one issue down or distraction... until someday when my mind might change.

Conclusion or well summery:
I want to learn a lot, mindset dramatically changed or got a new ideal of life after quitting a time consuming habit. Started to reinvest into interests, desire to get high knowledge in multiple fields. Lack the resources. Boo

240,"This is.kind of.long. tl;dr - a guy wants to hang out with me all the time, i say no but feel guilty and dont enforce my boundaries and now I'm really stressed out cos he is being so pushy

Hi everyone. I've been feeling really stressed out by a friend of mine and I'm kind of confused by what to do because overall I'm having trouble reading the situation. It would help if someone could help me on that.

Let me start with that I am female and 20 yrs old. I met this guy, who we can call K, on my college campus a year ago. He came up to me one day as I was sitting on campus saying I had pretty eyes and we had a conversation and that was that. For a few months he was mostly just an ancquientence I would occasionally run into on campus.

When we ran into eachother and we werent busy we would talk for maybe 15-30 min, and we got along well. At some point he asked for my number but we never really texted much. He knew where i would usually sit and come by once a week to have a short conversation but that was about it.

I guess over time he wanted to escalate our friendship, meaning he would know where I would sit and come by and look for me on the regular. My bf wasnt comfortable with me being friends with K, and out of respect for my bf I tried to interact with K less. I told him (and perhaps I should not have divulged this) that my bf was uncomfortable with it and for the sake of my relationship I didnt want to talk to him as much. At first he respected it and wouldnt come look for me/text me.

Over the next maybe ~7 months, K has gotten quite obnoxious and PUSHY about spending time with me. He would text me all the time just to have convos even tho i asked him not to. Every day Im on campus I get a text from him asking where I am so he can hang out with me. He started pointing out my physical flaws too which was uncomfortable, but i brushed it off as a joke. 

It got.to the point that by around April or May, I was staying home as much as possible to avoid him. I dont wanna see him as much as he wants to see me, and I know my bf wouldnt be happy with us hanging out as much as he wants to hang out.

When I tell K (I've told him about three times so far) that I want to interact with him less, he doesnt really respect it. He says me and my bf are stuck in the 1950s, meaning uptight. He assures me he doesnt want to have sex with me he just wants to be friends (not that I asked). Or he'll get sad and say ""no one can replace you"" and ""I cant talk to anyone like i talk to you"". Luckily he didnt contact me for about 2 months during summer, after I asked him not to.

Well, now that schools in session he's back at it. The other day he was texting me and I said I had to go to sleep and he said ""okay, ignore me all summer then go to sleep. Like thats fair to me."" Which seems so out of line to me, and I just replied ""blah"". He responded "" lol sorry I just missed you"". When I went to school the next day he came to talk to me and seemed really withdrawn and sad. Today he asked again to hang out and at this point I feel so stressed at school cos I want to avoid him but I would feel guilty saying ""no i dont want to see you"" or lying about where I was.

I feel like he's acting very entitled to my time, manipulative, and not very friendly at all because my realy friends dont act this pushy and needy. I feel like he was just supposed to be an acqueintance but he wants something more intense than that and isnt respecting what I want.

But on the other hand, what if I'm just being socially awkward and anxious and he's just being a regular person? And i'm misreading the situation, being sensitive and uptight, and what if I'M out of line for feeling this way?

Either way, I just want him to distance himself so I can be at school in peace.

242,"This could get long fast, so I'm going to try to organize the issues.

I'm a 27 year old Black American female.

I am an uneducated, two time college drop out with 10 years of various positions in retail and food service. The highest position was three months as a store manager, but I was terminated. 

I have no car. No apartment since my lease ended. My best friend and I were originally going to move, but her car broke down. Now, I'm with my parents who are poor and who need me. 

My life is in shambles. I battle depression and very low motivation. I have no real ambition. All I want is a way to care for my parents and to get out of retail. I'd love a cheap car and my own place. 

I have $250 to my name right now. I am unemployed. I can't return to school until I pay $1000 and I have no college credits.

I don't have any real excuses as to why life is the way it is for me. I just have no motivation to live. I figure what do I have to lose by asking for ideas.

Should I try to get to Houston and pose as a refugee? Should I just follow my long term best friend and roommate and mooch? If I continue to stay with my parents who also don't have a car, in my very small town with no public transportation, I won't be able to get a good job. I can't save for a car. 

Honestly, I am so done. Ideas, anyone? Just talk to me...",31Aug2017,1
243,"Hey Reddit family,

I come to you once again. Actually this is my first post in r/advice so I look forward to seeing what you all can do. I just started an internship in DC (it's always been a dream of mine to work here), in a role that allows me to be involved in the politics game. I'm really grateful for that because it's giving me experience in a field I would potentially want to spend my life in, but I've got a problem. 

There's so little to do. 

I'm working in a state affairs team, and since most state governments have finished for the year, it's just kind of slow. So I work 8 hours every day with about 2 hours of actual work. I want to be productive, but there's only so much that can be done. 

Along with that, a lot of my staff is rather cold and unfriendly and my attempts to start conversation have been met with little success. Today I filled my extra time trying to learn coding languages (I have a bit of a background in it), so that was fine but I would prefer to build value for my organization. I want to work as much as possible though, because it is a paid internship. 

Any thoughts on how I can be more effective? Or if not, any professional-looking time wasters? If not it'll be a long 4 months. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope.

245,"My life has never really been in order. I was home schooled at birth by my Mother and she home schooled all 5 of her kids, I am the youngest, I've always felt a insurgency of disinterest towards me from my mother like she was always 'over it' when it came to me and it was pretty obvious at a young age because the child two years above me Charles got about as much attention as me and He's like me in the way that He hasn't done anything with himself besides work dead and jobs even though his academic ability has always been praise worthy, (mine was never praise worthy). I don't talk to really any family member of mine about anything because I really have nothing to talk to them about and our family never really communicates with each other too much anyways.

 My oldest singling was a very smart college drop out who left a full scholarship because of depression and eventually got married and was lazy till he and his wife had three kids and now he and his wife both have fantastic drive and careers and all their kids seem pretty smart too. My brother Charles, the second youngest, currently lives with him and works a basic job, saves 80% of what he makes and just plays video games or watches youtube all day when he's not at work

 My next oldest sibling married during her college and was always pretty independent and collected and was my best friend during my ages of 8-14. She let me move in with her for a couple years after my Dad kicked me out at age 17 along with my brother right when we finished high school. I eventually left her house because she was having her second child in a small apartment and her husband was finishing medical school because I was in a depressive spiral of failure and not doing anything for multiple reasons. 

the third youngest got married to her long distance relationship that she's had since she was 14 and their the same age and now their having their third child and they seem pretty happy. me and her always had a playful make each other hate each other complex but we get along great now even though we don't talk a ton.

My parents always fought about money basically my whole life because my dad was 'never letting my mom buy what she wanted' and my dad had a pretty high paying sales job but He always hated it but We grew up in white people suburbia. I didn't think we were poor by any means and I don't think my mom was financially strained by anything and she was always just exaggerating because she knew my dad saved basically all his money.

My parents got divorced when I was age 12-13 even though they had been fighting my whole life, my mom just took us to the edge of the state one day out of nowhere while my dad was recovering from a slipped disk and she calculated a divorce rape against him and even got all of us dependent kids to sign a paper that says we want mom to have custody (mom brain washed my sisters and they just told us what to do so we could go back home and leave the hotel) We all basically stopped talking to my dad and I basically dropped out of life, started to try to just be around people and we were home schooled so my options on friends I already had came down to about 4 people and they all understood everything and I eventually left the great private school my dad put the two youngest of us in, Me and Charles, and we went to public school. Public school was public school nothing really special, Charles dropped out within a couple month, I got expelled from public middle school in less than a year for one violent felony and got put on probation and all that good stuff. My Dad eventually got me away from my mom because probation just kept getting worse and worse around her and He quickly helped me get off probation. I got off probation, I started smoking weed again, I started not showing up for high school and basically dropped out three times. My dad moved me two hours away from anyone I knew and put me in a high school for high school drop outs and I finished school, got kicked out of my dads for being a do nothing person at age 18 and moved in with my sister. 

Now I find myself at age 23 living at my moms again because I lost my job and options in a depression pit while I lived on my own for two years before moving back in with mom. for the past almost 2 years paying her rent, failed one semester of college on grant money, no job for the past three months, no job history that isn't negative even though I have had maybe 18 places i've worked at, and I need to move out of my moms asap and I have friends that care about me and would be more than happy to have me live with them and they think I'm a blast but I've been so inconsistent with my life it's hard to imagine being any other person than like my brother Charles who enjoys trying to feel as little as possible because lifes always full of failure. It's impossible for me to really talk about anything in person to anyone even a paid therapist because I just break down and cry. I really want to get out of my head and take action but I have such little discipline and nothing seems worth doing. It's obvious to everyone I know that I'm insanely depressed and it sucks to see the look on their face because I can see them thinking about it when they talk to me because I look like someone who just wants to kill themselves. 

It'd be amazing if someone else made a TL; DR for me or maybe I'll make one later and I'm sorry this looks like it's been written by a second grader.

251,"So, as I keep getting told, I have my shit together. 
I have a house, a boyfriend, a good job. So, why should I be sad right? 
The thing is, on the surface I do have it all, but deep down I'm going fucking crazy. And really, none of it fucking matters anyway. Like, why do we care so much about what we have/don't have? Why do we strive for happiness so much, to the point that it makes us miserable? 


When I met my boyfriend I was only 18, I absolutely was not ready for a long term relationship. I was enjoying being young and single, getting ready to start uni and figure out who I am. Fast forward 6 years, we bought our house, I didn't want to do it, I didn't feel ready for such a huge commitment. I knew as soon as we got a mortgage that was it. No going back now, at least no easy way out. 
My job I love, but it's a pretty tough job, takes a big toll on my mental state. 
Now, I know this sounds like I'm just winging, stupid spoilt little girl who has everything. But seriously, I have absolutely no idea what I want, and it frustrates me, because I know it doesn't matter, it's all ridiculous really, just live life right? 
I've always been a 'fuck it' kinda gal, like, whatever happens, happens. But lately, I've realised maybe I need to grow out of that attitude? I feel like maybe I have too much to loose now for that way of thinking? 
But i can't help but feel like I want more. 
And some days, I think hey, fuck it, down the bottle of pills and just be done with it. Or, jump on the train and disappear. 

I always thought by 25 I'd have my life together, and I did, but now I'm doubting it all, and have no idea how to deal with it. 
And my bf has absolutely no idea how I feel, I have no idea how to tell him, because I don't know what it is I'd even be telling him. Every time he asks 'are you happy?' I just smile and say 'of course I'm happy'.
I think deep down he knows I'm not, and I think he's just as scared by that as I am. 

Anyway, I'm sorry this is such a long post. If anyone has made it to the end, thank you for your time. ",31Aug2017,1
252,"Firstly, let me give some back story. I used to work for an art store where I eventually ended up store manager within several months of working there. There was a general manager who was above me and I was constantly appraised for my work ethic and how well the store turned around since I started there (they were without a manager for several months and the store went on the wayside.) The owner of the multiple location business was generally a nice guy but he could, at times be difficult to work for. One day, the owner came into my store (which was my ""baby"" and I loved what I did and that showed in my work) and told me how great of a job I was doing. I was unaware that I was doing anything wrong in his eyes, which eventually would be the reason I was demoted and removed from the store. That same day, I was asked by the general manager to ask everyone in the store, including myself, to wear aprons as part of our work uniform. When I asked my employees to wear them, they flat out said no. When asked again, they began to essentially whine about it. So I called the general manager about what the best plan of action would be. From there, she called and spoke to my assistant manager about it and it turned into a yelling match. When they were done, the assistant manager knew that I was the reason she spoke to him and he called me out on it, essentially cursing and bitching me out (I’m abit of a pussy when theres confrontations). Next day, the owner comes to me and asks to speak with me in the office. As soon as I sat down, he said that I was demoted, to go back to the original store I had started in, and was to expect a pay cut. Reasoning for all this, as he explained was due to my sales sinking. At this point, I was only in the position for a couple months and I used to email my monthly sales (which also included the year priors sales) to the owner every month and as far as I saw they were on the rise. I felt at this point that I was being lied to and no longer wished to work for the company. Maybe it was petty on my part, but I was clearly upset as I knew it was a scapegoat reason to demote me. I am also aware that the owner, without reason, has the right to demote me for any reason. I eventually left, with a 2 week notice, about 3 weeks later. Jump forward 2 years, when I ask for my old general managers permission to use her as a professional reference. She also didn’t feel as if I was treated fairly and wished to pass on her position to me when she decided to leave as she felt that no one in the company, besides myself, was up to take the position. She just generally enjoyed my work ethic. When my new job, which I have already accepted and have been given the position, called her about my reference, she slipped up and stated that the reason I had left was a disagreement with the owner, but that she agreed with me. Basically, regardless of already being given the job and the fact that I may be over thinking this, I just wish to give a proper answer to HR in case they ask what happened that may put me in a bad light. Im just not sure what to say just in case I am asked that wont turn out to be a worse answer that needed. What would be my best response?",31Aug2017,1

258,"This is a bit of a long one but I would really appreciate any input, sorry if it's not the right sub.

Long story short, I don't think I am capable of feeling 'love' especially towards those I feel I should do.  I'm starting to feel guilty especially about my partner as she loves me very much and I don't want to turn around to her one day and say I don't actually love her especially as she's not in the best physical or mental health although she's making good progress. 

I have always done what appear to be 'loving' things for family and my partner out of what I understand as courteousness and more of what I believe what I'd do if I felt love towards them. I haven't felt driven by love but again what I believe a loving person would do. 

I can't be sure whether my feelings are or aren't loving but the fact that I am unsure makes me lean towards that it probably isn't love that I've felt. This is especially upsetting as I wouldn't see myself as a good person if all the times I've said I love you (which feels kind of uncomfortable for me to say to my closest family) turn out to be false. I wouldn't bring myself to spend my life with someone knowing I can't reciprocate the feelings people have for me plus I would have to always explain to people I know why I'm alone (which I actually enjoy a lot of the time).

I know there's probably not a way to test for one's capability of feeling certain emotions (please point me in that direction if there is) but any input/advice would be really appreciated.

""I have the official release date. I don't know if I should be super excited or feeling anxiety. For someone like myself who has spent over 17 years incarcerated being dropped off into a society where life is fast pace, no support, no family, no nothing can be overwhelming.

Here's some background. I'm a 20 year old male. It's nearing the end of my uni summer break. For the past two weeks, I've been exhausted and finding it difficult to concentrate, all the time - on conversation, reading, attempting to study etc.

Every day I sleep 7-9 hours, meditate and take a multivitamin. My diet consists of a lot of meat, fruit and vegetables. I also do a bodyweight workout/cardio/walk a few times a week. However, I don't get my prioritised task done i.e. studying. It should take up the bulk of my day, but I can barely spend half an hour on it.

Instead, I spend a lot of time surfing reddit, especially on subs like r/mfa, reading manga, looking for things to buy (fitness stuff/clothes).

267,"I am stuck between two career paths/university majors. 


One is economics, the other is physics/math/astrophysics. 


I would like to take economics with the end goal of being in politics. I also know that economics is a very versatile major with really high earning potential. Economics is a good stepping stone into things like law school and business. I realize that politics is a difficult career goal to aim for because you can't simply work your way up. Most people who are elected politicians have gotten there by chance. Even those who are so lucky as to become candidates are often never successfully elected. I am also far more interested in the policy side than the public relations side, but I do like to be front and centre, so I can't imagine an being an advisor or part of a politician's staff would be anywhere near as satisfying for me personally as being an elected member who can make impactful changes in policy. 


Then there's the subject of astronomy. This has been an interest of mine as long as I can remember, but I recognize that there is a legitimate possibility of me ending up in an unrelated field on a very low salary (such as a research position). There are other things I want in life, and unfortunately a low salary means having to sacrifice a lot of that. My dream job is, of course, a job at NASA or something like that, but again, the odds are quite slim and I don't know what else I could do with a physics/math degree that I would enjoy.

270,"I went on a summer trip with people from my school, when we were traveling back home I accidentally peed myself cos I thought I could hold it until we arrived.

I stayed in my seat and tried to hide it but I'm sure the person next to me saw it but didn't say anything. .  and afterwards when someone checked the bus they would have seen the seat was wet. Also when I walked after we arrived people probably saw me too.

I'm on my last years of high school and I'm so anxious because of what happened I can't even leave my house. . .

I don't know if I should try to change class or something?? Help?

271,I work at an autoparts retailer that I currently don't mind staying with but don't see this as my career. I was offered a job about a week ago from a marine company that would basically be sales of boats and customer relations. However I could become an assistant manager at my current job and next step after that would be general manager/ store manager.  The marina would start me at 50¢ more than I am making now after about 3 years of auto retail. I live in the northeast so the workload would slow in the winter months at the marina but I was assure it's a year round job. Not sure what to do. ,31Aug2017,1
273,"I have become increasingly concerned with the level of heightened anxiety I am currently struggling with. I have Aspergers Syndrome and I find social interaction difficult. Things in my life, are going really badly at the moment, and things seem to be rolling onto one another. And I could spend ages listing each one. But my objectives are clear. I just want a good life. I want to be happy. I don't want any anxiety.

I am sleeping a lot at the moment and I have really bad headaches. I have a chronic cold that is making my head hurt. I feel run down and lethargic. I have been diagnosed with having a folic acid deficiency. 

All of my anxiety started at around March, where the DWP cut my benefits by £20 a week. I live in the United Kingdom. The female doing my assessment was rude and bullying me. I put in a complaint about her, and I haven't had anyone talk to me since. She wasn't very nice and ever since then I went into a spiral of depression and things got from bad to worse. I was in hospital experiencing suicidal feelings. I have been falling out with neighbours and my Landlord. Even though my Landlord is okay with me now. 

I have OCD and chronically pick my skin, and some times can't help picking at it. I haven't seen the GP for ages. I can't sleep at nights. 

I am very lonely and want a girlfriend. Even though I can't find anyone for some reason. I try my best. I went on the dating sites but I found them very narcissistic. So I have come off them again.

Today, this neighbour started giving my grief. He had a parcel for me. Left by the postman. An amazon job. I told him I was late for work, which I was. He said. ''It will only take a second.'' I started to walk off. He goes. ''Well sod ya then, that is the last time I do a favour for you.'' I walked off and everyone took his side. Old boy he was. Around 80. Nice bloke. No idea why he was yelling at me.

I also had this support worker, who was making inappropriate comments towards me, even though he said it was banter. But I am not sure. 

I am really at a loss what to do right now. Does anyone have any advice? It would be appreciated. I am so depressed.",31Aug2017,1
275,"Tomorrow i might be going to this little gathering type thing to watch a football (soccer for the americans) game and my friend that i like a lot and have liked her for about 2 years will be there. Now here's the problem i want to tell her but i'm worried about 2 things. 1. i can't just ask her to talk to me in private it will be too obvious and a bit awkward. 2. i'm afraid that if i tell her during the little meetup she would reject me (i have no problem with being friendzoned btw it is a bit of a confidence killer but i don't really care) and after that we would both just act awkward and everyone else would figure out what's happening (or maybe she just tells her best friend and she would constantly tease me)
I just really need help here. The only way i can see myself telling her i like her is over text but that just seems extremely stupid but that's the only option that i can see.",31Aug2017,1
