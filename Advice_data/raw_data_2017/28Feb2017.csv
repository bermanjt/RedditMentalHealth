0,"Hi all, 
I'm moving states with my boyfriend and I'm debating on taking my 14 year old cat with us or not. 
Here's the story I'll try and keep this short and to the point. My cat is older and showing signs of slowing down, as many cat lovers out there, we know the signs... she has great days and what I would consider sad days. I know this is the beginning of the end thus I don't want to add any other unneeded stress in her life. She is my cat, yet my families cat as well. She grew up with our family dog and when he passed about five years ago, we knew she was quite depressed and sad about it. Two years pass and my sister up and decides to go get not one but TWO puppies.... yes without notice or any discussion on how we think my cat would react. Well, needless to say they hate each other. The one taunts her and tries to attack her every chance he gets. So, my cat basically rules the upstairs while they have the downstairs. 
So heres my battle and what I can't decide on. Do I take her out of the stress environment to leave my family members which she loves (sleeps with my parents some nights) or leave her because these are the only humans she knows and loves? I'm also worried as my boyfriend and I will be working a lot and renting a two bedroom apartment. This this enough space for her? Will we be there enough for her? Ughhhh please all I'm so lost. I want her with me, but I don't want the move to kill her (added stress), I also don't want her depressed with my parents around. I'm so torn I'm hoping you all followed my nonsense and can fill me in on some insights for my situation here. Thanks in advance!",28Feb2017,2
1,"I'm mostly going on a hunch here, as nobody that I can recall has said this to my face, but I think people think I act like I'm better than them sometimes (mostly talking about at work and with some friends).  Now, I confess, I do think I'm a pretty intelligent guy.  In school I was in the ""special"" enrichment classes, I didn't have to do much to do well, went to a great university, did some pretty cool things there, and just generally speaking I think that I just think differently than other people.  I don't want to say I'm a better thinker, because a) thats the very thing I want to fix b) how could you even judge that (we only truly know how we ourselves think and guess how others do based on observation, right?) and c) I think thats a very slippery slope - one that I think I might have fallen down without totally noticing, but it seems like I tend to see things in a way that others dont or cant and am very good at problem solving in various contexts.

That being said, I just feel like with a lot of the people in my life (moved to a new city about 1.5 years ago after graduating and had to start from scratch basically) I get frustrated because I have to clean up after them - metaphorically and literally.

I don't know how to balance getting so frustrated about people not understanding and/or creating more work for me.  I want to like people more.  I want people to like me more genuinely.  I have a good network of friends but I feel myself becoming more and more cynical towards them.

I've always valued humility but I don't think that is what I really give off anymore. I also really value honesty and realism and straight-forwardness.  Is it possible to balance all of these?

I was teased a lot by brothers, friends, bullies, etc. growing up and even to this day in friendships and I think that's made me really defensive/quick to snap back.  I don't want to be that way.  Maybe its because I've sorta grown up with a chip on my shoulder, but I feel like I've always had a target on my back while at the same time never truly respected.  It's weird, and I'm sure the result of a lot of this is putting myself in mental traps, which is why I'm airing this all out in search of some outside perspective.

What do you guys think?  Am I full of it?  What can I do to work towards fixing it?  It makes me cringe to think that others secretly think of me as some tool or bully or stuck-up.  Again that could just be me overanalyzing myself but it FEELS like that could be some people's impression.

Really appreciate any input :)",28Feb2017,9
3,"So early Saturday morning I [21M] woke up to the sound of my extremely drunk roommate [20M] trying to get into my bedroom. By the way, we don't know each other very well - we got randomly assigned the same apartment. So I opened the door to see what he wanted and he was slurring his words and asking me to ""help"" him. So I told him he should go to bed. He mumbled some other stuff then just grabbed my penis. I shoved him away from me, he didn't really react, so I just went back into my room, locked the door, and went back to sleep. 

I'm not psychologically damaged or anything like that. He's not even a little bit intimidating and I could definitely beat him in a fight if I had to. But still, I'm not sure if I should stay in my apartment. He sent me multiple texts apologizing and swearing that would never happen again. I've been living with him since August and I never would have expected anything like this. He usually just keeps to himself.

So I'm trying to decide whether I should move. I don't feel threatened by him at all, but it's still a little creepy knowing that my roommate wants my dick. I'm 100% heterosexual btw. What do I do, reddit?",28Feb2017,1
5,I've sacrificed and busted my ass for 4 years now and it doesn't feel like it's going to pay off. I don't know what to do. I have picked myself up so many times and kept going after a setback and I just don't know if I can do it again. I just don't know if I have the strength anymore.

11,"We can refer to me as pepper BTW. 

To start off; 
I've been friends with him for a very long time but we've only been close for a year or so.
Note: He might  have some mental disorder that causes him to not realize he's doing this, he even said to me once that he says mean things without realizing it but there's no way he doesn't realize this. 

So, I remember the first time it happened was just one day randomly. (We don't see each other IRL much BTW,  for a while it was once a week or once every two weeks but now its not a lot - Over winter I couldn't cause of weather, but now I just avoid it. )

He jokingly remarked that 
""Fattest kid ever attempts and fails to climb fence"" And I brushed it off.
And then later he said something like ""Pff, I thought you said that you never saw rounded people  back where you used to live."" And then he smirked and said ""We're looking at you, Pepper."" 

There also was an incident where they""accidently "" pushed me over because I was about to spoil a show for him, but I've brushed that off. It was super violent and I went flying btw. 

And when talking to him online, here's a few  incidents; 

I told him that a ""pretty test"" thing gave me 89%, he told me I was more of a 50%. I mean it's not that bad but meh. 

Again, he said that I was a 5/10. Not bad, yes, but still kinda jerky. 

And when I asked him jokingly if I was an upgrade from his old best friend, he said ""both. Not in the look department tho""


And theres a bunch more like that I guess. 
Also another thing,  he typically ignores me when I send art I'm proud of or even something I made for him.

NOW, HERE'S THE COMPLICATED  PART.
1. He's my only close friend irl. 
2. I use him as an excuse to be on my phone. I have a lot of online friends but my mother does not approve of them so I just say ""I'm talking to -his name-'' whenever my mom asks what I'm doing. 

The reason I cannot make new rl friends is because I have social anxiety  and am home schooled. 

(For those it may concern, I'm 5'5 and 180 pounds. So yeah pretty fat I guess.)

14,"*apologies for any grammatical errors in advance* 

My boyfriend's best friend is dating a girl who is rude to my boyfriend and myself. She thinks she better than everyone given her family's comfortable middle class status and is horrible rude to everyone who is slightly different than her (example: She will call anyone who isn't vegan a psycho or diss anyone who doesn't love The Grateful Dead.) I have no problem with her life choices, but she was making fun of me on social media so I blocked her. I regret that as it caused a huge fight as I'm a ""crazy psycho stalker"" then she blocked me on all of her accounts and my new account. Even today, instagram suggests her as someone to follow and she blocked me despite me not interacting with her. She doesn't want to be civil, but I don't want my boyfriend to lose his friend.

24,"25 years old, recent college graduate, lost on life and need to rant/ can use some advice on what my current direction needs to be.

I left my first job as a Software Developer due to a combination of the environment I was in, inexperience, an admitted lack of interest and passion, growing tensions between myself and my then girlfriend, etc. I've just passed the anniversary of my unemployment, and as anyone who has been without a job for an extended period of time knows, the job search has been both emotionally/ psychologically taxing. I finally felt as if I’ve found a light at the end of a tunnel when I received a message for a phone interview not too long ago. Without going into specifics, it was for one of the first companies that I applied to when my unemployment began, when I was making my decisions based on passion and personal interests. The job itself was right up my alley, incorporating aspects of my interests, academic background, and goals. Needless to say, I flipped my sh*t the night that I received that email. Passed the phone interview, and worked incredibly hard in preparation for the following onsite, which I left feeling semi-confident about, and knowing that I did my best.

It’s been two weeks since then. I’ve since followed up with the hiring manager on the expected reply date, who reassured me that I’d get a reply ASAP. While two weeks is admittedly not a particularly long period of time to wait, the anxiety that’s resulted has been absolutely devastating. I'm constantly plagued with worries related to not getting the job, which has caused me to not eat or sleep well. Add on the fact that I'm hard pressed for money has further brought my motivation to continue my regular job hunt to an all time low. The only thing that really gets me through the week nowadays are the plans to meet up with friends on the weekend.

I really could use some advice in regards to alleviating the stress that comes from waiting to hear back, to stop distracting myself and to get back onto the job hunt. Thank you for anybody that took the time to read all of that, and any comments/ experiences to share are more than welcome.",28Feb2017,1

I fucking hate believing how I do I wish I could enjoy my life and stop desiring to be a woman, I won't do it but I just wish I could get rid of that thought I have tried but it keeps coming back. In almost everything I do I have to think about it. It is fucking annoying. I don't know how to get rid. And I definitely do not want to do it because I just simply don't and the probability that you'd pass and be somewhat pretty putting aside, being huge and bulky, most of transwomen don't pass TBH.

First, I was wondering how exactly I am supposed to go about getting these affairs in order? Do I visit a lawyer? Is it cheap? 

And the other thing I was sort of wondering, and is very odd (I'm an odd person), is am I REQUIRED to have a funeral? See, I'm a very introverted person. I don't like the idea of a lot of people gathering together to look at me in a coffin. I also don't feel comfortable inside churches, and hate the idea that I'd be in one during a funeral. Ideally, I'd like to just get cremated immediately with no embalming, have my ashes delivered to my relatives, and they can do with it what they will. No funeral. No church. No obituary. I just want to make it a simple, cheap affair if at all possible. Is that even allowed?

30,"Backstory: Me and my partner own a dog. The dog's always looked a certain way, one day my partner decided to change the way it looked, essentially making it look like more of a show dog, something that I extremely dislike. Stupid thing to start an argument over, right? Incredibly small. 

Anyways, I stood my ground, saying that I just hated the way he looked, and he doesn't look like himself anymore.

She, on the other hand, is keen on pushing that the dog has, indeed looked like that his entire life, and that nothing has changed.

It seems to me as if she's saying no to changing the dog back simply because she wants to say no. 

She happens to have a major in psychology. She worked in the field for quite a while. But she isn't all there, herself. She's got MS, something that can do a pretty good job at fucking with your head. So, she's convinced that I'm insane for two reasons, 

A), because I've ""become so fixated on a topic for so long."" Even though we've only been arguing about it today. Not even at the start of the day, this started like five hours ago. (Also nevermind the fact that it's difficult to view this as a symptom of insanity)

And B), because I'm ""crafting conspiracies"" about her, saying that she's saying no because she doesn't want my opinions and is disagreeing with me purely for the hell of it.

And my reasoning for why B) isn't valid will require a bit of backstory, I'm an aspiring author. I write shit here and there, nothing special, or good for that matter. I tend not to release my work, I want to create the best thing I can before showing it off. Not even she sees what I write.

Recently she's been crafting her own conspiracies about my writing. She seems hell bent on the idea that I'm writing about her, about how much I hate her, or how much she's ruining my life... which I'm not. She's become quite the narcissist. Everything MUST be about her, right?

So it's a little hypocritical of her to think that way about me. Then when I call her out on it, it's simply me being ""rude"".

It's likely hard to believe that I don't hate her after all of this. Because I don't hate her. I owe her a lot. It's just that I'm not keen on getting called insane. She's begun saying that I'm gonna need to see a therapist because I'm not right in the head, and it's very concerning because she's done this with other people. A lot of other people. Her logic tends to be, ""I'm never wrong. Those who disagree with me are either idiots or mentally inept and deserve to be hospitalized.""

Hell, she even wonders why I'm talking to random people on reddit like she's my mother concerned about me talking to strangers. I don't want to rush to a conclusion, but it's almost as if she thinks I'm cheating on her or something.

And yes, I know that many people here aren't qualified to identify mental illness, but I just want another opinion here because from an outside perspective, the entire thing is pretty fucking hilarious. ",28Feb2017,1

35,"Background: I grew up with an alcoholic, verbally and sometimes physically abusive father. I was the oldest of 5 children. I went no contact when I was 16, which was 7 years ago. (My parents were divorced which made this possible.) Briefly after my first son was born, I began low contact with my father. It lasted for about 6 months. He lived with his parents and his gf so it made it easy to be around him because of the other people to kind of buffer anything other than light conversation. When we moved away, he gave us $600 to move into a house quicker. I accepted this selfishly, thinking it was the least he could do since I wasn't financially taken care of as a child. About a month after we moved, he went to prison for about 3 years for a probation violation (drinking with an ankle monitor on, go figure). When he was released I did not speak to him. I question now why I spoke to him at all for the brief period when I KNOW I wasn't ready. He is currently in prison again (a probation violation) and I am living with his parents.  He has been diagnosed with manic depression and I know that he began drinking at a very early age so I believe he has not been able to mentally mature. 

I know I gave him, and his family, a false...not sure the word..for speaking with him for a while. The resentment I hold towards him affects my relationships with my husband and children, and my everyday life. I'm not sure what steps I need to take in order to forgive him...and to possible reinstate contact.

She was able to pull the funds together to fully pay off the car. She wanted to get the car paid in her name so she went to the dealership and paid it off. Shes received proof of purchase from hyundai. Hyundai has cashed the check she wrote.

So here's the deal. I'm on probation at work, and have about 30 more days to improve myself to the standards set by my boss. I've wanted to leave the job for a few months now, and this has put me over the edge to finally leave and find something else. 

Through this year, i've accrued 1 week of Paid Time Off (PTO) (40 hours worth)  plus i have some personal days (24 hours) for a total of 64 hours of paid time off of work.

So here's my question. When i leave the company, i don't get paid for the PTO or personal time that i have earned. so ideally what i'd like to do, is to leave the company with 0 hours remaining (or as close to 0 as possible). How can i achieve this without getting fired. 

I'd like to just say, i'm taking a weeks vacation, but i feel like they might not like that and let me go right then and there.

I've got some interviews lined up for other companies, and had a really promising phone interview for a significantly better position (10k+ more in salary) so i've got a little bit of a safety net. 

Financially, i could be without a job for 3 months and be fine, but it'd be nice to not have too much of a gap between jobs.

Tiny House Option:
This option entails me spending $20,000 - $25,000 building a tiny house and paying $6,000 a year (for the three years) to park it at $500 a month. Adding my tuition for the 2 years this will add up to be a total of 69,000. The silver lining being it is 1) my place and 2) mobile.

This time I answered a question about data and recommended a good place to get his computer repaired. When we get done talking he hands me an envelope that's like a greeting card. I don't think much of it and think it's just a thank you card. So I get home and open it and it is a thank you card. But inside is a $50 bill. I definitely was not expecting to see that and I definitely don't feel right taking it over something that took us less than twenty minutes to get solved for him.

My question is if I can even find away to get in touch with him what should I say? I don't want to sound ungrateful or say I could get in trouble and him feel guilty or anything like that. But I just don't feel right accepting that much money over something so small.

50,"Father has worked in software for a few decades, but now is nearing sixty, and has been unemployed from a full time job for maybe 1-2 years. 

He's not the most desirable candidate technically and socially, but in the past there's been some place that's had room. Maybe a decade ago, he also had a few years without unemployment, and eventually found something. Maybe his current mental state and a string of rejections made him more aimless and unmotivated. 

Financially, I think the folks will manage OK, but I'm more concerned about him spending the next 10-20 years at home. He's been basically void of human interaction other than with Mom, and consuming lots of FOX news. 

Not sure what practical actions are available. Would like to hear if anyone figured out or ran into an approach for this situation. ",28Feb2017,1
51,"People said I shouldn't keep asking this now that she's dead but I can't just shake off the fact that something's wrong with it.

My best friend and I know each other since middle school and we're really close. We tell each other secrets and ever since we left to different cities for college back in 2012, we make sure that we leave something on our group chat, no matter how busy we are or that we can't stay for conversation. We ALWAYS leave at least 'hi' once a day, to make sure the others know we're still alive.

I went to pharmacy school, and she went to study psychology. She was there when I took my oral exam on thesis and vice versa. She wrote a thesis about pathological lying disorder on criminal behavior and graduated in three years.

Now that I think about it, it was the moment when she started to change. She didn't continue her study in grad school even when she needed it to start her own practice. Instead, she told us she took a job with someone she knew from University and the next thing we know, she begin to fly to another countries like, three times a month. Like she could told us she's in Amsterdam today and suddenly she's in Dublin the next day. We never really question that because her parents seem fine with whatever she's doing.

Fast forward to 2016, she said she would be spending Christmas at Milan, Italy. She was still active on group chat during that time but rarely mentioned about Milan whatsoever. Then around January 2017 she came back to our country for about four days. We went to karaoke, hang out and everything, then she left again.

On February 7th we lost contact with her. She deleted all her email, and social media accounts. Two days later we called her parents, but they said she's fine.

On February 18th her parents just begun to search for her. She never reply any of our chat (we use an app called LINE) and it's literally the only thing that hasn't been deleted. We also found out that she'd never been to Milan on the first place when she claimed she did. At least according to Immigration.

On February 25th we found out that she'd passed away at Ticino on February 9th.

I came in contact with one of her friend online, and found out on the day she vanished from our radar, she posted some sort of cryptic posts on that website/forum but it got deleted at some point alongside with my friend's account.

I thought she was sick or something and ended up in a place far away from her hotel or something but when I saw her dead body for the first time, she didn't go in a good way. Here's what I learn.

1) Her body was found in a hotel room, she was fully clothed, but no one remembered her ever coming that hotel on the first place.

2) She didn't have any ID with her. No belongings whatsoever. 

3) She died due to massive brain injury. According to the doctor who did the autopsy, there should've been chance she survived if she seek medical help on hospital but there was no record of her going to any hospital so it's possible that she was just slowly dying without treatment.

4) There were so many injuries caused before she died, like bruises and cuts and all like she was beaten or something. What's more terrifying is that, she had marks on her ankle and wrist suggested that she was tied for a very long time, like, weeks.

And now she's dead, and we can't ask her. I know I should just let it go, but I can't. Especially since her parents are doing nothing about it, so does police, and there's no one willing to seek for answer and I can't sleep thinking about how she's always been there for everyone but no one cared when she died in the most questionable way.

UPDATE:
This is the last comments my friend posted in a website/forum she'd been a part of. I found out about this group from her LINE's timeline (she liked to use her timeline as bookmarks, something like that). I contacted the moderator and this is what the moderator has:
*""so this is where you've been hangin out while im gone"" - february 6th
*""yo! i am alive! “ψ(｀∇´)ψ surprisingly""
*""besides getting robbed in milan last christmas? it is all pretty chill lately.
*""yeah... it's kind of a weird story. so i went to milan for christmas and semester break right? and then i got robbed and lost all the essential stuffs like wallet and laptop and tablet and passport and student visa and any other things, and i got tossed from [xxxxx] embassy in milan to rome and i only have my phone and like, 20 dollars on my pocket. so it was pretty crazy holiday but hey, free trip to rome~ ""
*""you guys are lame, i left grad school so i don't have to deal with homeworks pppfffttt.
jk, i'm only taking hiatus this semester. i lost $50k, i gotta work baby, i'm broke now""
*""okay since nobody seems to give a shit about good ol [her name] i guess i'm just gonna leave.""
*""i thought we were friends. i guess it's noy from both side mkay should've seen it coming""
*""goodbye then. for good.""

I'd like to point of few things. She never went to grad school, which is weird because she graduated with 3.9-something six months earlier than everyone else, actually got offered scholarship by major universities and knew like, eleven languages. And she's actually quite wealthy so we never really understand why she ditched everything and take a shady job no one know instead.

I'll try to look into my personal conversation with her, and let you know if something strange popped up

The email said she found his email address on a popular dating site, but that she couldn't remember which one (my dad once had a Match.com account but shut it down a while ago). There was a photo attached of an extremely attractive young woman. I ran a reverse image search on the picture but nothing came up. 

Here is the picture. http://imgur.com/T16yd2E

I also ran a Google search on the email text but nothing came up there, either. In subsequent emails she told my dad that she lives in a remote village and has to drive into a city to make a call. She sends her emails from a satellite Internet cafe. He gave her his phone number yesterday but she has not called yet.

She is purportedly planning to come to the US at her own expense. My dad is swearing he won't share any financial or credit info.

This can't possibly be legit, right?? I wish I could prove to my dad that this is just a hoax but I can't seem to come up with anything concrete. If anyone could help me prove this is a scam or recommend any tips for uncovering the truth that would be great.

In my 10th year, I was failing a class.  I was juggling my schedule to favor my honors class more and I just couldn't keep up.  One day in class I was kept to myself, reading a book before the lecture started, before the teacher began yelling at me.  I was so confused at first, but the yelling continued- He said I was a failure.  I was an idiot for not trying.  I was stupid for not asking for help.  That I wasn't going to graduate.

I had a total breakdown.  I went back into my eating disorders and lost 30 lbs in 2 months.  I believed him.  I tried to commit suicide by deeply cutting my wrist (if I knew it wasn't going to work, I would've tried another way).  My parents?  They locked and shut me up.  I wasn't to ask for help.  My father told me I was his worst mistake.  I regretted surviving.

I'm scared to tell my parents I'm feeling this way, and trust me I have before.  They just wont listen.

I can't graduate.  I asked my parents if I could go to a charter school, but they gave me the silent treatment.  I've written my note, but I need to get my reason clear.

Furthermore, I have to wait until this Thursday to go on the date because we're both so busy, and during that time I've become increasingly aware that some barrier seems to have come up between us; some kind of awkward tension. We talk less and she seems to be avoiding me for some reason; also no longer contacting me. I understand that our relationship is kind of in an awkward limbo right now because we're in between being friends and romantic partners until the first date makes things feel ""official,"" and also that she may be scared because she's a little inexperienced with relationships; but it really really hurts me that she's avoiding me. It especially doesn't help that I was emotionally abused by my significant other in my last relationship the same way; ignoring my texts, avoiding me, etc. What should I do? I really like this person and I know that they're not doing anything wrong, but the relationship doesn't seem to be starting out so well and is causing me enormous stress.

Background on me:

- I'm 19, female, and black.
- I'm in my 2nd year of college - I plan on graduating a year early. 
- My father sexually abused me for 7 years (5-12; took my virginity at 11)
- I've always had friends - never close friends. 
- Never close with any family members. 
- I'm introverted, but not shy. I know how to talk to people, I just don't. 
- I've dated quite a few *men* from age 18 to now (all white; this seems to be my preference) 
- I fell in love at 16 and that destroyed me in multiple ways (we dated for 2 years, then one day he didn't reply to my text messages - haven't heard from him in over a year - first person I opened up to)
- Major eating issue (I've lost and gained up to 40 pounds *multiple times* over the past 5 years; I eat too much or too little + exercise too much or not at all) (I'm one extreme or the other, I'm a master at losing and gaining weight)
- Seen 3 separate therapists (first 2 for depression, 3rd for eating problem - no help)
- I've called suicide prevention twice, nothing useful for me there.
- Made one suicide attempt at 15.

Recent stuff that has me down: 

- Not doing so well in school this semester.
- I feel behind and have anxiety about grad school, interships, jobs, future (paying off loans etc...) 
- My body issue is getting worse (I've barely eaten the past 3 days except this special laxative tea)
- I feel hated - more than usual. I feel uglier and fatter than usual. Sadder than usual. Invisible more than usual. 
- Not feeling connected to anyone (campus is full of immature guys, and SJWs)
- Starting to realize I have *no one* in my corner (no friends, family, professors, animals, guys) (been at college nearly 2 years and have made no solid friends; only thing that keeps me sane/feeling normal are the men I date)

I wouldn't call myself optimistic, but I always figured there was more for me in the future so I kept going. 

I've never wanted to give up this badly before, I'm finding it very difficult to see past this...

Even when I tried to compromise with her, she didn't want me to see her. Was I wrong for going? Or am I just overthinking this?",28Feb2017,1
91,"I need to come up with $2,000 by the end of Friday, I'm guessing that getting a small loan from a bank such as Chase is my best bet? Is there a better option I might not be aware of?

I lost my job recently and unemployment has yet to come in (taking more than a month). I need to cover rent and some additional bills since I need to leave my apartment and live with my parents. I will be able to repay a loan once I relocate and start working again.

I am currently maxed out on my credit card with Wells Fargo (this is why not asking them for a loan, but I might try WF if Chase turns me down) and think Chase is my only chance of being able to cover my bills while I wait for unemployment benefit to come in. I am just not sure what to do.",28Feb2017,1
93,"So I guess I want to know if I should seek help for being a sociopath? There's nothing to really do about it, so I'm fine with just going on with my life.

I'll give examples of my sociopathic tendencies:

I'm unfaithful in relationships. For some reason I'm able to keep my relationships going for a long time, even though I've been caught cheating on them and just being really shitty in general (barely putting in effort). They always come back to me though?

Another thing is my ability to manipulate them into apologizing to me, even though I'm the one in the wrong. Also, I know just what to say to make the other person feel like complete shit. It's easy to hone in on insecurities. This makes them feel terrible about themselves so they try to get me to love them back.

I get upset very easily but also am able to calm down rather quickly. It's like if someone makes me upset then I'll take a mental note of it and get them back later somehow. Ex: my SO made plans w/o me so I went on a date with someone else the next week. My SO is very emotional and I find that this often upsets me more than anything. I hate how easily she cries.

I think my charm comes naturally. People want to talk to me at parties. My charm also helps in getting jobs. Several times I've been hired for a job that I'm not at all qualified for. I also see getting someone I find attractive to fall for me as a sort of competition, and then I'll leave them as soon as they do.

I don't know what else there is? I guess I do lie constantly. Even with just little things like what I did today. It's kinda like I'm too tired to tell the truth, so I'll just give them a lie. I've read that sociopaths don't really care emotionally for anything, but I do care very much for my boxer. I've been told that it seems like I love her more than other people so idk what that means? Another weird thing is I have this type of OCD where I pick at the skin on my fingers. Don't know if that has anything to do with sociopathy though.

I know I'm a shitty person. I just want to know what you guys think I should do.

He noticed small things in conversation and has narrowed down to where my girlfriend lives and has even asked me why she wasn't at school one day when he saw her car still in her driveway (his bus goes by her house he told me).

98,"I should start by saying Ive never posted anything on Reddit before but I think I'm familiar with how it should go, I found this sr while looking for a good place to ask for advice, seems like the right place so let me begin. I'm 15 years old, male and have had trouble with inattentiveness for as long as I can remember, I easily get distracted and find it incredibly difficult to focus on tasks that take lots of mental effort for long periods of time with no reward until the end. For example just last Monday my L.A teacher assigned for us to write a narrative in which our character must overcome and obstacle, it was due for today and I did finish but during the weeklong work period I wrote 3 intro paragraphs for different story ideas because I didn't like the last one and it took until Sunday night at around 8:40 pm to start my actual story, I did a bad job limiting distractions as it took until 12:30 to finish 3 paragraphs all of which took up 2 pages in total (front and back) During my mad attempt to finish it as fast as I could I disregarded the criteria and was missing several key details that I only discovered in the morning after a night of horrible sleep. I've been thinking that I could possibly have add my sister who is 19 right now has it and has been on medication since she was around my age maybe a year older, and my mom had it when she was younger, I brought up the idea that I could have it to my mom after my sister suggested it to me my mom was willing to take me to see a doctor about it but that was a year ago and I never went because of my tendency to put things off and not bring them up for long periods of time, my dad believes I don't have it as ""I never get distracted when I'm playing video games"" which I do a lot and feel it contributes to the problem. I want to know weather anybody knows if my symptoms are similar enough to those of someone with add that it's worth to see a doctor about treatment and medication. To clarify my symptoms, I get distracted easily, I can't dedicate a lot of mental power to a single task for a long period of time unless I'm stimulated to some extent, this means I get bored easily and move on to a new exiting activity until it gets boring, I do struggle with anxiety and social awkwardness however I have been getting over that quite well in the past months.

105,"I'm fresh out of college and there are many apartments in my price range, but because I still have to go on the cheaper end, the quality of apartments is very mixed. Some are reasonable, and some are just over priced pieces of shit. 

My current and first apartment has been a disaster. When I first signed the lease the exterior was recently renovated and the interior got an up to date kitchen and bathroom. But the electrical and plumbing are still archaic and from the 70s. I've had to switch units due to sewage problems, only to move to a unit with bug and electrical problems. Also this past couple of months a rather aggressive hobo camp has moved into the nearby park, and have been destroying our outdoor laundry area on a weekly basis. Every new tenant approved for my building is loud and is a smoker, despite it being a no smoke building. I like weed as much as the next kid, but it's overkill and fucking rude to sit on your balcony and light up for hours, blowing the smoke into other people's units. My landlord has seemingly gone off the grid, and the company he works for refuses to take direct calls and forwards me to the landlord who won't pick up. 

I am in an absolute dismay. I did so much research into this before signing this lease. I asked the neighboring units what they thought of the place, I looked the place up online, and it's so close to campus that there's a set of dorms across the street (which at the time seemed like it was a plus for security, but apparently there was some liability thing and they've stopped sending security down here). I read through the lease agreement thoroughly. I brought my parents along to also get a second opinion. I have no idea how I missed out on how sleazy this place was/was going to be. 

To all the veteran renters out there, what did I miss? How can I prevent this from happening when I go searching for a new apartment?

108,"Here's the rundown: I'm a senior in high school, and I'm in the highest level theatre class. As an end-of-the-year project, a few students choose and direct a one act play. I decided I would direct a show this year. I ended up casting my best friend as the lead (no bias involved). However, there are a few problems with this. 
The first and main issue here is that he has a terrible work ethic. He never does any of his homework (at home, anyway). This carries over to theatre, too. Last year, during the same project, he did not memorize the show he was cast in, and they were forced to cancel opening day. I knew this already when I decided to cast him, but I had talked to him and he promised that he would not let the same thing happen again, especially due to how close we are. 
The second problem is that he was also cast as a lead in another student's show (even though this was strictly not allowed by our director, she let it slide). So, he's the lead in two shows at once, and has until May 20, opening night, to be ready. 
My question and my plea to you all is: how canI help him? How can I motivate him to do the work that needs to be done? I'm sad to say I'm very worried the show will flop because of him. I really want him to succeed not only for my benefit, but for his as well.

Traditionally my massage school’s teachers training program (TTP) is a 2 to 3-year-long unpaid teacher assisting (TA-ing) apprenticeship However, my massage school in the summer of 2015 replaced the old apprenticeship with a new and accelerated TTP in which the bulk of the training would be crammed into nine months as “Tier I”. Then selected students would be invited to Tier II &amp; III and “simultaneously” begin earning back their tuition at $10 an hour, teaching classes supervised. Once teacher trainees could teach solo he/she would begin earning $15/hour as an instructor. However, Tier I cost $1,350 and required nine months of weekly Tier I classes (~150 hours) and weekly (TA-ing) (~150 hours). The head instructor/TTP manager, Nathan explicitly told us that the newly implemented TTP tuition was “kitty money” for the paid supervised teaching position since previously the old TTP apprenticeship didn’t cost money, nor did it pay.

I did not like the high cost of money and time for little financial return and the unknown costs of Tier II and III, but I loved the school and wanted to teach there. So in 10/2015 I along with three fellow massage school alumni enrolled in Tier I of our massage school’s brand new TTP and we all graduated in 7/2016. However, also in 7/2016 our massage school was sold and our head instructor Nathan suddenly left in 10/2017. Moreover, TTP’s Tier II and the paid supervised teaching positions never started! Soon after Tier I ended the other three students stopped TA-ing, but I still continue to this day to TA in class almost every week.

Once Nathan left another massage instructor, Ellen took over the TTP. Ellen told my classmate around 10/2017 that the school decided not to select any of us for the paid teaching training positions, but only selected us to continue onto Tier II. All four of us were frustrated so in 12/2016 we wrote an email to the new owners of the school, asking for help in getting a full refund, and two of us even met with one of the owners in person. The new owners seemed sympathetic, but a few weeks later in 1/2017 we received an email stating there were some “slight discrepancies” in our version of the story vs Nathan’s and the previous school’s owner. Next in 2/2017 the old school owner offered to give us each ¼ of our TTP tuition back because “the program was delivered as intended but the path forward towards employment has changed due to the sale of the school.”  

None of us are happy with this offer. In 1/2017 I asked Ellen about starting Tier II, and she said that our email to the new school owners was an “inappropriate,” “entitled” “ultimatum” that falsely claimed that we were promised paid supervised teach positions in Tier II. Ellen does not feel we’re ready to teach supervised whereas we do. So now we’re working on a response email while Ellen may be trying to replace us by reaching out to at least one other alumnus (who told me about it) to sign up for another new costly TTP. Ellen may have been offended by email and may now want all four of us out of the TTP.

Since I first enrolled in 2008 at this massage school I have probably taken more than 700 hours of classes and TA-ed over a thousand hours at this school. In 1/2017 I asked the school about my continuing teacher training, and the school replied in 2/2017 that they are coming up with a new teacher training process going forward and will let me know more as it becomes clearer.  I’m in limbo. I am also tired and bored of TA-ing because as a TA I mostly just observe class and during classroom massage-table practice time, I walk around and massage students and answer student questions, and clean up afterwards. I know my massage school is probably broke, but I’m surprised how they aren’t interested in resolving these discrepancies, but am instead appear to be dissolving this TTP program entirely with a dismissive ¼ tuition refund offer. I want all of us (the students and the school) to talk together under the city’s free mediation services to resolve our differences and come to a more fair solution, but mediation may offend them more and I don’t want to ruin my chances of one day teaching at this school. What can I do to help the school agree to take more financial responsibility for the delay and possible end of our TTP program? After all, this school’s massage modality is proprietary and we can’t really use our training to teach it elsewhere. 


TL;DR I am one of four students who paid $1,350 tuition to do Tier I, the beginning of my massage school’s teacher training program (TTP). Then after Tier I, school was sold and the program director left so the TTP has been delaying the last two tiers of TTP and is withholding paid TTP internship positions. 6 months later after Tier I ended, the students complained to the school and 3 months after complaint, the new owners dissolved the entire TTP and only offer an unsatisfying ¼ tuition refund to each student.",28Feb2017,1
113,"So a friend and I had a dispute about 1 month ago and then she just suddenly dropped me out of the blue with no word. We had never fought before so this was completely confusing.

It started out that I went to talk to her for a peptalk the night before I went to spend the week with my SO and I had bought him a school girl outfit for xmas. I was nervous because I normally don't wear something like that and wanted to make sure it looked okay. So she and I talked for a few hours on skype about our current issues in our lives among other things and I sent her the pic I took of the outfit. A day later she sent a message telling me she showed her husband and he thought it was cute. It freaked me out a bit but I let it go.

Then a few days later I saw her complaining about negative people and her husband made a comment like ""well if certain people didn't text u all the time u wouldn't be that bad"". I knew it was about me and got pissed off. For the simple reason that I said numerous times that ""if I am bothering you please tell me and I can talk to someone else cause I hate bothering people"". She never said anything to me so I thought she was on my side.

I got a bit childish and posted a passive aggressive post on my fb about not trusting people with certain pics. That pissed her off and a week later she messaged me about it.

She accused me of using her as a therapist. As I said I always asked if it was ok to talk and I always tried helping her with her stuff as well. Not the mention I made her things for xmas including a custom made doll that cost $80 and hours to make since she collects dolls. I also invited her to chat with me and play video games since was always home by herself.
She then accused me of calling her husband a pervert. That she didn't know that showing him would trigger my ptsd (I was sexually abused as a kid) and I should have told her not to show him. That she is not a therapist and is not supposed to how to handle triggers. That they thought of me as a sister/family. 
Who shows their brother a pic of herself in a sexy outfit made for the bedroom? 

Also have to mention that she constantly talked about my relationship issues with her husband without permission then asked if it was okay AFTER she told him. She also wanted me to dump my SO just because he was rude to me when he was sick (he apologized when he felt better) but she always held a grudge towards him.

She decided to tell me all of this 3 days after I had posted that I was pretty much dumped cause the guy had to move for a job offer and I was really heartbroken about it. I handled her well though and was polite and apologized for making the post instead of confronting her directly. She read it but never replied. 2 weeks later her bday came up and I was still dealing with myself and never wished her a happy bday right away then 2 days later I went to post a bday message on her wall and saw I was unfriended. She had also removed me from all other social sites. Sent her a goodbye message and told her for someone that brought up being friends for over a decade the leaat she could have done was have the guts to say goodbye. She read it and never replied.

It bothered me a lot more than I thought and it might be because she was someone I trusted to never hurt me. I was always supportive of her with everything. I feel lost on what I can do to make myself feel better and move on. I also feel guilty even though I am sure it wasn't my fault.",28Feb2017,1
116,"I'm white, my friend is black, were both women. We've been friends for a very long time, and I personally never thought twice about our races being different but it seems like now it's becoming a bigger deal.


My friend has gotten very involved with the BLM movement. I support the movement a lot, don't get me wrong-- with all the stuff coming out about microaggressions and modern day discrimination in the past few years, I've learned a lot. I've even realized that I held some of my own racist beliefs-- making jokes that relied on racial stereotypes, making assumptions about people, etc. I'm very proud of my friend for taking part in this movement, and I try to participate as well. Mostly, I've been trying to become more aware, more sensitive, and be a better friend to her. 


Since she's gotten into the BLM movement, she's also gotten very into ""owning her blackness"", which I also think is great. The problem I'm having though is that a lot of her owning her blackness involves disparaging white people. 


For example, saying she loves her natural hair, but following that with comments like, ""who would ever want that flat, thin ass white hair anyway"" or talking about how white people age faster or can't take care of their skin, or just the standard ""white folks are boring, uncool, and have no culture."" 


I sort of get that it's in response to years of discrimination and racism, but it still really hurts my feelings. I even talked to her about it one night (I was drunk lol) and she said ""I'm not talking specifically about you! I'm just talking about white people in general.""


Some stuff I've read online just says I should get over it, because it's just her way of venting against the dominant culture. I get that I'm not necessarily being discriminated against or anything-- I wouldn't call this reverse racism, since racism has far more profound effects than just hurt feelings.

was in HS we'd always beat eachother up and stuff and whenever they messed with me or joked with me I'd just beat them up (not seriously) and it would be over.

He also constantly makes mom jokes. They're not like stupid ""your momma"" jokes they're more malicious. One recent one was when he said that he fucked my mother and thats why she's getting a divorce (neither of which are true of course). I'm from a background where jokes like that really aren't cool but I put that aside cause most of my friends are typical americans and joke about that kinda stuff. 

The more annoying part is that since we've all separated for university he makes those jokes over snapchat. I get extremely irritated (reason why I'm here). I used to be able to brush it off or retort but after awhile I got tired of it cause I felt stupid doing childish stuff like that. 

At this point most of my friends have matured and behaved less stupidly but this one guy and his brother never cease to piss me off.

Fighting them wouldn't be smart cause they'd either fight back or just push harder. I don't like making stupid jokes like that and really can't force myself to do it. I'm rather conflicted by this.

What do you guys think? This guys is pretty moronic and idk if my head is up my ass but I feel much more mature around him.  Sorry to the brave souls that read this, hopefully my writing isn't too shitty.

Thanks!",28Feb2017,1
127,"I'm at a point where nearly aspect of my life is stressing me out and it's really taking a toll on me mentally, emotionally, and physically. I find it hard to relax these days, even when I'm home, I can't seem to relax properly. I tend to overthink a lot, therefore I stress. I try to distract myself by going out every day, either going out with my sister to have breakfast or just going to work, but I'm always stressing about something.

I won’t go into a lot of detail, but I’m mostly stressing about moving out of home and in with my older sister (this is not a big deal for me) and how I’m not getting any support from my father which has been very frustrating for me. I’m not getting a lot of work these days as I cost too much as a causal and worrying how I will pay bills, but I have asked my boss if I could go part time (it’s looking good, it’s just a matter of time and slight persistence). And, finally, the guy I’m dating is currently doing a post-graduate degree and probably won’t have a lot of time to do anything such as socialise, work, or even relax – my worry about this one is, when will we see other, how can our schedules match up?

All of these things have made me stressed in the past couple of weeks. I know it’s all temporary, things will work out in the end, but I just don’t know how to calm my mind about all of these worries and stresses. I don’t know how to relax anymore.
 
Watching tv used to be my go-to relaxation technique, but I’m too tired from everything that I can’t watch more than one episode of something at a time. I’ve stopped reading because I’m too distracted by my own thoughts, and I’ve only been listening to music on my commute to work and back.

As I said before, the only way I’ve been able to distract myself, lately, is by leaving the house to do mundane things, usually with my younger sister, or going to work (which, I quite enjoy, actually), and I have to admit, Reddit has been a distraction as well.

TL;DR How to relax even when stressed?",28Feb2017,3

132,"My sister (16) has been with her boyfriend (17) for a few months. He stays with us every so often and we get to see what they're like together. Usually they just joke around and have banter, then finish it by saying 'I love you'. Sometimes she hits him as a joke, nothing hard, just a little tap. 

Recently I've caught her slapping him a bit harder, and I'll instantly tell her not to hit him, but she doesn't see the harm in it. Last night was the worst, we were all talking when he said something about her as a joke, and she slapped him, as a joke. However she slapped him so hard he instantly had a hand print on his arm. I've yelled at her and she's obviously hurt him, but she just laughed it off. He then went off to his room and she's chased after him saying 'don't be a prick, it was just a joke'. 

This morning I asked if she apologised, but she keeps saying it was a joke. I told her that she shouldn't hit anyone, but the message doesn't seem to get through. I said that if he hit my sister I'd be furious, so I'm not going to act different when she hits him. 

What can I do? It's getting to the point I'm worried she's going to turn into one of these abusive partners that thinks it's okay to hit people. ",28Feb2017,20

135,"I'll try to keep this short.

I've been on and off (not officially) with a friend for the last 3 years, most recently around 3 months ago was the last time we were on again. A bit about us, me and him are very well suited to each other and we like all the same things, he tells me he's always had issues with committing to someone and he's been struggling with depression most of the time I've known him.

A month ago, I got a boyfriend. This guy is absolutely amazing but over the last month I have begun to realise we have some pretty big differences which make me think that we won't last. None the less I do enjoy my time with him.

A week ago the first guy comes back into my life saying how much of a mistake he's made and how he does want to be with me. Over the past week we have met twice for coffee/lunch and it does seem different and he's sticking to the plans he makes with me and hasn't changed his story or taken anything back about wanting to commit to me (he's usually done that by now).

141,"Hey guys...this has been the most stressful week of my life. Title doesn't tell the entire story, so I'll do my best to explain and keep it concise, but, it's still gonna be long. Apologies in advance.

**My girlfriend is pregnant**. 

I'm a 38 yr old man. My gf is 29. We did not plan to get pregnant. Up until now, she assured me that she could *not* get pregnant, as she has had multiple health issues with her reproductive system. This was a complete surprise to both of us. I do not believe that she tricked me into getting her pregnant.

**We are long distance.** 

I live in Los Angeles. She lives in Omaha. She came out to visit me in January. We had lots of sex. I've been living in LA for a little over a year. I moved here for work, as I'm in the film/music industry. She stayed back home because she has a daughter from a previous relationship, and they share custody of the daughter. Getting my gf to move to LA would involve a legal battle with her daughter's father, in addition to taking the kid away from her grandparents, cousins, elementary school, all that. My gf has a steady job back home as well. In short, she can't come to LA right now.

**We have been dating for just over a year.**

We met via Tinder just before I moved to LA. We never intended the relationship to be more than a casual thing, but once we started spending more time together, we realized that we were a great fit and quickly fell in love. We decided to give the long distance thing a shot. We have **each** flown back and forth about 3 times this year. It's getting very expensive, but we love each other. I know that 1 year is not very long, but we really click, and I have also developed a great relationship with her kid.

**She wants to keep the baby. I kinda don't.**

After she gave birth to her daughter, she'd had repeated visits to the doctor for abdominal pain, unusual bleeding, etc. Her doctors told her that she was very prone to ovarian cysts (polycystic ovarian syndrome), and that she was lucky to get pregnant in the first place. Likely she would have problems getting pregnant in the future. So, when we found out that she was pregnant this time, she was thrilled. I was also thrilled for about 2 days. After some very serious conversations with her, and some alone time to consider what all of that meant, I was less enthusiastic. A lot less. Still, she feels like this might be her one chance to have another child, and I completely understand.

**My career is very important to me.**

I moved out here only a year ago, because I had the opportunity to work with some amazing artists, film makers, and musicians. So far, my life in LA has been full of adventure, but not a lot of money. I just got a raise at my job, and I'm meeting a lot of inspiring people who are either directly or indirectly helping me with my creative projects. I'm getting more and more work, and I'm just starting to get comfortable here.

I know that I might never ""make it"" as an artist, and I'm 100% ok with that. At my age, you have to start thinking about non-glamourous lifestyles in the entertainment industry, like writing, editing, tech work, instead of performing or acting. Assisting on film crews, engineering recording projects, helping friends with photo shoots....all of it is so rewarding for me. I always wanted to work in the entertainment industry, and I never wanted to work a 9-5 desk job (although there are admittedly tons of positive benefits to those kinds of jobs).

If I move home to have this baby, I will lose all of the momentum I've made. I will lose the opportunity to work in the field that I want, because as you can probably guess, the film and music industry in Omaha is not all that happenin'. Additionally, I will have to quit my new job (which I love), get out of my lease at my apartment, move back home, and get a new job back home, all while being there for my pregnant gf. It feels overwhelming.

**Neither one of us is religious**. Abortion is an option for us, although it is **not** a casual or easy decision to make. We both feel like we are *killing a baby*, even though we know that, at only a few weeks pregnant, she basically has a cluster of cells inside of her that may or may not become a baby. Miscarriage is a possibility, as it is very common, in addition to her health problems.

Even with us trying to be scientifically minded, logical, and financially responsible (we are both living paycheck to paycheck), it's so hard NOT to feel like abortion is the wrong thing to do. 

Adoption is one option for us, but we both feel like our **very religious** families would not go for it. They would insist on adopting the baby for us, which would place a burden on them, and of course us, whether that is the intended result or not. Neither of us feel that giving the baby up for adoption is a realistic option, although I suppose we could be persuaded. It would be really hard, but then again, so would having an abortion. We would have to live with that fact, and also have a dark secret to hide from our religious friends and family. That would be awful.

**My relationship with this woman depends on this decision.**

She has stated, in no uncertain terms, that if we choose not to have this baby, our relationship is over. I don't blame her. She won't feel the same way about me. She'll have pain and regret in her heart for the rest of her life. She already suffers from depression, has been suicidal in the past, and has told me multiple times that her daughter is the only reason she has not killed herself already.

These are red flags for committing my life (or at least 18 years) to this woman. But....I love her. When we are together, she is incredibly happy and *very rarely* goes into her depression. When we are apart, she gets really down. She has had drug problems in the past, and she was raped by an ex-boyfriend years ago. I don't want to be another person in her life that has hurt her. I want to make her happy, but in order to do that, I have to give up everything I have worked for in my life, and there is still no guarantee of her long term happiness.

As a (sort of) side note: I grew up with pretty traditional/religious values, and a lot of that still sticks with me. If I do move back home to start a family with her, I'll marry her too.


**Both our families would be thrilled to have a new baby.**

I know that this is not a great reason to have a kid, but I do take it into account. My parents are getting older, and I would love to give them a grand-baby. I just wasn't planning on doing it this year. Ideally, I would have waited another couple of years, gotten my career and finances in order, married the girl, and *then* started a family with her. Unfortunately, life had other plans, and I'm in this now-or-never situation.

**We've already discussed having an abortion.**

That's the current trajectory, but we both feel awful about it. She flat-out does not want to abort the pregnancy, but she loves me, and is willing to sacrifice her wants  so that I can pursue my career and life in California. She is planning to take a pill-form abortion treatment in the coming weeks. After that, she will likely break up with me, and we will go our separate ways. :(

**I CAN STILL STOP IT IF I CHOOSE TO.**

I did not see myself being a father this year, and I *don't want to be one*. However, I feel like I am being selfish by putting my career above everything else. I also don't want her to suffer any more emotional trauma in her life, and I feel like I could make her incredibly happy if I just ""man-up"", move back home, make her my wife, and give her the family that she wants.

**I COULD be happy back home.**

Omaha is a great little city. I have friends and family there who would love to have me back. I could potentially get my old job back (although I don't really want it). When I think about domestic, midwestern, family life with this girl, it does make me happy. The comfort and security of a loving partner, a step-daughter, and a child of our own; it *is* appealing to me on a lot of levels.

That said, I *know* that I would feel like a failure deep down. As unimportant as it is, I'm afraid of people thinking that I moved out to California, didn't have what it took to be successful, and came running back home with my tail between my legs. I'm trying not to let it influence me, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about that. Even without the other people, I will probably feel that way about *myself*, which is the real issue. I saved up money, made a plan, and moved to LA on my own, and have been doing quite well for myself. To turn right back around and go home after only 1 year is very unappealing.

I would likely be relegated to doing creative projects as a hobby only. I would have to give up my dreams, as modest as they are, of making a living in the creative arts. I could work in retail, go back to school to become a teacher, any number of things, and then I could do photography, film, and music with what little free time I will have. Boo-hoo, right? Everyone has to face reality and get a big boy job eventually, so I should just quit being a wuss and suck it up, right? The only problem is, out here people can and do make good careers in the creative arts. It's not a fantasy. I'm currently doing it, and my career is just starting to pick up. That's what I wanted for my life, and that's what I came here to do.

So, that's about all I can think of right now. My brain is mush after a full week of crying, arguing, weighing options, and just plain freaking out. That's why I'm asking for your help. Any suggestions, personal experiences, or even if you want to berate me and tell me I'm going to hell....all will be noted and appreciated (I guess). For those of you who read this whole post, THANK YOU.

For the rest of you...

**TL;DR** - My long distance girlfriend is pregnant. We can abort the pregnancy so that I can continue to pursue my career (making her sad, and most likely ending our relationship), or I can move home to do the family-man thing, essentially ending my current career which I love (making me sad, regretful, and resentful, potentially for the rest of my life).

149,"I'm in high school (Grade 10), and I'm getting to that point in my life where I have to think seriously about what I want to do with the rest of my life.

After a lot of thought, I think I want to work with ND kids, like a long-time psychologist and personal hero of mine, especially Autism Spectrum Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (both of which I have), in the hopes of helping them in a way that, despite their best efforts, NT therapists will never fully be able to understand. These disorders affect people's lives in so many ways, and although every person's experience is different, there is something to be said for the experience a person who has lived with the disorder their whole lives, versus a person who spent a few years reading about it.

159,"Hello /r/Advice, I am in desperate need of some wisdom.

I am currently 25 and in the budding stages of building my career. I have been with my current company for one year now and I have been unhappy in my role from the start. However, my unhappiness here has not shown in the work I put out and within the first 6 months I was promoted from Junior Analyst to Senior Analyst with a major pay raise to accompany the title change. Although I have been very successful here, I could not stop myself from actively pursing new positions. You see, I thought my unhappiness was due to my current company's culture. I am a very social and extroverted individual. I love working in a team environment. I also think it's very important to be able to have friends at work (for your own sanity). But at my current company, I work mostly alone, eat lunch at my desk, and have developed zero relationships with my coworkers that aren't strictly professional.

All that said, I started interviewing with different companies. Today, I received an incredible job offer. The position itself is much the same as my current role, but with more responsibility. The benefits package goes above and beyond my current one. And they offered a salary that is $7,500 more than my current. But for whatever reason, I am EXTREMELY HESITANT to accept. During my 3 hour in-person interview with the team I'd be working with, my potential boss, and a handful of senior executives, not one asked me a personal question about my likes/dislikes/hobbies/what I do in my free-time. For three hours I was interrogated on my education, work experience, and my performance in my current role. This was extremely discouraging for me, because company culture is huge in my quest to find a better working environment. I was hoping that part of my in person interview would serve to see if I was a good fit for the team and ultimately the company. I needed to know if I would mesh well with the different personalities I'd be working with...ultimately, did I see myself being happy there?

And I'm also hesitant for a second reason. I'm now fearful that it isn't the company culture that is making me unhappy, but the work itself. I have never been passionate about the world of Business Analytics, but it is the career path I found myself on. So if I accept this offer, I'm going to essentially ruin any opportunity for me to change careers if I realize that's ultimately what I want to do, because who is going to hiring someone who can't remain at any one company for more than a year?

Is there any guidance/advice you guys can provide? Do I leave a company where my success shows, but I am ultimately unhappy for a different company that is offering me more money and better benefits, but where I am unsure if my current unhappiness will change?",28Feb2017,1

I have a boyfriend I've been dating for almost a year and a half now. Before I was dating my boyfriend, this guy (we'll call him Sean) me and him we were friends with benefits. Me and Sean were really good friends and well bc of the benefits it went to crap and got messed up. Me and Sean stopped talking because he hurt me and soon after that's when I started dating my boyfriend. A while after me and my boyfriend had been together Sean popped back up to apologize for everything that happened and to kind of tie up loose ends bc he was going off into the Navy and was going to start his life over. His apologies seemed sincere until he began trying to talk about the sex we used to have and stuff and obviously that was a problem bc I was with my boyfriend and I wasn't attracted to Sean like that. After an argument with my boyfriend broke out I told Sean that we could no longer talk and had to part ways. He was going to get back together with his ex anyways so I didn't see any reason for us to continue talking. Fast forward a few more months and Sean contacts me on Facebook. He asking me how I've been and said he found my number in his old phone and wanted to see how things were. Me being the person I am I confronted him asked him how he and his girlfriend were and proceeded to tell me how him and his WIFE were having problems and that's when I asked is that why he was trying to talk to me. He continued on and started to say how he wish things went differently and how he missed out on an amazing girl and friend blah blah blah.. he made it a point that him and his wife weren't even talking and are considering a divorce. He tried to engage in conversations about his depression and such which I felt like was a conversation more appropriate to have with his wife. I stopped messaging him bc I didn't want a repeat of last time and my boyfriend already made it clear he didn't want Sean talking to me.

163,"Okay, So here goes nonthin. I really hate sharing this information so I’m going to give very little detail to avoid upsetting myself and distracting from the purpose of this post. 

When I was 14 I was brutally raped by an adult whom I trusted and thought was a friend of mine. He lured me out of my parents’ house at night and took my virginity in a violent and non- consentual fashion. 

Eventually my parents found out and let’s call him ‘Joe’ was prosecuted, spent time in jail, and registered as a NYS sex offender for non-consentual sex with a minor. 

Fast forward 10+ years. As a teenager, the circumstances surrounding the assault never really upset me or rather I didn’t get the seriousness of what had happened. I blamed myself therefore I never truly healed.

 As I aged it started to settle in and take a toll on me. I have developed unhealthy coping mechanisms to help myself vison sex as anything but rape. And I’ve also developed a pretty serious case of PTSD where I zone out and have flashbacks with the most random triggers. But that’s its own thing. The real issue is I’m running into my Rapist on a very regular basis and its sending me into a downward spiral.

A couple months back I was in the city at a show with my best friend when I spotted him and his girlfriend from a distance. He recognized me and despite the restraining order stayed and glared all night. His Gf snapped a picture of me and yelled some insults in my direction and out of pure humiliation I left.  I got over that and told myself in 10 years I only ran into him once, surely, I wouldn’t have to again anytime soon. 

Until the following week. I’m in Wal-Mart with my step daughter and he comes into the isle I’m in I lock up and we leave without any of the things we came for. 

 And finally, Last week. I’m going through the drive thru at the local Panera Bread. I put in my order and pull up to the window AND HES THE FUCKING CASHIER. And he takes my card and gives me my order fully knowing who I am and what he did to me. I again locked up and couldn’t respond to him or even eat my food. A place where I frequent for lunch, now ruined. 

I see him crossing the street on my way home from work, I see him at the bus stop laughing and talking to people. Its eating me alive. He was living in a different county and has apparently now moved back and I’m seeing him on a very regular basis and I cannot deal.

164,"I went over to a hookers shoddy apartment and attempted to bang her but she was too tight (Asian). I had a condom on and put my dick in her half way, I lasted about 30 seconds and came in her with the Condom still on, she used baby oil as lubricant which I only realised at the end and now I'm freaking. After that I had a shower put another condom on and received a blowjob before I left. I noticed her stomach was like this http://m.imgur.com/4kxsWPZ

She had skinny features and 22 years old, is this sign of someone who has received an abortion? Also what are the chances of my receiving a std or her having a baby even though I was wearing a condom that seemed fine when I took it off and threw it in the bin?",28Feb2017,0
165,"Usually I tell people about 5-10 minutes after meeting them or when the conversation is coming to a close and we move on to talk to other people (usually at parties).
When I tell them, I say something along the lines of ""just so you know, if you call to me or start talking to me when I'm not looking at you and I don't respond, I'm not ignoring you, I'm deaf/HoH/cannot hear so well"".
Saying that, I find that using the word 'deaf' can initiate presumptions that I cannot hear anything (though I can with HA &amp; CI) and people treat me like I'm stone deaf when I can hear them. 

However I have moved into a huge house with 19 housemates (ages 24-37, mixed sex; I'm 24/f) and I haven't really had the opportunity to tell them. I've been there for a month now and there's been times when they probably have seen my hearing aid or CI though I usually hide them. No one has said anything though - guessing they think I don't want to talk about it but it's important that I bring it up, for safety reasons at least.
Out of respect, I think I should tell my roommate first so she knows before everyone else does, but I don't know how to approach it - it's not like I'm going to go ""hey, how was your day? Oh by the way, I'm deaf"" 

So I feel that my usual line is a bit too informal/random to bring up so **I need some help on how to steer the conversation onto my being deaf.** Humour is good and would lighten the situation - I usually joke about it anyway because it is a golden opportunity to show people that it's not a big deal and they can relax :) ",28Feb2017,1
167,"So, for privacy, lets call my friend Sarah.

Some background.
We met in Primary school, bonded over having the same initials. Nothing special there. Move forward to Secondary (/high school) and we were still really close. Her life at home wasn't so great, living with one parent who had substance abuse issues, as I found out when I used to go around to theirs almost everyday and we would watch various horror movies on VHS and make funny voices and rewind to certain parts in a film and she would do a voice over and whatever. It was good times basically.
After graduating we still stayed friends and hung about a lot. She got with this guy who turned out to be such a shitty abusive person but she was still stuck on him because she thought she loved him or whatever, but I supported her through that. She wouldn't let him go no matter how he treated her or what he done to her and even though I was sick of hearing it, I supported her and looked after her because at the end of the day she was still my best friend.
A couple years after leaving school she was living with this guy, but it went to shit and he kicked her out. So I made myself homeless for her, since my folks wouldn't/couldn't take her in, and at the time I would have liked to have thought that she'd have done it for me.
Her mother still had her name on her old house, but she had moved in with Sarah's gran (HER mum) and hadn't been in her actual house for a while. So Sarah asked for the key, and we squatted there.
It was not nice. There were certain instruments used by drug abusers lying around, some pills, the place was DIRTY as all heck. Kitchen unusable. Both bedrooms unusable. Bathroom unusable. But we made do. We just had to.
Fast forward a week or so and she was out staying wherever. I was left in this crackhouse (I couldn't return home for personal reasons) and she was constantly making up excuses for not sleeping there. A few days after that and the lassie disappears up to the isle of skye to be with her dads side of the family. That was that. I was stuck.
Fast forward from THAT maybe 6 or 7 months and I'm in a hostel and me and Sarah are talking again. I told her I would give her a place to stay for a couple weeks if she came back down to our city. Few months from there, I have my own place, she comes down (now keep in mind we had agreed on her paying £40 weekly towards food electric and stuff before she even left Skye) and for the like maybe 4 or 5 months I housed her I never got a penny. She paid for food shopping one time. The time she was here it was all stress since she was coming back drunk at stupid oclock once or twice, wearing all my clothes, I was always paying for everything even if we were out I would buy food or coffee and pay us into things like swimming etc. So eventually I just couldn't afford it. I was in debt, bla bla. She moved out and into a hostel.

So this is where we finally get to the point of all this. This has been going for about a week or so now, I believe, but a week or so after my friend left my house I saw a video and a picture of them in an item of clothing that is mine. It's a thin jacket I bought online (I do not remember where, I have had it since at least early 2015/late 2015 and I have checked Ebay) in homage to Castiel from SPN (its supposed to look like his trench coat) but it had only ever been worn at the most 3 times. Since I wore it so rarely, I tried to give it new life by having my gran (who is a sewing machinist) sew the front part of it together (you'll see what I mean in the images) so it became a mini-dress of sorts. It had a waistbelt which I tied into a bow at the back of it. It should be a size 12 unless it came from China (where size has to be exaggerated on everything) where it would maybe have to be an XL or XXL or similar.
But anyway, this item of clothing had sat in my wardrobe from the day I moved into this house (back in July) until Sarah left. I never took it out, never wore it. Then I seen this video of her in it; which by the way, was took in my house (this is important) and a picture (from the hostel she went into), so I immediately went to check my wardrobe and it was gone. Sarah is swearing blind it is hers and her Auntie gave her it.
Now, she is also telling me that the item of clothing was in a carrier bag of hers and it stayed in that carrier bag until she left. If this is true, why would she have a video of her with it on IN MY house? Plus the fact I never seen her in this before now.
I don't know what else to do. They are saying that there is no stitching inside and it is all one material, and each time I bring this back up they avoid it. Sarah left a bunch of clothes here and I feel its only fair that she gets her stuff back when I get mine back. Trying not to think about the money she also owes me.

**TL;DR - Supposed friend stole something from me and owes me money, demands her stuff back without me getting mine. It's plainly obvious that what I say's mine is actually mine, but they keep saying ""its obviously not, look again"". I bring up valid points and they avoid them. What do?**

169,"Hi all, so when I began tutoring privately for money, I was charging 30 dollars an hour to this one family with a sixth grade child. As the years have passed, the family has recommended me to others, to the point that where I now charge 40-50 an hour (depending on the age of the child and subjects) but I still charge that original family 30 an hour. 

It's getting to the point where it's not worth my time to stop by the original family, since I can get better paid for that time tutoring someone else. I want to ask for a raise, maybe to 40 dollars an hour, but I'm afraid that if they decline, I might experience backlash from all their friends that have hired me as well. Also as a side note, the original family's kid is sort of a genius and I'm more of a cheerleader than an actual tutor for him (I supply emotional support more than academic), meaning it's definitely one of my easier gigs. 

So what should I do? How should I begin the conversation?

171,"I'll start with the fact that I believe I have some form of bipolar. I've never been told that officially, but I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.

I started a job last year, and I didn't like it much, but it wasn't so bad. I broke my leg on Christmas Eve, and I had to leave for a month and a half. 

During that time, I was feeling so great about life. I was loving school, and actually enjoyed every class. 

I started back to work two weeks ago, and my mood instantly went south. I can hardly fall sleep anymore, I'm back to having no real appetite, I feel like crying, and I cannot get out of bed. It sucks. 

I know that it's just a down swing in my mood, and it will go away eventually, but I'm sick of feeling this way. I want to die. It's not good. 

I have zero time to myself now because of work and school, and it's bearing down on me too much. I'd honestly just quit, because I hate the job so much, but the pay is okay for someone that only has a HS diploma. I also need the money because I am about to move out of my parents house.

177,"One month ago I gained employment in a job that just seemed so perfect. The culture is fantastic, it pays well, it offers flexibility with my post-graduate studies and I feel the business has many values that are aligned with my own (anti-bullying, etc). After a lengthy recruitment process, I was hired with 10 other individuals and I am one of 3 females within the group. I get along well with the others and try my best to learn as much as I can on a day to day basis after spending a full month in training for the role, however it is a challenging role and I still have a lot to learn.

Something which has really been bothering me is that the main coaching staff I interact with on a daily basis tend to favour a number of the guys in the group. It has gotten to the point where I feel like they are more eager to help those select people and are far friendlier towards them with banter and inside jokes. When I seek assistance they behave very differently towards me and can be very abrupt, if not condescending. What's more, these select favourites keep getting praised in weekly updates on our progress with this 'team member of the week' mention via email. Don't get me wrong, these people are great, but I find that while I am still adjusting to the complexity of the role, that this is very demoralising especially considering that I have had no feedback on my work performance and it makes me feel like I am not performing as well as I should.

Yesterday I had a coaching staff member scoff and shake his head at me when I made a mistake and after all that had happened previously, it caused me to have an anxiety attack (which I have not had for a long while) a short while after.  While I started having this anxiety attack at my desk, one of the other coaches saw that I was very shaken up and told me I need to relax and didn't make any further attempts to help. After this happened, I feel very reluctant to seek help from these staff members and it is making it difficult for me to ask for help.

My main manager is not around all the time, but he is very lovely and doesn't demonstrate any of the behaviours of the coaching staff as he is a very empathetic person and I feel inclined to approach him to discuss my situation further, but I am concerned that this could backfire and I could lose my job for bringing this up (I am a casual staff member).

I even take the time to be out in the living room just me him and my girl so he can get comfortable with her, and even take him out with us when we got out to eat sometimes so he gets used to her and no matter all the reassuring I try to do it doesn't help.

191,"Hey r/advice

Basically, when I was around 14/15 I had an internet friend who lived on the other side of the world. We got along well and skyped a lot and admitted we had crushes on each other (never 'dated' though, *cringe*). I was a very different person back then and around that time, especially after we lost touch (due to me saying something stupid and her misinterpreting),  I was in a pretty bad and awkward place. 

I'm 18 now and ever since then have changed and grown up a lot. Through the ages of about 13 to just last summer I had a lot of self esteem and emotional problems that I have only recently been in therapy to help with. And it's been pretty okay so far, I've had a fresh start at college and have been able to make new friends whilst coming out of my shell socially, and working on myself for the first time in my life. It's a slow progression but  it's good. 

Anyway, just a few days ago I added that friend back on facebook in an impulsive move at around 5am. Here is where my problem arises. I don't like thinking about that time in my life. It was quite awful and I just want to move away from it to be honest. I'm not totally sure why I did what I did, maybe it's because I don't get a lot of female attention irl and she's one of the only girls to be nice to me in that capacity. I don't know. But I know that talking to her again makes me feel uncomfortable and regretful, because I just want to grow and embrace this new part of my life, and I feel as if I've just sort of dredged up the past.

198,"I am self employed as a personal assistant. I know that basically means I am someones slave. But I am starting to feel like one of my jobs is unhealthy for me emotionally...and for my husband, because he has to deal with me. 

So I am more than willing to say that I am not perfect. And that I sometimes make mistakes. But I don't think I deserve to have this much anxiety over a job.

The story:
I have been working for one client for over a year. Everytime I think we have reached a good place, she switches up her expectations and I am in the ""dog house"" again!
They have recently gone through a divorce for the last year, and I have been there for every part of it. Now the divorce is over, and they are in the process of purchasing a rental property. Through this I have been included on emails. And some of the people she is working with, have put me in a position to try and help facilitate getting things done. I went along with it, as it seemed like the most natural thing to do. Apparently that was wrong. 

Last night the emails started. Talking about how uncomfortable they were with me coordinating working on a day that is not a scheduled day. Which I wasn't. I was working to get keys for the new property to get bids on some work needed to be done. Apparently that was the wrong thing to do. Even though I was the one meeting with people in two days. I had the keys dropped at their place of business. I did forget to tell the front desk to hand the keys over to them.  On top of that, the person dropping of the keys apparently needs to drop of a contract, but that wasn't clear to anyone, because they hadn't made this choice while I was working on the keys. I don't know why the people who are working with them on the house decided to include me and to ask me for things. I don't know if any of this is clear. 

Long story short, my client isn't very nice to me when these things happen. And makes me feel like I am incompetent and that they obviously have no respect for me. 

So how to I gracefully quit this job while letting them know that their ever changing expectations of me are driving me nuts and leaving me with a ton of anxiety, and hurting my home life.

211,"So, after years of getting into it with various roommates about how loud they are I decided to take a step back and consider that it is probably just me. 

I don't know why, but the sound of others making noise from another room (laughing, shouting, blending drinks, just talking at a moderate to high volume) gives me brutal anxiety. I immediately being to feel panicked, angry, and upset and then I don't know how to calm down.

My latest roomies are particularly loud. I kind of lost my mind this weekend when, after I drove 16 hours straight through the night, they had a large dinner party with friends followed by a movie where every single moment seemed to warrant ""OHHHH!!!"" and ""WHHAAATTT!!!!"" from all 8 of them. I texted my one roommate that I was exhausted, and that the noise was too much, but he ignored me. When it kept going for a couple more hours, I started to have a full blown panic attack. I didnt know what else to do so I poured a large glass of wine and essentially paced my room and tried to distract myself. This culminated in my asking to talk to my roommates at the end of the night, angry and crying and buzzed, and looking like a total nut because to them - they aren't even being that loud (I disagree, but I think their point is that most people would be able to deal with it).

I don't know how to fix this, it's literally the one thing that damages relationships with my roommates. Sometimes I even have to have a drink or leave the house to calm down because I feel like I can't breathe. I know a simple solution would seem like earplugs, but I want to work on the cause and not just a quick fix (I also hate earplugs). I'm generally a socially normal person otherwise, besides being an introvert. I like going out with friends and good conversations, and even don't mind noise when I'm in the same room, so I don't know why this causes me such horrible anxiety. Has anyone dealt with this? How can I work on this?",28Feb2017,1

219,"Sorry, lot of venting here.

So I just had a huge legal midterm.  Last night, as I was frantically cramming my girlfriend flipped out at me.  She's been getting mad at me a lot lately (which has been incredibly frustrating on its own, but thats a whole different issue) but this one got me.

She started texting me, seemingly got very happy (although I didn't realize how upset she was).  I tried to reply as best I could, but like I said, I was frantically cramming for this exam.  

Then, she called me.  I answered, and we talked for about 20 minutes before she hung up on me (conversation was about about how she felt I didn't care and I didn't love her).

I texted her a lot after, but basically I ended it a little afer 12:30 with a text saying ""I love you, and I will come see you right after this exam tomorrow, but I need to goto sleep right because this exam starts at 8 AM.""

The thing is, this is the THIRD time she's done this.  She seems to think I should just throw my school aside and focus on her.  She said if i was upset she would spend all night helping me even if she had a diploma the next morning.

The thing is, she doesn't have a diploma...she isn't even in school right now.  And I wouldn't do that to her.  It's really fucking easy to say you would when you don't actually have to deal with it.

Mostly, instead of fixing what she was upset about, I'm just pissed right now.  Im pissed she put me in this situation AGAIN.  

Do I have a right to be mad?  I honestly dont even know.

242,"Hi r/advice; hope you're all doing well. I'll give a brief overview of my life and current situation, and hope that y'all can provide me some sound advice.

I grew up in a comfortable suburban environment in the midwestern US. Spent the majority of my youth, playing sports, with superficial friendships, and at church youth group. Went to university to study English Education on a scholarship for a year and a half,, and then dropped out after a having a depressive episode. I've currently been recuperating at home, with my parents and siblings, and working at a restaurant (18yrs and 10yrs). The pros of this situation: 
It's very comfortable. I've not felt much stress in the past two months. Parents pay for food and car insurance, mom even does my laundry most of the time. 

Cons: Lots of ignorance and apathy at the house. Parents support me and want me to become independent, but are comfortable with their lifestyle, aren't particularly inclined to intellectual conversation/the exchange of ideas. Since going to university, I've realized the extent of my ignorance, and I long to turn my eyes back towards the light of education. I would love to spend my whole life studying, but I'm aware that this could be highly unfeasible. 

As Lent begins tomorrow, I will begin to attempt to start living my life on ""hard mode,"" by imposing acts of discipline into my life, namely by ceasing masturbation and gluttony, two things I struggle heavily with.

I'm really interested in lots of things, (especially religion and spirituality, language, nature, music, psychology, health, and where science/society will head in the near future) though I don't know what it is towards which I should orient myself. My goal before leaving, is to sort out my religious/spiritual worldview, and feel as confident as an uneducated person in that view before taking on the next stage of life. 

I've never quite taken mental discipline seriously either, and therefore, I think that I should make this my number one priority as I move forward out of the house. I have several ideas of endeavors that I would like to undertake, but unfortunately my cognition is limited to my limited experience. Anyway, here are the several paths I am considering taking. 

*Attempt to join a Catholic or Buddhist monastary for the course of the next 3-4 years 

*Head to the West Coast (alone), find someone to introduce me to psychedelic drugs (I'd like to try mushrooms ONCE. Just once.) and take community college classes, to become a paramedic; learn an instrument on the side. Work hard for 10 years and save up as much money/invest smartly as I can, so as to be able to life a quiet, frugal, life for the next portion of my life. Pragmatically, this seems to be a decent option; as far as I've read, it seems as though paramedics are not likely to be automated by AI in the years to come. 

*Go back to the university at which I was studying; finish their philosophy degree on my scholarship. Cons: small college in the middle of nowhere without much diversity in the student body/intellectual life. Pros: Have several friends there. Small class sizes, lots of opportunities for interaction with professors. Could get a philosophy degree debt free most likely.
 
*Attend an Uber Catholic College 4 hours from home. Pros:my best friend studies philosophy here. Plenty of opportunities for spiritual growth. Cons: Very mono-culture, potentially taking on $80,000 of debt. 

*Find a prepper community; learn as much about that lifestyle as I can. Some people see a societal economic/social collapse as imminent. Pros: Perhaps incorporating myself into one of these groups would not only give me the ability to survive a little bit longer, but also give me the opportunity to live in a community. Cons: Dealing with potentially batshit crazy people. Lack of intellectual life(?)

What would you advise, reddit? 
I'd like to learn how to take my life seriously, but I constantly wonder if it's best to pursue spirituality while eschewing everything else, or to specialize in something practical while pursuing other interests on the side.  

Too much wondering will just lead to stagnation, and I'll die before I get anywhere! So I'm curious as to what you might do in my situation.

Peace.

For example, I was talking to a colleague the other day and he said “How is that relevant?”. When what I was saying wasn’t particularly relevant to the discussion but kind of vaguely related.

259,"Ok so I've been with this girl of my age since I was 18, I am now 23. I am still studying to have my bachelor's and afterwards my master's, she's been working full-time and has her own appartment for a while. 
  
Half of my time I am with her in her appartment, the other half I am in my parents house, she cooks for me and buys food for both of us rather than just for herself.
   
I have a pretty good relationship with my parents and they are the ones paying for all the stuff I need outside of gf's house. I still work from time to time in a part-time job to have some money for myself.
    
This weekend the gf told me she has reached a point where either I start getting her some money to help her (which I agree on, she shouldn't be the one paying for everything while I am at her place) and I move in soon (next summer) or we'll break up.
   
The thing is, for me, moving in with her is a big step, I have lived all my life with my parents and have known nothing else. And I feel like our relationship is pretty fragile. We do not share the same tastes or interests in anything, we have completely different ways of thinking, and even though we were never separated, we almost broke up a bunch of times. I am also not very happy with her physical condition as she's gained a lot of weight since we've started dating and doesn't seem to want to make an effort on that side for me.
   
I sincerely don't know what to do, because I thought about ending the relationship myself a bunch of times, but then I have feelings for her, she has a good relationship with my parents, and she can be a real sweetheart when she wants to. Even when we have a harsh argument, the next day, after a night of sleep we kinda forget about it.

I'd say the main thing that stops me from wanting to move in with her, is really that I feel like our relationship, which has lasted for a while now, is still pretty frail, and could end pretty much at any time. So in my head, I'd want to move in with her whenever I don't feel this way, but I don't know if I'll ever not feel this way...

263,"   I am about to be 16(yeah yeah, I know I'm young lol), he is 14 (we are one and a half year apart). He never used to be as bad as he was now. Yes, he has always tried to annoy me endlessly when we were younger, but now he is extremely nasty towards me. I am having a lot of trouble coping with it. I have several people at school who are rude to me which gets me down (I don't have a thick skin), but it's usually not bullying or nearly as bad as the way it was in middle school. While I don't feel so good about them, the way my brother treats me, each time makes me feel a mixture of shock and rage (especially that someone would treat a family member this way). And I don't like that I'm starting to actually have very violent thoughts nowadays about him. I try to be a positive person and never hold such ill feelings, but it's uncontrollable. It also has built up for several years, ever since around when I had depression. He would slide a knife towards me and ask if I would kill myself, with a smirk on his face (he was 12 or 13, I was 14). But it's gotten a lot worse nowadays, although he no longer says exactly that (I'm doing okay now). When I'm around, he also tries to get me upset by physically getting in my way and saying disgusting(inappropriate) things. 

One thing I'll mention is that I've tried seriously talking to my parents about this. They only half listen, and my mom just idly tells me to ignore him (although they have regular screaming matches, but she continues to be nice to him and spoil him the next day. even if he was physically trying to be threatening or push her). My mom has also grown to accept him saying things like "" get away from me! And ""ugh you're so annoying!"" if she approaches him while on his phone, although she's always helping him with things. He takes everything she does for granted.. It makes me angry, because my parents just accept it. Also, every time he says something (for example, the other day ""ugh go fuck yourself you dumb cunt""), she just tells me to stop if I say something back (usually something sarcastic such as, wow, what an incredible way to treat your sister). 

I always avoid being near the family because of not wanting to be around him, and being near him or even hear him. It gives me almost a sick feeling. I don't hate anyone with the intensity I do him. When I have confronted him he furrows his brows, smirks and says"" me? I've never done anything to you"" (I assume as a way to frustrate me and invalidate what I say), so that doesnt work. 

I honestly feel terrible even though I live here, and hide away in my room just to get away from him. I also sometimes have really violent fantasies (about him) after he says/does something nasty again. I don't want to feel this way. 

I honestly have no where to turn about this, so I got it off my chest on here and hope for some advice. I just can't stand it anymore and feel horrible whenever he's home :( I also can't stop feeling like I don't matter because my parents don't care that I feel this way or have to put up with being treated that way by him. I feel desperate to just reach out somewhere even though its the Internet :( any advice would be very much appreciated.

265,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 and a half years and she's great. We hang out daily because her dorm is awful so she lives in my apartment. We write music together in a band, and my friends like her a lot because she's fun and agreeable. So I really highly doubt there's some underyling problem in our relationship. 

Anyway, she normally sleeps from like 11pm - 7 am, and then she'll take a short nap after her classes, which is fine I do it too. Then she'll come over and we usually play videogames, make dinner, do homework, watch movies, whatever, but shes recently started coming over, saying shes cold (my apartment is kept at 68), grabbing a blanket, playing 3DS for 15 minutes and falling asleep on my couch. If she doesn't sleep on my couch she sleeps on my bed. Her naps usually last 2-4 hours. If she wakes up and shes groggy, she'll stay up for another couple of hours and then go to to sleep at the same time she normally does. She doesn't ALWAYS do this, but probably 4 days a week she spends most of the day asleep. On the weekends we will stay up til like 1 or 2 and i usually get up at 10:00 am. She will stay in bed until like 1:00 pm unless she is dragged out of the blankets. And if she doesn't get her 11 hours of sleep, she'll just take a nap while we're at my friends house or while I have people over. It doesn't matter if we're drinking, watching a movie, writing music, or having a party. 

Obviously this has taken a shit on our sex life because anything we do is in the bedroom and as soon as she gets in my bed, no matter when, she wants to cuddle and then shes out like a light. Today she was laying all over me in my living room and we were gonna go back into my room to mess around, but as soon as she got in my room she got under my blankets and went to sleep.

 Trying to wake her up is like trying to wake the dead, and if i try to wake her up to help me make dinner, play videogames with me, or anything I have to spend a cool 15 minutes trying to waker her up. First I gently shake her and say her name for about 5 minutes, then she hides under the covers to ignore me. Then I whip the covers off of her and she gets pissed but she falls back asleep anyway. Then its back to shaking and saying her name, and sometimes I just give up at this point cause she gets pissed and starts pushing me away. If she chooses to get up at that point, once she's fully awake, she'll tell me she is sorry for being such a handful when I was trying to wake her up and that she doesn't want me to think she was ignoring me, she was just ""so sleepy and warm"". 

I'm heading back from class right now and she's currently asleep. She woke up when I called her but I'm sure she fell back asleep immediately cause I texted her to check. We were going to work out together when I got home but I don't feel like wasting 15 minutes just to have a shot at her getting her ass up.

266,"Hey there Reddit. So, for some context, when I was 15-16 (~2012-13) I had some mental health problems related to medication I was on, ended up hospitalized for suicide attempt. After awhile we discovered what was up and I got better. After several months of being mostly back to normal, my mom (emergency room nurse) phones me, asking if I would bring some books to the ER. A boy about my age was being committed for suicide attempt, and he didn't get to take any of his books with him. So I get some books for him but my mom won't let me meet him, so I write my name and phone number in the front of the books. 

About a year and a half later, he calls me up while I'm at work. We talk for a few minutes, but I can't talk for very long so I tell him I will call him back. For whatever reason I didn't try to call back until at least a month later, maybe longer. When I did, someone answered the phone, and when I asked for _____, the person grumbled and hung up. 


So the information I have is: 

* Approximate time he was in the ER

* Approximate time he called me

* Phone number he called me from, which I reverse searched for an address and some names that are attached

* First name

* I believe he was in foster care at the time he came into our ER

* Approximate age


Honestly, this might just be impossible/pointless, but I figured I would at least try. I'm not really sure why I feel so compelled to reach out now, but I would really like to try and find him if I can. 

Any advice or a suggestion of a place to cross-post this would be really appreciated. ",28Feb2017,1

279,"Looking back, my mum has always been an incredibly negative person. I didn't realise how abnormal she was until I went to university and got a break from her. After university I moved in with some friends, being away from her for so long my views softened and I idealised her in my head.

Now I'm 26 and have moved back to where I came from, it's one of the most expensive cities in the world and even though I have a good job it makes sense to live with my mum for a bit. I was planning on staying here up to a year, now I feel like I cannot do that because I'll either destroy my relationship with my mum or drive myself crazy.

She is perpetually negative. I moved back in January and have stopped asking her how her day was, because not once in 2 months has she said she's had a good day. She has a talent for turning anything good into a pity party for herself, like when I got my current job, she said it was great I was so successful so young, but that she wished she earned that kind of money, that her parents were mean so she never had the chance. At first one might feel sorry for her, but this is her lack of perspective showing; she is a millionaire on paper, has hundreds of thousands in liquid cash, is getting a payoff worth tens of thousands when she retires in a couple of months, she has a nice house with no mortgage in an upmarket area of London. I could go on. She didn't skip a beat, I had no time to be happy for myself before she sucked the life out of the occasion, I rang her right after I found out I got the job and even her first reply was something that lowered the mood a bit, ""wow, I never earned that much"". I never have any reply for this kind of thing... Like really, do I say thanks, or what? Even her compliments involved herself and how ""hard"" she has it.

Heck, she's even brought up my dead dad at times, acting as if she was the only one who suffered after his death. I try to console her without feeding her need for pity, but it's impossible to make her look on the bright side.

It makes me very uncomfortable, I would also have more pity if she wasn't so cruel to others sometimes. I was in therapy for over a year once and not only did she not offer a shred of support when I was literally going nuts, but she told me recently she thought I was ""just stressed about exams"", when I told her the extent of it, that she had really upset me, she somehow managed to turn it into something bad *for her*.

I wonder sometimes if she is mildly autistic or has NPD, she is very self-centred and lacks any perspective. She often does nice things, but I get a strong impression she does them for herself, not for others.

Any advice for dealing with persistently negative people? I am going to move out in a couple of months, but I do want to have a relationship with my mum, it's just she makes it so hard. I am at the point where I am old enough to be fully aware of how abnormal her behaviour is, and I find it hard to even go out for a meal with her, not just because of her negativity, but because she is childlike at times and to be honest, it's just too embarrassing.",28Feb2017,1
280,"EDIT: Yeah you guys are right, sorry its just I was home schooled and after starting college noticed how much of a wuss I was and someone who can't say no. Thanks for the replies !


Hello all, I am new to posting as I just lurk most of the time, I apologize for any and all grammatical errors.

So on to this problem I need advice on, there is this girl who sits across from me in my college class; I am not her 'friend' we just make small talk about the assignments in class and are strangers outside of this one hour class.

From the second class my friend and I (who both bought our own textbooks) asked her if she has bought her textbook yet because she is going to need it for the next class to which she proudly stated ""Oh, I don't ever buy my own textbooks"". At the end of our third class this semester she asks if she could take pictures of my textbook for the homework our teacher had assigned, I said it was fine but I didn't really think about it too much since it was still the beginning of the semester. Come the next few classes she asks at the end of every one (to which I said yes every time) so I decide to leave my textbook at home instead of carry it around with me since we only need it for the homework questions; at this point I am starting to feel that it is a bit unfair so instead of saying no I avoid her by saying I don't have it or I forgot it at home.  

Now the last class she has asked again to which I said I don't bring it to class anymore, she then handed me her phone and told me to put my number in it, I wasn't really thinking about it and put it in quickly so I could leave (kinda feeling like this was a mistake a few minutes later).  
She has texted me once before for the homework and I ignored it thinking it wont be too awkward the next day at class. She didn't turn in the homework because I never sent the pictures but she also didn't say anything about it. I had class yesterday and she texted me again for tomorrows homework and I don't know if I should ignore her out of fear that I might make an enemy out of this person who is going to sit across of me for the rest of the semester. 

I know that this might seem mean of me to not just send her the pictures because books are expensive, but this girl really doesn't give off the feeling of 'someone in need' or who even makes an effort, shes on her phone or sleeping the whole lecture and I honestly feel like shes using me, because I'm a little socially awkward as well; she never asks my friend for pictures of the book even when she has his number. Should I just get over myself and send her the homework for the rest of the semester?

tl;dr  Girl doesn't want to buy her own textbook and keeps asking me for photos of mine which I don't think is really fair since I paid for it and its already the middle of the semester and should have her own by now.

282,"After receiving and serving a 2 week long superintendent's suspension for a nonviolent and non-academic dishonesty offense, the suspension office has said that the suspension was to be expunged at the end of 11th grade, ""with the provision that the suspension record be sealed and used only for dispositional purposes in the case of a future suspension"".

Does this mean I can safely check ""no"" on the common app concerning that?  I know it's risky to lie on your college app, but vague ""reassurances"" to be honest and leave your fate hanging in the air from snooty college experts is much less appealing than lying, having the suspension locked away/expunged and knowing it can't be dug up by the colleges. This is my first suspension, my normal behavior at school is good, and so are my grades, so I don't think there will be much reason a college that isn't insanely selective would go out of their way to dig up dirt on me. 

Additionally, I heard that the common app also requires that your counselor answer to a similar question about past discipline with a specific student - and I hesitate to think that mine would lie for me even with an expunged suspension - am I right on that? In that case, what's even the point of having a suspension expunged if you're gonna have to face the music about it anyways?

285,"So on Friday I volunteered to be designated driver for my friends while they went out since I had a book to read for class anyways. At around 11:30 my friends text me to come to the bar I dropped them off at obviously a bit drunk. I drove there, parked the car, and sent them a text telling them I was there, and proceeded to just wait. They were taking a while and while I was waiting I guess something had happened in the bar across the street because a few police cars drove up, one of them parking right behind me (in a fire lane if that counts for anything). The officers leave the car and then proceed to go into the bar, then back out, and begin an on foot pursuit of this guy. Simultaneously my friends call me telling me they were actually not at the bar I was at and at one 5 minutes walk away and to come to them. I agreed and went to back out of my spot and go to them when I lightly hit the cop car. I got out and looked at the cars with my flashlight and there was nothing on either car. I still was going to leave a note but when I went back into the car I could not find any pen. The officer was no where to be found and I figured that even if I were to find him he'd be arresting the guy he was called in on. Also my friends were calling me begging to come get them as one friend was feeling really sick. I decided that what I was going to do was go grab my friends, drop them off, buy a pen, and come back to leave a note. I figured I could do it fast enough before the cop left. Unfortunately my plan failed and the cop was gone when I returned. Now I understand dashcams and knew that I wasn't off the hook yet. Today I tried going to the police head quarters to turn myself in, but unlike in the movies I found out you can't just walk into stations. Now I don't know what to do. I haven't told my friend yet about this, I want to go explain myself and take the charge for hit and run, and get this over with. How can I report myself? What are the odds the cop never finds out?

But then the lab was taking the new grad student out for dinner. I can't tell you where because I wasn't invited. I was one of two students in the lab not invited, and I don't really know why. 

**Is there some way I could let my lab members know that it kind of hurt my feelings that I wasn't invited, when essentially everyone else was?**

I don't want to sound petty about it, or make it a bigger deal than it is, but I do sort of want to let whoever planned it know (and I don't even know who planned it) that it's a shitty feeling when your lab mates, the people you spend most of your time with for at least 2-3 years, don't want you around.

Sure, I'm shy, quiet, and dealing with some anxiety/depression type issues, and it takes me a while to get comfortable around others so I tend to stick to myself a lot (makes me lonely though), but I always try to be nice, polite, and friendly.

I don't know, maybe they thought that because I'm shy I would make a bad impression on the new potential student? Or maybe that I wouldn't want to go? 

But I did want to go, and this all just makes me feel bad about myself, and reinforces negative stereotypes I have about myself, such as shy = bad. That's the only reason I can think of for not being included in something like this, when basically everyone else was. The other guy not invited is also quiet (quieter than me actually), so that also just reinforces the idea that maybe they just didn't want us making a bad impression or something...

299,"
I've been friends with Nancy for a few years now and recently trauma in her past has brought back horrible feelings and triggered numerous suicide attempts. She has since then got a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and her husband Gus, her grandmother Edna and I (Michelle) been her only support apart from her other family about an 8 hours drive away.
 
I have felt helpless through most of her struggles and I've even had issues with my own husband Jake telling me 'it's not my problem' and because I've been looking after her mostly full time before Gus gets off work, I worry if she's left alone in the day (Edna also works FT) she'll harm herself somehow.
   
Another thing about BPD is how she won't ever be cured. She might have periods of 'normality' but something can set her off and she'll be a mess all over again.
  
I've tried encouraging positive things while she is off work sick until she gets help from mental health teams, but sometimes I feel manipulated and trapped into this vicious cycle with her to the point where I've-not so subtly- hinted to Jake to find work elsewhere.
   
She refuses to ask for money from her parents- mum Nat was married to her abuser Vic for many years before it was found he was sexually abusing Nancy and her sister Betty. She says her dad Paul doesn't have the money to help (refuses to ask him when he sounds like he could spare some for the treatment of his own daughter) and the free healthcare has her on loads of waiting lists.
  
Can anyone help with any advice? I want to still be her friend but not have to worry about leaving her alone or trying not to let the sad stuff going on with her get me down. I want to be able to get a bit of time off from her without having to worry what she's getting up to. Anything positive or anyone else with an experience similar would be incredible.
