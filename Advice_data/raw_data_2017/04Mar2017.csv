1,"I’m[18F] clinically depressed and my emotions have hit a hard turn since I recently broke up with my boyfriend[18M] of 1+ years. I can’t focus on school or anything for the matter and all I want to do is cry. My chest is heavy every day because of how much I regret neglecting him during our time together. I treated him like utter shit and I know I was emotionally abusive in the relationship. It sucks because I couldn’t see how much I was hurting him and the people around me and now everything he says I am affects me so much; I feel like committing suicide. 

My thoughts have been nothing but dark and I feel like even if we do get back together it won’t be the same and I’ll forever hold regrets. I don’t know what to do, I want to stop hurting but I still want him. He was the one who kept trying to make things work and now the situation has flipped. I feel like my efforts will just be wasted and that I’m holding him back from moving forward in his successful life and I bring him nothing but sadness and pain. I know he still loves me, but he’s realized his self worth and stopped putting up with me and my cold and distant self.  I just want everything back to the way it was before the situation got ugly. I know he needs time to be apart and I respect that but I’m so scared of the day he finds happiness with someone else. I feel like a mess. I don’t want to live anymore knowing that all I do is hurt people and ruin people’s lives. 

My life is spiralling out of control and I feel like I can’t do anything right. My future and my dreams have all been thrown away because I don’t find any interest in anything I’m learning or doing. Not even music makes me feel good. I find it hard to smile every day because of how painful this feels. I hate being alone because I get too lost in my thoughts and I just feel like dying. 

I know that if I want to be with him, it’s my turn to really try and anything he does I have to accept. I know I have to work on myself before things can get any better but I’m scared he won’t still be waiting for me when I do. I think he already stopped waiting. I’m scared of getting hurt and I don’t know how to find peace. I feel like a walking corpse because I’ve died on the inside. Things to help me cope like changing my style or getting more active only feel good for a while but I know it just helps me avoid the cloud hanging over my head. 

TLDR: Please someone help me find happiness. I messed up and I don’t know how to live with myself. How do I stop emotionally abusing everyone and just live in peace?

2,"I am a first year med student, and i am really doubting my choice to study medicine. Some subjects are really boring, but other i really like. The job as doctor i still really like, but the study has a lot of boring parts. It feels like i have to go through 3 really stressful years, to get a job i really like. 

At the same time i really like psychology. I did one course next to my study over the past months and i really enjoyed it. It is a lot less stressful, the teachers, the students the stuff we need to learn. I just overall really prefer the study. But the reason i didn't choice it was because there is a really low chance that i would get a job on level after studying it. And because I don't like some of the jobs you roll into with psychology.

Did I make a mistake by not studying psychology? If I did should I now still switch? I still really like some subjects on med school but others are just really boring.",04Mar2017,1
4,"hoo boy. 

I'll try to cover the context as quick as possible.

back in 2013 I went to University to study Journalism. Was a massive douche and cheated on me then gf of two years, dove straight into another relationship. Two months in, in December of 2014 a best friend ended his life while we slept downstairs. I was doing fairly well at uni, on track for a first, I straight up never turned up again. I'm not sure why exactly. Maybe I used it as an excuse. Enrolled onto a different degree the following academic year. For some reason I thought I'll magically no longer be lazy. I got super clingy with my girlfriend (to the point where I would have panic attacks when she or I were away on holiday(yeah, realy messed up)) Around the year anniversary of his passing had a pretty weird breakup. Resorted to smoking weed for a good thre e months straight (which funnily enough I don't regret, I actually think the introspective thinking helped me actually face some darker thoughts head on). I started doing some voluntary writing for online entertainment outlets and wrote scripts for a few indie games and loved it) I knew however that I wasnt going to survive the year in my english studies and pulled out. Moved back home. Here I am, I have a retail job, worked my ass off at it. (awards from regional management and training for a promotion) Getting myself a transfer to get back around the area I was living and back in my own place.

I Guess my biggest issues are simply, when that crap took place any vision I had of what I planned on doing was completely shattered. Now I have no idea waht i'm doing or where i'm going, do I stuck to this possibly well paying (utterly soul destyroying) retail management route ahead of me? After all I dont have the degree to back me in my writing skills..

This indecisive overly worried attitude has spread to every aspect of my life. I have started countless hobbies and cant commit to anything, I would happily hire someone to say, ""Right, that's useful and that's useful. Practice those two skills every night after work,"" while slapping me anytime I doubt that path or go 'hmmm but I should be doing this new hobby instead.'

I just can't progress, and I'm too worried about making another fucked up decision to commit moving forward. Help?  

So sorry for the uber long read",04Mar2017,1
7,"I'm getting ready to head off too college but they need an immunization record. My parents haven't kept a record for me, and I have gotten shots at multiple clinics and doctors over the years. Is there a department or database that I can contact to get my records? What should I do?",04Mar2017,5
8,"My situation is complicated, as are everyone else's but I feel as if I can't talk to the people around me and please no one respond with that as a suggestion.

So I am the youngest of three brothers, born in 2000. I'm a 3rd generation Brit, my mum and my nan were born in England but dad is from Pakistan (no they're not cousins, thank the Lord). As a British-Pakistani, it is uncommon for your parents to be divorced but my friends do call me a coconut (brown on the outside, white on the inside). 

So my mum and dad have a complicated relationship. He's left numerous times. He first left when I was 5 and prior to that I remember my sperm-donor of a father to be abusive and violent and quite the authoritarian. The earliest memories I have of him are him yanking my ears and slapping me across the face, I get that some parents like to discipline their children but this was for minor reasons, like not being able to write my homework correctly or not passing him the TV remote. One night, my mum and him had a heated argument and he ended up leaving, I was 5 and found out the next morning when my older brothers told me, my middle brother is 2 years older than me and my oldest brother is 5 years older than me. They got divorced, both Islamically and by the British Court. I later found out that the reason for him leaving was because of cultural differences between him and my mum. 

A few years pass and I'm completely unaffected by this, my mum has been prescribed anti-depressants and in a bad mental state and so we were always with my mum's younger sister for a few years of my childhood. My middle brother was clearly affected because I think they had a connection. Eventually he took my mum to court for custody but my mum won majority custody as we were at risk of being abducted and taken to Pakistan which is why there's a court order but I'll get back to that later. So he ended up meeting us every weekend under supervision at a centre and I'll admit we had some good times but he claimed my mum's family was brainwashing us and a load of crap a child shouldn't have to hear.

Around sometime he remarried to a lady from Pakistan and my mum's mental health got real bad again and I can't count how many times I heard or saw her cry. He ends up divorcing wife no.2 and sending flowers to my mum to reconcile and by the time I was 9, they had reconciliated and married again. My older brother being half a decade older than me, he wasn't exactly happy with it as he had more of a perspective and was 14 by the time the sperm donor came back, missing some vital years of his childhood. At the time I didn't understand his objections but now I do. 

So it was back to the domineering lifestyle we'd have before but I had more of a perspective of his and my mums' relationship and I'll admit, there was some love there I guess. However they'd always have big arguments and me and my brothers were being treated like shit and the sperm donor and my oldest brothers' relationship was really strained. I'd keep seeing my mum cry and I'd have to comfort her and she told me not to tell her family, bare in mind the sperm donor never physically abused her or touched her without consent, but the damage had been done. So it goes without saying me and my dad never had a good, friendly father-son relationship, neither did my brothers and I saw my extended families relationships with their kids, and it was full of love and that was something I saw I was missing out on.

He ended up bailing in early 2012, leaving us £100 for bills, utilities, food etc. He comes back in November of that year. My mum is in arrears.

A year passes and it's 2013 and I'm 13 and it's Ramadan. Still same montonous routine and verbal and phsyical abuse. I even started logging dates at which he physically abused me because I got so angry at him and I couldn't do anything. I can recall him spilling a drink down my back after I refused to drink it and him refusing to give my mum money. My mum was a housewife as he didn't let her work yet she still managed to pay all the bills. Today she works and she has payed off 30k off our 50k mortgage (yes ik the mortgage is low, it was 2002 when they applied). So one night, 1 or 2am, my dad comes home from work, we're half an hour from starting fast and me and my two brothers are in the living room. My oldest brother was 18 at the time and had a phone for 2 years now, which my dad didn't approve of because of his crazy old fashioned Pakistani mentality. So my dad walks in and slaps the phone out of my brothers hand and starts beating him, fyi he's never taken drugs or alcohol. So he's beating him and beating him and I'm wondering why my brother wasn't fighting back which he later told me it because he knew that him not fighting back would get rid of the sperm donor. During the fight he nearly broke a heavy vase over my brothers head which I stopped, it all happened so fast and he got a stick and beat him with it til it broke. Me and my other brother froze and all I could hear was my mum screaming. Somehow she got my brother out of the house, dizzy and barely conscious, we made it to my mum's brother's house at 2am which I ran to before I got my brother there with the help of my mum. Long story short my dad got arrested after we called the ambulance, as the police come with an ambulance if its a domestic abuse case. And that was that, he's never seen or talked to me since. My brother has been affected since that day, you can see it, and feel it. My middle brother has now come out of his shell after seeing my sperm donor for who he is and my mum is still trying to get another divorce from him, both Islamic and by the UK law which he is playing around with. All the times he has left, not once has he paid child maintenance which he dodges by saying he's not working, and I know through sources he's living comfortably in Spain. He's married to bride no.3 now, big suprise(!) 

My mum is in debt, working two jobs, my oldest brother now has mental issues, me and my middle brother live with my mum and help when we can. He wants the house or his half as its joint on his and my mums name. However he can't do that til I'm 18 which is next January. Anyways I know through a mutual friend of my mums and sperm donors that he wants to contact me and my middle brother. I fear he wants to control me again and will not agree with my career choice (arts and entertainment) and will be domineering. My mum says talking to him will make it likely for him to pay the mortgage and child maintenance both which he never did anyways. I feel like I don't need him or ever will, I've survived without him so far so why should I need him now? I taught myself how to shave, how to talk to girls, to play sports, to becomed learned and to be a man, I DID THAT, not some sorry excuse of a father. 

Should I talk to him now or in the near future, ever?

Coming back to the court order thing, my mum got a court order saying neither parent can take any of us children out of country without signed consent which was set up so he couldnt abduct us. Considering I'm the only under 18 out of my brothers, it only applies to me now and I have to wait one more year til that goes. He has rejected my last appeal to go out of country but only because he does it to spite my mum. However I've never been out of England, ever, and I feel restricted and cant go to international school trips or enjoy the world right now. Is there any way of side stepping that without spending a lot of money in court or is it a case of waiting it out?

TL:DR - Piece of shit father left me numerous times and wants to contact me again. Missed out most of childhood, and now I'm 17.

11,"I HAVE to go to Denver in 3 weeks. I live in Maryland and it's unbelievably expensive to get tickets to a flight to Denver. The cheapest flight is roughly $450. That is WAY out of my budget. Right now the only thing I can afford is Spirit. There is literally no alternative at all.

I've flown with them before, like 2 years ago and the flight was rough and I think I remember our flight getting delayed. 

However I'm pretty reluctant about flying with them now because for some reason the only option they have available for flights to Colorado are connecting flights that connect in Chicago. I've heard people complain about Spirit saying that their flights get super delayed that they spend HOURS getting delayed. I can only imagine that if our flight last time got delayed and it wasn't a connecting flight, that this time it'll be even more likely for my flight to get delayed or for me to miss my flight!

I don't fly very often and this is my first time flying alone. Need advice. Should I fly with spirit and get these ticket?",04Mar2017,1

18,"I went out with this girl when we were both in high school, I never had a serious relationship before her and before she moved to college we had talked about our post college plans with each other. 

During college my depression and anxiety that I had a handle on throughout high school started taking over and ruining my life. I don't know if it was because of the change in environment or because I felt so secluded from everyone I had once known, either way she went to college in a different state and our relationship began to strain because we could never see each other. Eventually I decide to break it off for some reason, I don't remember the exact reason why but we continued contacting each other regardless. I still loved her and for a while she still loved me. When she met someone else it drove me crazy but we still were seeing each other behind his back... (neither of us would have considered cheating before this, but it happened). She broke up with that guy but I was dating someone else so we didn’t get back together. Eventually she met the guy she is currently married to (Her mom is still friends with me on fb so it popped up in my feed randomly). Before we stopped seeing each other entirely we slept together once or twice while she was dating her now husband after which she told me ""we couldn't do this anymore, she wanted to give the new guy a chance and it wasn't fair for any of us to continue the relationship we had."" I had to agree. I still loved her but I could see that her love for me was fading so I let her go and I wished her luck. 

My depression spiraled again and basically after a year I dropped out of college to focus on my job. My friends didn't really help me get over the relationship at all but they shared their weed with me. So I started using a lot of marijuana, to the point where I kept ruining my life. In debt from school, spending my money on rent because my roommates stopped paying their half of the rent and spending the rest on alcohol and drugs I finally reached out to my parent's. I told them I need to move home to get my life on track. 

A year after we decided to break it off officially I called her to try and get closure and she answered, I apologized for how our relationship got so fucked up and for being an asshole when she wanted to date again. She accepted and we laughed about old times. I asked if we could be friends again and she was hesitant so I didn't push the issue (her parents started hating me, I don't know if they knew the whole story of how our relationship degenerated but I could accept that at the time and she was a year into dating her now husband and didn't want to complicate that either which I also accepted).

Eventually I met my fiance and now we're three months from the wedding. I love her more than anything and she's been the main person to help me turn my life around. To say the least I never intend on losing her.  But to bring it back, I think about my ex less and less as time goes on but she has never left my mind entirely. I have random dreams about her and sometimes I see something or smell something that brings me back to memories of her. I don't love her, at least not the way I used to. It's not romantic but a more of a fondness for her and I still care that she's happy. I feel like a piece of me will always love her though and that's hard to accept especially when I want to give myself entirely to my fiancée. 
With that being said I have been thinking about contacting my ex just to talk and reconnect. She was a big part of my life for years before everything blew up. She was my best friend for years and we had a ton of things in common including our personalities and sense of humor. I doubt she's the same person that she was when we stopped talking, I know that I'm not. I also feel like it's important to say I don't want to ruin or strain her marriage in any way. As far as I'm concerned if she never told her husband about her and I sleeping together when they first got together that's her business and not mine to bring up. I also don't want to ruin my engagement/ soon to be marriage either. I've told my fiancée about my past and she understands how I feel about the whole situation and my feelings towards my ex. I just don't know if my ex has ever talked about our past with her husband...

TL:DR- It’s been about four years since we’ve contacted each other in any way, we had a messy break-up. She’s married now to the person she dated after me and I’m going to be married soon. I’m not trying to rekindle feelings/ pursue her romantically at all/ ruin her marriage or my soon to be marriage. I just miss her friendship and I want to know how she has been doing. I know I’ve changed a lot since we were together and I’m sure she isn’t the same person. Would 
trying to make contact with her just be a mistake?",04Mar2017,1
20,"I live in an apartment complex and this is ridiculous. I live in florida and I have two problems. The first is the landlord keeps putting noticed of entry on my apartment building for everyone in my section. I have two cats and the requirement for entry is to stow pets in kennels. I work an hour away and I work full time so I have to make arrangements to kake sure my cats are not locked in kennels for 10-12 hours because that is cruel and they will also need to eat and litterbox. Well. Second issue is when they give the notice they do not slip under the door or tape to the door. They open the door, put paper notice in the crack of the door and close it. I do not want some random stranger opening my front door around other random strangers and doing who knows what. (I know because once I was home and heard the door open amd close and it scared the fuck out of me) lastly, I understand advance notice of entry must be given in advance and they have to give it somehow but this is the third notice in a two week period.

I am going to get fined or something because my cats are not in crates because I cannot take yet another short day or time off work to secure them...and what in the hell are they checking for in such a short period?

21,"Hello all. I want to provide a little info before I start to throw out my problem. I work for a distribution company as a Merchandiser. I put new products on the shelves in grocery stores and provide service to them. Basically, I re-organize the shelf to accommodate new stuff. I work mostly at nights and in the mornings. 

Recently, I had a talk with my boss during a meeting and he told me to stop helping the customers of my customer. He said he understands that it has been ingrained in my brain to help the customer find products and serve them but he says it is not my responsibility to help their customers and that I have to focus on my work and do my job. I think this is wrong because the people who pay my customer are in fact the people who pay me to put the new products on the shelf and to further expand the business. Secondly, I was raised to help people and any job I have ever had has said that you should be customer-focused, regardless of who the customer is. Also, I have this belief that nothing in life is ever black and white. However, the other side of me is saying that this is my boss and I have to do what he says. I really feel like ignoring my boss here but I know either which way this will lead to issues. So /r/Advice, do I ignore my boss or does as he says and just work?

25,"I wasn't a stereotypical preteen, in fact ironically I hated my MS years but it felt like a much simpler time looking back. I was raised very strictly. And on top of that I was bullied a lot atleast in 8th grade &amp; by then lost all the ""friends"" I made. I had a slightly easier time in earlier grades of MS but I've never really trusted relationships, even when I had ""friends"". And I realized only after MS that any of the boys I chased were never really going to work out b/c they went down a slightly bad path, most sadly. Luckily I've never chased them besides a mild crush.(That's another problem I've never felt love or I'm sure capable of it)

I'm definitely not a preteen anymore but I had even less of a social experience afterwards in HS. And I've never really socialized in college yet. I'm still being forced to live strictly, as in I can't even listen to what my mom calls a ""love song"" or any of the songs you'd hear today. I'm Indian &amp; can't even date until marriage. 
I'm constantly even in a competition with my family &amp; extended family, whom I think believes I'm a loser, atleast 25% of them. Even though I'm the only one who joins in intelligent debates.

Long story short I wonder if the way I have turned out is normal or if I'm missing something I definitely can't feel. I'm fine with being immature. It even comes down to the kind of guy I like. My type would be Tanzin Norgay Trainor(Parker on Liv &amp; Maddie) if he was 10 years older. If he's a little older, he wouldn't even look much younger than I am. The most confusing part is I like guys who have girly features but probably aren't girly girls. Or the type of overloooked guy, who isn't considered attractive(except to me ) like Ron Weasley. Ron was the most attractive to me.

I'm maybe more immature than I should be. But I feel like it's part of who I am in a way and I don't even want to change, I don't think I can. Not that I don't act adult but I am a bit more innocent or playful. B/c of lack of experiences, my strict upbringing, &amp; maybe genetics. 

Though sometimes I feel like my mom is not too hard on me &amp; hard on me at the same time. She doesn't let me emotionally deal with things at times, she pushes me without letting me have the full experience. Though she also doesn't push me hard enough. I know it's hard on her and she is alone in many ways(same with my father); but  I think she also knows that I've always been alone without any support besides her.  My female cousins were never there for me.  
I know that isn't a clear explanation but it's a struggle for me to adjust. It doesn't help that i'm not very strong or have a lot of experience.  
I've been learning to think positively these days, letting go of anger I have for many what I believe are stuck up family members or just putting distance between me and them.  Being silly is therapy  for me.  I see I'm proving that I'm immature but sometimes I feel so weak, inexperienced, &amp; shy it's the only way I know how to deal with things I've never experienced and will not likely experience anytime soon. It  doesn't help I'm expected to keep silent either b/c I don't have as much freedom as everyone else.  ",04Mar2017,1

31,"Hey guys. So recently I've been feeling like I can't do much that I would like to in my life, because other than internet and what I own, I'm kind of cut off. I'd like to work, I'd like to drive, and in my free time, I'd like to play video games with other people, and it's tough to do any of these things. I'm 18 and I still don't have my license because I don't have 40 hours clocked in; my parents hardly take me to drive and there aren't many opportunities where they'll let me take the wheel because we never drive without reason, if that makes any sense (ie we drive to school and grocery store, not roam around or head to friend's house.) As for money, I can't drive, so considering I abide by my parent's driving mores, I wouldn't have the time for a job since they're always up to something. The only way I get money is by doing my dad's work at home, and even then that's a rare opportunity. Finally, I play video games quite a bit and I cherish times where I can do this with my friends. However, it's pretty hard to do this as well. My friends are usually too busy to play together in person, and my internet is bad/limited, so online's pretty much off the table. I also like going to tournaments related to Smash Bros (a fighting game which I like to think I'm good at), but I can't get further experience because either the reasons mentioned above or the fact that neither of my parents are willing to drive me 90 minutes to play a party game with a bunch of other nerds.

32,"Hi, Reddit. uhm I'm a huge introvert and overthinker so I really am shy a lot of times and not talk a lot and so end up being (really) awkward. 

I don't dislike talking to people generally though I find it a bit exhausting because I find myself freezing because I don't know what to talk to them about. I kind of end up just talking to them when I have some business with them and I guess that kinda sends antisocial/unfriendly vibes which I think drive people off. 

It's especially bad when I talk to somebody I like/admire because I end up giving curt replies and greetings because I get really shy and embarrassed and I know those are red/dead end flags and said person/s get the wrong idea and kind of not talk to me anymore. 

I'm less awkward when I'm with people who I feel are also introverted or share the same interests. I also have trouble initiating conversations. 

How do I solve the problem of sending the wrong impressions to other people? I mean if they've stopped talking to me because I don't really say much, how do I talk to them so I could I get them to talk to me again? That sounded kind of wrong :( but you know how could I fix things so they'll stop thinking I don't like them?

37,"     I'm a 17 year old kid. I love making music. If I could, I would sit around all day just making music. It's my dream to make music for the rest of my life.. I'll be honest, I want to blow up and make millions of dollars from music. But my mom doesn't believe in me. Ever since I started making music, my grades started to suffer. To punish me, she took all my music equipment away THAT I PAID FOR MYSELF! She said she would give my equipment back when I turned in all my missing assignments. Fast forward one week, I've turned in all my missing assignments  but she still refuses to give me my equipment back. 

     She wants me to go to college, pay 25K a year for a pointless degree, then get a job earning 60K a year hating myself and my job like she and most people in America do.

     That life is not for me. I'd rather die homeless and broke then work a 9-5 job for chump change. She does not understand that there is more than one path in life for people. She is close-minded. She thinks money is everything. It's like I can smell the greed on her breath every time she talks. It's sad to see her institutionalized by the public school system to think that money brings happiness. I'd rather die a homeless bum than earn 60K-80k a year working for someone else.

     Lately I've been contemplating running away because I can't be around these closed-minded, puppet motherfu*kers for much longer.

42,"Hi r/Advice,

For context I'm working as a lab assistant in a job I like a lot, even if it's not always perfect. My boss hired me when I decided to leave another position at the same institute due to incompatibility with my previous boss. At interview my boss said she wanted someone who would work with her for 2-3 years at least, with the understanding that people in my position/age often move around or leave for other careers, but I think if I wanted to she would be happy to have me for as long as she's able to. I feel very grateful to her for taking me on when she did. I also really like my colleagues and hope some of these relationships will last after I'm gone.

But my current job doesn't allow for a lot of progression, and to stay in the same field and advance I would have to do a PhD. I am getting frustrated with the nature of my job being more practical than intellectual and I want more of a challenge, but having worked in my field for a while, I have seen what postdocs go through and I don't want that life for myself, so I don't want to do a PhD.

I think I want to go back to university and do med school. Coming to that conclusion was a huge relief and I'm really itching to get started on that new path. I'm also kind of older compared to when most people start medicine (I'm 24) and feel like the longer I wait the more I'm falling behind, the more complicated having a family will be in the future, etc.

If I apply for med school this year I would start next January, meaning I would have worked for my boss for almost 2 years. If I apply next year I will have worked for her for nearly 3, the amount she said she wanted at my interview.

I want to leave on good terms with my boss and colleagues and I think staying a year longer will help that. The lab is in basic medical research at an influential institute so maintaining these relationships would also be beneficial if I become a doctor. But now I know what I want to do, staying another year seems so depressing. I'm so excited to move forward with my career.

I've asked family and friends for advice and they've all said to start school sooner, but I think they're biased. I haven't discussed this with my boss or colleagues because it's generally a bad idea to admit you're thinking of leaving. Unbiased advice would be much appreciated.

tl;dr I want to start med school ASAP but I want to maintain relationships with my boss/colleagues after I leave because I am grateful for my job and genuinely like them. Will leaving sooner make these relationships harder to maintain? Or is it worth it for me to move forward sooner?",04Mar2017,1

I'm up for a job at IU which pays well but it would force me to leave my best friend and roommate here in California. I pay tons in student loans.

First off, I would like to say I consider myself quite average in a competitive school so I am pretty sure the UCs would bother to go out of their way to reconsider my application over the many other better applicants. This fuck up happened in 2016, however, I just realized my mistake today after checking my UC Davis portal and realizing they have not received my official SAT scores. Officially they were due 2 weeks ago and I have no one to blame but myself for this. Although I have gotten into 2 states schools, my original intention was to get into a good UC. My private school admissions are mostly Reach schools so I have a low chance of getting in. Back in 2016 I sent in my official SAT test score to University of San Diego (USD) instead of University of California San Diego (UCSD). I have posted a thread in college confidential and hope to ask for advice from the reddit community also. I have found an old thread a year ago with a similar predicament and some advice given was to send it in ASAP and call in when admission office opens (on Monday), however, in the thread, there was no conclusive information from OP about what happened.

50,"I think I'm spoiled, and I feel really bad about it. 

So basically what happens is that I am obsessed with video games. I love video games and I play it like a lot. My school grade are OK , I have some B's and A's. I do chores every week, I either clean the table and sweep the floor or I just wash the dishes. 

Anyways, onto the real part. So around like 2 months ago, my like 2 year old laptop was getting really slow and it was loosing keys. I couldn't run my favorite video games like CS:GO. (I actually could but it would be at 5-10 fps in-game) So I asked my parents for a new laptop, they said yes and bought me a 300 dollar laptop. This laptop was great, it could run all the games I wanted. (Now you're probably thinking, how could you run CSGO on a 300$ laptop?) Well, we got a pretty good deal off of Amazon. Anyway, so after like a week of having it, It completely broke. I couldn't get on the laptop and it just shut-down. So obviously, I could do any homework or play any games. They had to return it back and got the money back. I had to use my old laptop that was really slow which really sucked, I could barely even do my homework on there. Then my parents said I could buy like a 200 dollar laptop for homework. Then this game called Overwatch came out, its 40$ USD and I asked my parents if I could get Overwatch. I was stupid to think I could run in on my laptop. But my parents said yes and they said I could get it if I don't need to get a laptop anymore. I said okay because I really wanted this game to play with my friends. Then after that, my old laptop broke and I have to use my brothers really crappy, old laptop. I can barely even play like Minecraft on low settings without getting like 10 fps. :P I also really want to record games on Youtube so that really pulled down my motivation. Now my parents could say I could get another laptop. But I really don't want to, I really feel bad for them because they buy me so many things. I even tried refunding Overwatch but they wouldn't let me because I bought it out of the time range for refunding which is 72 hours. I also have photoshop which is 10$ a month, I got that for my birthday though but still, its really tons of money. I will probably refund photoshop soon but I can right now because there is a termination fee or something like that. Now its time for you guys to answer, Am I spoiled, or not?

I also would like to add that I asked all my friends and they said they all get their stuff from their birthday or Christmas and they either have to earn their money or it's something really cheap. That is what makes me think I'm spoiled. Even one of my friends said I was spoiled. :/",04Mar2017,2

I told him I'm a virgin and he didn't believe me at first because he says I'm very attractive, but he isn't one and has quite a handful of bodies which makes me a bit nervous just bc I'm not as experienced.

52,"I apologize in advance for the long post. I tried to be concise while giving out as much information as possible.  

I'm starting my first year in university and I already did two years in college. 

During middle school I had very poor self esteem, but when high school hit, I became a lot of confident. Then, during my two years in college, I became a lot of sociable and much more outgoing. 

Now, I feel very good in my skin. I'm eating healthier and I'm exercising a lot. School's good, family's good, great friends, etc. I feel like everything's going great in my life. 

However, after I gained more confidence (especially during college), I started needing more approval. I started needing people to tell me things that I already knew about myself. (And yes, I truly know these things. I'm not just trying to convince myself that I have these traits.) 

For example, I know that I'm considered a ""smart"" person in the sens that I perform well academically. However, I need a guy that I'm close to (whether it's my boyfriend, a friend or someone I'm seeing) to tell me that I'm smart. That's just one example. I could go on. 

So here's my question: what can I do to stop needing someone's approval? 

I've been struggling with this for a long time and I don't know where to turn. (I'm thinking about going to see a therapist.)

54,"So I am a 17 year old girl and whenever me or me and my mom go anywhere we get followed by some guy. Normally they are like 40 or older. It happens nearly EVERY SINGLE TIME we go anywhere. And I often see men staring at me. And I'll look back at them and they just keep staring. I don't look strange or anything that would make anyone stare at me and it just makes me feel so uncomfortable. 

Example: me and my mom got out of the car and this weird old guy snuck up right behind us (my mom said she could feel his breath on her neck before she even saw him) and he said ""Hey Ladies!"" and my mom screamed (also my mom has a heart condition and she said her heart rate was super high because of this. Thanks random guy) and the guy kept acting weird telling us he wanted to tell us a joke. Then my mom and I sped up and walked into the store, and my mom went to the bathroom and I went to look in the store elsewhere and the guy followed me everywhere I went. He wasn't even trying to be unsuspicious. It was so frustrating. It makes me feel so scared and uncomfortable. Then later today these two older guys in cowboy clothes kept staring at me. And I swear I'm not overreacting or just thinking they're staring. They ARE staring. 

So what should I do when something happens like this? Like I don't think I should call 911 when they're following us because sometimes they don't even talk to us but it really makes me feel scared. I don't know what to do.

He does visit the house once every 4 or 7 days, but for most of the week he is absent.

Now I know better than to doubt my own dad's words, and I know my dad has been having really difficult times over last two years trying to find an income. But rest of the family here are getting reeeeeally anxious thinking about where or who he might be with right now. What if he's doing something illegal for work?

I live on campus in a single dorm and I'm a very shy, anxious person so I haven't made a single acquaintance, much less any friends.

Bookkeeper, mechanic, cook... And me, being a laughable excuse for a human being, want to be an artist of some kind. Animation, graphic design, concept art, character design, as long as it's art related. But I know that I can't make a living off of this, and I'm just going to be another stupid kid who spent their savings on a useless degree. I just feel alone and kinda stupid.

I've always wanted to get a career in something art related, but I've basically given up that hope. While my art skills have improved by leaps and bounds over the past few months, I don't feel like I'm going to be at a good enough skill level to be able to get into any art school. 

I find myself comparing myself to other artists and while I generally am able to look at someones art and say ""Hey, I want to practice to improve to be able to draw at that skill level,"" I know secretly that while yes, with time I will be able to improve to that level, it won't be before I'm out of highschool. 

Since I was a tiny kiddo I've always wanted to be making art for a living, so it hurts telling myself this.

Honestly I'm just looking for advice on whether or not I should chase that dream, and if not, how I should accept this. Even if I don't chase it, I'll continue it as a side hobby, and try and focus my efforts on finding work that I'd enjoy, but it'll still hurt having to let go.

Today I went to a department store change room and they had artificial lighting. It could have been the fact that the change rooms are so small and I was forced to look at my reflection from only two inches away from the mirror, but I looked shorter. Also, my face was all red like I'd just ran a marathon. It also had a lot of reddish/pinkish discolourations which I found generally unflattering. 

People tell me I tend to look very boyish for my age [24] and I can generally see this youthfulness in the mirror, but today, in this artificial lighting I didn't look boyish. It was trippy — I looked like a shorter, fatter version of ''myself''. And now I'm not sure which one is the true me.

1) I've left her on our way to Las Vegas with two of her own friends. One friend was mean to me at the airport so I got up and left. I decided to sleep at the airport and take the first flight back home in the morning. We stopped talking for about 5 months. 

2) I just began speaking to her again in December. I asked her if I could rent the room in her apartment in Berkeley. She has a three bedroom 1.5 bathroom. We verbally agreed to $950. The room is about 9ft by 9ft, so it's a small room. The other bedroom belongs to her daughter and the master is my hers.

She has a boyfriend who sleeps over every single day and hangs out in the apartment during the day as well. He has a job so he's not a loser. She asked me if it was okay before, and I said yes because her daughter needs a sort of father figure and he helps with the dog. I was lying :/.

Personally, I have a shit load of anxiety and hate being around the common areas when he's around. I just feel like the third wheel and like my attempts at conversation are shot down. I basically don't feel comfortable anywhere besides my room.

She's been very helpful and kind otherwise. 

I told her before the Month of February was over that I was going to move out by the end of March. Although I lashed out today and told her the real reason I was moving out.

I just came back from a 5150 hold from the hospital due to massive amounts of stress, so I sort of lashed out saying that she was overcharging me for rent. The whole lease is $1826 and I didn't think it was fair. Whatever, it's her deal and she charges what she needs to. I just felt like I was taken advantage of paying a little more than her half of the rent while her room is huge and the boyfriend lived in for free. The world's not fair; tough luck for me. We live in the San Francisco Bay Area, although this three bedroom is very cheap compared to others around here.

I don't necessarily want to repair the friendship, but I want to end this roommate thing amicably. Should I start looking for people to rent the room or should she?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Unstable friendship but now roommates. I lashed out because I felt the rent was unfair. It was verbally agreed upon and I totally understand that the world works the way it works. What are the right words to express that I'm sorry? I apologize for the typos!

The Choice: Take a new respected position, or change life path entirely. 

I have recently been offered a new job as the General Manager of a large MNC in Taiwan. The pay is ~ $60 K/annually and responsibilities are fairly heavy. I have been working in this industry for 7 years and have a very niche skill set that makes me relativity qualified for the office head in this country. I am 29 years old. 

The issue is, I do not enjoy the company I work for, nor the actual industry, and have been considering turning my career and life in a new direction. I very much enjoy web development and freelancing work, which I have started doing on the side and already have had a little success with (paying customers).

So the advice that I would like to ask from you is, should I take the new GM position because it will be a great mark on my resume, a great learning experience, and stable paycheck... Or, turn down the position and try to move into something I feel much more passionately about and explore new avenues?

I am extremely torn as the pragmatic side in me says the answer is very simple, take the position. However the emotional and human side of me recognizes that I am likely walking into another several years of unsatisfying and trenching digging work.

He says 240 and I'm getting kind of pissed, I just agree and he slips me the money and bails. I'm at work, customers, I'm upset, this is not the time to *talk*.  

So now I have, no reliable car and not enough to cover repairs+bills, this eats at me the rest of the shift, fuck.  

I simply can't make this work. We met after work, it basically boiled down to ""I can't do this"" and that I need the keys back, hand him the 240 from earlier back.  

He now says he can get the rest of the money, 260-300.. idk, by tomorrow and then a few minutes later by tonight. My mind is made up at this point.  

After some protest, I kept the first payment as fees, was that wrong? He had the car for a little over a week, I figure 100 cover rental+insurance.  
I'm not sure how I'm gong to cover the bills. I told him I'd sell him the car this week for 800, 200 less than asking, if he could make it happen.  

I wish I could help the guy, trust basically a stranger but I just can't, not a third time even if it might be ""later tonight"". I'm on the cusp of homeless myself, too many bad decisions in a row, I really can't afford another.  

Nice enough guy, new coworker just trying to get  back on his feet, but I just simply don't have the cushion to be playing around.   I thought about a fundraiser but I don't know the first thing nor do I have a computer. 

I mentioned trying to help him find a cheaper car, that didn't go so well. ugh.. he works first thing tomorrow and has no car. :/  

What should I do?

88,"Bear with me, this is a little long. So a friend/coworker of mine, we'll call her Kate, was on a dating site a while ago and met this guy named 'Mike'. They talked for a couple of weeks, only for him to tell her out of nowhere that he's really someone else not named Mike and that his initial pictures were fake. He said that she passed his dating test and is a genuine person and that he felt comfortable sharing his true identity with her. Naturally, she was upset that he lied, and blocked him.    
  
Last week, this guy ends up coming in to the casino (this is important) where we work looking for Kate. Turns out, he looked her up on Facebook and found out where she works, her full name, etc. Fortunately, she was out of town for the weekend. He left a package for her with the manager on duty, who opened it with security and surveillance present to make sure it wasn't a bomb or something dangerous. Inside was a big stack of love letters. HR has the letters and they will not let Kate see them. (Not sure if this is illegal? I understand why they don't want her to see them, but whether they actually have legal right to hold them is something we don't know.) The manager also called Kate and told her about the situation, and even a little bit of what was in the letters.   
  
Naturally, Kate called the police. Unfortunately, they can't do a damn thing because this guy is frustratingly clever and hasn't given her his real name. Remember how I mentioned that we work at a casino? There are security guards at every entrance. Despite the guy obviously looking in his twenties (they're supposed to ID anyone who looks under thirty), whoever was on the door at the time did not ID him so Kate does not know this guy's real name. That one slip up really makes things difficult. Surveillance photos won't do much save for discourage him from coming back - which he hopefully won't do. However, he did send her another message saying he had another package for her that would be delivered in July, which is when her birthday is. She's really hoping to have this dealt with by then though.    
  
The one thing Kate does have is his phone number. She got her friend to call while pretending to be an employee from one of the telecommunication companies here. Unfortunately, they picked the wrong one to pretend to be from, so their attempt at getting his name failed. Can the police not contact the cell phone company and get a name that way or would they need a warrant? Is it something worth pursuing? For the record, we're in Canada.     
  
I've suggested to Kate that she needs to either delete, lock down, or even change her name on Facebook. It's too late to protect her from this guy, but it will help prevent future incidents. She's going to get security to escort her to her car after work. She's going to get pepper spray or something and carry it in her purse. (Guns are absolutely not an option.)   
  
What else can my friend do? This is a really scary situation for her, and I'm pretty frustrated on her behalf on how our manager and security failed at handling it properly. She doesn't want to get whoever was on the door in trouble but I think it needs to be addressed so that everyone is on the lookout for this type of behavior - whether it's her stalker, or someone else's. (Mini rant, sorry.) She also needs the money and can't afford to take time off.

89,"Okay, I feel very guilty about this. I've been feeling guilty for years now but at this point I'm just suppressing it.

I got my rabbit when I was a teenager. I really wanted a rabbit cause I was stupid and thought they were cute, so my parents got me one. I never bonded with her. She would always loudly oink at me and bite me if I came near her and it never changed.

Unlike cats, rabbits don't like anything. She only wants to sleep, eat and burrow. She cares for none of her toys.

I moved across the country after having her for a year and she stayed with my parents. I didn't want to take her with me because my now husband and I were in the middle of finding a house and getting married and it's dangerous to take a rodents on an airplane anyway.

Now we moved back to my parents' state and she's still here, but we're of course expected to take her in as soon as we settle. My parents thought about giving her back to the ASPCA but never did. They seem to think kt's better for her to be stuck in a cage pissing herself.

Oh yeah, she picked up this lovely new habit of pissing outside her cage. The stench gives me migraines and t seeps into the floor. She still oinks when I'm cleaning the shit from her cage or feeding her. Even if I dare give her a treat she will oink and attack. 


I don't know what to do. She's like at least 7 years old and I'm not sure what's the most humane thing to do. Stick it out for another couple of years? Give her to the ASPCA? Put her on Craigslist? ",04Mar2017,0
90,"Hello everyone! First of all, I work at a public residential facility as an assistant caregiver. This is my first job and I've been working here for two months. Let me tell you some important details about the place, which is essentially a facility where people who suffer from serious mental illness are dropped off by family members who are no longer willing/financially capable of supporting them. Some of the patients were found wandering in nearby streets, while others were brought here after having physically harmed themselves or somebody else. The thing is, some of the patients are visited regularly by friends or relatives, but some others  were just left here and after that, their relatives were never heard of again. This is the case of the man whom my concern is about. We'll call him R.
R was brought here 2 years ago by a young man who is supposedly his nephew. According to my co-worker who has been working here since 2013, the nephew gave the staff his contact information and told them that he would come soon to visit R, but he's never come back since that day. The main receptionist tried contacting him countless times to no avail until everyone just gave up. They all later found out that the address and phone number that he provided did not exist at all. 

R is 54 years old and suffers from some undifferentiated kind of developmental delay and urinary incontinence. He is almost non-verbal and only uses a few words to ask for food, water, to let us know he is not feeling well, etc. He can walk and move from place to place on his own but his legs are noticeably weak. I work the afternoon shift and my duty consists of assisting R's main caregiver, which is the person I think may be mistreating him. We'll call her G. At first I thought that G was just stressed out (it's a very demanding job) because she complained a lot about R and how difficult was to deal with him. He would refuse to get up from bed or to eat, things like that. A few days later, G didn't show up to work so I had to be R's main caregiver for the day, and he just acted like the sweetest man on Earth. He smiled a lot, ate well, didn't refuse to get out of bed and even agreed to go for a walk with me around the hospital to get distracted. I thought his change in attitude was surprising but I couldn't tie it to G's absence at the moment. Where things started to get fishy was one night like two weeks ago when I was doing overtime. I put R to bed and waited until he fell asleep before leaving his room. Then I went to the restrooms at the end of the corridor, not far from R's room. A few moments later I heard a quick shriek that came from his room, followed by heartbreaking, continuous crying. I ran out from the restroom into the corridor only to see G storming out of R's room and going downstairs. I went to check up on him and tried to calm him down, but he couldn't explain what had happened. I checked for signs of injury. Nothing. I followed G downstairs and asked her about the incident, to which she replied that she went to check on R after hearing him scream and that he was probably just having a bad dream. I wasn't satisfied with her explanation, something just didn't add up (why did she storm out of R's room instead of staying with him and trying to calm him down?). 

So far, it's been 2 weeks and 4 or 5 similar incidents have taken place (R starts to cry after being alone with G, G acts confused and makes up explanations that seem quite fishy). It's important to mention that R is not used to cry over minor things. He cries when he is really uncomfortable, scared, in pain, or running a very high fever. The more I think of it, the greater my concern. I have examined his whole body but there's no evident sign of injury to be found and it's driving me nuts. Other things that have me thinking are:

1. G tells me not to feed R because she ''already fed him'' while I was not there. Later, R tells me that he is really hungry. I feed him.

2. One time a co-worker witnessed how R asked G to take him to the restroom (he fell down and his left leg hurt too much for him to walk). He yelled: Pee! Pee! over and over again but she waited until he had wet his pants and proceded to scold him and tell him to clean the floor, until my co-worker intervened and didn't allow G to make R clean.

3. I have heard G tell R to ''stop bothering her'' when he is just trying to show him some flower or leaf he has found, how his eyes are each a different colour, or a toy he really likes.

Please help me, I have already reported everything that has happened to my boss but he thinks I'm overreacting because G has been working here for nearly 3 years and my boss considers her to be a model caregiver, and besides, nobody had had any problems with her before. He sent R to the physician and no injuries were found. I'm at a point where I've been thinking of taking R home with me just to prevent R from being alone with G (she works the night shift and has access to his room at any hour). You guys may think I'm exaggerating but I really don't want to take the risk of a sweet, innocent man being harmed.

98,"Hey Reddit. For background, I'm a young M adult (-20) that had bad relationship experiences before (sudden breakups and such). I became fed up eventually, and decided not to seek out any more heartbreaks for the foreseeable future. I actually found it nice to interact with girls in the same sexually disinterested way as other guys. In doing that, a girl I work with (who has/had her own bf) realized I'm single and offered to 'find me a girl', because she had 'plenty of friends' who were 'on the market'. I acted on that with a sort of kneejerk response telling her that I appreciated the offer but wasn't really looking for anyone at the moment. (She seemed to take it wrong.) After re thinking on what she said, I wanted to know if anyone else had good experiences with people 'matchmade' by others. I initially thought it was a bad idea, but maybe I just thought too selectively...? Does that kind of offer even sound beneficial, or desperate?

106,"I am currently employed in a small business and just got an offer from a larger company. I am really happy for the offer because it is a position where I will enjoy more the tasks and the salary is considerably better (I was paid significantly under the national average for my position, the new salary is aligned with the national average).

Leaving the company will create a serious disruption, as I am the only person covering this position and I am not easily replaceable. In addition, my line manager is pregnant and due in 3-4 months, so it is the worst possible timing for the business.

I like the people in the company and I learned a lot from them (for which I am grateful), so I want to leave on good terms.

So I've been wanting to get into a sport for a while now. I do running but It's not something I watch on tv. I do enjoy running but watching it on tv is a little bit eh... not that interesting...

146,"Sorry in advance for poor writing skills! I am 18 years old and will be graduating in June. As a little bit of backstory, I come from a long line of sexual abuse in my family and a lot of physical and mental abuse from my mother. When I was 12, I sexually abused a little cousin because I wanted to reenact what had been done to me. Unlike myself, the cousin was able to speak up and I got in a lot of trouble and the police were involved.(I understand what I did was wrong and do sincerely wish I could take it back, but I have had to accept it happened and live with the consequences) I luckily was not registered as a sex offender or given a punishment by the police. But that was put into my juvenile records.  Fast forward 5-6 years and I was trying to get into the military. I wanted to join to serve my country but also to get away from my mother. Due to my past I was rejected about a month ago and now I'm just getting started with college stuff. I could really use some help with this and sadly there is more to this tale. A couple weeks ago my mother lost $40 and blamed me for it going missing. I swear I didn't take the money but she refuses to see this any other way. She has taken everything from me and just yesterday took my car and locked me out of my room.( I have to sleep in the living room) There is no food in the house and she basically cooks and buys enough just for herself. I just got a job and start on Monday, but I'm not sure how I'm going to make it. Everything just looks bleak and I have nothing figured out. I am deemed highly intelligent but lazy( as an example i was a few points from a perfect score on the practice asvab I was given). I don't know if I made a whole lot of sense, but I have troble keeping my thought organized. I basically just need help and advice. I honestly don't know what to do. The military people were able to see my past so will my future employers be able to?

147,"Guys,
     I believe I am experiencing burn out in my career of sales, and I am just not quite sure how to overcome it. I have been in car sales for approximately two years and I have done exceptionally well and have consistently been a 15-20 cars a month guy. In October of 2016, I made a decision to leave a dealership that I absolutely loved but the new General Manager had made it very unbearable and was no longer happy even though the store sold over 300 cars a month. I moved to a new dealership where I was making really good money and we were selling close to 300 cars a month. The owner of the dealership I had left contacted me to offer a finance manager position to me at one of his new stores he opened. I have not yet got the promotion and it could be months before it happens. To make a long story short, this dealership is only pushing about 60 cars a month and the money is not where it needs to be. I am driving an hour and 20 minutes each way, everyday. My money is running out and sales is what I absolutely love doing. How can I overcome this sales burnout? I do not know what has happened but my hustle, drive and motivation has just disappeared. Now, when I get to work I just look forward to being able to leave. Any advice?",04Mar2017,1

Now I know that whilst in college I could work small jobs. I've applied for a lot of them but got no calls. And I did some art commissions online but they are far and few between. I do transcription work on scribie but that's basically working for nothing (less than a dollar an hour).

So that's a lot of classes, in case you didn't know, around 34 hours a week, plus homework and projects etc I don't have time for a job really. 

On top of that I have anxiety disorder and I'm really not good with people or fast paced situations, ie fast food jobs... So I don't know what to do.

Why do I want money? So I can pay my own rent (feel like shit when dad pays it every month), and better yet, save up for my own place (I hate living with roommates, also due to anxiety), or a car (hate getting rides from others constantly. I have all this fucking guilt)

Yesterday she let me know that a new restaurant is opening up nearby and it was the last day of their job fair. I made myself look presentable and professional, printed my resume and headed down. 

My interview went okay. I'm terrible under pressure to describe myself and talk myself up, so I fumbled on my words and had a little trouble with a couple questions. The thing is, I'm an excellent, very hard worker and I was really excited to hear of the opportunity of this new restaurant. 
Now, we were both told that we'd hear from them over the weekend, asked about uniforms and hours and training. However, my friend got a second interview and I only got one, which leads me to believe that I did not have a very good interview. 

She got her email about an hour ago. 

Is there anything I can do to come back from this? Could I email the restaurant and ask for a second interview? I was really looking forward to this, and now I just feel very disappointed in myself because I know that I just messed up my interview, but I'd be great in the position. ",04Mar2017,1

My horny self derives much excitement from indulging in this fetish, but as soon as I'm done masturbating, immediately after I start hating myself. Then I tell myself, that I will forever fight it to keep it at bay. Eternal inner conflict, if that's what it takes to prevent it. 

So I fight, until I give in again eventually, and the cycle repeats, and I end up feeling horrible either way. There's just no way I can accept this fetish. It's nothing too fucked up, it's quite common actually, but it's degrading. I fucking hate it, and I get REALLY angry at myself when I indulge in it, like I want to smash a mirror or just, take my anger out on something as it is too intense. 

This fetish is an obstacle in the way of the person who I want to be. There is no way I am going to accept it. I don't care if the only person who knows about it is my sexual partner.

159,"I'm a 20 year-old programming major and have been in an absolutely amazing relationship for the past 6 months. However, as of recent (not sure how recently, but maybe the past few months), I've began to feel a bit different in some ways. I consider myself to be kind of ambi-verted (changes in settings, but I have no issue with talking to others and going to louder events), but I feel like I've hit some sort of block, both conversationally and how I feel I come off as.

In my relationship, there's been a conversation block for some time where I just cannot think of what to say - being a conversational buffer is no problem, nor are thinking of plans and what to do, but just starting conversation and keeping topics going. I don't have this issue in most of my friendships but know it's happened before in my past relationships, and I'd like to be able to overcome it while still staying in my relationship. We still talk and have no issue texting or anything and spend a fair deal of time together, but we just hit blocks in person at times (usually in the morning and afternoons, but by night I'll be okay and can converse a lot easier). With most of my friends, I have a lot more energy (especially in group settings) and that's when I'm loudest and most bold, but with her, I tend to stay more basic with how I act. It's so weird how different my mindsets can be and how my comfort zone expands/detracts in those different environments. We've opened up to each other and are insanely close, I just can't bypass the energy-level part.

As of this semester, I've been spending just about all of my time doing homework and studying, minus days here and there of going on a few trips and going out. I know we need time away from each other and our own separate experiences to help keep conversation fresh and our lives interesting, but what else? I don't want to fall into a hole of some sort and lose myself and my identity as a person. I love music, things technology-related, art, exercise, and trying most new things. I don't drink or smoke either, which I feel limit me in some ways. Would regularly reading and watching film help me out, in terms of expression and personality?

171,"I believe in passive long-term index investing. My young friend Jesse, whom I took under my wing when he began investing less than 2 years ago, rejects my advice to avoid day trading. I am tired of trying to use logic, reasoning, and math to convince him, and I know he likes gambling and a challenge. So, I offered a wager against him whereby we would each invest a given amount for 10 years, and at the end, whomever had the most in their account would win the bet. I suggested the bet be $10k, but that was a little too rich for his blood and he said he was interested in a $1k wager instead. I believe this to be an even greater advantage to me, since trading commissions represent a higher percentage of his initial investment. So, I agreed. However, we still need to work out the terms to ensure the spirit of the bet, which is to identify the whose strategy is best. Here are the terms I think are appropriate and my reasons. Please help me identify issues I may be overlooking.
We will establish a joint investment account that is taxable in order to ensure transparency in purchases, withdrawals, taxes, fees, commissions, and performance.
I will invest $1k into VTSAX (Vanguard's total stock market index) and leave that investment alone for the duration of the bet.
Jesse will invest $1k, and may only invest in individual companies of his choosing, but may trades stocks or leave cash in the account's money market however he chooses.
Jesse will not adopt any strategy that attempts to track the VTIAX index fund. This is to prevent from gaining an initial advantage 1 day into our bet and then just converting the investment so that it matches my investment over the next 10 years, which would defeat the purpose of the wager.
All fees/commissions must be paid by the appropriate party from the account in accordance with our brokerage's requirements.
Taxes must be paid yearly in accordance with IRS guidelines. The money will come from the appropriate person and must be withdrawn from their portion of the account. Obviously, Jesse's frequent trades will result in capital gains upon which taxes must be paid annually. Unless tax law changes as I understand it, the only taxes on my portion will come from realized dividends.
The final account balance that determine's the winner will be assessed after all capital gains are taxed. This will prevent any edge to me based on the fact that all of my long-term capital gains will be unrealized.
The wager will be $1k. The winner will be whomever has the most in their portion of the account after taxes on the close of the market on the same date as the date the money is invested 10 years afterwards (perhaps March 31, 2027)
Jesse may not take actions that use my investment as collateral. For example, he may short stocks, which he likes to do, but if the amount he must cover ever matches the value of his portion of the account, he must immediately sell off and cover. In other words, he may not risk my money. If this happened, his portion's balance would be 0, and the bet will be settled immediately.
Is there anything else I should be considering, or any better way to manage this bet?",04Mar2017,1

Anyways, we don't really talk all that much Bc she lives an hour away and we used to hang out a couple times a week but I got tired of driving over to her. So then it was once a week 
she doesn't have a car. my dad has taken my car -Now we both depend on our Bf for rides.

I have a out of town house and we have been there a couple times and her Bf drives her out there. 
Now we only text a couple times a month and don't hang out unless she wants to go to there. 

Recent situation: 
She texts me and says ""I miss you so much, I need my -insert my nickname- do you want to hang out?"" 
I said ""yeah but I don't have a car to get to you""
Her: "" Wanna go to the out of town house?"" 
I was busy, apologized to her and told her why.

Today I text her and tell her I'm free if she wants to come over but I still can't go out of town.

*This is the sketchy part*

She says ""oh I went the other day but your grandpa was there so we went to the neighbors dock"" 

-this is private property and these people are gun loving rednecks that won't hesitate to shoot. 
- I told her no in the first place and she goes without me anyways?? 
- I don't even own it I have to ask my gpa permission to stay the weekend! 

I ask my mom what to do about it and she said to let her know that was not okay and she could get in serious trouble. 
I told my mom idk if I still wanted to be friends with her Bc she doesn't seem like the best of friend? And she trespassed. 
My mom told me to hang out with her one more time and see how it goes I followed her advice and now she's asking when and where we should hang. 

Should we find a mutual place to hang or should I ask her to come here? 
Should I even be friend with her

For this reason, she still tries to keep in contact with her ex-husband as ""friends"", despite everything he has done, because he still pays for the house/bills.

I've talked with her about it and she says the reason she never bothered to get a job is because ""men are supposed to put bread on the table"" and she expected to live as a housewife her entire life. She thinks she's too old to get a job now and is scared of the day her ex-husband stops paying for the house.

I moved a year and a half ago to do my masters. I visit my home city once a month -- which is the only time I get to hang out with Betty &amp; Bob. Both my friends have recently become unemployed. They were both terribly unlucky and got laid off. So, now, when we hang out -- I make sure we do something we can all do (as to mind other's financial situation). Both Betty and Bob have been less themselves since becoming unemployed. Which I can understand.

As their friends, and because they've become more my family then friends; I often make efforts to send them any jobs I know of that came my way. I just want to see them both do well. I don't talk about my personal life unless they ask me -- i.e.: my relationship. A few weeks ago, they both asked how things have been with my boyfriend (who I started dating six months ago). I told them things have been going really well and that we'll be moving in together soon. This is my first relationship of the three I've had in my life, that I'm sure that I want to be with this person forever. They sounded happy... but not genuinely happy (I know when they're faking it so to speak). We always share good news with each other, but lately, I don't feel like I can. They asked how school was... told them I'm going to be doing my residency soon. They didn't really seem to care, which hurt... I've worked so hard between my health and other obstacles to reach this point in my life. I really thought they'd be happy for me... like the way I'm happy for them when they reach their goals.

My friends since then have been avoiding me like a plague. We all usually text each other at morning/night to wish each other well. They won't respond to me.

I've been working on the book for almost three years, and working at this dead end job for two years. I'm still young, 24, but i feel like I've dug myself into a hole.

in a way I've replace one nigh hopeless impracticality with another in the form of this writing dream. It's what I've always wanted, honestly, but it's also really really hard and would take a fair amount of luck to accomplish. 

As far as my skills, I'm confident in my abilities to write, to speak to people, and i feel competent at almost everything I pick up besides math. Essentially, I am also interested in everything, I am a very passionate guy and can get sucked in via curiosity about the peculiarities of all sorts of disciplines. I feel like all the investments I put into myself are totally wasted at this current job. 

I'm bashing myself but I always thought of myself as smart, but I clearly wasn't smart enough to craft an intelligent life plan. I like to blame it on the Disney channel mentality I grew up with, it told me I was special and could do whatever I want, but the real world isn't like that. I really want to get back on track but I feel so lost, between the daily routine of my job and also the effort of my book and the wasted hours surfing Reddit... just feels like there's no time. And I also feel so uncertain about what I want and what path to take.

Sorry for the long speech but i wanted you to have context. I'm thinking that I have to give academia one last go, as it seems like the only way to make my philo degree worth anything is to get a masters. The question for me is: what degree can maximize a potential for a career that can provide comfort for myself and family, as well as fulfillment? Unfortunately math and science fields are out for me as that's just not where my skills lie. As I said, I'm pretty open to new disciplines.  I'm really wary about pursuing philosophy after being so disillusioned about what the degree did for me in the first place. But idk, interested to hear what you guys think. Everyone says I should be a teacher but that field seems saturated.

Further, what do I do about this dead end job that I feel is corrupting the soul I don't believe in? Haha I'm being dramatic, I know all jobs are tough. But this shit is making me depressed! If it wasn't for the book, I would feel hopeless. Anyway, thanks for any advice you can muster!",04Mar2017,3
191,"So I'm talking to this 1 girl and we're both really interested in each other. Today we were supposed to hang out; her dad dropped her off and she came in. About like 30 seconds later he knocked on my door and told her to leave. I was really confused, but found out that she said she was going to a girl's house that lives nearby me. Not the best 1st impression to have; what should I do to help go over this hiccup?",04Mar2017,3
196,"Could write a book on the trainwreck that is my family life, but I'll try and keep this brief.

I'm 20, in the second year of a university course, attending from home. Since I don't like the course for many reasons, I'm going to be dropping out very soon (without going into details, student debt won't be an issue). My parents wouldn't tolerate this and would likely want me gone, but that's fine; nothing would please me more than getting out of here.

That's the theory anyway. Fact of the matter is, I lack any and all independence. Never had a job, lived at home my entire life, no real friends. The thought of going out on my own terrifies me, but it has to be done. Have the feeling that the longer I wait the worse it will get.

Could use any advice I can get in this situation, but I understand it's a little broad. If I can be more specific, anybody have advice as to what jobs I should be seeking as a 20 year old dropout with no experience and how I should go about it? Just about the only industry I'd be hesitant about is fast food, but I'm definitely not in a position to be choosy. Thanks",04Mar2017,1

Response to Superchecker:

I have been to Disney World many times. My stepdad isn't really a fan of visiting Florida. Also, the theme parks get really expensive. 

Response to mrmeeseeks8:

All the people who would be going on the trip: my mom, stepdad, me (30 years old), and my older stepbrother.",04Mar2017,2
200,"So I'm not in any way attracted to children in any way, however I like to imagine myself what they may look like when they become adults... But still I feel like a pedophile... I'm not...

201,"I was given a demo model of a pair headphones from my mom, the company she worked for said throw them out and she brought them home and said hey, here you go. I've found someone who wants to trade them for a great piece of guitar gear, and now my parents are up in arms that it's immoral to profit from this, and now I'm absolutely not to do it or I'm in huge trouble, however I'm 19 and moved out of the house...

I personally see no moral issue here, and for clarity this isn't some boutique headphones from a mom and pop store. They're Beats from Walmart, in mint condition and perfectly clean. 

Maybe it is morally incorrect, and if it is I won't do it. But I don't see the issue, so am I being ridiculous? ",04Mar2017,1
202,"She asks me out to get lunch every day, she sends me post-it notes,  She keeps hugging me. She's beautiful, nice and perfect in every way. I am on the verge of accepting that I'm gay. YET! HEre comes this girl who's mixing my feelings. Will I deny her? How? Will I accept her intentions? Will I be true to myself and not hurt this girl? I'm so confused! ",04Mar2017,40
204,"I just posted about another ""friend"" on here. I haven't had very many friends growing up (I'm only 19) but I can't seem to make any true genuine friends. They all just seem to abuse my kindness. I had a really good friend and I often think back to our friendship (that I ended 2 months ago) but I can't help but think of the petty things, like I always paid, I always drove, she didn't want to hang out with my Bf, and I seemed to ask her to hang out more often even though we had a great time everytime we hung out. We often spoke about how great of friends we were (we could go a week straight together and not argue once- I can't even do that with my Bf) I asked on here before if I should be friends with her and was told she was just using me as well 
I guess I'm just wondering how to make friends. I have a son that's 2 I don't get out of the house at all expect to go to work where everyone is 10 years+ older than me so I have no friends there 
I am an awesome person I feel like. I am funny I am kind I am a great listener I loathe conflict idk I just don't know why I can't find friends ",04Mar2017,3
205,"I'm the only woman in a college club, and whenever I show up this one guy there ALWAYS looks me up and down and it's so disgusting, pervy and obvious. Women reading this, you know that feeling.  Whenever he does that I zip up my jacket and glare at him or turn away. He seems embarassed by that but then continues to do it. This is a continuing issue and I really want to set him straight. There's no doubt he does it to other women too. How do I confront this?",04Mar2017,1
207,"Recently my brother got a bunch of ww2 gas masks donated to him and im really concerned because I researched online and I heard they contain asbestos. He first got addicted to collecting them when he saw movies and played games that had military guns and suits, so he ended up wanting to collect that stuff, now the nightmare of collecting old asbestos filled gas masks in the walls in his room. I could also tell my the old musky smell that he put them in his room and he mostly spends time in there any ways so he's been exposed to that stuff for about a week. I walked in there and quickly walked not wanting to inhale that stuff. (hes only 14 years old so he probably has a couple of years left to live before he gets cancer probably).",04Mar2017,1
