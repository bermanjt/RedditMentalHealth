3,It seems whenever I'm home I'm very quick to snap at someone and just a angry shitty attitude. I just got back from college today and I already in that mood. Even now when I type this I feel like I'm gettin hot or heated up. Any ideas why this can be?,09May2017,2

7,"Alright, I’ll try to keep this understandable. Right now, it’s just a jumbled swarm of thoughts in my head and it is starting to get to me, hopefully typing it out will give me some perspective.

I’m 19 and I just finished my first year of university. I am quite the introvert and have trouble introducing myself to new people. Luckily for me, my best friend from high school went to the same school and was in the same program as me. I ended up meeting a few people this year, but no one that I have kept in contact with or hung out with. I guess you could say they were all “Facebook” friends. So the only person I really conversed with was my buddy, which was great, I had an awesome school year because of it. I had never been in a position before, where I could openly talk to someone about anything, whenever I wanted to (we were roommates).

Now, we were both in a program that is divided into two specializations, studies and production. We were both enrolled in studies with the hopes of transferring over to production next year. I don’t want to be overly specific because I introduced him to Reddit and it would be a little awkward if he recognized who I am based off of this post. Anyways, we both applied and I just got a rejection email today. It really bummed me out, but I had plans to stick it out in my current program again because I come out with the same degree as if I were in production.

He told me that he also got a rejection email today. He had plans to stay back as well, but he applied to another school just for the heck of it. He went for an interview at this other school and it turns out that he liked it. He was offered admission and he said he’d take it if he didn’t get in at our current school. I don’t blame him, in fact I’m happy for him. So I am 99% sure that I am going to be alone next year, since I doubt he is going to change his mind.

We were both in an apartment and I had to renew the lease for next year already. I haven’t paid for anything yet though. Only my name is on the lease. I don’t know what I want to do next year, but I have a few options:

- Go back to school alone, try and find a roommate, try and meet some people (remember that I don’t “know” anyone). In a program that I don’t really want to be in.

- Go back to school and take a ton of electives and reapply in different places the following year.

- Stay home and work for a year.

I’ll be honest and say that I am not a huge fan of any of these options. The elective one sounds best, but finding a decent roommate will be hard and meeting people will be harder. It’s going to be tough and I don’t really know what I should do, it has all been really weighing me down since I saw the email today. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

8,"Hi there. So I'm not sure where else to post but I REALLY need to clean my ENTIRE house. I just finished college and it's been getting very dirty the last few weeks as I was cramming to wrap up my school work. Any and all tips and advice or resources appreciated!

I struggle a lot with motivation and am essentially just so overwhelmed with this project that I don't know where to start. I live in a 2 bedroom upper flat (with a roommate who keeps to herself - part of why I want to clean up everything to be respectful). The main rooms are the kitchen, my room, the bathroom, and the living room. EVERYTHING needs to be done - dishes, laundry, vacuuming, cat litter boxes, even down to cleaning the refrigerator. 

Any clean-freaks out there have tips for me to start this project? I have the whole day off tomorrow and am hoping to get as much done as possible. I just don't know where to start!",09May2017,1
9,"My fiance owns the house we live in with her ex partner, we are trying to get the mortgage so its in my name aswell as hers and paying her ex out. There has been a problem with getting it sorted and she started saying about throwing in the towel. I have been saving money each month and after 3 years the money will mature and we can both have a nice little payout, and if it wasnt for her i couldnt have done it. Am i wrong for telling her that if the mortgage still belongs to her and her ex partner that i wont put any of my share of the money into getting a new kitchen or doing up the house as it isnt mine?

I was given an ultimatum saying i either put money into the house because i live here or i leave. I should pay bills and things because i live here but as its not my house to be putting money into i dont feel i should. 

Am i wrong for this?",09May2017,2
11,"I am posting this on behalf of a good friend of mine. 

She is living in VA to help take care of her ailing Grandmother who suffers from dementia as well as other health issues. My friend has diabetes herself. She was originally asked to move in to help care for her Grandmother and was promised to be compensated for her time. That never happened.

Then her uncle moved in to ""take care of his mother"" (my friend's grandmother) and removed my friend from the bank account and took over as his mother's power of attorney. 

This man is a severe alcoholic and a drug addict who, as of today, was took into a mental health facility for observation for a few days. He drinks at least 24 cans of beer a day, does nothing to help his mother in the process...he doesn't even provide food or laundry soap. Instead, he spends all of his mother's money on gambling, beer and a new Porsche. 

Meanwhile, my friend (who can not get a job as she has to care for her Gran and is on a very limited public aid food card) now has no way to help her Gran as she has no access to the bank account. 

She is also fearful for her safety and her life when her uncle comes back home. She has no family support and I live in IL and can not, sadly, help her out. 

What is a next step she can take in order to get help? At least regain control of her gran's account so she can feed her. 

Please, any advice would be helpful. Thank you.",09May2017,2

16,"I had a job and a house. No friends, no girlfriend/wife. I was 36. I have extreme social anxiety, I may tell you why later but now it's about the topic.

I lost my job. I couldn't pay my house without a job but at the same time my parents (at the time both 65) were looking for a place to live so I let them live in my house and they paid it until I could get a job.

It's been 2 years and I've gotten no job. During those 2 years, my mother, who is an easily offended Catholic fanatic has started multiple yelling tantrums. This is normal for her, she has been doing it since I was a kid and hasn't stopped and will not stop. According to my dad, she hasn't been the same since she lost her first son who died a day after being born. I think it has made her crazy, even though the crazy runs in her family (myself included).

This time, two or three days ago (I can't tell because I've slept on sleeping pills and benadryl and haven't kept the time) I woke up early to her screaming at my older brother (on the phone) who actually has a job and a wife (My mom hates her for many reasons). This is no normal screaming, this is crazy-ass hate-filled screeching from hell. My dad tried to calm her down but then she got just as mad at him. (She also got into a fight with her sister, because when my mom gets angry, she has to get angry with everybody)

I stayed quiet and didn't get into it because I knew nothing good could have come of it. The day passed and the next day my mom decided to again call my brother and start screaming at him. So after that screaming match I lost it (I inherited it from her) and also started screaming and I broke one of her Virgin Mary statues and cursed and I don't remember well. I also got into my car and went to my brother's house, not knowing what I was going to do there.

I got there and I said something about losing the only family I have thanks to him (my mom and dad are old and have high blood pressure) and started crying like a bitch and could barely breathe like the piece of shit that I am. My brother tried to calm me but once I calmed down, I just left.

Just before I went to my brother's house, I sent him a message on Facebook about how he's an asshole and how his wife is a fat slut that was responsible for her previous husband's suicide and a bunch of other things that now guarantee I will never be in good terms with any of them. By the way, his wife read them somehow. I haven't used facebook in years so I don't know if the message was public or if my brother showed it to her.

So I get home and decide to just sleep it off, so I take 2mg of Clonazepam (legally obtained from my psychiatrist) and took two little cups of benadryl so I could just fall asleep and not do anything stupid anymore.

But while I was sleeping I hear my mom cursing and screaming in her usual banshee way and I get up and confront her. (note: My dad wasn't there and she wasn't talking on the phone. She was literally screaming at nothing).  I don't know exactly what happened but I got so mad that I just started wailing on her and also took another of her statues and bashed it against my own head (but nothing happened I think) then I got into my car and I don't remember much except a security guard told me that I had to turn off my lights (I was sleeping in the car). I don't really remember what happened because I was sleepy but eventually I got home and slept until now.

I slept good, it was all a bad dream until I woke up and realized it really happened.

By the way, this is the second time I hit my mom, so sleepiness is no excuse. The other time I think I didn't hit her too hard but it was bad. Even after that I was still her favorite son for some reason. Maybe it's because I pretend to be religious just to make her ""happy"". I go to church with her and sometimes pray with her but I don't really believe in any of it and just do it because I can see how she's saddened that my other two brothers are not religious people. I won't keep up the act anymore because obviously it doesn't make her any happy. This is why I broke her Virgin statue. She likes dissing people who don't believe and she's a super Catholic but she still loves getting into crazy-screaming arguments (these are not normal arguments, I'm talking about red-faced screeching vitrol and hate and not stopping or reconciling in weeks if not months.. she did that to me when I was a kid. I would misbehave and she would scream and hit me and when I cried she told me to stop making a scene because she ""wasn't hitting me hard enough"" which might have been true, but I (we, because she did it to all of us) was crying less at the ""pain"" and more at the hate that came out of what was normally a loving mother.

I have extreme social anxiety. I don't talk to people because I am afraid of offending them or because I think I'm a piece of shit and they will (and have) reject me. I blame my upbringing for it. My mother also gets extremely easily offended over everything. She wants to live in a world of pure Catholic cleanliness. Luckily my social anxiety keeps me from having a wife and family so I won't be beating them anytime soon. Maybe I deserve it.

TLDR: I'm a worthless piece of shit  I just beat up my elderly mother.

20,"Hi parents. Im having issues with my parents and it eventually has led to where some of my friends and I have grown apart because I can't do anything. I'm nearly 16. I get very good grades in school. I do community service. I do sports. I stay out of trouble for the most part. My parents, to begin with, don't let me go places like friends houses that they don't know, and then if they do they make a huge deal about it and call and text and make it an ordeal. They demand to know my location at all times and have a tracker on my phone. I can't just go with the flow i have to approve every move i make. I don't have an issue with them knowing where I am, but i can't go anywhere without them getting angry because they didn't approve. I am nearly 16 I think i can be trusted to go out without being monitored. I passed my road test with a 93. The test giver called me a very good driver. I am not allowed to drive with anyone in the car and they have to know exactly where I am all the time, I can't drive around like everyone else my age. There is no flexibility, I cant go out often because they have to have an exact plan. I don't know what to do I need some freedom. I can't have my phone in my room when i go to bed, they constantly check my snapchat and instagram, tell me my grades are bad, which they arent, and all around hover over me and don't give me trust? freedom? I don't know what the word is and I dont know if this explains it well but it is ridiculous for my age. I feel like I am being treated like a twelve year old.

21,"Hey all, so my brother has a learning disability, is 22 going on 23, and wants to get a job. Although, understandably, he is having some difficulty. A little bit about his disability: Technically its a combo of being on the (very low end of) the spectrum with permanent brain damage from a series of seizures when he was younger, but basically he just has trouble picking up concepts and he can't do simple math (so anything to do with money is out of the question) but otherwise he's pretty intelligent. Once he gets the hang of something or learns something really well he usually becomes very good or very well versed in a subject, by it takes him a long time and very close instruction and constant reminders. He cannot drive or operate heavy machinery, and he's very socially inept. He had a near death experience about 5 years ago and has become a socially awkward shut in ever since. 

Are there agencies for this kind of thing? Or companies that are known for working with people with disabilities? What kind of work could he do that doesn't require operating machinery, talking to people or cash handling? And how would he get through an interview? Are employers more lenient when somebody states on an application that they have a learning disability? The only thing I can think of is cleaning or stocking, which he does have experience in though his high schools Work-Ability program, by even that may be a little complicated or overwhelming for him if his superiors will expect the same from  him as any other employee. 

Anybody with any experience in this area are more than welcome to PM me. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

24,"Hi reddit, I'm not really sure what to do but hopefully I can get some kind of help here, hopefully this isn't long so please bare with me.

I just turned 23 this past month and I graduated with my degree in Economics a year ago

I had a temp job for about half a year, helping out in the purchasing department of a company while they were searching for someone who had at least a decade of experience. They found someone so I was released from my temp contract but I was able to quickly find another job, problem was it paid much less and it was a 2 hour drive. I ended up quitting after only a few weeks due to the hiring manager completely lying to me about what I would be doing, I was supposed to be doing something similar to my other job but instead they had me working on an assembly line. Their reasoning was that after they hired me they realized they didn't need me in the purchasing department but rather than tell me they just stuck me on an assembly line and pretty much refused to give any real explanation until I quit. This was 3 months ago.

I have been searching for another job and living with my parents. Problem is every day I have to deal with them constantly asking me about what it is that I want to even do with my life, not a job, but a career. Every day they say to me ""it's been **a whole year** since you've graduated and you're not one step closer"" or ""time is going and you aren't even doing anything towards your career when are you going to get your masters?"" 

Every time I tell them that I'm just trying to focus on getting a job right now and that I don't know what I want to do for a career they get furious. They keep comparing me to the 4 people they know who are my age who have already done their masters but the thing is all 4 of them knew what they wanted to do and represent a very small minority of people we know who are my age and know what they want to do with their career so I think it's very unfair that they keep comparing me to them.

Everything that I've thought about in terms of what I might want to do with a career they shoot down immediately and almost berate me for even thinking about going down that path. To them any job that doesn't have a path to making at least $70,000 a year isn't worthy.

Every time I tell them that I'm trying to figure out what it is that I want to do they get angry and start yelling about ""what tangible thing have you done to get closer to choosing a career."" They keep acting as if choosing a career is like taking a class with homework and once you're done the homework you know what you want to do. 

I'm going to a therapist and a career counselor about this, but it's like it doesn't matter to them.

So every day I get to hear ""it's been **a whole year** since you've graduated and you're not one step closer to a career"" (emphasis on the whole year)

Every day they tell me ""time is going.""

It's driving me absolutely insane, every single day, multiple times a day without fail they tell me this like I don't already fucking know. And the few times when I tell them that I know and that I'm trying my best and that they don't have to tell me this every single day they say that they have to ""walk on eggshells around me"" which I think is completely unfair. They'll bring up that I'm the one living with them but I know that, it's not like I haven't given them money, I appreciate that I can live here but still.

I'm trying and they just don't get it and it's driving me insane that they can't understand that.

I did economics because *they* told me that they'd only pay for school if I did Econ, Engineering, Physics, or accounting. I'm having trouble choosing a career because I did the degree that they wanted me to do and now I'm trying to make the best of it, I never wanted to sit at a desk in front of Microsoft Excel all day.

How do I make them understand? I don't know what to do. What should I do?

I feel like taking the money I have left, getting in my car and driving until I'm far enough away. I can't take this anymore.",09May2017,1
26,"So basically im a 16 year old Male living in the eastern states of australia.

I have the most amazing mum anyone could ask for, she listens to me, we can have great conversations about literally anything and me and her generally get a long well.

My father on the other hand, tends to shut me down when I try and have a civilised conversation with him. He is always right and I am always wrong. He is constantly threatening to ""F**king kill me"" whenever he even thinks im considering disobeying him. He hates how me and my mother have this close relationship and is currently trying to shut it down by telling me that I'm not to speak to her without him being there? He has put his hands on me (recently actually) by grabbing me round the throat and throwing me to the floor because i said to my older brother i hated him and wanted nothing to do with him anymore at all (Theres a backstory to this but he's pretty much a copy paste of my dad)

I'll admit i'm extremely far from the perfect child, I have been in trouble with the law before, I have had issues with my older brother and been in trouble with the school, But this issue has been going on literally since I can remember. I've tried telling him i respect everything he does as a father but i really ""hate"" him as a person. This lead to him losing his sh*t and me getting punished again and him telling me he hates me.

So am I a massive pussy? Or is my dad ""abusive"" (not sure if thats the correct word)
If you need more information/have any questions please feel free to ask, I'm an open book!

30,"I'm going to make this as least sob-story as possible, sorry in advance.

At the moment, I'm a senior in high school about to graduate. I talk with 2 or 3 people at school, but that's about it; I don't really socialize outside of that. I couldn't tell you if I wished I socialized more, but what I can tell you is that after school I find myself extremely bored and bit useless while browsing the internet. On occasion, I will find the motivation to polish up my web development skills, a field that I have a real passion for. Unfortunately, I go a private high school, and my options for friends has always been quite limited. Not that I'd want to bother making friends now when high school is about to end, so I'm not really sure where this leads me. Let me tell you why I don't have any ""real"" friends: I don't make an effort to socialize, even though I want to; at every waking moment, I realize my own social anxiety, and I let that get in the way of me confronting other people; I've went to private schools my whole life, and before high school I've been inadvertently taught by bullies that if I don't shut up, they're going to make sure I shut up. From the bullying all those years, I've been hardwired to keep my mouth shut unless I have something really good to say, otherwise I sound like an idiot and I deserve to be made fun of. I tell myself every day that this isn't true, but I don't really make the connection. Needless to say, my social anxiety is getting in the way of me having a genuine relationship with my own family, and just other people in general. I wouldn't necessarily call myself depressed (maybe because I'm just afraid of the word); I like to smile and laugh. Speaking of which, something my anxiety gets in the way of every day...I might find myself in a public situation where I really want to smile or laugh, but I try to hide it. Not sure why, it's just what I tell myself is the safest social route to not being bashed at. Let me fume out my deepest insecurities: the fact that I have no friends, I can't hold a conversation for my life (but I can sure start one!), I'm essentially a hermit outside of school, my heart gets pumping and my hands shake when I have to say something in class (public speaking in general, but 1-on-1 no problemo), I can't remember the last time I've talked with a girl by myself (surprise, I'm a guy), and I'm insecure with my relatively skinny body (not extreme). As for physical appearances, I've went to the gym a few times, but every time I think about going again I say I'll make a fool of myself, and I should just go earlier so there are less people at the gym to witness my tomfoolery. Something in mind tells me that just seems wrong...I shouldn't care about that (I also realize that yes, people at the gym do not care anyways). Yet here I am, posting away on reddit.

So, what's the big deal? I'm very optimistic about making real friends in college, the problem is that well...optimism only goes so far. What are some genuine, long-term steps I can take to overcome my anxiety?",09May2017,2
32,"This is my first post on Reddit so sorry for any format issues etc.

So I've been playing football since I was eight, and I've really enjoyed it. However these past two seasons I've just really gotten bored of it, practices and even games just feel unrewarding and like work (I'm a sophomore in high school btw) even though I'm starting on varsity. I understand that football requires hard work and you're gonna have to do things you hate, however I just don't find joy of it in any aspect anymore. I'd much rather chase a life of weightlifting and studying physical therapy, because that is what I love doing. I was planning on joining a branch of the military to help pay for college. Now I can't just up and quit because  like I said before I am starting on the d line and my coach basically has really high hopes for me, despite having a mediocre season at best this year. So what I've been thinking of is to fake a concussion during spring practice, because it would've been my 5th in 2 years and I think that would be a reasonable excuse for quitting. However, I really don't want to end up regretting my decision and losing friends or letting down peers etc. So what do y'all think? Do you have any experience with my situation? If so please enlighten me on some options. Thanks in advance ",09May2017,1
34,"HI! This is my first post on Reddit. 
I need advice on what to do in my situation. Please help me. 

Let's call my friend Rachel. 
I have this friend, Rachel, who talks/acts without thinking much. 
She is not stupid in a book-ish way, but stupid in life-wise.  
She is kind of person who is selfish unintentionally. 
She is a really good person. I know that. 
I know that because she is...too innocent (or stupid) to use anyone for her benefit. She just doesn't know what can tick people off or things she says is really offensive or stupid or just plain rude. 

We became friends because her ex-room mate was taking advantage of her. I am a really nosy person and if I see something unjust, I have to take some sort of actions. So my other friend and I helped Rachel get back at her roommate and saved her from taking advantage anymore. 

I have known her for 4-5 years now. We share many mutual friends. She is friends with my best friends as well. But recently, she is behaving in a way that ticks me off a lot. 
It is not like ""oh I don't like the way she acts or dresses"". 
She doesn't value friends preciously. 

Here are some of the things that really ticked me off. 

1) She needed a place to crash near her interview place. She asked one of our friends (who lives with her parents) to stay at her place. My friend said yes, but she has to go to a church meeting and it ends at 9 pm. Rachel arrived around at 7 pm and said she arrived early and wanted to sleep right away. I told her that I can meet her at the nearby Starbucks until my friend come back from her church meeting, but Rachel insisted that she would rather go to the house where my friend's parents were home (Rachel never met her parents). Eventually, my friend had to cancel her church meeting and went home to be with Rachel. 

2) Rachel asked me if she could stay at my house the day after her interview (so after the day she insisted on sleeping early at my other friend's house). She said she feels bad staying at our other friend's house for more than a day. I said I can't because I had this camping trip. Then Rachel invited herself to my friend's house one more night without asking my friend for another night of stay.  This other friend of us called me and asked me why Rachel wasn't staying with me. I told her I never said she can stay with me. Rachel just told my other friend that I already allowed her to sleep at my place without asking me and when I said no, she just invited herself over for one more night. 

3) She got the job near our friend's house. She was now 600 miles away from her family. She has a small sedan and I have a SUV. I offered her to help her pick up her bed at IKEA with my car. She said she also need a help to put together the bed. I said I would be more than glad to help her. 
But the day she picked wasn't good for me. So I told her MANY times that I have an important meeting in the afternoon that I must be back to my office by 1:30 pm. Ikea opened at 10 am and it was 1 hour away from my office. It was only 25 minutes from her house, so I told her to meet up at 10 am sharp at IKEA and pick up her bed. I was at Ikea at 10 am. She texted me at 10:03 am saying she just left her house. I waited for her 30 minutes. I also told her that she should have picked out the bed already. But she didn't. We walked around IKEA to pick the bed, get the bed, and pay the bed, and load it up. We drove to her house. I was busy unloading the bed but she went inside the house to let out the dogs first. I still had a bit of time left, so I helped her put togethering the bed frame. But she kept saying, ""I don't know this is right."" I told her she should do it and I have to go, but she said: ""but I am not good at this!"" 
So I stayed and finished the frame and drove back to my office in hurry. I was late to the meeting, but I thought it was my fault. 

4) She went to her home and her plane was coming back on Sunday. We all decided to go to church together because her plane was landing at 9 am. Then two days before her arrival, she texts to all of her friends saying that she accidentally booked her return flight to the airport 1 hour away from all of us. She asked to us to pick her up. We said we can't but we offered her to take uber. Then she said ""but it is too expensive!"" so we found a metro schedule for her to work and one of our friends to pick her up at the metro station 30 minutes away from the church, so we can pick her up on our way to the church. She said thanks, then she decided to just switch the flight plane ticket to the arrive at the airport close to her house later. She just threw away all the planning and search for her we did out of the window. If she had money and plane to change, why didn't she do that first?!

5) She calls my other friends fat and ugly (honestly, this friend is chubby and...cute looking. I wouldn't call her pretty either.) and makes fun of it behind her back. (but this ugly friend and Rachel are good friends as well.)

6) Once she said I am not pretty in her opinion to me directly. . I accepted the fact and I thanked her for the honesty. But whenever she sees me, she is like ""Oh, your eyeliner is smudged. You need to change the makeup."" or ""You look so much better now! You look pretty now!"" after I got makeup at Sephora. 

7) When one of our friends worked out and went through a horrible diet plan to be on the Muscle Mania competition, we all said we will be there to support her. A week from the competition, we all found out that the admission fee was more expensive than we thought (I mean, it was $35 for pre-judging, $45 for dinner show. $65 for the whole thing. It wasn't that expensive). Some friends said they can't go because of money, but then Rachel said, ""I would rather go to UMF concert with that money!"" (we kindly remind her that UMF concert is way more expensive than that). She didn't come. 

8) I was at the competition, posting pictures and sending it to my friends who couldn't come. Rachel was responding to the pictures and supporting my friends via SNS. Then she texted me and complained about how she just spent $700 on her tires. I told her why it is so expensive, then she said she decided to get good tires, and went on complain about it. She knew that I was the designated photographer of that competition for my friend, yet she continued to bother me for various stuff. 

9) During lunch, she texts me again and asked me to send her the address of the competition place. I sent her that. She texted back, ""Oh it takes 1 hour (38 miles). too far!"" and didn't come. She just totally forgot I drove 1 hour to IKEA for her bed and drove her to her house and all that. 

10) We have this friend coming from California and staying in the city for only a day before she goes to her brother's graduation. I told her that I have work that day (Friday) but I will join late. She asked me to get out of the work early so we can all go meet this friend together. 



I am so sorry it is long. 
I want to head on tell Rachel that is is a shitty person for all this thing. But I need to know that if she is really a shitty person or not.
So far, I have shared this story with my other friends (not mutual friend with Rachel)  and I have this two advice from my friends

1) Accept the fact Rachel is this kind of person and just shut up about it and pretend to be good friends with her because telling her would end the relationship or split the group.

2) Tell her the truth and how all those makes me feel uneasy and makes me doesn't want to be her friend. If Rachel is meant to be my friend, she would accept it and understand it. If she doesn't, then leave her. 

I do not want to spli the group. But I can't tolerate Rachel's action. Then again, she is not a bad person, but so...selfish and stupid and..ugh.

It feels like telling a stupid sweet puppy that she is a bad puppy although she thinks she is doing NOTHING wrong. 

AM I over reacting? What do you think?

Thank you

38,"This is the most complicated moment of my life. I don't know who to turn to next, so I'm turning to Reddit.

I'm a high school freshman who can't decide where I should go in life.


Context:
I am probably the most disabled person on Reddit, at least mentally. I have mid-range hearing loss, and I wasn't diagnosed and fitted with hearing aids until this January.
To boot, I also have epilepsy. I used to have absence seizures, but they went away when I was 9 due to lots of medication. I never had a single seizure for over 5 years until I had a grand mal seizure during one of my finals. My seizures developed into frequent grand mals, and I'm taking heavy drugs right now.

Because of my ""disabilities,"" my grades dropped.

Right now, I'm almost an all F student and I would have to repeat.

The funny thing is, if I wanted, I could have skipped two grade levels.
I'm also classified as ""gifted.""

I took the SAT and got a score of 1120. Keep in mind I'm a high school freshman.

According to my school, I can skip right onto the 10th grade. I won't have to repeat, but I got another problem; my GPA screws me over hard.


My seizures and hearing loss was screwing over my grades, not my lack of knowledge, and I will greatly suffer for it. I've proven that I'm smart enough to skip grades, but I'm still doomed.

While the neighbor opened the front door, a dog (adult rottweiler) ran out to my wife and immediately bit my son on the foot. The neighbor called the dogs name to come back and immediately after biting my son, the dog ran back into the house. My wife said she heard our son scream in a way she had never heard before and he cried for a few minutes. Luckily he was wearing socks so it provided some protection, no skin or long term bruising. I'd like to note that the neighbor didn't apologize, she just went in without acknowledging the incident.

MY wife notified me of what happened at work and now that I'm home, I plan to speak with the neighbors tomorrow as my wife does not speak English that well. Should I report this to animal control? How should I approach my neighbors? I have only said hi once or twice since they moved in this year.

43,"Hi reddit.

My husband and I are so torn. We currently live in Denver, Colorado and are considering moving back to our hometown in Arizona.

My husband's company isn't looking so hot. He predicts the company only has about a year left until things will be dried up. He's currently looking for new opportunities in Arizona and Colorado, but we cannot definitely decide where we'd like to live.

We both grew up in Arizona and moved to Denver when he was offered his current job. We've loved it so much; the seasons, the weather, the snow, all of it! Although, we find ourselves really missing our family and friends, especially around holidays. We are trying to start a family and would like our children to know their cousins.

We're afraid we'll move back and realize why we left. It's miserably hot in the summer, there isn't snow (close, anyway), and there's scorpions. We might finally get that baby we want and be really happy we're around family. It's just. so. dang. hard.

Another thing is we'd be able to sell our house for $125k more than what we purchased it for, and move back into our rental house in Arizona. The current lease is up in a few months. 

We're looking for any advice from someone who's been in our similar situation. What did you end up doing? What would you choose in our shoes? Did you have any regrets or things you'd do differently?",09May2017,2

That's not true. Just to get you up to speed: there's this girl (F16) that's been picking on me for quite a bit. Recently she got one of her friends to ""date"" me. What she and the other girl (F16) were trying to do was to try and get me in trouble again (She got me in trouble last year and it did not go too well.) The girl that was ""dating"" me was trying to get me to beat the crap out of the bully (Keep in mind, she still is a girl.) I have MAJOR evidence that shows the bully was working together with my now ""ex"" to try and get me in trouble. Now my friend thinks that I'll blame anything on that bully. He thinks I'm over dramatic and will ""blame"" her on everything. I still got the emails that she sent me. I archived them for safe keeping (As evidence). How can I get my friend to believe me and that I don't always blame it on the bully?

TLDR; My friend thinks that I blame everything on a girl that happens to do messed up shit and picks on me. Ever since I had an incident with her, he thinks that. I have evidence that clearly shows that she was behind that. How can I get my friend to believe me and that I don't always blame it on the bully?

62,"17 y/o. I've had a crush on my teacher for almost the entire year. In the beginning and middle of the year I thought she was attractive but I didn't think much of it. Probably because I was engulfed in schoolwork and too busy. But now it's the end of the year, and I have less and less school stuff to worry about. However, that gave me time to have wandering eyes. And now I have a pretty huge crush on my teacher.

I never acted on it or told anyone though, because 1) I'm extremely shy and I'm not open about my romance life to anyone and 2) I know a teacher-student relationship is highly inappropriate and illegal. But it's still on my mind and that's what kills me. This is slowly destroying me from the inside out and I don't know what to do. For now I'm just waiting until the year is over so hopefully summer will help me get my mind off her, but I still feel trapped now. Plus, I'm going through a minor unrelated depressive episode right now, and it'd be nice to get something off my chest and make my burdens lighter.

Any advice on what I can try to do? I don't want to talk about this with anyone because it's just a crush and it'll go away anyway like my other crushes did. But is there anything I can do to develop more self-control? Thanks.

69,"I understand I could have it much, much worse. But my father no longer feels like a father. He used to be a hard worker, caring man who did everything he could for his family, and he was so nice to everyone. 

Since then, he retired about 5/6 years ago. He had back surgery, which likely was his reason for no longer working (he was only 50/51). He then began to spend more time with us. 

A few years later, his mother dies. After that, it seems that his already-existant prescription medication problem got worse. He dozed off at a family reunion, requiring me and my mother to drag him to our car. I (his son, around 14–15 now) began to argue and fight with him. I remember a few days before Christmas, it got so bad that I cursed at him and even hit him. (I later apologized to him, as I knew I was wrong.)

We argued a lot. He began to be distanced away by our family, who also did not like what was happening with him. This had no positive effect on him, and simply just made him worse. 

Nowadays, I'm 17. I still argue with him. As a matter of fact, it's gotten worse. Why? He's got a new doctor (a psychiatrist) who prescribes him very strong medicine, inesuch as Xanax and multiple others. The doctor, according to my father, is trying to see what medications will work, so my dad must visit him every month. He's been going for 4 months. 

So far, it has been nothing but hell. Each week, I am uncertain about what will happen. He seems to always be in some sort of druggy state, just slurring senseless stuff. His temper is through the roof, and he is insanely touchy about anyone confronting him about his medicine. 

He has also become very, very addicted to publishers clearing house. He spends days and nights on his computer, always saying that he thinks he's won something, and that he thinks they're coming to deliver his prize. He is INSANELY hooked on it. Not only that, but he also clicks on whatever ads and pop ups come, thinking they're also legit. I know by now he must have given out some sort of financial info. It kills me to see him do this. Any time I try to ask him to stop, he gets very angry at me and tells me to stop being an asshole because it's his house. He uses everything he can against me and my mom in arguments, and even claims to be a strong Christian man even though he uses the Bible against me in his arguments. He criticizes me for going to church every week yet still persisting to defy his authority. He is such a hypocrite! As a matter of fact, some of our arguments have gotten so bad that i have contemplated suicide. (I would NEVER do so, but in the moment he just tries to make me feel as terrible as can be.) despite this, he continues his behavior and calls it my own fault. He is tearing our bond apart. I feel myself losing respect for him so much in recent months. I don't know what to do. He just makes me feel worthless, embarrassed (in public). He constantly uses the fact that he buys me nice things as an excuse to act however he wants to me and my mother. But druggy and publishers clearing house-obsessed behavior is not the way. I feel he is at his lowest I have ever seen him. He is not willing to accept that it is him who has a problem. Badly.

I had an awful experience to say the least, almost daily bullying &amp; harassment from multiple members of staff, witnessed by other coworkers. My boss offered 0 support &amp; made a point of using me as an example in a bad light &amp; offering other coworkers praise &amp; rewards. He was also the MD and did much of the bullying &amp; made racial slurs himself. 

I was laid off after 9 months on pretty shady circumstances but I was happy to leave as the harassment &amp; bullying were only getting worse. 

My coworkers who saw it were too scared to back me up when I said I was going to take the issue to him, as they feared for their jobs. 

Tonight, after 4-5 months of no contact from anyone at the company my former boss rang me up at 7pm. 

He said he was calling about the 1 star google review I had left the company a week ago. I can saw for sure that I did no such thing a week ago. I did click on the link to verify the business address for my CV but nothing else. 

I can't say for sure I didn't leave the 1 star review when I was laid off (it was a massive shock to me &amp; again, was handled poorly &amp; I was pissed). I didn't write anything though. 

For whatever reason Google is showing this 1 star review as though it was left last week. It also shows another 1 star review by some he claims ""has never worked with or attended training with the company"" and that he is ""working to get it removed"". 

From his very accusing tone it sounded to me &amp; my partner (call was on speaker phone) that he thought I had posted both trying to hurt the business. 

The call went on for 8 minutes, him asking me to give them 5 stars, telling me someone had hacked my account, etc. I said I would contact google to see if I could get it removed (I won't) but that I wasn't going to edit it in any way. 

This happened about 30 min ago &amp; I'm still shaking I'm so mad and upset. I thought I was free of his bullying and now I'm back to feeling like I've just left another meeting with him belittling me.

I'm 18 and have been dealing with verbal and psychological abuse from my mom for the past decade. Recently she has been upset that I went to prom with my ex girlfriend (I'm a girl), who she doesn't like. We're still good friends and had a great time, but she was so upset that she threatened to kick me out. After she realized that I would actually leave the house if she decided to force me out of my house for that, she backtracked and told me I can stay. I pay for 90% of my expenses, work almost full time, just got accepted into my dream school, and have a 3.9 gpa. So, it's not like I'm a bad kid- she literally just didn't like my prom date. Tonight she found out that I participated in senior walk at prom (this weird thing where the seniors walk with escorts, their names are announced, all that jazz). I told her that I wasn't going to do senior walk so that she wouldn't have to come and make a big deal out of me being escorted by someone she hates. Tonight I decided to let her know what actually happened, and she got extremely upset. Basically told me she didn't want to see me graduate, threw my phone at the wall, yelled, screamed, the works. I decided to tell her that I'd go to a friend's house for the night, and she proceeded to take my keys away (with the car that I pay the bills for). She then took all the things I had packed and locked them in her room. When I finally got her to open the door and begged just to get my phone charger, she literally scratched me as I tried to grab it out of my bag. Now I'm stuck with no transportation and have a full time job to get to, and this is my last week of school. I don't have brothers or sisters and my dad lives across the country. I'm scared and not really sure how to handle this situation. Also sorry for the long post!",09May2017,1

83,"Sometimes saying no can be very awkward and disturb bonds between friends.

I've been going out to eat lunch with a friend every week because he asked me to help him spend his meal plan money before it expires this summer. So why not... free food. However he started saying, I should start giving him money in cash, equal to whatever he's buying for me, so I'm basically giving him money and he'll pay for me using his meal plan. No more free food so I don't really want to go, I also don't want to start giving him cash for something he's inviting me to go to because then it feels like I'm paying him to take me to get food. 

Technically speaking, the money is still the same as if I bought the food myself. I get a $5 sandwich, I lose $5, only difference is he is pocketing my $5, which doesn't feel right. I liked the free food. I don't want to go and spend my money just to help him use up his meal plan. 

I've been making excuses but I can't keep doing it for the rest of the school year. I also don't want him to think I was freeloading off him, which I kind of was, but he did want the help and he did initially offer me free food.

87,"This may sound like an overreaction, but that's why I'm coming to reddit for advice. Today I was in my second-story bedroom, which overlooks my back deck, and had my window cracked. After dark, my mom came home to a dark house downstairs and upon her coming in and turning the kitchen light on, she and I both from our separate positions heard what sounded like someone fleeing out on my deck right outside my window. While we thought it could have been an animal, it sounded more like a person, especially given the fact that it decided to flee as soon as it saw my downstairs house lights turn on, as well as our patio table being out of place. We called police, who found nothing.

This caused me concern enough, but just now about 2 hours after the incident I had a strange man add me for the third time after deleting his Facebook and Instagram requests over the past month or so, which normally I would not think twice about, but given the timing I'm starting to panic. Upon looking at this person's profile he lives in the same general city as I do, he has no posts of his own but seems to add only women on both his Facebook and Instagram pages, and he also seems to have looked me up separately on Instagram after denying him on Facebook. We have no mutual friends. Can anyone give me advice as to how to treat either or both of these situations? I'm not saying they are connected, but given tonight's incident I'm obviously inclined to think so. And even if not connected, I'm scared and at loss of what to do, if there is anything to do. I'd also be interested in hearing if any of you have had similar situations and how you treated them because right now I just feel a little helpless.

102,"There is a police officer who lives on the same floor as me in my apartment building. The first time I met him was a couple of weeks ago when he knocked on my door with two fellow police officers accusing me of smoking weed. He threatened to evict me that night unless they were able to search my apartment (at 11pm). I was stressed so I let them and of course nothing was there (I don't smoke weed and no one else has been in this apartment).

&amp;nbsp;

Then a couple of nights after that I heard and noticed someone standing behind my door (late night). At first I assumed it was my neighbor directly in front of me, but I didn't hear his door. Then my leasing office called me and said they were issuing a 21/30 (21 days to remediate or 30 days to vacate). When I talked to the guy in the office they said the officer has been to my door multiple times and he smelt marijuana each time. I was confused so I asked why does he keep checking my apartment... I live next to the staircase and the elevator. They said there was nothing they could do.

At this point I feel like this officer is just harassing me and to be honest I never met this guy before the first incident. So I don't know how I could've wronged him.

Job layoff issues, Potential Money issues, Potential Parents Issues, Job Interviews issues, Potential new career?, Finding/Keeping Friends issues, Possibly getting new hobbies?, shyness/confidence issues, romance and priorities, etc.

I would like any input. Feel free to @ tag or PM me, please.

**Long version**

So I got laid off 3 weeks ago from this post ... so nothing too uncommon in the current NA economy. That said, it still sucks. I'm splitting a fairly pricey apartment with 2 others (who have jobs). I signed up for EDD so I could pay my share of the apartment while looking for a job while not losing too much of my savings saved up.

My last job and the one I want to pursue is Software Quality Assurance Tester/Engineer/Analyst (basically testing programs to make sure they work). I've had a bunch of interviews with other companies, even within a month or 2 before I got laid off. Sadly I haven't gotten anything yet. I feel confident when I go into them, I have 3 years of experience with testing and fairly knowledgable on stuff (but of course there's always stuff to learn). However, I've gotten rejected or no answer from any of them since then. I do the follow up thing too. I've gotten pretty far in multi stage intereviews interviews so I know I'm doing something right.. I just lose out last second. Sometimes I dont get past the phone interview or the first in person interview.

Id rather not use EDD to get government money to help pay off but Id rather support this apartment and the great people I'm living with. 

Even though I have a solid amount of savings, I'm REALLY scared of spending on anything outside very bare essentials of living. I even cut my hair really short just to save money on future haircuts when only a few months ago I wanted to try this new hairstyle that I came to like but I didn't think was worth to maintain to save money.

I'm trying to really hard to find jobs, I try to apply to at least 5-50 every day, depending on how busy I am cleaning or doing other chores (or getting distracted by anime or something). 

However, I'm also stressing if my parents find out. They'll go ballistic since they always hounded me to look for better jobs (I was getting underpaid) which I WAS but I wasn't getting any luck. They'll likely bug and potentially give me crap almost every day out of worry.

I'm not even sure if I should stick to Software QA since it's not as a ""sought after""/respected as a programmer or even a DBA as far as Computer Science majors go (this is what I majored in)

I tried to look on the bright side and maybe I could relax from my job while at home. However, if anything not having a job is making me more stressed since I dont have actual busy work besides applying for jobs and doing chores. I'm not as motivated to play games or watch anime (two of my usual favorite home hobbies) since I feel like I have to get a job ASAP and do what I can but at the same time I feel empty because I've been focused on this AND I'm not getting good results.

I also realized how crappy my social life actually is. I've graduated from my college: both Bachelors and Masters. While not on bad terms with any of them, I feel like I've lost contact with many of them just due to me being busy and just by not having common school events or clubs to keep us close and interacting often.

I've tried to get into contact with some of them through Facebook but conversations are pretty short or ignored.

So I've been trying to find ways to make new acquaintances/friends.. however it's kind of hard to find new friends of the general interests of stuff I like (anime.. especially dubbed anime, visual novels, Video Games.. usually Japanese RPGs or Nintendo or FGs). As far as FGs go there are places to play fighting games that are like 1.5 hours driving distance.. but I'm not always motivated by competition AND I dont want to pay the 10-15 dollars just to enter a venue I know I wont do well in (when I dont practice enough). While there are a couple places I'm acquianted with some people, I dont know if it's worth to pay 10-15 dollars just to play games with them for like 5-8 hours then MAYBE talk to them on twitter sometimes.

I've considered expanding my interests... I kinda like DnD I guess? But thats a big timesink. I dont want to do things like going to bars (speaking of which my romantic life has been non-existent for the 27 years I lived but I have more to worry about right now)

Online communities are basically what's even keeping me kinda social in a sense.. there's been some great people I've met in various places like reddit, discord, gamefaqs, etc.. However the fact that I'll never meet any of these people IRL is really saddening. When I have all this IRL stuff to worry about I feel less motivation to talk with these people in text or voice chat as often as I used to..

I had to leave a lot of the communities I  used to be in because while they were fun a lot of what I was doing felt more like a job... which is fine if I weren't stressing but I was stressing and I didnt want to think about it while worrying about this IRL stuff.

Doesn't help I have random insecurities about myself like being shy (but I feel like Ive slowly been getting better at this), not showing as much confidence when needed (a possibility in interviews? and just in general when deciding some things like this), or just being boring to be around (I always think about relating to lack of IRL friends).

So I'm willing to get any advice on what to do through this comment or PMs or whatever. Please!",09May2017,7

112,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can. I'm 25, I was raised by my grandparents as my single mom was just entering her 20's and wanted to go to college/spend time with her boyfriend (future husband), and my grams had always wanted a son, so she offered to take me.

My grandparents are both Romanian immigrants. My grandfather is very stern and distant from everyone so we never really had much of a relationship, just lived under the same roof. My grandmother is the one who raised me for the most part, and this post is about her. She is a very prideful woman, strong/stubborn in her beliefs and unwilling to admit to wrongdoings, and on top of that has a major anger problem. 

Our relationship was never really too much of an issue when i was young, aside from a lot of neglect. As I got older (12ish), and bullying started taking a toll on my grades, she started to view me as a disappointment, on top of this she did not like that I had gotten older and wasn't a cute toddler anymore, and the novelty of having a little boy wore off (family members tell me this is a big factor in her change towards me) and this is where I became a venting point for her. From then until I moved out in recent times, she would be absolutely brutal with me. Constantly tell me I was useless, tell me to give up when I would do productive things/tell me it's pointless and I'd fail (like when I was starting college), tell me I was a bad person, that friends and loved ones only pretended to like me, or would get angry at me for showing kindness to others, and that they were just using me, and much much more. 

As I got older I found out from my mom and aunt that she was the same way with them growing up, hence the reason they moved out after high school. However when i would bring up talking to her about it, they'd just laugh it off with a ""good luck, she'll never admit to it, let alone change"". 

I've only tried once in my adult life to bring it up (when she told be not to bother with college because I'd fail), and her best friend (who was there) jumped in to defend me. I brought up in a polite way how her constantly discouraging me and verbally beating me down for years made me feel, and that I wasn't looking for approval, just neutrality at best. With her best friend backing me, thinking this was a chance to get through to her and potentially heal our relationship a little, she just laughed in my face and berated me for being weak. 

Eventually I gave in and moved out, which allowed me to fix a lot of my emotional issues (had a hard time emoting towards people and came across as cold). Problem is, she's getting older and everybody basically tries to avoid her for the most part, and just tolerates her or walks on eggshells around her, because they all have pent up frustrations towards her/don't want her to snap (gramps included)(she has rage fits where she yells super saiyan style and breaks things). It's pretty much the same with me, there's a lot of resentment that would disappear if she could just talk to us about it, rather than each of us having to get therapy after moving out. 

Also good to note that I'm the most strong willed of her kids, and not really a pushover and would speak up the most when I felt she was going to far, my mom would often promise to back me up, but would always end up just throwing me under the bus instead. (Which made me resent her in my teens, but I kind of get it now). 

Also I feel I should specify that my mother and aunt didn't do things like that out of fear, but rather they looked at it as a pointless headache to stand up for themselves or me. My grandmother is also a very religious seventh day adventist who very much likes to brag to others about how kind and generous she is, and how she has never lied one time in her life  (she lies very often), and would brag to me constantly how I was very lucky she took me and would tell me she regrets it. 

One last thing, I  got a bit suicidal at 20 once when I was on anti depressants and told her I was having feelings of suicide, she told me life is a gift from god, and that if I wasn't appreciative of it then I should just go through with it and give the gift back. This was one of the few times my mom spoke up, but gave in half way through and just told me I was overreacting (about what she said ). It would always frustrate me that people in my family would relate to me and sympathize, but then treat me like I was soft for feeling hurt or depressed. 

Anyways, sorry for the ramble, just wanted some advice from some unbiased strangers who have some knowledge/experience in this area, also to get a lot of this off my chest, and maybe someone can help me understand why she is this way. 

Edit: When she would throw rage fits and I'd try to go to my room or find some privacy somewhere, she wouldn't allow it or would follow me to continue her fit. She also hates privacy of all kinds and would constantly go through my things, and would not allow any locks in the house, even on doors to all our rooms. She would even use the washroom with the door open and would get angry at me for keeping the door closed while in the bathroom or not letting her in while I was in there. (Still does it when I visit) Not sure if this indicates some sort of control problem on her part.

Edit 2: Adding more weird quirks of hers as I remember them. She is also like the complete opposite of a hoarder. Like she keeps a normal amount of things in her room, but would freak out at other people's if they were not basically empty except for furniture. She would constantly throw our my belongings (that I paid for), collectibles, gadgets and trinkets, sometimes shirts, even though my room was always clean and organized. I would even go as far as to keep the bottom drawer in my dresser full of all my belongings, since they wouldn't be visible and out in the open, but that never stopped her. To this day, I can't get myself neat nerdy things I like and put them on a shelf, because that weird paranoia still exists in my head.

tl;dr: grandmother is a dick to loved ones, not sure why or how/if it should ever be confronted.",09May2017,1
114,"I want your honest opinion on what you would do..not the most moral answer because obviously I already know that otherwise I wouldn't have posed the question like that.

For a year an a half I dated someone who I had a lot of difficulty with. At first I was head over heels in love with him and so was he with me. But he was extremely controlling and demanding. We got to a point where we basically couldn't reconcile and he left me for someone else. I was devastated even though we couldn't get along but I knew it had to happen and that one of us needed to make some sort of move. I moved on after 8 months..and in that time he became very wealthy as his career kicked off just before he split up with me. He dated a few people but all the while stook me out for dinner to amazing restaurants, called me and helped me with my personal issues and always told me that he loved me and that I was the one. Through the women he dated I noticed that he had learnt that I was in fact right due to universality of the opinions of the girls he had dated and since breaking up with the most recent girl (and the girl before aswell) has been desperate to be back with me. He has gone out his way to do a multitude of things for me such as giving me a $250 gift card because I left bleached towels on all of my black clothes, ruined them and was very upset one time. However, I'm worried if I rerun to this relationship he will go back to his previous behaviours including extreme rage that terrifies me. I do want the lifestyle-expensive restaurants, a bit of a whine and he'll buy me whatever I need at the moment. I'm not poor but I am studying and want to enjoy some sort of pleasure before I eventually have a career (i want to do medicine so it will be some 8-10 years from now I will be making a decent earnings and have disposable income for some things I really want such as plastic surgery to fix the disfigurement I suffered in a car accident as a child.  It's not as though I don't love him still but I always thought that he was not good for me because of his anger issues that terrify me particularly because I was physically abused and neglected as a child.

Anyway, on the flip side I recently met someone from reddit not with the intention of dating (but he has expressed that he really likes me but is cautious and doesn't want to get his hopes up mainly because I might not like him in the end-I've massively paraphrased). He in his early 30s but I was very shocked when I heard that because I seriously thought he was younger than me (maybe 20/21) btw my ex is 24 and looks 30. He is very extremely sincere and ""moral"" and kindhearted somewhat to my annoyance lol because he always goes for society might view the most moral answer. Eg doctors receiving freebies from drug companies might actually convince them to prescribe that medication (which I disagree with!)
I told him about my child abuse story for example and the whole way through he kept tearing up..I've never really had a response like that but I respond similarly..overly empathetically sometimes when people share their stories. 
We talk almost all the time but I don't want to disappoint him if I am going back to my ex..I would feel terribly guilty for leading him on. Besides I have already got feelings building for him...this is getting extremely long but hopefully you understand that he is a really nice guy, we get along and I'm attracted to him but he is very poor and probably always will be lol. 

Btw one more thing my ex is extrmelh socially intelligent and helps me solve a lot of issues that I otherwise wouldn't know how to solve. I always call him for advice when I need him to calm me down or help me solve an issue. I don't know if this guy would be able to understand or sympathise with my issues or offer me solutions since he acts according to a strict moral code (he's not religious).

121,"I applied to Brown University early action, I didn't expect for half a second I'd get in. 

Then I did. 

I was on top of the world. I couldn't believe I'd made it to my top choice college and my parents were so proud of me they were in tears. It was the single best day of my life to date. I had always dreamed of being in the Ivy League, and the open curriculum is perfect for my academic goals, I thrive in a self directed learning environment. Providence is exactly the kind of town I wanted to spend my college years in. I didn't think it could get better. 

But now I keep hearing about how Brown isn't ""really"" an Ivy, and the only ""real"" Ivy's are Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia, and that it isn't even in the top 15 schools in the US never mind the top 8. 

They're (by they I mean my friends, teachers, and extended family) saying there are non-Ivy schools that are far better than Brown (Duke, Pomona, Vassar, etc.) Even though when I was researching colleges those didn't seem to have the same tremendous upsides Brown did (like the open curriculum, top rated undergraduate education, and the option of cross registration at a top art school nearby.)

123,"13 weeks of university and I have attended more or less 8 out of 26 lectures/class. When I attend the lectures I find them absurdly easy and then I don't bother with them at all. It all comes down to me studying a couple of days before the exams.

I am sitting on average 8/10 with highs at 9-9.5 and lows at 6.5-7. I told myself that this semester I'd attend but i didn't managed to do that.

I find myself working on personal projects for hours on end without taking a break. I found myself working on a small project for 12 hours straight at a Starbucks.

I am not lazy. I have gotten 100/100 on all 10 of my projects this year and completed both of the final group projects alone. We had to do 1 of them in groups.

125,"I emigrated to Argentina on June last year. Basically I've been living in this Hostel where I also work at. Sounds cool, right? At least that's what I thought when I started.

I work as a receptionist, and also stay for free. My issue comes from the fact that they make me do a lot of administration things, which I didn't mind doing, but at some point I realized the management is just abusing my trust, taking advantage of the fact that I have nowhere else to go to squeeze me as much as they can. I'm basically another manager,, but just without the respect or position or payment or say.

To this I should add that me and my coworkers are all working under the table, we are never paid on time, and management just disappears whenever a problem arises, and then blaming us for not solving their problems.

I feel like I'm playing a stupid pity game. I've basically stopped enjoying anything I liked, because all I can think about is how much is detest living like this. All I do is wake up, endure shit, then go to bed. I don't know if I'm just getting depressed or something, but it's really getting to me.

131,"Hi /r/Advice,


A year ago I got out of a long-term relationship. I needed a place to stay so I moved in with my mother and teen brother. I've now lived with them for a year and I need to move out. I'm a 27 year old and I want my personal space and independence back. 


Extra info: the housing/rent market is terrible right now and there is no possible way I could rent an apartment alone. There just aren't any available and the only options are way too expensive for me and my office salary.


**I have two options right now:**


* **Option 1:** A friend (we've known each other for a year) is renting a decently sized apartment at the outskirts of the town I live in. The apartment has a bedroom that no-one is using and she thinks I should come rent with her. I would have a large bedroom to myself, a decent living room with my friend, and it would just be the two of us (and her cute dog). Our personalities match really well and we pretty much like the same things. She has a dog and he is adorable.


The downside is that it's farther away from work. I normally take 7 minutes to drive to work, but living with her it would take about 30 minutes (plus traffic on my way back home). I guess that's not the worst thing ever (I like listening to podcasts anyway), but it is pretty far away from everything (compared to what I'm used to). 


* **Option 2:** My boyfriend has a decently sized apartment that he will one day own, and two of his friends are renting with him. I get along well with his friends (a guy and a girl), the three of them are childhood friends and a some months ago the guy and girl started dating and are now a couple. Since there would be four of us the rent is *really* cheap. The location is also close to what I'm used to and it would take me about 7 minutes to drive to work.


The downside is that I feel like I would not have a space of my own. I would be living with my boyfriend in his(/our) bedroom and sharing a living room (and one bathroom) with him and the two others (the friends that are now a couple). 


I've always lived with parents or boyfriend and never on my own, and I feel like living on your own (or with a roommate) is maybe something you want to do when you're in your twenties. But I don't know, both options have their pros and cons, what do you guys think?


TL;DR: My own space and independence with a friend but will be far away from everything including work OR a very cheap rent and nice location but not really my own space.",09May2017,2
134,"Just like the title says. I had an old application on file with UPS for a package handler position when I got an email last week from their HR rep about an availability Monday through Friday from 5pm - 10pm. She walked me through the process, had me resubmit my application for the available spot, and even had me come in for an interview where I was told the position was basically mine.

Fast forward to yesterday. It had been about 5 days since I'd heard from HR, so I got in touch to follow up on my interview. She told me that several employees from the morning crew had decided to take the shift I was applying for and as such, the available position moved to 3:30am - 8:30am. 

I'm not really sure what to do. On one hand, it's been a while since I've had a stable job and I could really use the money. The work is simple and the hours are short...it's the kind of thing I've been looking for.  On the other hand, though, changing an available position in the middle of the hiring process seems a bit more than shady, especially considering they sought me out to apply for it in the first place. What's worse is knowing they weren't planning to contact me about the change and only offered the AM shift after I followed up with them about what we'd already discussed. Any advice would be greatly appreciated...I need to make a decision by the end of the day and I'm torn as to which decision would be better in the long run. Thanks in advance!",09May2017,1

She was awful to me in every way. She would make people think she was holding my hand in a friendly way and then crush it really hard when no one was looking. She stomped on my feet and kicked me. She made fun of me for stupid things and always found a way to put me down. She acted nice in front of my brother so he wouldn't believe me. Same with parents and teachers. She tried to get me in trouble with the teachers I liked. She gossiped about me. And so on.

Now my brother is having coffee with her for networking purposes - he's involved with a nonprofit and she and her family are BIG donors. Also he's hosting a fundraiser event tonight and he invited her.

I want to go to the event and support him. I want to be mature and rational. But I'm just so angry. Why does she get to waltz back into my life? Why doesn't my family care about what I went through? I mean they say they care but that it was a long time ago and I should move on. They say maybe she's changed. Why does she get the benefit of the doubt?
Furthermore, I am very anxious about what will happen if I run into her at the party. What if she says something nasty to me? What if I lose my cool? My life isn't picture perfect right now. I'm single, living at home, between jobs. I have depression and anxiety problems and I don't like my body very much. I feel so insecure and inadequate. I cannot handle the feeling that she is winning and I am losing even after all this time.

I need to know how I can get out of this rut basically, I have no qualifications, barely any work experience. I've spent most of my life sat in front of a PC, taught myself some programming, recently been teaching myself to draw. These are both things I thoroughly enjoy.

What I really need to know is, how can I go from zero to job as a person that can barely even muster up the courage to use a telephone (and by barely I mean never). I can barely hold a conversation so you can imagine how job interviews go.

So, as the title says, everytime I get used to a girl I like initiating most of the conversations (which is a good sign, as I was told, but it doesn't have to mean anything here and it's not really that important.) I kind of feel down when she doesn't initiate, like, for a day or two, which is normal, because the other side has to also show some interest and obviously the girl has other friends and a life apart from me. 
The biggest problem here is when I initiate conversation myself, which I do, but I'm extremely careful about the frequency of it, like I feel that I can't do it two days in a row even she sometimes does it like for three of them.

148,"So, here's the story first.

I've been basically working two jobs for the past two years. I'm a software developer, so having multiple gigs at the same time is nothing new. 

I've been working **job A** full time. Five days per week, eight hours a day. **Job B** is more like a part time thing, I work on it for roughly 30-40 hours a month.

I've decided to quit **job B** because I feel overwhelmed with work lately and I want to have more personal time. Money is not a problem as well, so there's really no point in having two jobs.

The thing is, I know that when I'll tell my boss at **job B** that I'm quitting, he is going to do his best to keep me there. He'll offer raise and to employ me full time. But I don't really care about that, I'm staying with **job A** no matter what. 

So my question is...should I ask for some kind of raise at **job A** because I'm giving up another opportunity? I don't think I have any negotiating power here, because I won't end up accepting offer from **job B** no matter how good it is.

So I was thinking to approach my manager at **job A** and kind of give him some heads up about it. Something along the lines *""Hey, I was just about to quit job B but then they gave me a really good offer. I'd honestly rather stay here, is there any way I can get a better deal here? I'm not planning to leave either way, I just feel like I deserve something for giving up another opportunity for this company.""*

A few months later, I was put on the transplant list for a few organs.

2 years after being put on the list, I got my life saving transplant.  But after that the recovery was long.  But I started going to university within the first year after the transplant. I started looking for a job while I was at the university but I never found one.  I finished my degree in Health (ironic, I know) last May.  And now I've been looking for a job for over 2 years.  

I did find one job recently but I couldn't keep it because I had to be around sick children and work 10-11 hrs a day and not drink much water.  The transplant requires me to drink a lot of water (a gallon a day) because the medicine has caused me to get chronic kidney disease.  My immune system is suppressed from the medicine so I shouldn't be around sick people either.

I'm currently dating someone who I regularly see like everyday. Usually, after I get off, I come home, pick up a change of clothing and go to my partners condo to hang out with him. As of recent, my mother has really been making a big deal out of me not being home. She can not give me a proper reasoning as to why I'm in the wrong. I give her 500 dollars a month, buy groceries, buy her random things that she needs, etc. I'm never disrespectful and I always do as I'm told. After working and battling traffic, being with my guy allows me to relax and think of nothing. I just don't understand why she is making such a fuss about me going out with him. Throughout the day(while I'm at work) she texts me ""I don't know why you hate the family so much."" Or she would say ""do you love him more than me?"" Or ""I should just rent your room out since you are never home."" It really hurts my feelings. Like really hurts my feelings. I've never done anything wrong before. Ever. And the minute I find happiness in a guy, it seems as though I'm the one turning my back her. Am I in the wrong? Before I started going out, I would be the one to pick up after everyone and clean up behind everyone. I would literally go running and come home to sit in my room. So what's the difference if I'm out? What also baffles me is when I was over 800 miles away in college, I was always out and about. I'm 25! I'm responsible and I feel like I deserve to enjoy myself. My mom growing up lived her life to the fullest and now I'm being shunned for living mine and being happy. Am I in the wrong? Please assist. ",09May2017,2
177,"I want to get into the world of IT but I cannot afford any kind of school and the college that I was attending cut my financial aid to about half of what I was getting due to them for some reason thinking that my mom, who is a single mother taking care of another child and having to worry about bills and whatnot on the salary of a receptionist, is giving me $3,000 a year to help with school. Realistically this number is a big ole ZERO. Where they're pulling this number from, nobody knows.

I want to try and get an entry level IT job and was wondering if this is possible with Certs. So that I can make more money than I do now and save up to go back for my Associate's or Bachelor's degrees.

181,"So, I'm 17 male, and lately I've been falling into a bad ""trap"" of wanting to have sex or mess around with girls. Which is not me at alll , I'm usually the sweet , nice guy. I'm still a virgin and only messed with 2 girls. And I've know this girl for about a year but we didn't really talk constantly , just every now and then , we met at a youth group at her church . And I'm not religious really btw. I liked her from the start , she's innocent and hasn't been with any guys, like ever. We recently started talking again and she asked her parents if I could come over for lunch and I did. She has a really nice family , I usually don't say that often lol, it's weird. And it went pretty well, they said I'm a really nice guy and everything. And since then we've talked every day, and I tend to fall for people pretty quickly , plus she's very attractive so it makes it even easier to like her.

185,"Hello, this is from last night. But I guess it starts years ago.

In 2013 when I was 21 and in college I worked at a pretty big Toy company. I didn't care for the job to much, but it was a decent gig. I was only part time but could work 40hours and beyond if we needed help. During this time I was with my wife (then girlfriend). I had applied and been approved for numerous credit cards and student loans on top of that. You can see where this is going. I wasn't making enough were I was at. 

At the beginning of 2014 a friend of mine had a better hourly rate paying job at another retail store. Also note he did nothing wrong in this story. His job was security, which I thought would sound better on a resume then random ""Sales associate."" So I applied and got the job. The only issue was I might have made a $1 more per hour, I was now only working 25hrs and no longer working anything past that. I started to fall behind on my bills and eventually stopped paying them all together. My numerous credit cards and my student loans were just getting later and later.

My girlfriend was able to help me get money for a ring to propose to her. I did the proposal she said yes and a few months later we got married. In April 2015 I found a full time job making $10 an hour. With the plans to start paying off my debts. Only I never did. And I never told my wife about how stupid I am. We moved into an apartment after we got married, and my credit was so bad it costed us another $300 in our deposit. I just told her I had missed some payments. She would ask me constantly about my bills and I would tell her I was taking care of it. 

Recently I got tired of my life and I started to work on myself. I'm having someone clean my resume up to make it look neater and more appealing. I started trying to do more exercise. I took the advise of some co-workers and signed up for Lexington Law Firm to try and fix my credit. I started reading ""You Are a Badass"" by Jen Sincero. Well we are also trying to rent a house. Yesterday my wife saw and liked one and were working on the applications together. As we laid down she asked if there was anything else she needed to know about my credit besides some missed student loan payments. And I told her I had not made a payment on my credit cards in years but that I was working on it with Lexington Law Firm. She. Was. Furious. She had every right to be. I lied to her for almost 2 years of marriage. We'd been together since 2010 and I was to embarrassed to let her know. She stormed of into the other room. I tried talking to her but she didn't even want to look at me. It broke my heart when she said she wasn't going to get the house because of me. I died inside. I let her down, and I feel like shit.

Just when I started figuring out what I wanted to do in life, my fiancé(now husband) lashed out on me saying ""why don't you do something with your life. Why don't you just find a job instead of going to college and taking one class?! You'll benefit more from a minimum wage job than one class! You aren't gonna go far. When you have kids you're gonna wanna go back but with kids what's the point?!"" and more relating to that. I get it. Maybe he was trying to give me advice but it didn't come out right or I don't know...the point is that I was taking one class that semester because it was all I could handle at the moment. It really hurt though because his ex was a lawyer who went to the top schools and me...well I was a returning college student. I let some time pass after high school and then went back to school. Ever since then I felt compared to her. My success is nothing comparable to hers. And to top it off, we got married and moved it and after a year of marriage I find a bunch of love letters from her about how much love she has for him and a letter after they broke up stating her feelings that are still there for him. He would occasionally text her for her birthday and vice versa but would hide it from me until I found out and got angry and just burst. They were broken up for about a year when we got together but why would they still keep on texting each other ?!
And It's been a year since he's told me those things and a year that I felt compared with her for everything. And to make matters worse my birth control failed me a month after he made those statements and I got pregnant, leaving me feeling even more behind in life. Now I have a three month old, feel empty, compared, and unfulfilled with my life. I'm sorry that I'm all over the place...i have nobody to talk to here and reach out for support...
I have felt like I have not achieved anything with my life and compared to her all the time. And the words keep haunting me ""when you have kids what's the point of going to school""...I feel as if all my dreams are crushed. I too wanted to go to law school and be someone even before I met him but my reality says otherwise...

202,"Have to explain a bit of backstory here: 

Had to find a new spot, so figured finding a roommate would make things easier/cheaper.     

My brother worked with a bunch of people at a hotel so i asked him if any of his friends needed a new spot. One did so it was perfect. I was sure that my brother wouldn't recommend someone he didn't think was OK. 

Spoke with the guy prior to finalizing everything, he tells me he got kicked out because his prior roommates didn't were not caring and treated him like shit. So he would not converse with them and keep to himself. They took it as an insult and worked together to get him kicked out. ( I now see this as a complete and utter lie ) 


My brother was in the process of moving overseas so he was staying with me ( us ) for the time before he left, so he would'nt have to get trapped in a contract.  He payed his share so all was fair. He stayed in my room which was fine too. 

I work nothing but day time,   8 am to 530 pm, so i'm gone all day.  The brother worked mornings mostly, but had night shifts every now and then. The roommate ONLY worked nights. His preference. 


This is where the issue comes: 

I have a cat. I have had suspicion that he has abused my cat. i have heard/seen him hurt his and have no idea what to do so i try to keep my cat secure in my room when i am gone. but he goes in anyways for god knows what reason. 

I start to notice things in my room moving.  My weed that i keep in a specific spot started to run out much quicker. I asked the brother and he says he doesn't touch my stuff. I believe him as he and i lived for years and i never had this issue. Certain tools in my room that i used for housework were missing. I would later find in roommates room. 

Confronting him about this he gets mad, and i mean the guy needs Anger Management for LIFE kind of mad. 

Hes racist too has made multiple issues about Hispanics vocally. I told him i don't appreciate him speaking this way and directly turns it into a "" DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND SAY "" issue. 

The brother has now moved out and is in the Philippines. I live with the roommate alone now. So knowing his habits i got a camera in my room.    


I guess my main issue/question i need help with is this: 

Am i a weirdo for getting a camera for my bedroom?
How can i confront my roommate about this without it being turned on me for having a camera? 

How do i respectfully talk with this guy without things escalating ? .

Well last year I was a temp living with my SO. I was, still am, working full time but since I lived with my SO I could save $5000 in 3 months no problem. I left my SO and I now live on my own which makes it more difficult for me to save money. My parents learned about my plan to go back to school and they pushed me to apply at a private college that has an excellent program for my major and I have been accepted. 

The issue: The company I was assigned to hired me on full time with full health and dental benefits. They gave me a dollar raise as well. All of this happened 2 months ago. But, this is not my dream job and I can't say that I see myself with this company in ten years. The college that I got into is a private college with not many night courses. I would most likely have to drown myself in debt to go full time while not living with my parents. I don't want to move back in with my family because my parents are strict and they pressure me without intending to do so which causes me to stress out. They also live in a 3 bedroom home and they have 3 other little ones ranging from 15yrs-3yrs. 

Tuition for the 2017-2018 school year is currently at $33,200. If I go full time, I would probably lose my insurance benefits and end up with over $50,000 in debt.

218,"(Throwaway account) I'm eighteen years old, a college student, and I'm so lonely. I have friends - three close friends in particular (I'm the kind of person who typically sticks to a couple close friends.). However, all three of them have girlfriends who they spend a lot of time with. I'm basically just a second resort for them to hang out with if their girlfriends are busy or late at night after they finish being with their girlfriends. It sucks. They even go on double/group dates together, which leaves me feeling lame and unwanted. 

The past couple months I've been feeling this heavy loneliness around me that I've tried to prevent. I've attempted to talk to people at college, but I go to a community college where people tend to stick to their own devices until class is over and they go hang out with their friends. It's a very antisocial environment. I've tried joining clubs, but they must be inactive because the requests I've submitted to join have gotten no response. 

I have hobbies (music and drawing) but both of those aren't very social as I just do it by myself in my room. I lift weights and ride my bike, but those are also pretty independent. Dating's not really an option either as I'm simply not attractive to girls nor am I particularly cool or smooth. That I've accepted at this point and I don't really see myself being in a relationship.

221,"Long post (NSFW)

Hey all,

I've been feeling incredibly bad for over a month now for something that I did when I was young. It's been making me feel terrible every day, since I remembered it but at the same time, when I look at it from a more rational viewpoint, I don't think it's anything really that bad or abnormal in the grand scheme of things. I've fretted over posting but I need to get it off my chest and hear other people's views.

Basically, about a month, maybe close to two months ago now, I logged back in to an old account on an image hosting website (similar to Imgur). I'm 23 and it was the first time I had logged into my account on there for about 5-7 years, I can't remember exactly. I used the account to save screenshots of achievements I'd made in an online game I played when I was younger. The reason I had remembered the account existed after so many years was because I'd revisited the game again which made me remember it existed and so I visited it for a nostalgia trip.

When I logged in to it, I saw the last images I'd saved onto the account was of a topless girl. I had been sent it from a girl that was my age when I was 16 or 17 (6 years ago). At the time, I had saved it on my private account being the teenager raging full of hormones that I was and I believe this was before I had a smartphone which is why I had saved it onto the account. I must emphasise the account was private so nobody else saw the images (there was one other that was not explicit but of a girl in her underwear). I'd completely forgotten they even existed. But of course, with the hindsight of it being 5-7 years later and me being 23, I realised that the images were inappropriate. I obviously deleted the images and then also deleted the account after looking through the rest of the images on it which were of the game that I'd originally logged into it for.

Now, for weeks now I've been worrying over it as I know it was wrong of me to see them. But the rational (well I at least hope it to be) part of my head has been saying that it's completely normal behaviour for someone of that age at the time to be seeing images of that nature if sent them. My only mistake was not deleting the one image that really shouldn't have been on there, but it was completely unintentional as I simply stopped using the account and forgot it existed entirely until recently. When I saw it, it was deleted straight away so there wasn't much more that I could do.

Another thing is, where I've been worrying constantly, it's resurfaced something else into my head that was also completely accidental. I should say, I've suffered with anxiety and depression on and off for a long time and this has really hit me hard as I feel like I've done a bad thing, albeit unintentionally. I try and avoid trouble and be as un-confrontational as possible. I've been worrying about it every day for long periods and it brought up in my head, this other thing that happened that makes me feel terrible even though it was, again, completely accidental. Something that it brought back up in my head was when I was browsing porn years ago. I had googled 'Rule 34', which people might think is a bit weird but (NSFW) r/rule34 is quite a popular subreddit so I can't be that abnormal in that aspect. I clicked on one of the first sites that came up and was looking through the different images and at some point came across an image that was clearly depicting someone below the age of 18. The rest of the images I'd looked at were fine and I hadn't intentionally seeked it out and have never revisited it but for some reason that's popped in my head because of what's happened recently and is making me feel even worse even though both incidents were unintentional.

It's like I have the classic devil/angel on each shoulder, but my brain keeps telling me I did something wrong more than me thinking more rationally.

I just needed to get this off my chest and hear what people think. The rational part of my head says that I was young, full of hormones and stupid, I received an image that young people send eachother at that age. I forgot all about it. Then unintentionally, I saw the image 6 or 7 years later but deleted it straight away so couldn't have done much more. And the other incident was just me stumbling across an indecent image on the internet accidentally, which I guess can happen. Something I didn't seek out and something I did not revisit. I've been using the internet for over 10 years, I guess it's not uncommon for a person to accidentally stumble upon something like that once in that time.

So would people agree that I'm not abnormal or a bad person and that the two things that happened aren't worth worrying about? Or if you do think I did something wrong - any advice? I feel guilty about it but don't know what to do as I don't think I did anything that wrong and I can't change what happened.

TLDR - Recently saw an image of a girl topless that I'd been sent when I was 16/17 and had forgotten about. Deleted it when I saw it but have felt terrible about it since. Due to me worrying, it has brought up another incident in which I accidentally stumbled upon another indecent image a few years ago through no wrongdoing of my own but I still feel awful about it. Any reassurance or advice would be appreciated.

We did everything together; experienced new things, traveled, made friends together, talked constantly. Neither one of us has had a relationship before and neither one of us is out to the public, but I starting falling for him hard.

Quick Back story: Last six months have been hell for me. I had a viral infection that effected my nervous system, followed by the suicide of my roommate &amp; best friend (We had lived together or down the street from each other for 30 years). Gf and I broke up and I just feel like I have been in a downward spiral.

I really want a fresh start. I have a couple jobs that don't pay very well but are in the fields I want to work (It's not easy to get a job in my field). I have always wanted to move to a coast and the timing of everything seems to be now or never. My lease at my place is about to expire (I can't afford this place anymore since my roommate, well you know... died). I am nervous if I leave my jobs that I may be making a huge mistake and could never find work in my field again. Moving to a place with notoriously higher rents, well I worry I may be just running from my problems and I won't be any better off, maybe even worse.

I still love my ex and I know she still loves me too. Her situation makes it near impossible to move to a new place for many, many years let alone soon. 

My options are quitting my jobs, packing my bags and moving to a new city for a fresh start and hopefully a new lease on life or I can stay put, get back together with my ex and move in together and keep plugging away at my jobs hoping they will turn into something more sustainable through hard work and experience.

243,"So I already have made 2 posts, got some advice but things aren't going that well. Here is the post which explains everything, although you don't really need to read it(except from some sections of it which I'll prompt you to in this post).

TL;DR of that post is: I have a crush on a girl one would call weird and shy. I'm also shy. I asked her out and she said she can't go out  during exams, which end on the 31st. 

Continuing


That was a bad answer(for me) but I still thought I had chances. Waiting a month for it though would be bad for my health, as I too have exams, plus her saying no after all this would hurt me even more. So I decided to talk to her best friend to see if she is interested. 

After 2 days of waiting I got this very very weird answer. Okay so, apparently she asked about her opinion on me and she said she isn't looking for something right now, and(this is where the weird part comes in) she doesn't like the fact that we **DO** have the same interests. I mean, okay, she might wanna try something different(which I don't really get, and I can't really believe is true either). But she hasn't been in a relationship before(almost, see 2nd paragraph of linked post)! How can she say that?! If she had said she doesn't like me I'd get it and I wouldn't feel like having the slightest chance. But she didn't.

After that I had lost almost all hope. Then, my friend which had a ""relationship"" with her last year told me that she said the same thing in his case, **in front of her friend which I asked**(fun fact, we sent the same girl to talk to her, same answer). Obviously, that gave me hope. I didn't say anything. Then her friend acted on her own and ""cleared things up"" or ""made sure"" and told me she ""doesn't want to"".

I mean, at this point, I got suspicious. The whole thing doesn't seem legit. It was probably a mistake talking to her friend. After all that I asked her if she told her that I had a crush on her and she answered ""she knows nothing"". She is clearly avoiding me though.

I feel like I've screwed this up by talking to her friend. I still wanna ask her to go out and tell her I like her, but she will probably say no(to going out, I know she is probably going to reject me liking her too but I wanna feel like I exhausted all my options).",09May2017,1
245,"Okay, before everything, sorry for my profanity and plain honesty, but please don't say any mainstream bullshit that everybody spews out like ""you're beautiful the way you are"" or ""nobody notices those things"" or ""you just gotta work for yourself."" Also, this is like **40% rant, 60% advice-seeking.**

Obviously, **I am struggling a little to accept that I am Asian.** No matter how much I conform (which I've never really done before this year), no matter how much I be friendly (which I've never done to people of different races before two years ago, which was when I moved to USA, but I do not racially discriminate others), no matter how fancy I dress, or no matter how overall good person to all people, I am always **that weird kid** which just seems because I am Asian.

This is going in my mind because when I achieve anything at all at school, *I did well* or *I aced that test* just because *I am Asian* and ""*all Asians are smart*,"" which is a pretty tiring thing to hear. Also, making friends to people is a little difficult because when I literally go out there and just talk to people (strangers), and then ask them honestly what they thought of me before and during I was talking to them, these strangers tell me that they thought I was ""that weird Asian kid"" (note, not just ""that weird kid""), and I believe strangers because they don't have any reason (such as friendship) to lie to me and care about hurting my feelings.

This insecurity is not very strong anyways, but it's been going for 2 years now. My self-esteem is slightly affected by this, but **not** to the point of social anxiety. Though it doesn't greatly affect me, I sometimes catch myself taking pictures of myself and wondering what I would look like with plastic surgery (which isn't healthy behavior), just to look more ""white"".

**TL;DR** strangers tell me they thought I was a ""weird Asian kid"" before and during talking to them, people tell me I achieve things/I am smart just because ""I am Asian"" (and that ""all Asians are smart"" or because ""my parents make me work very hard"" which are both false, BTW, I am the laziest mofo ever). Now, I find myself **slightly insecure.**

The one thing I'm most worried about is if I ask him, and he's confused or put off by the idea of me liking him like that, and he'll stop hanging out with me. I guess that would be pretty shallow, and I don't think he would stoop to that, but it could still happen. I think that comes from the fact that both our mothers are good friends as well, and I probably seem more like family to him, but I might just be looking into it too deeply.

247,"For the past year there has been a gay guy that acts creepy and borderline harasses people around the neighborhood. He doesn't physically assault anyone or touches them, he just yells out remarks  to me about 90% of the time he sees me on the block. I know this isn't just to me because he always goes to the same corner store which is on my block and I'm sure the cashiers there are sick of him as well.

He's pretty annoying, I think he believes that this neighborhood is a playground for him and he can say whatever he pleases to anyone. Sometimes he just says hi to me, other times he acts gay or tries to be lewd. He's loud and obnoxious, often times continuing to talk even as I'm walking away about my business.

At first I just ignored him, then I tried calling the cops on him, but I could never get the cops to show up as he was out on the block. He spends like 30 minutes of his day at the corner store and after he leaves he's gone for the whole day. I stopped trying to get the cops on him and instead tried to talk back a bit. I made fun of him and said he was on welfare, that pissed him off somewhat, but next few weeks he was back at making random remarks again. One day I was trying to get my car out of the snow and he came up the block and started doing his usual shit, so I told him to fuck off. Then he tries to recommend places to get shovels to get my car out. And of course next few weeks later he's back to doing his thing.

Overall he's really stupid, I'd rather he not exist. I'm moving out of my place in a year so I'm trying to think of ways to effectively handle this. I don't think anything will make him stop unless I literally punch his face and break his nose or something, or the cops come down and arrest him. Basically if no heavy consequences occur I'm pretty sure he's going to continue doing what he does. Calling the cops on him doesn't seem as effective since he's quickly gone, the cops won't be able to show up in time when he's out. I'm thinking about just continuing to make fun of him if he tries to talk to me. Maybe be very sarcastic with him and shoot some remarks back.

261,"My professor for an upper level engineering course (Fluid Dynamics) changed/didn’t follow her course syllabus and ended up really hurting me and many other students with final marks. 

The course was suppose to have 5 homework assignments (worth a total of 15%), 5 quizzes (worth a total of 15%), two midterms (worth 20% each) and then a final (worth 30%). 

I didn’t find the following things too big of a deal but we ended up having 3 homework assignments, 3 quizzes and since people did poorly on the first midterm, she added a research paper component that would count for a percentage of the midterm test. 

The big issue here is that the second midterm was completely dropped and she added that 20% to the final exam percentage, making it worth 50%. 

The final exam consisted of four computation questions, one being a topic we touched on the last day of class, where we didn’t have a homework on and she didn’t say to look at the homework exercises. She just told us to quickly look over this topic, so I assumed it wouldn't be on the final. I was wrong… that question was on the final which means I instantly lost 12.5 points off my GPA for the class, just because I missed one question. I ended up getting a C+ in the class which significantly drops my GPA. If I had gotten that last question right of just reviewed some examples from that homework which wasn't assigned, I would have gotten a B or B+ which is a pretty significant difference just off knowing one question. 

My main issue with this is that if the syllabus wasn’t changed, that one question wouldn’t have been able to drop my entire grade in the class so much… it really hurt me in the end and I’m not sure if there’s anything I could do about it. Does anyone have any suggestions, thoughts, or plan of actions I could take? Thanks for all of the advice and help in advance.

FYI, I felt like I really learned a lot from this course, and a C+ doesn’t come close to a representation of how much I learned.

I started smoking pot in December and I moved on to lsd, dxm, and 25i nbome, this whole school year I've gotten into minor trouble every 2 or 3 weeks (couple days of iss) and most of the times I'm with my friends doing bad stuff, I got caught smelling like pot and my school suspended me for 5 days, I now believe I hit rock bottom because of all the shit I've been doing this year, my parents both work blue collar jobs and it hurts me to be making them go through all this. So now my question is how do I make my high school life nothing like middle school? (Cutting off all friends and making new ones?, focusing on sports?, getting a girlfriend?) most of my friends are good guys who do drugs, but I want to stop all this shit. 

All advice welcome.",09May2017,1
264,"Ever since my boyfriend and I decided to get engaged, I've been {maybe} overthinking his behaviors.
It all started when he applied for this job, he had to get tested for drugs. He couldn't pass, so he said that he didn't even want the job and that he was pleased with his old one. He claimed the old one matched his career options were better at the small firm he worked at, because it focused more on his actual degree. Anyway, I don't care which job he has but the moment he couldn't get a job because of his weed habit, I started kind of seeing it as a failure. Most of his friends are unemployed and unambitious, many of them don't even have college degrees. He's the most productive one of them.
I feel like weed plays such a huge role in his life and he's pretty much addicted. I have nothing against weed, but I don't appreciate it taking control over his life. He's definitely abusing it.
As soon as he finishes work, he makes endless phone calls trying to score, he spends the rest of the evening smoking up at one of the guys and playing FIFA. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. He's 28 and I feel like this is a phase a lot of people his age have passed.
I really don't mind him smoking up as a general notion, but being addicted to anything isn't the greatest thing.
He's committed to his job, and he uses week to relax for the rest of the day.
Do I have a right not to like it?

265,"A while back I bought a bag to use for work. However, after using it for about 7 months the fabric is beginning to tear. I went back to the store expecting them tot say this isn't what's supposed to happen and that I would get my money back/a new bag/a discount. However, they told me this was normal and I should have bought a leather bag. They did patch it up with a marker but obviously this doesn't fix the issue. Back home I wrote an email to the head office complaining, as I am very confident in writing and I had plenty of arguments (still have factory guarantee, I discussed the bag with the saleswoman and what I would be using it for when I bought it, when I went to complain I mentioned twice that they did not inform me about this quality of the fabric when I bought it, etc). The head office emailed me back that they had called the employees and they had said they thought the issue was resolved, and they wanted to call me about it. Now, I'm not happy about having to go back to them in the first place, they provided bad service twice and I tattled on them (plus what else are they going to do, they said they couldnt do anything else than color in the light spots), but also: I'm just not very headstrong on the phone or irl. Going there complaining the first time was a big deal for me as is, and now I have to call them again and be all 'not taking no for an answer' which obvs failed the first time I went there.

In short: how can I become confident enough to not apologize for complaining and be all understading and walk away with a broken bag and nothing to show for my efforts?",09May2017,1
268,"A few months ago I began writing a series of books revolving around three teens getting sucked into a hidden society full of magic and its practitioners. It is inspired by the Kane Chronicles, along with some snippets from other media. However, as I also refer to magic practitioners as ""magicians"", the story feels a little similar. I don't want to call them ""wizards"", ""sorcerers"", or ""warlocks"". These all make you think of old guys with beards. But I'm not a huge fan of ""mage"" or ""enchanter"" either. Should I deal with the slight feeling of similarity despite large differences in the plot, or change the way I refer to the characters?",09May2017,2

The police officer made me feel awful and went on about how I could have killed someone. He's right and I feel so embarrassed, guilty, shameful...the list goes on.

275,"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, so sorry in advance if I screw up posting this. 

Today was my sixteenth birthday. I've always been very contemplative, and sometimes worry too much. But today I've been in a state of sadness. I'm not really sure exactly why, I've got a few reasons but I'll get into that in a second.  I guess I'm just looking for advice, on any of this. I just needed to get this out and maybe look for input. 

I have an okay group of friends. I've got okay grades, nothing special. I've got okay looks, and okay social skills. I feel like everything in my life is just ""okay."" I think the reason I may be thinking about all this today is I was thinking ""okay I've been around 16 years now, what do I have to show for it?"" And I think the answer is nothing. Not in a ""I've fucked up in life"" kind of way but I just feel like I should have something to be proud of or know who I want to be or have something accomplished. 

I want to be a film maker (I own about a thousand movies on blu Ray). But film school takes pretty impressive grades, and I feel like any kind of art major is defiantly not the way to success. (No offense to any art majors reading this). I don't know what I plan on doing or where I'm headed in life, and that scares me. My grades aren't impressive. Not horrible, but not impressive. This stresses me out so much because I feel like so much is based on grades now days, and I'm a very hard worker, but I'm just not good with school. 

My friends are good people. I laugh with them but I feel like I'm losing touch of them. I get lonely fairly easily. I've always been sort of a romantic, but nobody really knows that. I haven't really dated anyone yet in high school, and I don't think that's important and I'm sure I'd scoff at someone else saying that, but I just hoped I'd make some sort of connection with someone by now. 

I don't really know where I'm going with all this. I've just been thinking a lot about all this today. This isn't some thing where I'm looking for attention I just needed somewhere to talk and hoped someone will have some life advice for me. ",09May2017,1

But now I have a family, I was ill for a month and I just feel like my sharp mind is slipping as I get older (33 yo) and I feel too tired to stay motivated to constantly study new material and remain competitive.  I feel like office politics of working in a corporate environment of 600 employees in 1 room is wearing me out.  I feel like I can't win.  Seems like some people dislike me no matter what I do.

281,"Ever since I've seen the movie John Wick, I've been looking for a 69' Mach 1. They're a bit out of my price range, but I finally found a tribute car that I think is a decent purchase. The problem is there are a bunch of other people willing to buy it as well. So, I threw down a deposit asap to reserve the car, but I can't fly out to check out the car anytime soon because I'm going to China for a bit.
I've talked to the guy on the phone and he seems legit, but I also feel like it could potential be a scam and I would love for someone to help me out and check the facts.
Here's the lowdown on what's happening with this purchase so far and why it could be a scam:
It was sold on ebay for 18500 but the woman that won the auction never paid so he listed it in other car sale sites.
The guy I talked to is named Dave, he has a business partner named Ray and Ray has a ton of classic cars (this one is his as well) but Dave wants me to do a wire transfer to him, then he'll give the money to Ray then Ray will allow it out of the shop it's in. Ray owns a few auto shops as well. Dave is involved only because Ray has no tech background and that is Dave's skill set.
A wire only transaction is just sketchy af especially when money has to touch so many hands before I even get to see the car.
There is no title, but apparently cars in CT don't need one if they are over 20 years old, but they can get it registered and then it won't be a problem for me to get it registered and get a title in my state (NE).
All the fact seem to check out so far but I'm a pretty cautious person and don't want to get swindled.
They have a website at http://www.selectmotorsct.com/ but this will be sold as a personal sale to dave and the check is not made out to select motors. This is also the only classic car on the site, which seems somewhat odd (this is what I made the deposit for: http://www.selectmotorsct.com/1969_Ford_Mustang_Paquabuck_CT_9911320.veh )
I'll be sending the check to: 15 Overlook Court, Portland, CT 06480 the car is at: 125 East st New Britain CT 06051
I would love if someone in CT could do some work for me to see if this transaction is legit or not. Willing to pay $100 bucks or so for an hours worth of checking for me.

Playing World of Warcraft while voice chatting with friends and drinking booze.

This gets boring quick and it's not good for my health. I have no clue about how to fill the huge void if I remove this part of my life but I am willing to do it.

284,"Hey guys, I have a question about extracurriculars for university. I'm in grade 11 right now. Over grade 9 and 10 some stuff happened in my life that affected me a lot, so I didn't really take care of myself that well. Grades dropped, stayed home playing video games all day, etc... I managed to turn the grades thing around this year though, going from a final grade 10 average of 67 to a current average of 86. I believe that over the summer I can do more academically-related things which will allow me to get much higher marks in grade 12. So not too worried there. One thing that does concern me, however, is my lack of extracurricular activities. Now I know a lot of people on the internet say ""Oh, look at your hobbies, stuff you do around the house"" etc... but seriously, I have none of those. I used to be really good at basketball, but during those two years lack of exercise has lead to me putting on a lot more weight than I would've liked (though I'm taking steps to resolve this issue as well), and I'm not nearly as good as I was. Something else I frequently participated in during middle school were math competitions (of which I frequently won awards). Aside from these two though, basically nothing else; and these happened before even high school, so don't think universities will really care that much about them. All advice regarding this issue is very welcome :)

The basketball shoes may possibly be a half size to big (if that could be it, one size smaller felt a little too tight, but is my normal size), but the nikes were perfect siZe. One siZe too big was too big and one size smaller was too small.
