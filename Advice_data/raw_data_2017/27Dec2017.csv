1,"I currently work a job at a furniture store. It’s back-breaking work and I don’t even make enough to support myself. My boss has always been good to me, and there won’t be anyone that can take over my job when I leave. It will pain me to leave, but I told her I wouldn’t be staying when I was hired. 

I knew I wanted to get out of low-pay jobs, so I went back to school. I graduated with associate degrees in accounting and business. That was last May. I was hired as a bookkeeper shortly after, but was laid off after eight months. 

Since then, I have been searching for accounting work to no avail. I had promising interviews that didn’t result in call backs. I went to a dozen CPA offices, but I can’t even get a job filing taxes. 

I always have a plan. Right now, my plan is to be an electrician again. I did it for six years before I had to stop due to a lack of work. I can work part time for a little while until I can leave the furniture business and do it full time. When I get enough money to get my state electrical license, I take the test. I’ve already met all of the requirements. Hopefully by this time next year I will be on my way to go into business for myself. 

I know it sounds like I’ve made up my mind, but I am afraid of what might happen regardless of what I do. If I choose to be an electrician again, I have to fully commit to that path. But I could actually have a career instead of just having jobs. What do you think?",27Dec2017,1

9,"I have a little (28 year old) brother who has had a string of unlucky, unfortunate, and undeserved setbacks in life. He confessed to me today that he feels like there is no way out of his current situation (see below) where he never seems to get ahead. As his big brother, I want to be able to help him and give him some advice, but I hardly know where to start. I'll describe how he got to where he is, what his limitations are now, and what little I can think of that might be helpful.

**Past.** My brother didn't really become himself until he found football. It got him to be active for the first time in his life and he dedicated himself entirely to it. He played local leagues as well as coached, and was eventually brought on to a farm-league team where the next semi-pro players were drafted from. It was right at this time that he developed an allergy to gluten that took him from a 220+ lb football player to barely 100 lb. Everything made him sick. He stopped playing and moved back in with our parents. 

Once he got back on his feet, he found an opportunity to be a truck driver in a remote part of the country. The company trained him to drive any and every kind of vehicle and he moved up quickly. He even bought a brand new truck. Then, his *terrible* relationship imploded: he was evicted from his apartment, left all of his possessions and his job, and drove more than a thousand miles back home.  

So now he's back home again. He uses his driving experience to get a job as a taxi driver while he figures out what to do next. Almost immediately, he is rear-ended at full speed while driving the taxi. He had extensive soft tissue damage in his neck and back, and his recovery was measured in months. As he was still recovering, he was rear-ended **again** -- this time in his personal vehicle. While insurance covered the cost of the vehicle, his back is now so messed up that driving can never be his profession again.

**Present.** He now does his best to work 30 hours a week at a job that pays him just above minimum wage. We live in an expensive city, and like many people out there, he is living paycheck to paycheck. He works as much as he can; any less an he can't afford to live away from home, but any more and his health deteriorates. He feels like there is no way for him to change where he is in life and is constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown (as anyone would be). He feels like he is a burden to everyone is his life, can't do the things he used to love, and is stuck in a loop of barely making ends meet.

**Advice.** My first piece of advice for him would to start seeing a psychologist about all the stress and changes he's had to go through. I'm not sure how that would work financially, but I feel like he is approaching a crisis point. My next piece of advice would be post-secondary education into something like computer science. He would be able to customize his work space to accommodate his injuries and it would be in an industry with a higher starting salary and plenty of upward mobility. *Problem:* he hasn't finished his high school education and refuses to discuss this. It's something he is ashamed of and goes to great lengths to conceal. *Another problem:* he couldn't afford to stop working to go to school without having to live with my parents once again. While this is something my parents would offer without reservation, I think the idea of being as old as he is and having to move back home (again) is horrifying to him. *Another, another problem:* my career is in academics, and it seems to be a sore spot for him. I've offered many times to help him with whatever distance learning he would be interested in, but I've never been taken up on the offer.

I love my brother and I want to be able to show him a way out. Any advice on what his next steps could be, or how to best bring this up with him, is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: brother has suffered numerous setbacks due to health, bad relationships, and bad luck. Looking for suggestions to help him take control of his life and get him moving forward.",27Dec2017,1
11,"The title say it all really,

It seems impossible for someone to like me, no matter what I do, the only time anyone seems a little bit interested in me is when either I'm drunk or they are, I just feel stuck in an endless stream of rejection and being ignored. I don't know what to do.

The more I drink, the less I care but the shitter I feel, 
The less I drink the worse I feel and the more I care.

The only think keeping me alive is my family, but I just need that female companion to come along and make all my troubles melt away.

""I'm probably just tired"" 
""I don't need help""

13,"First of all, excuse me for my English, I'm not a native speaker.
I don't know what to do anymore...
I have quite an elaborate and not so positive history with women, so having even the slightest bit of feelings is a big step for me, since I've been really protecting myself of making any serious commitment.
My first girlfriend died in a car accident, and, after a lot of heartache en a long period of healing, I met someone new who I fully committed to, but after a little over a year she took off with a large portion of my savings... After these experiences I've been very careful with getting attached romantically.
So, here's the situation...
A friend of mine and his wife got divorced. I've always liked her. She's an upbeat, outgoing girl who I've always appreciated and liked a lot as a friend. I've kept in touch with her after her divorce and supported her in any way possible. 
Since the divorce we've been in contact a lot and growing close. She shared her most intimate feelings with me and I always provided a shoulder to cry on and I've helped her in any way possible. I've been there for her day and night.
It's been 10 years since I've been able to develop feelings for someone but finally it happened. This is the first time in a very long time I fetl really at easy with someone.
Since she was going through a difficult period in her life, I didn't want to impose my feelings on her and kept silent for about a year.
Lately, she has been talking to me about how she wants someone in her life, but she wanted someone who was able to cope with her emotional baggage.
A week ago she came over for dinner, I opened up to her about my feelings, and we ended up in bed!
I was so happy and felt this sort of calm descend on me, like everything fell into place.
The next day, after she went home, she sent me a text saying she wanted to talk. I went over and then she told me she didn't want a relationship. Dazed and confused I got into my car and drove home like a zombie. I didn't sleep that night wondering what the hell just happened...
I sent her a text (it took me a few hours to write this, since I didn't wanted to do anything rash and be considerate of her feelings) because, when I look into her eyes, it's impossible for me to build complete sentences... I'm not the best at expressing my feelings, and I needed some time to gather myself to do this. This really doesn't come natural anymore to me.
I explained to her how confused I was about what happend. One moment it was all tenderness and sweetness, and 24h later, it was all over... I told her to think about what happened and that I really do care about her (no matter what emotional baggage she has) and that I really want to give this a shot. I told her to take as much time as she needed, and asked her to tell me, when she was ready, what she really wanted.
Now... The reaction I got was that she felt I wanted to give her feelings of guilt and that this was inappropriate. Suddenly it was all my fault...
Now I'm even more confused, and I'm wondering: did I really make a big mistake to open up?
I really don't know what to make of this and some advice would be greatly appreciated!

15,"Hi so I am Jenny and I am 19 years old. I have a little sister who is 12 years old and I am wondering if this is a little phase or if something is genuinely wrong with her. So me and my mom and my little sister and my mom's boyfriend live together. I have a job at Shopko while my mother and her boyfriend work as janitors. My little sister is in 7th grade and she has no friends. She claims to have social anxiety and we have been told by a therapist that she may have social anxiety but the thing is, I think my sister lied to her therapist. Like to suicidal questions or self harming questions, she always said no. I don't believe that she does self harm or such. She got out of therapy and I don't know why. Anyways, here are things that make me wonder if she really is okay. When I asked her about it, she said that she is just going through a phase but I am scared it is more. 


- she would complain about not feeling part of this world. Like she would say that she just feels like a spectator sometimes and not part of any thing in this world. Like not part of family gatherings and such. 


-she stays home a lot and has no friends at school. She is the quietest girl there. 


- I once went through her journal and saw some pages saying ""Pain does great"" and I saw a lot of pages just saying the same thing: ""You're all prisoners. What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds that stops you from seeing that you're just tiny little clogs in a giant absurd machine. Wake up! Why be a cog? Be free like us. Just remember, smile."" 


And besides the word ""smile"", there is a little smile drawing but there is always a drop of blood on the paper somewhere. How do I know it is blood? I once walked in on her, cutting her hand and put a bit of blood on the paper. 



- she has a violent wallpaper on her phone. It shows this ginger boy with a gun under his head, looking at this other guy and it had worse next to him that said ""I am the boss"". 


-she also really likes guns and weapons. My cousin owns some and when we visited him, she kept asking just to hold a loaded gun. Bot safe and no, we never let her so much as touch one. 


- she tells really dark jokes and laughs like a fucking maniac. She would tell jokes about Jewish people, even though she isn't a fucking Nazi, and death and abortions and she would laugh at her own jokes. Not like chuckles, like fucking maniac laughing. Mouth wide open and loud. I hate it, it scares me. 


- she fixes everything with knives. Can't open something? Knife. Can't peel a banana? Chop off the top. Can't twist off a water bottle cap? Stab a hole into the cap. 



I know that this all sounds violent but I am wondering, is this a phase or something worse? Do I tell someone? Or do I just leave it alone and let her sort it out. She is also really sensitive. Cries at anything sad but pissed at anything even remotely saying something bad about her. Or to her. She also is adorable too. Like when we are all together, she is a normal girl who laughs like us. But when she is alone, she starts doing that shit. She tells jokes to herself..and her mood changes so quick. One minute it is happy, next sad, then happy, and then angry and then happy again. Like what the hell is with her? Is it just hormones and an edgy phase or what is it?",27Dec2017,9

20,"How can I just let go? I don't want to analyze myself anymore, and yet I do because there is so much value for myself and others in figuring out myself entirely that I see everything else as worthless right now. When I am alone it's all I do, but it depresses me so much. I feel hopelessly lost when I analyze myself because I never make progress on my exact cognition(and how could I???? My brain is putting itself aside to try to watch my normal brain activity..it's a paradox. Me is trying to observe an exact duplicate of me inside my mind)

When I'm not self analyzing, I make no progress on where I want to be in life and what I should be doing to give the most meaning and joy to myself, and the most value to society. But I just can't pin anything down with certainty, so I grind my gears again...and again...and again...theoretically for the rest of my life. I can seriously see it haunting me till the day I die. I want to be done with it, but I've already started and can't go back now. I see the value in the answer and I have to have it, so I push my brain again and again and again. But I hate it now, I hate my brain and what it is doing and I hate how when I stop I blow around like wind with no direction and that it requires me to self analyze to move forward-&gt; leading me right back to permanent depression self-analysis.

I'm stuck between two impossibles with no more energy to fight it. I want my brain to stop and I just want to lay down forever. My head is heavy and I'm getting headaches. I can feel my brain is tired, but it just keeps chugging, keeps analyzing, keeps pushing itself to find something in my brain that I couldn't find before, like it NEEDS to define me and unlock the rest of my personality that is missing that makes me so empty. I want to cry just thinking about how lonely I feel doing this constantly. But if I stop, I'm giving it up. I give up on my happiness and finding my place in life. I'm too empty and unmotivated to try things anymore, I just can't even bear it. I don't want to continue. I don't want to stop. I can barely find the energy to complete my daily life, let alone go out and try things. I can't go out and try things with others because my emptiness has left me nothing to say and connect with others on. I feel I'm drowning in complacency with no energy to make it out and no direction to help, with no way to find a direction.",27Dec2017,1
21,"I've always had a turbulent relationship with my mother and to some extend my grandmother.  I'd describe them as socially conservative with limited education and myself liberal.

A few months ago I had a blazing argument with my mother; I told her I couldn't love her and stormed out of the house with my things.  Currently I am trying to maintain some distance between us.  I came home for Christmas, with the encouragement of my friends and acknowledging that though part of me resents them, part of me also loves them and feels guilty.  My mother couldn't be more physically generous to me: if I ever needed anything she would help me as much as she could, no questions asked, and despite the argument when I came home she had some small presents for me and continually offers to do things like washing and making cups of tea etc.  I find it painful and somewhat suffocating that she is so kind in some ways and obviously dotes on me, yet I can't return the affection.  I am an only child and she is a disabled widow, and I feel she uses this to generate pity.

My issue is with her suffocating behaviour and opinions and commentary on my life.  If we disagree for some reason her retaliation is often to say that I must be mentally ill or that she ""preferred me when I was on medication"" (I have suffered depression in the past and am sensitive to this).  She will also ask what my friends are doing and then later use that to compare me to them or remind me of my past failings.  She also makes disrespectful comments about my partner to me and in front of other people.  I have attempted to broach this issue twice in the past with her and she dismisses it as her being concerned for me but then continues the same behaviour.

Essentially if we have an issue, she pins it on me being ill or that I'm somehow under an outside influence, rather than seeing if either of us could change our behaviour.

I don't know what to do anymore.  Keeping distance is hurting me, knowing I am hurting her, yet I want to avoid the nasty opinions that arise and would to feel like there is less of her attention on me (even this nice sort).",27Dec2017,1

29,"(I posted this an hour ago but it isn't there, really sorry if I'm breaking any rules by trying again!)

So I have never been to this sub before, I just have spent months worrying over this. I'm sorry for selfishly taking your time. Using my 'throwaway' account as this stuff obviously identifies me.

I am in the UK, I graduated from Cambridge University with a 2:2 in genetics. I want to continue in biology research. Due to a series of unfortunate events I got no summer research experience. I am not qualified for a PhD. It has been almost 6 months since I graduated and I am getting nowhere! I'm miserable and frustrated, my anxiety is worse than ever. There is no room for me at home so I've been staying with my ex (the nicest guy ever) but I can't stay here forever.

I hesitated after graduating. I expected to get a grad job easily but all research places require experience, I'm trying so hard and getting nowhere! Renting a place near home seemed dumb (Of course I'd be moving away soon for my shiny new job) and I didn't want to waste money renting in Cambridge.

Now I'm stuck.

I want to be with my friends, I'm miserable, I want to be back there. I'll easily be able to get a job if I live there, surely. At least a minimum wage one to tide me over. Surely I'll be happier with people I know. I can just about afford the move and a couple of month's rent if I use everything I managed to save through Uni. I have my societies, one which I am running, that I can get back to. I feel, if I stop moping, I can find a much happier life there.

But it's so expensive in Cambridge. I can only get a tiny room for £500 a month, it's awful living standards. I've been depressed and not talking to friends so they seem distant, will I be able to reconnect? Is it just plain dumb to waste all this money on moving to somewhere I'll hardly have space to live? All I want is a gecko, if I rent in the north I'll have loads of space for a gecko, but there's so few job prospects and no friends.

In regards to our financial situation, I am thankful as I have a roof over my head, food to eat and a college education that I will be able to pay off. Disregarding my thankfulness for those things, my family rarely take anything I say seriously and don't listen to my opinions. I tend to take things a little to seriously (i'm way too hard on myself about a lot of stuff) but this is something that I recently have been really upset about. I'm just sick of my siblings and parents making hypocritical comments or telling me to do hypocritical things, then being told to grow up when I call them out for being a hypocrite. I'm fucking sick of being looked at as the dumb one in the family, just because I have a few minor learning disabilities. Sometimes I can tell that my dad smells the bullshit in the air when i'm getting railed for something that's obviously hypocritical, but he makes this ""attempting to look tough"" face and tells me to grow up as well.

33,"I met this girl about two years ago. She only had one boyfriend and they broke up two years ago, so she's single. I wasn't really interested in talking to her, because I was very shy and felt like I would have nothing  to say.  However, she was always the one to keep messaging first and carrying the conversation. 

After about a year of this we became very close,. Im currently away from the country for a year and that made us even closer. We skype every day, we go to sleep together on Skype, one of our rituals before we sleep is to tell each other love you. This is all platonic.She goes thru some family issues, she has PTSD from sexual abuse and I'm always the first one she comes running too begging me to  be with her over Skype and I stay comforting her until the episode is over. I am the only one she turns to in  moments like this and even the only one she Skypes.  She began talking to a guy for a month now and didn't tell me about it for a week because I was having a pretty bad week, but I learned about it when she was in the middle of their first date when i messaged her a night. After she told me I felt physically sick, like couldn't eat, and I don't know why but i couldn't sleep. 

 The day after she was telling me about it,  and she told me she told the guy before they even started dating, her best friend us a guy and nothing has to change between us or this can't work out. He was fine with it and even wanted to be friends with me. She was telling me how great he is and how much he makes her happy

A couple days later she was  going on another date and she asked me to come on Skype  to talk to her and to see her dress before she leaves. I began to get the same kind of sad feelings just seeing her dressing to go. I couldn't function while she was on the date and then when she came home and told me they had their first kiss, I couldn't sleep again.

The only thing I mentioned to her about how I feeling as she began to date is while she was telling me about how great he is, that she said something that hurt me where I felt I didn't really matter anymore. I didn't talk to her for two days because of this but she didn't know I was not happy with her. After the two days we Skyped because she missed me and I told her that I felt hurt with what she said.This brought her to tears that I didn't matter anymore and then she went and brought out a gift she made for me for Christmas, she wrote and entire book about our friendship and what I mean to her, which really touched me.

I know she doesn't see me in that way and I don't think about being in a relationship with her,  but at the same time I want to be the only guy for her. I think about us just being in each other's presence playing with her hair (she likes that) or kissing her on her forehead when she's having a bad time, but I definitely don't think about being together with her.  As I speak she's with him now, they aren't a couple yet but I'm pretty sure it's gonna be official soon.

I feel like this whenever she tells me about their plans to go out. I also  feel like this when she talks about  him. Anyone knows what's wrong with me/ what am I feeling,? Is it that I have feelings for her? How can I get over feeling awful when she goes on her dates? I dont want to do anything that breaks up our friendship because that may probably break me.

I didn’t do it  because it seemed to me to be a major gym faux pas. 

My question is, should have I said something? If so, what’s the best way to do it if that situation happens again? I’m not a trainer but I know my way around enough to know what will definitely cause injury.

I’ve only been here for two days but there is this 14 year old boy here who last year during an operation lost all his eye sight. 

He’s a happy kid (they all are), but I was wondering is there anything I can do or set-up for him before I leave. He has an mp3 player that he listens to but he can’t go to school anymore or really play outside. 
Money is limited here so he has not been taught how to properly loive being blind, his friends help him around a lot.

38,"As the title states, I started a job today. The job I applied for was ""HR Assistant/Recruiter"", which is what I want to do... I am gonna make a bullet-point list of things that stand out to me that strike me as sketchy/odd.

I am on the fence of whether or not I should even return tomorrow, so any help will be greatly appreciated:

* We agreed on me starting at 8 AM... My 'supervisor' didn't show up until 9 AM.
* He spent about 20ish minutes of the day talking to me, and then was telling me how I am the 'new HR Manager' (???)
* There is nobody else in HR besides me 
* He then basically gave me a giant laundry list of things he wanted me to do and get done, without any training or help. He basically just gave me this big list of things and then left me alone to figure out how to do everything.
* He told me about payroll (using a system I had never heard of) and didn't train me. Just told me all the people that weren't gonna be at work and needed to use their sick time. So I had to figure out how to put in their sick time into the payroll system
* Told me that he tried getting the other employees (8 of them) to agree to a 9 AM or earlier start time, but people are coming in at 10/11 and he can't 'figure out' how to implement a start time (he's the owner of the company...)
* Same idea as the start time, but he said that people are taking 2/3 hour lunches and he wants me to quickly figure out a way to stop that from happening
* I had to download Microsoft Office myself (which should have been done before I started), but couldn't even do it since the operating system was from 2010.
* He told me that he gives *every* applicant an IQ test and basically just basis their employment on whether they 'pass' the test or not 
* You can't find the company when you google them
* The office doesn't have their 'company name' on the outside of their door
* When getting my key card, the owner said a completely different company name than what it says around the office

I just find it a little weird that I'm getting absolutely no training on this. I also find it worrisome that, especially in HR where there is *so* many laws/rules/liability, that he'll just throw me into the thick of it with NO training

He also told me he wanted me to start the week between Xmas and New Years cause he said it is slow during this time of year and then I can get trained... Me getting trained doesn't seem to be happening.

45,"Background: I go to a small high school. About 70-80 people per grade, ~300 overall. I am part of a more nerdy clique, but sort of serve as a bridge between a lot of cliques. Example: I have also been part of the theatre clique for a while, and many of my nerdy compatriots recently joined me in that group. I also am friends with a few of the more sports-oriented people. 


Characters: 

N- my closest for 7 years, dating girl in our friend group.

E- very close friend of mine for 3 years from a different friend group


Note: This story is a single in a series of extremely similar incidents involving E, and most of the time N.

This year, N, myself, and a girl I’ll call E worked together as the sound, light, and stage managers for a production of our school muscial. This musical was the first time N and E had met each other, since I had met N and E through being nerdy and theatre respectively. Anyways, N and E hit it off. This was all fine and dandy, and all three of us would chat as we worked. One week, E reached out to N and I with a service opportunity in the downtown of our city working at a carousel (our school requires service hours). That Friday night, N, E, and I went to the service opportunity. It was scheduled to be 2 hours, but ended after 15 minutes because a caroling competition was messing with our power. We decided to get some coffee and walk around the carolers. 

As we walked, E and N talked. Despite the fact that all three of us were there together, they talked as though I was never there. It wasn’t a private conversation in content or anything like that. It was a normal, inconsequential conversation that they were just having like I didn’t exist. Whenever I spoke, they’d address it with a single word and move on like I’d never spoken. Since then, the show finished and we went on break. E and N talked constantly over text/social media, but whenever I tried to talk to E she shut me out in a way she hadn’t before, to the point where she never responded when I wished her personally a Merry Christmas. I felt ostracized and helpless. I brought it up with N and learned that he’d been unaware he was ignoring me when we were with E. 



TL;DR: Close friend of 3 years is leaving me behind after meeting my best friend and doppelgänger. 


What I need is help with E. I don’t want to lose one of my best friends for 3 years, but she won’t let me reach out and try to mend whatever seems to have caused her to leave me behind. I just don’t know how to go forwards from here.

52,"I broke up with my boyfriend of a year about 3 weeks ago. Here is the backstory:
I had been really good friends with this guy from high school, after graduation we ended up dating at the age of 19, I am now 20. It seemed perfect because we were best friends to begin with, so we enjoyed all of the same music, humor, movies, and had a lot of other things in common. He is a good person, but I felt like I was carrying him most of the time. He had no car and I ended up driving him to work everyday, letting him stay at my own house every night, and would sometimes help him pay for bills, he helped me in ways also but I realized I shouldn't be taking care of someone financially when I am so young. We had been having so much fun together, and I know he had cheated on his previous girlfriend but I trusted him, until one night I decided to look through his phone because I had some doubt in the back of my mind. We both are musicians and I had found that he had given his number to a girl he had met at a gig. They had been talking for about 3 days, these messages included him saying he wishes he was laying with her in bed, saying he she is beautiful, and a bunch of other things that are obviously not okay to tell someone when you are in a relationship. (Keep in mind he slept in my house so he was messaging her laying next to me while I was asleep). I tried breaking up with him after finding this but he cried so much, literally begged me for hours, and assured me that it didn't mean anything and he was just being stupid, and he promised me that he would never do it again and he would make me happy. So, I stayed with him. We would fight a lot, but we had also had so many fun times together and traveled to concerts of all of our favorite artists, and I can say those times were some of the most fun and happy times of my life. After this, there had been three instances where I found messages of him snap chatting multiple girls replying to their selfies calling them gorgeous, hot, sexy, etc. After each time he did the same begging and assuring and I ended up staying with him. Although he had never physically cheated on him, this hurt my feelings so much because I had not felt appreciated, I did so much for him and I just felt that he did not have enough respect for me to do these things behind my back. The last time I had found messages, I finally broke up with him (3 weeks ago). He has not left me alone since, and we have even hung out and slept together, but I had told him we are not getting back together despite this. I had gone on a couple of dates with this sweet guy who adores me and it felt nice to get treated so well. Problem is, I still love my ex boyfriend, he is a good person, but not a good boyfriend. He took this breakup really hard from what I have heard from other people including himself. He tells me that he did not realize he was taking me for granted and that he would never do anything like that again and would do whatever I want to make me happy. I have tried not talking to him for a couple of days but I end up talking to him because we really are each others best friends, and getting along so well when we aren't fighting makes the break up hard. I do not know what to do, seeing how my ex is acting now makes a part of me believe that he means what he tells me and that he will treat me how I should. Another part of me doesn't believe it and I can see that I can date someone else who has their lives together and will treat me nice. I still sometimes hang out with my ex and I am also seeing this new guy. I don't know if I should stop hooking up with my ex because that makes it worse or if it doesn't matter and I should just do what I want even if that makes the break up harder.

It's basically a hobby of writing fanfiction together or written D&amp;D.  We became friend pretty fast and clicked instantly, talking basically all day every day, but as always, I've moved on from that specific show being my main interest. 

We now have nothing in common, and out conversations consist of her telling me everything that goes on in her life. I've never really liked talking about my personal life, I go to work, go home and get online and that's basically it. Not much to really talk about. She sends me paragraph upon paragraph about her family drama and her kids and her life, and I am honestly not too interested. I know that may seem mean, but the reason I'm online is to avoid personal life. 

I have moved on to other roleplays with other characters, but she seems to dislike everything I'm into. She hates sci fi as a whole, and unfortunately thats my favorite genre. She also doesn't like video games which is another thing that divides us. She seems to still want to be friends with me, but I'm not sure what to talk about with her now.

I started at a new school this year and I’m having massive issues with my classes in the same way that people who didn’t have to try in high school have issues in college. This isn’t surprising since the school is designed to function more like a college and is tailored for “smart” people, but in reality it just feels like the teachers are worse at doing their job in most cases and don’t explain the content thoroughly. This doesn’t bother me so much, I expected it, but I’m having trouble compensating. The only class I routinely study for is Russian, which is one of the two classes that I have an A+ in, and I recognize that I only do so because I’m forced to through extensive homework. In my other classes I have As, then two B pluses, which may not sound bad to some of you but it kills me. The main problem is laziness, which I am working on (Reddit isn’t helping but I do think I’m getting better), but then there’s also that I’m just generally clueless. When I study I tend to go over my notes, quiz myself on them, and then I’m done. This clearly isn’t working, and there are some classes(lit and  FIRC - though I don’t think FIRC counts toward my gpa so I couldn’t care less about that) for which I don’t have notes to study so I’m at a loss.

I know you can do it yourself If you know how to do it.

My car is a Seat Ibiza 2005, the key I believe by the looks was broken because the one of her dogs. Or water damaged because I changed the battery and it doesn’t work.

What are the steps of reprogramming it or If you have a video?

78,"Co-worker and I have become friends. We sit together at break, talk to each other outside of work, walk out to our cars at the end of shift, I've bought them lunch when they asked me to. I've been pretty good to this person I think. Anyway, been going on like that for three months. Before our 3 day weekend for Christmas break I bought them a gift and gave it to them. (walking dead compendium 1) Heard nothing from this person for the entire break. Get to work today, and they seem to be avoiding me, won't talk. I push on the issue, which is them actively walking away and me chasing them trying to talk, and they say they're upset with at home issues. So I'm like alright I'm here if you need me. Get ready to leave and they just clock out and leave. Don't wait up or anything. This is strange because we've made it routine, and I don't think they wanted to be alone cause they were walking with others and talking. So should I address if they have a problem with me or want nothing to do with me to just say so or does this seem mostly in my head and it's an overreaction? I don't want to come off as a weirdo that is overreacting, but I am a bit hurt over their actions.",27Dec2017,2
79,"For a bit of background info, I'm a transgender woman who has been taking hormones for around three and a half years, so it may be better to think of me as being someone with the emotional capacity of a person three years into puberty. I work in food service and recently got into an argument with a guest. The details of the actual argument are unimportant, but I was informed afterwards that I had a snippy, terse attitude with the person. Regardless of who was right or wrong, neither my manager nor I feel that it's okay for me to give 'tude to a paying guest. I asked another coworker, and she said she can definitely tell when I'm having a bad day.

Looking a bit deeper, the revelation that I have a bad attitude explains a lot of things that have happened at work, like being denied constructive criticism and cross-training over newer employees with better emotional stability. Ultimately my emotions aren't going anywhere in the near future as far as I can tell, so I need advice for how to keep it together or even turn my passion from a liability into an asset.",27Dec2017,2
80,"So my boyfriend and I live in a house with 3 other people, one of whom is my landlord, and the atmosphere in the house has become increasingly hostile between all of the tenants and this guy. For one, on the day we moved in, he told us that he would be renting part of the common area out for airbnb, though it isn’t at all reflected in the lease. He made it seem like it wouldn’t affect our living situation at all, but it totally has. Though the lease explicitly states that we only need the landlord’s consent if a friend should stay more than a week, he has forbidden us from ever having friends over, even for a night, if there is an airbnb guest staying. He claims he doesn’t want to overcrowd the place, but he is willing to have up to 6 people stay through airbnb, and our most recent guests have a cat. Me and one of my roommates are allergic to cats, and when she raised this point to him, he basically said to deal with it. 

On top of this, he’s just incredibly intolerable. He holds ridiculous, unreasonable things against all of us - sometimes flat-out fabricating shit we’ve done. Most recently, he’s started cursing at us and insulting us personally. My roommate, my boyfriend, and myself are all considering trying to get out of the lease, but we’re worried about the ramifications. He has issues with one of our neighbors and has talked about slashing their tires, and the way he treats his dogs is borderline abusive, so I’m kind of worried about what he would do. I don’t think he’s above getting physical or vandalizing our property. 

We have the only copy of the lease - he doesn’t have one, so we could technically just bounce, pretending that there was never any lease, but I don’t want to be shady about. Do we have grounds to get out of the lease legally?

Another thing I maybe should mention is that this guy has an illegal grow-op in the basement of our house. We saw it the day we moved in, though our lease does say that we don’t have access to that part of the house. 

Anyway, looking for any and all advice... especially of a legal nature. hopefully I’m in the right place.

84,"Before Christmas my girlfriend told me that she wanted to travel to another country. Economically I couldn’t afford it, but she could afford it and she wanted to go with me or without me.

Latter on my girlfriend told me that her Ex-Boyfriend's family, him and some mutual friends of them were going on a trip, which include visiting several cities of a particular country for one week, she even ""invited"" me to go (I think it was more of a false invitation, as I think she knew I would say “no” right away, as I actually did). 

Either way I got offended for that proposition, and I told her that I do not agree with that, but I did not make a drama out of it. However, I could still sense that she still wanted to go real badly.

To make the story short … she bought the flight and went on a trip with them, before buying it she asked (begged) for my permission….. and I (To test her) told her that it was up to her, at her own discretion, basically it was a yes but not quite. The point is that she did not think it twice before buying it.

Now the backstory of her and her ex is that they lasted almost 8 years as a couple, He is still in love with her and wants her back. My GF despite being with me for over 2 year, has still not stopped communicating with him, and they routinely exchange texts. Awhile back I even confronted her about it and she told me that she was confused and that she was not going to stop talking to him no matter what I said, you could guess how that made me feel. Latter on, she told me that she had made her mind and wanted to be with me and that she would stop talking with him (sadly the communication didn’t stopped altogether, but at least it wasn’t that regular)….. either way the damage was done.

Beside this “recent event” me and my gf currently have a very good relationship and we are happy, and I don’t doubt her commitment with me, but I do recognize that we have some issues… she knows that I have my reservations about marriage, but at the same time she knows that her ex wants to marry her in a heartbeat and he is a really a good guy, better than me in most ways, and whom she still have some feelings left…. she even confirmed me in the past that in case our relationship didn’t work that she was afraid to lose him for making him wait so long. 

Right now she is traveling with him, and I am at home taking care of her dog :/, right now I’m confused and I don’t know how to feel, I don’t know anything that is happening, what you guys think about this situation.

86,"Hello r/Advice, 

This is a very serious thread and brutally honest one at that. This thread will have my sexual experiences and feelings.

I am a 24 year old Male.  I have been struggling with an attraction towards younger girls. I am attracted to girls around 11 years old and above. I am not exclusively attracted to younger girls but also woman up until their 40's if they're good looking.

A little information about my childhood. My father was a drug addict and left me, my brother and mother when I was 5 years old. I haven't spoken to him since. My mother throughout my childhood would be promiscuous and date a lot of different men. She didn't want to work much and I grew up poor. Felt pretty alone, never had a father figure.

Anyways, onto my first sexual experience was when I was 7 years old. I was over a family friends house and would normally play with their daughters, one is my age and the other is 2 years younger. Anyways, The 2 daughters and I were out in the backyard playing on top of their trampoline where our parents couldn't see us. The older sister asks me if I have ever seen a vagina. I say no, I didn't know what that is. She tells me its between her legs and she then asks if she can see my penis. I said no, I was really unsure with what was happening. I don't know why but I was beginning to have strange feelings. She then offered to hers and her sisters vaginas and then I can show my penis (her little sister was sitting quietly next her the whole time). I was curious and I agreed. Both sisters then pull down their pants and show me. I blush and felt aroused. I then show them my penis which was hard. Then their brother walked around the back of the house and saw us. He was 13 at the time. He then got extremely angry and chased me away. I was scared but I didn't tell anyone about that. The daughters were never there the next few times my family visited their family and I moved away to a different town. I felt attracted to them from that experience and would fantasize about seeing them again but I never did. 

My second sexual experience. I wasn't much older but was roughly 8 or 9 years old. My mother would often have men from the military over our place to have sex. There was this one time where I was wanting attention from my mother but she was in the bedroom with a man. I knock on the door and demanded attention. She eventually let me in and the man was under the blankets. I wasn't happy that he was there and didn't trust him. I noticed he was hiding something under the sheets. So I tell him to tell me what he has under there (I really don't know why I thought this was a good idea). My mother briefly left the room for something, he then lifted up the sheets and showed me his fully erect penis. He wiggled it around and was smiling at me. I was shocked and scared, I didn't like it at all. I ran to my mother and told her he showed me his penis. She did nothing about it. Years after this I spoke with my older brother he said that it had happened to him to and had walked in on our mother having sex by accident a few times.

My third sexual experience. I was 9 years old at this time. I moved to a new school. I didn't have any friends at the time and was lonely. An older boy who was 11 or 12 years old befriended me, and I would play with him often during recess. My older brother didn't trust him and kept telling me to not play with him. I didn't listen to my brother because I didn't have any friends at the time. After a few weeks, during recess while me and the older kid were playing, the older kid took me behind a building where no one else was saying he had something to show me. Suddenly, out of no where he became really aggressive and started grabbing me. I was getting frightened, He grabbed my hand and forced it on his penis. I felt extremely scared and didn't know what was happening. I was yelling and telling him to stop, he didn't listen. He was much stronger than me and groped my penis and pulled down my pants. He was trying to stick his finger in my asshole. I was struggling as much as I could but it he was too strong. Luckily, my brother would always watch out for me. He walked around the corner and saw it. He beat the up the older kid pretty bad. Needless to say I stopped being friends with the older kid and he never spoke to me again. 

Last of relevant sexual experiences. Fast forward to my teenage years. I would still feel attracted to younger girls, I thought they were beautiful. Although I believed it was wrong to date any girls younger. I was an attractive teenager and younger girls would often have crushes on me. But I would only date girls my own age or older even though i still found then attractive. When I was 13, I lost my virginity. Then throughout my entire teenage years I would try to have as much sex as possible, even going up to random girls and getting their numbers to trying to hook up. 

Lastly, when I reached the age of 17/18, I still had an attraction for younger girls that were as young as 11 years old. I knew something was wrong now. I thought my attraction would have gone away by now, but it didn't. I begun to hate myself. I think about telling others but I know the hatred people have for pedophiles. I am 24 years old still have this attraction and want it to go away. When I mention pedophiles in conversation to someone, their general response is to kill them, cut off their penis or send them to jail without question. So I have never opened up to anyone about this. I have thought about seeing a counselor or psychiatrist but where I live they'll just report me to the authorities. So I keep this to myself. I haven't had any sexual contact with younger girls and never will. I avoid contact with young girls because I don't like the feelings. I am extremely hard working and successful with my life regardless of my childhood situations and have a loving Girlfriend. But I still feel like I'm a monster for having these feelings. Does anyone have advice? Or can help me make sense of this?

TLDR; Father absent since 5 years old. Mother was a slut. When I was a kid my Family friend daughters showed me their genitals and I showed mine. One of my mothers hook ups showed me his penis, mother did nothing. Older boy in school befriended me and nearly was able to fully rape me, but older brother saved me. Noticed when I was an adult I stilled had attractions for young girls.",27Dec2017,6

90,"I've known her little brother for a few years, and last year he started high school. He spends most of his time on his computer, in his room. As soon as he gets home from school I'm told his family will rarely see him for more than 20-30 minutes at dinner and then it's back to his room. This is on a daily basis.
   Additionally, he has very few friends, and I'm worried they enable his behavior. They live similarly to him, and they play games at the same frequency if not more than him. It affects his grades. He hardly socializes from what I know besides on his computer. This worries me because I was in a similar boat as him when I was in high school, and I seriously regret it. I don't want him to end up without the necessary skills to make friends and be successful. It's easy to say he's only my girlfriends brother, I shouldn't care, but I do because his parents seem to be okay with it.
   I'm in the house semi-regularly, and see first hand just how pampered he is. He's a sophomore in high school and he doesn't know how to make Kraft macaroni. Furthermore, he does nothing but ask for my fiance and/or his mother to buy him McDonalds' every night, sometimes even when his mother cooks a dinner for him.. And they accept it. He lacks responsibility, and isn't held to the same daily chore standards his siblings have. His parents are completely okay with it and I'm concerned for his mental health and how this is going to affect him some years down the line.

What can I do as a 'brotherly' figure to him? I've tried spending time with him, taking him out and talking with him about what he likes to do, offering different ideas for after school activities and sports. All he wants to do is be in his room. Sorry for the long post, but me and my Fiance are a little lost and discouraged.

91,"I’m 24, B.A. in public health education. 

I’ve had depression since 16. I’ve had multiple therapists even through college, anti depressants taken on and off and right now only smoke weed and have been doing so since March of last year when I moved back home.

I’ve never been much of a social person, growing up I hung around older people mostly. I had few friends and none of my friendships ever became life long. I was that boring weird girl in class got picked on for being overweight and awkward.

Men have never really liked me. My father lives less than a city away from me and never has had time for me despite promising it all these years. Calls to ask him how his day was started off with ‘you got my money’ (had borrowed money from him and every time I called even if it was to ask him how his day was) After 24 years of his manipulations and constant mistreatment (the list goes on for miles)  I blocked him and told him to leave me alone.

I didn’t have sex til 23. Guy used me. I had a few ghosters, the only guys actively chasing me were mentally slow.

I get used and fucked over a lot by people. It gets really bad at times, last guy called me the devil for a week straight along with a barrage of fuck you’s. Told me to go kill myself.

I’ve had people stand me up, ghost me. Get one over on me my whole life. I’m considered a push over.

Compared to my only friend in Winston who has 4 kids. Constantly needs to borrow money and gets mad when I don’t help her with shit. I love her kids but she used to use me and people constantly told me that she was only bringing her down.

She’s a lighthouse. All the men want her despite 4 kids by 3 guys. Works part time at a store. Not even a diploma. Guys wait outside her house for her. They break up and bother her the next day. 

I get called the devil for getting mad about getting stood up. I get laughed at. Literally only the slow guy ever tried to come back. 

They told me I was a sad little soul by nature and people don’t like that. So I accepted it and told them about wanting a sperm donor, rather than a guy who used me and abandoned me. 

They told me there’s someone out there for everyone and that I should keep my dating profiles open and stop looking sad.

I can’t help my facial expression, in the past trying to think of something funny to smile makes me look weird because I mumble to myself.

I’ve always just taken stuff to far. My father once choked me because I lost my shoes in the house.

At 24 my mother threatened to punch me in the face because I answered back playfully but I do it too much. 

I get that I’m a Debbie downer and along with the fact that I was told if nobody was chasing after you coming back to see you or trying to get back together with you that it means your pussy is whack.

Sex has always been blah for me. Guys can’t  get it in with me because it’s so tight. It’s lame like the rest of me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or how to change. 

Nobody who leaves comes back. Ever no guy returns later on to try again with me.",27Dec2017,2
92,"Hi Reddit, as much as this may be embarrassing to say, but I’m a guy who fell in love with a girl completely over the internet. I was 18, she was 15, and we were both a state apart, so it was really hard to see each other. She was really cool though. We would talk for hours on Skype when we had the chance and we became really good friends. We told ourselves to never get attached, just have skype sex and remain “fuck buddies”, but we eventually got serious. I know it sounds kinda sad that I fell in love with someone I never met in real life, but don’t judge. It felt odd for me too, but good. 

After a year and a half, I broke it off. I did this because of the many times we tried to meet up with each other, it never happened. Plus, if she met someone in real life, I would’ve felt guilty for holding her back from being in a physical relationship. We talked as friends for a little while after, but soon talked less and less.

Alot of things have happened. I’ve been in relationships with other people, and so has she, but she was the best out of all of them. We are both single now, and every few months I tell myself that I should talk to her, but I never do. I want to talk to her again, but I don’t know if she wants to talk to me, nor do I know if we should talk ever again. What do you think?

93,"So I’ve been playing dungeons and Dragons with some people who I met via Reddit and at first it was a blast. But as time has passed I’ve felt more and more like they’re enemy then they’re friend. Things came to a breaking point when one of them mentioned how they were ready to rape and pillage. They quickly made the joke that it had been a Freudian slip. Personally, rape is a touchy subject for me. I haven’t been raped or anything like that, but I have nightmares of the women I love being raped. I didn’t want to bring the mood down, so I just asked them not to make those kind of jokes again. What I expected to be the end somehow turned into them ranting at me about how they can say what they want. After I tried arguing my point for a while, they just stopped responding. Later another friend came around and read over the texts (this was all over Discord by the way) and then they started getting on me for asking the other friend not to say it.

I've been with my boyfriend for a year now, and it's been absolutely wonderful. We're long-distance, so I've been out to visit him in his home state several times, and we're currently looking at moving in together in January. Everything seems to be going great between us, and I know that we're both looking forward to the future.

The issue is that when I first met him a year and a half ago, I lied about my age. I was underage at the time, and we started dating a few months after. I'm over 18 now.

There have been several times when I've almost told him, but every time I end up panicking and chickening out. I'm terrified at the thought of him leaving me, but at the same time, I know that he's bound to find out about my lie eventually. I figure it'd be better for me to tell him than for him to figure it out on his own. I haven't lied to him about anything else.

I've gone out of my way to be compassionate and empathetic towards him, and I really hope he can extend the same courtesy towards me and be forgiving, but I just don't know. I really need some advice on how to handle the situation and how to hopefully salvage my relationship if things go poorly- I know that I definitely need to tell him about this before I take the leap and move 1,500 miles away.

106,"It's a bit complex to explain, but I'll keep it as brief as possible. I'm a 19-year-old college student who's lived with in an abusive household his whole life. My father was abusive to me, physically and sexually and my grandmother exposed me to him in the first place.  My mother neglected me so I had to live with my grandparents, where my dad free-loaded off of them. My grandmother is also verbally abusive to me, and I've pented up so much anger for years while wanting to tell her to ""shut the **** up."" I'm not a violent person in any way, but today I felt like I've had the last straw with all of it. My uncle and aunt think I will become just like my father who was a convicted felon that is doing nothing with his life besides being a complete man-child. He has done unspeakable things to me as a kid. I have a hard time with trust issues with other people, and my therapist had diagnosed with me post-traumatic stress disorder.

I can't consider this people to be my family, and my church has been there with me through these harsh times. I'm in school for Computer Science and I work a paid internship as a web developer. It's underpaid ($10.25 an hour), but my job is offering me an A+ certification to work part-time as a computer tech. I want to get out of the house, because I'm sick of the constant abuse I have gone through my whole childhood. Family counselors haven't helped, I don't go to my personal therapist anymore.

Some people think I should stay while I'm finishing up my AA, that won't be in more than a year. Anger has just pent up with me, and I've tried to avoid them as much as possible in the house. My grandfather is the only one who was ever understanding and kind with me, and he thinks I should stay until I finish college.

Most days, especially busy ones, Its only twice; once after i wake up and once before bed.  On days where I dont work...well. the skys the limit, I usually do it at least 4 times on especially boring days. My peak has been 7.

I Avoided asking this on Nofap or anything like that, I know how those lads are, but I just wanted to hear it from an open source.

Its not like its ruining my life or anything, I still have friends and I can choose to stop and do other things, like play some games or exercise, I just typically end up doing this when I get bored.

111,"I'm the youngest child and only boy in a family of old fashion Bible-toting legalistic Christians. Over the past few years, I've become more open minded and therefor have stopped following along with their belief system. This has caused extreme tension in our relationship, and eventually caused them to say they will not help me pay for college at all, even including the price of submitting applications. I'm currently 18 years old and a high school senior planning on graduating this June. I have good grades and am in the top of my class. 

Here's my issue: Our household income is above $100,000/year, which, as far as I know, makes me ineligible for most Financial Aid and scholarships, but none of that money will help me. I know that it's almost January and I've definitely been too lazy in submitting applications for college, but I frankly don't know how to proceed from here. I live in a very very very small town where there is literally no employment available for me in the winter, so I have no income and can't even afford to pay for college applications.

115,"Throwaway because I don't want this crud on my art account. Bleh. 

Since I was fourteen my mother has always been mentally and physically abusive. There was always talk of her taking prescription drugs, stealing from the neighbors, generally being an awful person. She's very well known and stunts pretty hard for social media to make everything seem peachy, but her every day life is a struggle she chooses to create for herself. She lives with an angry man who does nothing but yell and stomp around because she needs his social security check. She wont get a job because she'll lose all these government benefits she's getting. So she cuts hair on the side when she needs cash for something. 

I kept my distance from her for about three years. I had anxiety to the point of not leaving my house from 2011 to mid 2016 and recently snapped out of it (thank god!) because I fell in love with someone and want to make a life with him. I realized getting out of bed was a necessity and I wanted to be better for both him and myself. The holidays roll around. Since I will be moving far away in just a few short months I wanted to have at least one good holiday season with my entire family. So I hang at my mom's place with my sisters on and off throughout the month. Things are better than they've been in years... until Christmas night. She sat in the corner with her back turned against all of us and she sobbed. She guilt tripped me for ""leaving her"" soon. She made everything about her.

Feeling a little guilty I decide to go to my mom's this evening since the chaos of Christmas is over. She knew I was on my way there but took forever to answer the door... Like 10 minutes. I could hear her walking around talking to someone the whole time but no one else was there. She finally opens the door and after looking at me she calls me her best friend's name... And she kept calling me her name. After a couple of sentences she finally realized it was me! And after looking around I notice she has her drugs on the coffee table. 

She has two 14 year old daughters that live with her and the asshole that is their father. I knew my mom was probably into pills and stuff but never anything like this. She looks like death and I'm scared she's going to die soon because of this. I also don't want my sisters around her when she's so out of it she doesn't recognize her oldest daughter...

I'm leaving the country in just a few months and I'm terrified that if I turn her in, something will happen and she'll try to ruin my life. She's like that. I make art for a few bucks here and there (cant hold a job because I'm an anxious fuck) and she did her absolute best to ruin it by giving me a bad rep on social media. Saying I stole things that she actually stole and sold, that I did drugs (never in my 25 years of living), etc.

SO... What should I do? Do I report my mother and risk her coming to my house and beating my ass? She's going to know it's me. And she's done it  before. 

Do I turn the other cheek so I can get a few bucks making art for her friends so I can get the hell away from her? I'm only 200 dollars away. Not much longer.

I'm feeling so alone tonight. Like no matter what I do, I'll feel insane guilt and I can't win.

117,"So recently I was with my best friend and some of her other friends and they all got high but I didn't. I'd never been around my friend while she was high and to be honest it looked like a lot of fun. She got really happy, and pretty handsey, and kept telling me how much she loved me and how much fun it would be if I could get high with her. Ever since then I've been seriously contemplating asking her if she'll smoke with me because I really want To have fun with her like that, the problem is im fucking terrified

A little background about me, my entire family all the way back to my great grandpa has all been addicts and drug abusers and all my cousins have tried pot and it didn't really work out that well for them. I've always said that I would never drink or do drugs because of this but for some reason now my brain is trying to convince me I can only do it just this one time and if I do A B and C then it'll be fine and I can kick it

I guess my question is, will I be able to only smoke this one time and not get addicted like the rest of my family or is this a really bad idea?

120,"So this co worker I have, he actually used to be my friend back in high school. He's a year older so he graduated before me, and then went off far away from art school and I didn't talk to him for 4 years. 
When he came back I mentioned he apply at my work place since we were hiring.
It was fine at first, but after a few months he started getting really saucy with me and everyone who isn't the manager, and says extremely inappropriate things.

As an example:
I'm his senior (employee) by 2 years. That means if the manager or anyone higher up than me isn't working, I'm in charge. Any time I ask him to do something  he says ""no, why don't you do it yourself."" as I'm serving customers, which he then goes to the back (no cameras) and plays on his phone. I don't mind people using their phones as long as work gets done, but this is a constant thing. If he actually does what I say he makes sure to stomp his feet (not even joking) and mumbles obscenities before doing it. 
He also makes inappropriate sexual jokes all the time and it's absolutely disgusting. 
Any time I have a minor complaint (if I'm tired or hurt myself) he says ""why are you such a drama queen get over yourself"", though when he has a complaint it's the end of the world (went home early so many times because of small cuts and bruises. We work in a kitchen).
The worst that happens is the ""I hope you get hit by a car"" threats he makes to me constantly and to another co worker behind their back as they're on sick leave. He's also made at least 4 new hires quit because of his attitude. 

Any time I try to call him out on it or get angry with him he always says ""hahaha I'm just joking with you stop being so serious"", although it's only a ""joke"" when I finally do get angry.
He pulls the same stunts with tier Co workers, though not to the same extent as with me from what they've told me.
I've tried going to management but they won't do anything about it because it'll hurt their precious diversity scores since he's an open LGBTQ member and has threatened using it against then before.
It would be extremely difficult for me to quit as I'm in a union with very good benefits and very good pay for a university student. The only reason I haven't cracked over these two years is because I only work 12 hours a week while in school, but breaks and summers are absolutely depressing for me. I'm usually a very laid back person who likes to ""go with the flow"" and have absolutely no problems with any other workers who are under my seniority level. The rest of them really help me push through but it's getting too much. 

Tl;dr
I need advice on how to work in close quarters with someone who makes me absolutely miserable and depressed, with little option of them getting fired and me not being able to quit my job. 

Sorry for my post being all over the place. It's currently 4AM and I'm laying awake with anxiety since I have to work with this guy tomorrow.

I am 17 and for a long time laughed and “felt good” during inappropriate situations, ex at a funeral or seeing someone yelled at/ embarrassed  . I figured this to be a coping mechanism and normal. 

However I’ve come to the realization that it’s not a coping mechanism , I hate to say it since I can’t stop it and is embarrassing for me but I really do enjoy seeing people cry , or in physical pain etc. Even family . Not sexually ( although never experimented ), but it just makes me feel really good, like smiling , laughing good. As stupid as it sounds this has disturbed my life because I have to walk away from others in pain and can not have people describe their issues to me as I will start smiling , creepy as fuck I know .

The past few years have been kinda rough and college has always been what I imagined as the phase of my life where it got better.

To add to that the girl I've been seeing in the end applied to this same school (not because of our relationship, we both visited the school months apart and fell in love with the place).

 I ended up getting rejected from the college, she got accepted. So now the past month has been seemingly one day after another of intense sadness. Feeling like everything I've been working for for the past two years was just within reach but slipped away and now I'm being left behind. Logically I know that there are other schools that I will be more than happy at and have already applied to. And also that this girl shouldn't be something I'm hinging a decision like this on.

132,"I have been with my current boyfriend for about a year and a half. Pretty much since we’ve been together I have caught him in tiny little white lies. I just ignored them for the most part, because they were small.. and nothing that hurt our relationship. But the little lies add up... and make me change my moods often. He is completely faithful, good to my daughter... I trust him in almost every aspect more than I have ever trusted anyone. 

Long story short, I know for a FACT that he does cocaine behind my back and lies about it. Maybe once or twice a month... and I know the second I see
Him if he’s done it. I have learned that if I try and confront him about it it makes him so mad and defensive that I just don’t even bother anymore... I just shut down instead. I have seen transactions on his bank account that show me he pulled out money right by his “ coke guy” houses multiple times. I have found rolled up $1 bills that smell like coke fall out of his jeans when I was them. I found little coke bottles in the garbage. He always has an excuse and completely defends himself and has some
Bullshit excuse. I have given him many many chances to just be honest with me. I have told
Him many many times that I can’t stand the lying... him doing coke once or twice a month ( and I always know, we are together every night) isn’t such a huge deal. It’s the lying! But obviously I don’t like it at all. We are 27 years old... 

I know that he doesn’t have a coke problem at all. He works 6 days a week, good guy, always there for me. Things could be perfect if he just didn’t lie to me.

Him and his dad(my dads brother) have been over a lot, staying for dinner. It’s not uncommon for him to sleep over. 

We have the same sense of humor, same interests. We’ve bonded over our uptight religious parents. Get high together, swear, express our actual thoughts and fears. He’s one of the few people I can be myself around. I’ve never been uncomfortable around him. 

So, on Sunday, we watched movies, he stayed over. He slept on the floor of my bedroom. About half an hour after we said goodnight, he got on my bed and he did things to me. He didn’t rape me, but he touched me and rubbed himself on me. I didn’t know what to do, so I did nothing. I pretended I was sleeping. I don’t even know if doing anything would have made it better.

I can’t even write what I’m feeling. I’ve been thinking about it constantly. I’m having really weird and confusing feelings about everything. I’ve never ever thought of him that way before. It’s so fucked up and I’m ashamed. Did I say or do something that made him think I wanted him in that way?

I don’t want him to get in trouble. I don’t want anyone to know. I don’t hate him, I hate what he did.

My little brother also suffers from our crappy internet, so consequently he goes over to my grandparent's to use the internet. Him and I got caught up in a conversation about ten minutes ago. He brought up the question, ""do you ever notice how grandpa spies on us?"". Naturally I said yeah, as he's always been a little nosy (refering to how i see him in the reflection of the monitor when I'm doing something). But my brother says, ""No, like he knows what you're doing without even seeing."" This understandably creeped me out. When I thought about it, it would make sense, as my brother always uses his laptop with a wall behind him at their house. Following him telling me this; I asked what made him think that. My brother recalls an event about three weeks ago in which he's watching some video video on youtube. He said it was some comedic video where someone (a stickman) does heroin in public and gets a reaction. About 30 seconds after watching the video, my grandpa comes into the living room, directly to my brother and asks, ""What're you watching?"" in a sorta pissed tone. My brother tells him its a ""funny video"", but before he can show my grandpa what it is, my grandpa tells him that he can ""see everything he does"". He then pulls our grandma into their bedroom (where his computers are) and has a conversation with her for a while. After hearing this, I naturally got freaked out.

142,"Yesterday seems to have been the worst day of my life. 

It’s probably worth mentioning I have Aspergers Syndrome at this point.

The day before I got into an argument with my girlfriend’s mum (I live with the gf and her family). Her mum and I have conflicting personalities and she also likes to drink a lot. I tend to drink a lot if I get upset or angry which led to a confrontation between the gf’s mum and I (I didn’t do anything physical, she just squared up to me and I did the same in defence, nothing more). With the amount I’d had to drink I was also quite ill. The being ill thing has happened a number of times in the past which has put strain on my gf and my relationship. 

Long story short I had the police called on me and got taken and dropped at the hospital where I kipped on a bench for about 3 hours before I could go to my grandad’s place that morning.

Whilst there he explained that he needed to get some food in for me (I’m a coeliac) and that we would pop to the supermarket and then I could have a rest when I got back. Not long before we crossed the road to the supermarket he went very silent and unresponsive and then fell sideways and hit his head which started bleeding. I found out he’d had a cardiac arrest. He’s 93 and is now in hospital.

Long story short I’m not in a good place right now. My gf of 4 years is now saying she’s through with me. I love her with all that I am and losing her would destroy me and possibly cause me to drink way too much to dangerous levels.

Happening for almost 3 months now (started as 1 call every few weeks, but it's now ~3 every day). Blocking numbers doesn't work since it's practically a new number every call. Obviously spoofed

Current solution is to only accept calls from contacts, but would like a more permanent solution that doesn't screw me over if I'm expecting a call, or Dominos. I'm sure this has happened to someone else, but I'm wondering if I wait it out, it'll eventually stop or if my best bet is just to get a new number (which I'm starting to think I should)",27Dec2017,5

I look next to the tree stump and there's a thin plume of smoke. Some of the tanbark had caught fire. 
I thought this must've been from me being a little careless and not making sure my cigarette went out.

However, around 45-60 minutes ago I went out for a cigarette only to see another, thicker plume of smoke and more sticks and tanbark had caught fire in a different spot. Although I had not smoked near the tree stump since the first fire.

Suddenly i just start to ""realize"" that everything is ""real"" and i get super afraid of everything.

173,"*I posted this to /r/askdocs, but got no replies, so I figured I might get some here*

I’m 15, male, have no serious medical conditions, and I don’t take any medication.

It started about a year ago, and has happened 6 or so times since then. The numbing is always in a foot, sometimes in my calf, and has happened with both feet at separate times, though I believe it has happened more often in my right foot. The actual feeling is a sudden jolt of pain followed by less painful numbness. I can easily move my leg around while it happens, but my foot and toes are harder to move. When it happens, the toes also tilt downwards and stay that way until the numbness simmers out. Once, a vein popped out at the bottom of my foot and I could feel it pulsing, thought it also retreated once the numbness stopped.

As far as I know, the triggers are when I slightly move my foot, though I’m not sure in exactly what motion. But there are a couple triggers I remember well. It happened once as I was lying down on my stomach and casually pointed the toes of my foot, and another time as I pushed the pull-out leg rest back down on my sofa, when my calf was also affected.

When it happens, I quickly grab my foot and massage it a little before getting up and limping around, which gets rid of the feeling within 20 or so seconds, though I still feel a slight twinge of numbness in my foot for a few minutes afterwards.

Can anyone tell what this is? How serious is it?

Edit: Something that potentially has an influence on this are my “duck feet”. Since I was little, I tend to walk with my feet pointed slightly outwards rather than straight forwards, though I’ve been working to correct that over the past couple months.

Edit #2: I was just following the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) on /r/bodyweightfitness, and while doing the arch hold, I felt the inner edge of my right foot get a little numb. When I touched it, it got a little red and froze in place for a while with a dimple where I poked it. The foot became numb the usual way yesterday, so maybe I was aggravating the symptoms after they had died down.",27Dec2017,7

So I quit the game and rejoined about three or four times, and regret every moment of it, I also tried getting a refund but couldn't get it. 

I stumbled across this post: http://www.battleforums.com/threads/wow-lead-to-depression-and-suicide.148369/

This is possibly the worst feeling ever, to go so low and still not be accepted at all.

179,"Hey guys! Long time lurker, first time poster~ I'm about to 21 on Thursday(20yr female). My fiance is 21. Both he and his sister were adopted, he was adopted at birth the day after he was born and has some issues(epilepsy, asbergers, ADHD, autism) and his sister came from Russia when she was 8. His mother and father are wonderful towards me and I've never really had too big of an issues unless he and his mother get into really big fights and what not. His sister can be incredibly nasty calling their mother a bitch, a cunt, every word that if I thought of saying to my parents, my body wold be missing from this planet. She is 21, her boyfriend who moved in unknowingly after a week of dating is 19. They both have jobs and live with my fiance and his parents. His sister has gotten into trouble with the law multiple times and they always bail her out. 

So bear with me: last year at Christmas I was proposed to. Wasn't anything big or fancy. Just him and I and a little ring that his dad helped him buy because he was still at college by this time. We weren't really allowed to tell anyone because we had been together for 6 months and his mother didn't want to be shamed in the church community(they don't really go to church a lot but have many friends who belong to the churc) and by the family as well. Fast forward to this year and the sisters boyfriend proposes to her after almost getting charged for spray painting the proposal. The same night I got engaged but a year later. My soon to be in laws are super excited and congratulate them and want to see where they got engaged. My problem is that I feel really discouraged and that as much as they make me feel like I'm family, soon to be in laws have never really said anything to the extent of my fiance and I being engaged. Do I have any right to feel like this? I know it sounds silly, but I feel really sad because no one really knew about my engagement until 6 months later and no one was really excited for us.

180,"A bit of context. My father is an intelligent and accomplished individual - Ivy League medical fellowship, patent holder, you get the idea. He's always been overly prepared (non-perishables in the basement, more than enough firearms), but lately he's gotten hooked by a conspiracy theorist: Stephen Quayle. In his literature (I don't want to call them books), Quayle asserts that Hitler survived WWII and established UFO bases in Antarctica. He also promotes the idea that Demonic giants used to roam the earth, that President Obama accepted his office from ""Satan's Throne,"" etc... You can read more about this guy [here.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Steve_Quayle)

In the manuscript my dad asked me to read, the author asserts that he alone knows the truth by using a section from Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and the Bible, as well as a quote from famed Nazi Herman Goring, to establish logical proof for the absolute wack it contains. Again, this book is about the secret war the U.S. fought against Hitler after WWII ended in 1945. Quayle also talks about the press' efforts to diminish the accomplishments of white, European men. The document's only modern citations are other conspiracy theory authors and junk online articles. 

My sister and I had glimpsed this publication sitting out on a past trip, but when I was home for Christmas, he became rather insistent that I read it. He requested that I read the first two chapters and was explicitly bummed when I didn't invest significant time. I did however, honor his request - mostly to confirm my fears about the nonsense contained within. 

My appeal is this: how do I approach him about this in a manner that is constructive and not alienating. I don't want to ridicule the man, but this author and his content is vile and dangerous. I'm concerned that if I ignore the situation, he'll retreat further into these ideas. I'm quite certain there are others out there who've encountered this, hopefully with positive outcomes.

A little background:

I work middle management for a small law firm for about two years (I am not a lawyer, but I work as a financial analyst). I love my job, however, one of the partners for the firm is incredibly possessive and creates a toxic work environment for just about everyone. Employees have attempted to go to the head partner/owner as well as HR, but all complaints have fallen on deaf ears. The toxic partner has even bragged on some occasions that she doesn't fire anyone. All she has to do is make life a living hell for the person she targets and they eventually resign.

Early last year in the middle of a large case, my boss up and resigned. No two weeks notice. No thirty days notice. Nothing. Just walked into the head partner's office and said ""I quit."" The board eventually gave me management of financial analysis of the case and came out pretty successful, placing me under another capable person to manage me.

Last week, however, after dealing with Miss Toxicity in the middle of a leadership meeting, he too resigned without notice, leaving our department on the limb, the future of which to be discussed after the holidays. I spoke with him personally after he resigned and he told me that dealing with her has given him a host of health problems, including chronic ulcers and triggering migraine headaches.

A lot of people underneath me are scared that we will be mismanaged by said toxic partner and people fear that they will be the targets of her abuse until they too resign. I feel though that I am next on the pecking order. So I am currently looking for another position. Question: when asked by a hiring manager ""Why are you leaving your current position?"" should I mention the hostile work environment or would that be ""too whiny?""

187,"So here's my situation. It would mean the world to me just for anybody to read through it. So I'm 19 years old and attend a community college and am working towards my nursing degree. This college really lacks campus life since a majority of the classes are online and we just have a small population who attend in general. With this in mind, all my high school friends have left far away from my hometown to attend universities elsewhere. I am feeling somewhat sad and lonely atm because I wanted to get just a part-time job to meet some new friends and make some extra cash on the side. My parents however, did not approve of this even though I had pretty good grades (3.75 GPA). Part of their reasoning is because they had heard advisors simply not recommending people to work while obtaining their nursing degrees, as well as they think I just won't be able to handle both of them at the same time. However, I even had made a contract that said I would have to maintain a B+ in all my classes or else I would quit the job..... still rejected. So I'm looking to you guys for advice, I think i'm pretty well off physically and financially; but I feel as if I'm missing out on a lot of real world social aspects and situations I might encounter in the future. I also feel like my time is essentially wasted because I spend a good amount of time studying and achieving these good grades, yet find spare time that I feel could be put to good use such as... the part time work which would help me mentally and emotionally. So yeah just looking for your guys' opinion as to how to persuade them even more, or find a work around, like I said I think I have tiger parents so I'm not sure I can get through to them.
TLDR for the main gist: Attend community college, with not much campus life, mainly take online classes, high school friends moved away, parents won't allow me to work bc they think i cant handle the burden of doing both even though I've proven I can get good grades, feeling lonely and somewhat socially empty.

For me to try I get rejected. Who I am as a person isn’t good enough for a lot of people which is why I tell people I’m doing them a favor by not being more open.

In today’s world it’s rare you find a guy that wants to take you out which is a common thing I see with my friend. For all the attention they give her, no dinner dates, no going movies, they come and hang out, but they also get obsessive.

To start off, I'm a 23 year old female. I'm not a special person by any means, I don't believe anyone is, however I have been through experiences and come from a background that had shaped who I am today.  

I almost feel like giving up because absolutely nothing in my life has come easily. Every piece of my identity and every thing I have strived for has only caused me pain, suffering, and heartbreak. To begin:

-  I come from a conservative religious background. My family is of this nature. I went through a great deal of difficulty and pain leaving my religion and having my family figure out about it. It was one of the hardest things I had to figure out and deal with in my life. It is made worse by the fact that I feel the 20 years of my life before that brainwashed by my former religion were a complete waste. This isn't to mention the recurring mental issues I believe I still have as a result of it. 

I cannot come out as having left my former religion to my closest childhood friends because I will lose them if I reveal who I really am. I have to keep up appearances in my society and will never be able to freely speak out against what I believe to be an oppressive belief system, especially for women, if I want to keep my family and friends. This has resulted in me continually feeling suffocated, unable to express my true thoughts, and has given me a multitude of mental issues. What is one to do about this? 

- I come from a perpetually occupied country that is in a continuous state of war. It has no infrastructure, no money, no economy, nothing. I will never be able to return to it normally or travel through it freely, since there are numerous restrictions on those of my background to even enter the country. I have numerous relatives in jail and who have been killed because of these conditions. When I was a child I saw things a child should not ever see. How can I get over this? How can I get over never being able to live in my country or seeing it free? How can I change something that won't ever change? 

- The consequences of leaving my religion left me in a constant state of paranoia, depression, and anxiety throughout my last two years of college, so much so that I feel these years were wasted for me since I did not truly enjoy myself or live my life. I isolated myself to focus on my studies much of the time only to be able to finally graduate and gain my independence. I gained it and some success. I would say this is the most positive outcome that has come about from the past 3 years of my life. 

-  My dating and relationship life has never been a success. Even with some friendships also. Despite the fact that I am described as sociable, attractive, fun and successful by my dates and otherwise, none of it has never worked out for me. I made a bad decision getting involved with a certain man once, it was a 2 year thing, but it was never a real relationship and he treated me so badly. I never anticipated what was to happen with the 2 men I seriously dated after him: they were kind and decent men, but I didn't expect things to end the way they did at all. I've never gotten past 4 months in dating a man. All I get is men constantly hitting on me when I go out, so I can hardly go out alone anymore as it makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Men have harassed me to the point of depression, since I feel I will never come across a man that will take me seriously like a human being. The times I have, it always ended abruptly for reasons outside of my control. Perhaps it's due to my numerous ""issues"", but I can't change those about me. 

Overall, this is the gist and shortest summary I could write up of all I have experienced and am going through. I have no idea where to begin addressing them. I have too many hang ups and issues. While my experiences have made me stronger in many ways, some days I get extremely depressed and feel I cannot go on anymore. Nothing in my life has ever come easy. I have so much pain inside of me from all these issues combined. These are the things that I think of when alone that seriously cause me depression. The only thing that alleviates them is pursuing a few hobbies that act as a distraction, and going out and interacting with friends and others, but I live in an unfriendly city that isn't that open to strangers speaking to you. I don't fit into one box and feel I can't relate to many others I meet much of the time no matter how hard I try. I feel I don't belong in this society no matter how hard I have tried to adapt. I feel torn between this new culture I am in and my original one which ha resulted in multiple identity issues for me.

I've been married about one year. Before I got married I had slight bicurious feelings but never acted upon them. I've only ever slept with women. I did some experimenting with anal beads, butt plugs and a dildo, which I definitely enjoyed. Lately I've found myself masturbating to more gay, transgender, pegging and sissy porn. I fantasize about fucking and also getting fucked.  My wife and I have watched straight porn together but nothing too kinky or non-hetero. I'd love to get her involved, buy a strap on and let her bang me but I don't think she'd be receptive to this kink of mine. She's not very dominant (occasional spanking) but I'd like her to tie me down, gag my mouth and fuck my ass. Any advice about these feelings or how to broach this subject with my wife ???

207,"My Aunt died a year and a half ago, so calling him a ""recent"" widower is maybe a stretch, but her death remains the most recent upheaval in our extended family.

Some background: They had four adult children. All but one moved away prior to my Aunt's failing health. While they all returned temporarily, their jobs and lives are in other parts of the country. None live with or near their father currently.

My Uncle is extremely religious, and my Aunt's death has not shaken his faith (so far as anyone is aware). He sang in the church choir prior to his wife's death and continues to do so, but sometimes misses rehearsals or arrives late, isn't shaved or showered. He still lives in the house he shared with his wife, but isn't keeping it clean, isn't doing dishes or taking out trash, etc. He likewise isn't reliably keeping himself very clean.

Basically, it seems that he's having trouble taking care of himself, not due to physical limitations, but due to emotional/mental ones. The good news is that he's seeing a therapist weekly.

I want to help in his recovery, but I don't know the ""right"" way to do that, if there even is a right way. I'm also afraid of saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing and making things worse, but maybe that's an irrational fear.",27Dec2017,1

209,"My first semester of college was rough. I was sexually harassed continuously by several people, and stalked. I never reported these happenings though because I was afraid. I am still wary to tell anyone I know about it. I suffered a concussion early in the year, went through two benzo withdrawals, and was involved in a car accident that did serious damage to my back.

I started to fall behind in my classes, and depression made everything so much worse. I knew I was severely depressed. I was always on the verge of suicide and even made an attempt, but my roommate had come back early that night and I couldn’t carry through. I tried getting help. I went to the student counseling center several times but eventually the director told me not to come back unless I was going to kill myself. I went to the health center, explaining I needed something to help me through because the depression began to control my life. I reached out to my doctor and therapist but received little help, mostly due to the fact I was unwilling to truly open up.

Anyway, I failed three classes and passed the other three. I have been put on academic probation. My parents found out that I failed at least one class when they went through my mail and found the probation letter. There was a confrontation and a lot of yelling. My dad didn’t talk to me for three days, and my mom (as she’s said since I left for college) that if I fail, I will be kicked out of the house. She has said awful things about me on Facebook where the majority of my family can see as well as my own friends and coworkers, bosses. 

She demands to see my transcript. I don’t want to show her because I’m afraid of losing my home, and of my grades being posted on social media. I pay for my own schooling, and I feel it is ultimately my decision whether or not to reveal my grades. Also, I don’t trust her after what she has said about me, and that she has opened mail addressed to me (I am a legal adult). She’s made me a humiliation in my family, the way she presents me to my brothers at Christmas. I don’t feel she has earned the right to see my transcript (though I know that’s a bold statement for me about my own mother).

Fast forward another few months &amp; I found out that she was texting other guys. I confronted her, she lied to my face &amp; denied it.

I can’t find any motivation or interest at all to study like I can in most other subjects (even though I know it’s in my best interest to get a half-good grade to get into the uni I want), and most importantly when I go to start studying I just feel lost and don’t know where to start.

I would like to ask for your advice concerning an issue I have with a cyber stalker.

Someone I met online managed to hack into my computer, smartphone and router through sending me malicious email attachments which I naively opened.

I got rid of my router, smartphone and computer and went to my parents' house for vacation after that incident. While there, I was using my parents' home computer to connect to the internet. During that time, I received a phishing email with malicious PDF attachments, which I naively opened as well, only to realize that they were coming from the hacker days later, after noticing strange activity on my parents' devices.

I informed my parents that their devices were hacked because of me, but they shrugged it off and did nothing about it.

I went back to my house, got a new router and a new smartphone, only to find myself with a hacked device once again, after noticing strange activity on my smartphone. 

I have absolutely no idea how the hacker managed to access my devices another time. I'm thinking of going to the police, but I'm afraid that it won't do much, because the hacker is from a distant country,and I only have some basic information about him (first name, accounts, picture, ...).

223,"I graduated about 5 years ago with a BA in Finance from a state school. My current job pays well and I’m surprisingly good at it but it is not rewarding for me. I’ve always had interest in math and science and I’ve recently looked into returning to school for engineering. I tried it once when I first went to school but was an 18 y/o getting my first experience with freedom and alcohol abuse... needless to say it didn’t go well. I believe now I am mature enough to put in the work necessary to complete the degree but I have some questions on the logistics. 

Financially, I’m curious if anyone has experienced studying in a country where tuition fees are relatively low even for international students? I’m American and I’m sure you’ve heard a few horror stories surrounding the costs. I’ve read articles regarding a few countries that offer programs to international students at reasonable costs but I would love to hear from someone who actually did it. Looking for things like how to afford cost of living, finding a job, breaking language barriers (if applicable), etc... 

I’m also unsure which engineering discipline would work best for me (currently leaning computer engineering) so any insight from engineers about pros/cons of their particular field would be greatly appreciated.

At the beginning of the semester we didn’t even know each other but about half way through the semester, she moved seats in both classes close to me. In one of the classes right next to me and the other right in front of me. We started doing group project and shit together and talking more and getting to know each other. After finishing one of our finals we even walked around the campus together. She complained about being cold so I gave her my hoodie and she commented on how comfortable it was (it’s probably the least comfortable hoodie ever but it’s all I have) and then I walked her to her next class and even gave her a hug and told her that I’ll see her soon. By the end of the semester we were even planning to hang out just me and her over Christmas sometime.

I feel like it's because they are not really warm to me, they are polite but I don't feel like they really want to get to know me.

So when they invite my bf and I to eat with them for example, I know it's rude to refuse the invitation, but in my heart I feel so uncomfortable when I sit with them because I can't force myself to talk and I don't know what to say.

So I don't get any enjoyment out of it, and I really dread doing it. Like I feel like the only situation I could enjoy with them is if I got drunk or something and then I would not care about what they think of me and then I could speak (like Raj in Big Band Theory when he can only speak to girls when he is drunk....) and have fun.

My father is an ophthalmologist,and easy field of medicine and he basically does routine check ups and some routine operations and lasers.He did not guide me much during my youth and I spent all my time alone studying for school,doing nothing and after we bought a computer,playing video games.I basically wasted my entire youth in front of tv and computer screens.However was familiar with nature and animals which my father treated badly.
My school had no music or art classes and people here were obsessed about football which did not interest me and I was not very popular but I was doing ok socializing with people.My town was an intellectual bubble and most inhabitants do not speak English.


I learned to speak English when I was 13 and with frequent computer and internet use I became fluent 4 years later.I did not use the internet for educational purposes.I used the internet badly and was addicted to porn since I people here do not make relationships at these young ages and besides I had very low self esteem since my father put me down all the time.I do not play a musical instrument and do not drive.

When I failed and did not do well in the exams my father enrolled me in forestry.My father has a private office and evades tax and has a high number of clients since there are only three ophthalmologists here and people from nearby villages visit my town for medical treatment.

I am 22 years old at the moment.Time here is slowed down,the days are slow but the years go fast.I am depressed and lonely and hate my existence here.School and education here is horrible and my parents did not help me much because of ignorance.They also fed me a bad diet which I improved,I eat healthy now and work out.

I have a complete lack of direction.I always loved movies and wanted to direct and music but there were no teachers here and my parents did not sent me to any music school.I watch videos of people in music universities and I feel so bad for myself.

My environment is toxic in my family.My father only talks about money and wanted me to become a doctor like him and take over his office.I am sure that I failed him and I blame myself for every argument that happens in our house.My sister is doing a geology major.

In my university we do not do any actual work.I am only interested in wildlife.I do not think there is much future in that degree for me and everyone of my classmates wants to work for the government which is impossible here and they just delude themselves.
My degree is a 5 years masters one.I cannot find any information from my teachers of other people in my university and the future looks rather bleak.They tell us to go and study abroad and work in foreign countries but they speak vaguely and don't give us information over how this is going to be.Since I am reading online that people succeed in universities if they have a specific career plan I can see that I will fail since I do not have any plan or aspirations.

I think I am set up for failure.Only thing we do in our university is pass the examinations and we do not use any equipment or software.I also do not like it here very much.I am thinking of doing a post graduates degree in wildlife.


I even considered of going to a military school but I would have to give again the exams.I would simply choose to give theoretical subjects of languages,history,literature and latin,ancient greek which were subjects I were very good at.I failed when I was giving math,physics and chemistry.But I cannot join now since I am ver the age limit which is 21.However the army is in severe luck of funds and all they do is sit all day and watch TV and I am not exaggerating.

243,"Hello dear redditors,
First and foremost may I want to apologize for my bad English as English is not my first language. I am a Reddit fan for quite a long time and I can relate to a lot of redditors so much but never have I registered myself at Reddit. But today I have and I figured why not post my story here on Reddit and see what others think of it? As I have a lot of thoughts I don't know what do with it. I am a 25 year old female currently struggling at life. I don't even know where to begin as I have a thousand thoughts and regrets in my head all screaming and shouting and fighting for a place in my head. I just recently lost my dear loving dad from cancer. Seeing the cancer eat away my dad and being with him till has last breath has left me shattered. He was diagnosed on july 5th with stage 4 bile duct cancer and died on september 4th. As soon as he was diagnosed I didn't show up at work, told them I am taking my vacation. I had to, because my father was getting ill day by day and he needed our help and I was the only one (besides my dad) in the family with a car and drivers license. And boy it was needed. Appointments, picking up meds, rushing to the hospitals..because complications, my brother taking an overdose..again rushing to the hospital, I stayed a week in the hospital, picking up family from the airport, all wanted to see my dad..because he's not going to be longer here. Everyday was unsure. It was hell. My boss was not amused because I was six weeks gone from work. I had to work again, but then my father got more and more ill and I couldn't work, I was such a mess. So I just told my boss I can't work. Soon after that my dad died. It left me completely broken and I couldn't function for nearly three weeks until work kept calling me. When I showed up at work they were, again, NOT amused. They offered me their condolences but emphasized the fact that it was not done to not show up at work and as a full timer I have responsibilities. I had a big conversation with my manager and the boss about this. I understand their point completely but I didn't care as I was in so much pain about my father I wasn't behaving nor thinking rationally anymore. I cried during those conversations with my managers. Anyhow, fast forward three months and I am seriously failing at my work and this has been noticed by my manager. Haven't I forgot to say that I'm working their for almost three years completely hating my job (again poor life choice). This job is making me depressed but I can't quit because I need the money to pay for my masters at the university and to pay for my rhinoplasty (my nose is something I am terribly insecure about, and I'm finally going to do something about it). I had a last conversation with my manager basically him giving me two options: 1. getting fired If I'm not seriously going to improve my job (this gives me the right to unemployment money) 2. they help me find another job, but if I don't find another job within six month I have to resign (then I don't get unemployment money). I asked for a third option and that is a agreement which means I work for two months and I quit and still get unemployment money, but they declined.
In all honesty these are fair options. But the problem is I'm so tired of everything. I feel so tired. My crippling insecurities and anxiety which is a whole other story, the pain of losing my dad, the responsibilities and the regrets I have, the things I want to accomplish so badly, the job that is making me depressed. Everything is getting to me and I feel I can break down any moment. I can't quit the job because we need the money (I help my family out) but my job is making me so depressed I can't take it any longer but I don't have the strength to find another job. I just want to take some time off, to think, to grief, to sort my life out, figuring what I want to do. That is why I want that agreement  so bad, but they won't cooperate. There is so much more to my story but I will leave it at that. Dear redditors, what should I do? Honestly I just don't know what to do anymore. Just getting out of bed, putting this facade on and go to my job is taking up so much energy. ",27Dec2017,1
244,"Hey everyone,
i’m a 22 year old guy from Australia, strong introvert. I’ve recently started working a fulltime office job and ever since then I’ve been finding it harder and harder to have my alone time and properly recharge. 

The office is open plan and although I’m not on the phones (thankfully my work is mostly emailing and admin) a lot of people on my floor are so it’s always noisy and very stimulating. I have a 1-1.5h commute each way where I have time to be alone and just read or listen to music. 

I live with my family - my parents and two younger brothers (18 and 11), and apart from the 18 y/o (ambivert) they don’t understand the concept of quiet or personal space. Pretty much from the minute I’m home my youngest brother is clinging to me, asking me to play this and that. My parents spoilt him so it’s tough for me to say no without him sulking and then me being guilted into playing with him. I mean I enjoy playing with him, I just need my own personal space and quiet time as well. 

But essentially I don’t get that. I’d like nothing more than to be alone from like 9:30 till I sleep but it’s school holidays until the start of Feb so my brother doesn’t have a bedtime so he wanders into my room and sits with me. I want to eg read or watch a TV show but i can’t do that with him sitting next to me on my bed and pretty much waiting for attention. When I ignore him and do my own thing I feel awful as well because he’s a sweet kid and we have a good relationship and I don’t want to ruin that. He sleeps in my room on my double bed as well because he likes my bed lol. 

I used to have early mornings to myself before work since I have to leave really early, but I start half an hour later now so even this morning my peace was shattered while I was having breakfast because both my parents were awake and joking and asking questions and ughhhh

I’ve worked fulltime before, did it for a year in another city and found I was able to have my own space at home after work because everyone else at home worked fulltime and understood personal space etc, and I could disappear on hikes on the weekend without my helicopter parents freaking out because they wouldn’t know haha but I can’t do that now that I’ve moved cities and moved back home because my parents essentially treat me like I’m 12 and give me no space lol. To the point of eg coming into my room at 5:30am without knocking to check if I’m awake for work. I think added to my distress at home is this discomfort that my parents aren’t really that ok with me being gay so even though I’m out to everyone I still feel a certain pressure or feeling of being confined — when I was in that other city I didn’t have to hide the fact that for example when I didn’t come home for dinner I was on a date and I could talk about the guys I was seeing, but can’t really do that anymore lol. 

I’d like to move out but would feel more secure doing that in 3-4 months when I have savings to fall back on and have made it through probation at work (I’ve been doing well but still...just in case). But looking for any other advice or suggestions on how I can recharge and have some alone time and space in this situation (:

Thanks so much!",27Dec2017,1
245,"Hi all,

I'm having trouble putting an unrequited love behind me, or, kind of. Years ago, I had strong feelings for a guy I went to school with. I, also being a guy, was hesitant to tell him. Eventually I did so, and while he did not return my feelings, he was supportive of me and remained my friend. I struggled with this for a while. We spent a week or so together over New Years back then, which lead to me actually ""coming out"" in general, and he was supportive of that.

I was in a deep depression throughout this time, because despite his support, something in my head kept insisting that he disliked me, or was only putting up with me, or something. I know that, in that unhealthy state, I put a lot of pressure on him.

This was years ago, and in that time we've spoken sparingly. Both of us have our own lives that have taken us away from home. Yet, I still think of him very often. Not obsessively as I used to, and not to the point of making myself sad or depressed, but fleeting thoughts. I had largely stopped communicating to him as a measure to encourage my own healing - and I think that has been helpful. I hadn't heard from him since middle of 2016 (he is military).

In the time since, I have developed a lot of self supportive skills to interrupt negative thinking and cope better. I am calmer, more confident, and I am not sad or depressed. These changes were noticed among friends, family, and in my career where I received promotions until a while back when I had the opportunity to pursue other job and educational opportunities and continue to grow.

I returned to my hometown for the holidays, and all was fine. I tend to get a little vulnerable around New Years, as my mind does drift to the fun times I shared with my friend then - but nothing uncontrollable. This morning, as I was preparing to return to my life away from the hometown, I stopped in the DMV to get a new sticker for my registration.

Who was at the counter of the DMV? My friend, from years ago. He said hi and asked how I was doing - but I felt like I had fallen through myself. I felt fearful and ashamed of myself for being in front of him. I returned his hi and said ""not too bad"" but had already turned to sit in the waiting area out of his sight. I fled from him.

I sat in the waiting area until he left. I came home at once, threw everything in the car, and got on the road back to where I live now. Years ago, something like this would have sent me into a real tailspin. That isn't happening now - but I am having trouble processing my emotions.

I feel ashamed for being in front of him, he scares me. I think I am ashamed of how clingy I had been years ago. I'm not the same person I was back then, but it felt as though every new development had melted away on sight.

It is a friendship that I would like to repair - though I suspect the damage is wholly in my head. I long ago accepted that what I wanted years ago isn't going to happen. I was surprised at myself today, and now I am frustrated at my behavior towards him as rude or cowardly. I appreciate how he supported me when I needed it, and I've never been able to thank him for that. We have had nice brief conversations in the years since, but we don't reach out to speak to one another. Today was the first time I had seen him in person in probably three or four years. It jarred me terribly.

Can anyone offer me advice on how to cope with these emotions? I have wanted to thank him for his support long ago, but I feel bringing up those times would be uncomfortable for both of us. I am at a loss over how to process this, and any suggestions would be appreciated. I'm sorry this is so long - in a way writing it out also helps me.",27Dec2017,1

253,"We played in the same fantasy football league. I won but he finished last so there wasn't any reason for resentment. I simply was making conversation watching tv. Normally we never sit in the same room watching tv and there's usually a weird vibe when we do. To ease the tension I asked about getting the money from my friend (who we both know) who is in charge of it and he said ""don't ask me"" in a super defensive tone. I said ""I was just asking"" and he got even more defensive saying ""well that's my answer!"" and eventually stormed off really upset.

We don't talk much and we're both going through hard times trying to figure out our lives but I don't know where this hostility is coming from. We all celebrated Christmas like everything was normal and now this?  I can think of a few things that he's mad at: not having the tv to himself, jealous of my fantasy win, or some other resentment that he doesn't share.

254,"Last year someone bought property next to my home and put in an unlicensed marijuana dispensary and grow op in a residential area. Because I live on a First Nations reserve (Canada) the authorities can't/won't do anything about the operations. 

I am young and inherited the property with my younger siblings when my mom died. None of us have any money and this guy has let his work crews trespass all over our property and intimidate my sister, and also encroached on .4 acre with his industrial fence and parking lot. He also clear cut some trees and has damaged trees and trails in our woods. 

He's super scary (he's done ~20 years in federal prison) and he's made tons of money selling pot. He's been trying to settle under the table for a really low amount that won't cover the necessary legal costs/professional services to sever the encroachment. 

We sent a response to his initial offer and one of his employees threatened to sue us for defamation. A few days later another community member came and tried to manipulate us into rescinding our letter and accepting his deal. She told us this guy had cancer (our mom died of cancer) and imagine having to deal with our crap on top of chemo and feeling sick etc. I almost felt like I had wronged him after the conversation. 

I'm scared that we'll be forced to litigate or settle for less than the intimidation and damages are worth.  I have a lawyer, but we've already paid $1000 for legal services and I don't feel we're close to a resolution. I guess I'm looking for advice - is there anything else that we can do? I just know he can afford to stall and make this cost a bunch for us. ",27Dec2017,2

Unfortunately most coffee communities I have found including here on reddit they understandably prohibit self promotion unless you are actively discussing in those communities.

257,"I work for one of the largest public school districts in the US as a secondary teacher. I’ve been teacher for almost 10 years, at two schools. 

At my first school, I had two coworkers, I’ll call them Mr. Murray and Mr. Showers (married man) who taught French and Science respectively. Both of these teachers were very popular and well liked amongst students. Mr. Murray was the soft ball coach, frequently hosted students in his room during lunch and sometimes even drove them home from school. Mr. Showers was the “big teddy bear,” always hugging female students in the hallways (sometimes the same student multiple times a day), having impromptu pizza parties, tutoring late into the evening after school, friending students on Facebook. Were these things again the rules? Yes.

At the end of my first year at that school, rumors started to swirl about Mr. Murray and another student who had just graduated that year from the school. Apparently, other students had seen him over the summer parked outside of the former students house (we’ll call her Charlene). Charlene was telling people that they were dating, and a few months down the line there were even rumors of her being pregnant. Mr. Murray was someone whom I considered a friend and I didn’t believe that he would be involved in something like this. I confronted him with the rumors a few times and he, of course, said they were false. I believed my “friend,” and shut down the rumors anytime I heard them. 

Well, come to find out, the rumors were true. Mr. Murray was in fact dating and having a baby by the same student he had taught and coached the year prior. They’re now allegedly engaged and have TWO children together. He resigned before he was fired. We’ll get back to him in a moment... 

Fast forward one year later. Mr. Showers was no longer working at the school, he’d moved somewhere else. The new school was looking for another science teacher... he let me know, I applied and got the job. We were coworkers once again. We had a year of uninterrupted schooling, no drama no issues. 

That following summer, I met with a former student from the school we’d first worked at together. Long story short, she told me that from the moment she graduated, he had been soliciting her for sex. Sending her messages on Facebook requesting very... weird favors, sending “special packages,” etc. She also told me that she was not the only one he had done this to. I was shocked, and all the hugging in the hallway started to make sense. 

To make a very, very long story short, I told my principal but there was nothing that she could do since the girls were over 18 and had all graduated. I left it at that. But then, he did it again, with another student from our current school to the point where he girl felt harassed. There was an investigation (in which I did minimally participate) and he was fired - well, he resigned before he was fired. 

The other day I got on google and saw that both Mr. Murray and Mr. Showers are employed at a charter school in the same city. I was shocked, honestly, I mean what are the chances. Charter schools clearly don’t do their research, but then again, they both resigned before anything was on their “permanent record.” And to be fair, these “relationships” did not become inappropriate until after the girls had graduated (but I mean, let’s be real here, it started at school). 

As a teacher, I feel like it is my absolute duty to protect all students - period. And it disturbs me that they saw these children whom they taught, children who looked up to them and respected them as an adult, as sexual objects. 

Here is my question: should I say or do anything else? If so, what? Or should I just leave it alone and move on? ",27Dec2017,2

I passed my driving test a while ago, and I was excited but now I realise my learning starts here. It's frustrating. I am worried about getting points and fines, even though I keep to the speed limit, and I don't go over red lights.

My Father is getting older, and I want to help provide for him and be strong for his sake, as cliche as that sounds. But deep down, the harder I work, admittedly I want to work to help myself also.

Especially over Christmas, where it seems everyone just wants an excuse to be lazy, but I am really keen to get going.

268,"I started dating my ex-gf during the middle of college - I was a Junior and she was a Senior. What started out as a fling turned into a fairly serious relationship and by the time she graduated, we decided to continue the relationship even though it would be long-distance. We continued our long-distance relationship for 2 years as we were in seperate cities but instead of one of us moving to each other cities, we both decided to completely change our jobs and meet in a new city. Once we moved, everything was great and we didn't have any major fights or anything of that sort. We both developed new interests and we were overall happy together. I broke up with her 8 months after we both moved to the same city, the circumstances I will describe below. 

Rewind to back when I was a junior in college. During this time, just as I had started dating my Ex, I had also started flirting with another girl who was also in another city. We both had very strong connection and the flirting lasted 1-2 months via text and Snapchat. Eventually, I started to feel very bad about doing this so I stopped messaging her in the cold and explained to her that I was in a relationship and this wasn't right. I felt like a complete ass at the time. 1 year ago, we both saw each other and then we started talking again but not in a flirting way - I made sure that if we were to continue to have any sort of relationship then it would be as a friendship. Over time though, the feelings started to creep back in and the connection felt extremely strong, so strong that I started to doubt my current relationship. I asked myself that ""if I feel so strongly about this girl, then surely my current gf couldn't be the one even though we rarely got into fights and were happy together"". None the less, I took the plunge and broke up with her thinking that I would be happy with this other girl, even though I would need to restart a long-distance relationship. 

Fast forward to present time and it has been ~9 months since I've broken up with my ex. We haven't talked since. While at first, I thoroughly enjoyed the honeymoon period with my new gf, we are now in a state where we get into serious fights every 1-2 weeks (something that never happened with my ex). I've started to think that I made a terrible decision and should try to reconcile with my ex. I've talked to my current gf about my thoughts of my ex and she told me that it isn't fair to her if I'm thinking about her. In response, she rightfully told me that this isn't fair for her and that if I truly feel for my ex, then we should break up and I should try to reconcile. I'm trying not to make another impulsive decision so I told her that that's not what I want to do and that I really just want to get stronger. 

I also just generally feel like a terrible person for not being more sure with myself and what I wanted, which ended up hurting my ex and potentially hurting my current gf. 

Any advice on what I should do or think about? I feel like I can't really talk to anyone about this as no one really understands how I feel so anything input from this community would be helpful!

I was on waiting duty, serving. I got off shift in 15 min and a burger came through that was gonna be thrown out, I said I'd eat it so don't throw it. As I was clearing plates, I ate some of the food as I walked past it with 5-10mins of my shift to go. 


The kitchen manager reported me, I didn't even know this was something I wasn't allowed to do within the kitchen. She just went straight to my manager instead of warning me it was forbidden.


 I was told I'd get a disciplinary next time. Now I'm scared to go back into work, scared of losing my job and scared of my boss knowing. I feel like any tiny mistake from now on is gonna make me look unfit for employment and I'll be terminated.

He's leaving to study abroad within the next week and I'm worried that I'll miss my opportunity to.

279,"New user. Mobile. Just here for advice. Tl;Dr at bottom

My boyfriend is obsessed with cars. And not like nice, flashy cars either. The more beat up and run down they are, the more he obsesses over them. Lately its been all about the Mazda rx7, before it was a geo metro, oh and the Mitsubishi lancer, can't forget about the ford, Toyota and Subaru too.

The catch is, if they're reliable he doesn't want them. His last Mazda which he was forced to sell (he needed a running car for work, go figure!) was a piece of garbage that I had the pleasure of haggling for, read sarcastically. $1000 down the drain and I saw no improvement with the car. Only continued deterioration. To the point where the car didnt even run. He just posted pictures of it on Instagram.

I'm not trying to be that girlfriend. Im really not. But there comes a point where your relationship and the future of your relationship should come first. We've been together for coming on four and a half years. Known eachother for almost eight. I'm madly in love with the dingus but it seems like this may be the final straw.

Before we started dating, his mom passed and hes recently been given a decent sum of money. Money that could easily be applied to our future but he is 'jokingly but also unjokingly' talking cars again. I know just as well as the next woman tired of project cars, that hes going to throw all of this money away on ""one more radiator"" and frankly, I'm not sure I can handle it all over again. I understand that in the end this is his money, but after struggling as a young couple to suddenly having an awesome opportunity thrust at us... Its hard to look him in the face when he talks about cars. This isn't just free money from the sky... This is a once in a lifetime chance to get ourselves straight and I dont think I can stand it if its all thrown away.

I don't want him to see me as overbearing or like a killjoy but at his age he should know what's important - and if ANOTHER car is what's important then I feel there's no room for us.

Am I being unreasonable? If so, then I already know what I need to do.
If not, how can I discuss this with him more without sounding like a nagging mom?
I don't want to just take all this money from him, since I really have no right in the first place, but I desperately want it to go towards our future together instead of to a car I know won't be around in 2 years.

Tl;dr: my boyfriend came into a bit of money, talks about getting another car. I'm over it. I either want him to invest it smartly or I want out of the relationship. I don't know how to talk to him about it.",27Dec2017,1

281,"i can't trust my friends and family's judgement since they're thinking for me and it is biased, i need to get some outsiders' opinions. i hope you'll be able to give me your honest opinion on my dilemma. this is going to be really long, i apologize, my thoughts are extremely scattered atm. my ex-boyfriend was and is very suicidal. we knew each other before, we played in the same band but didn't know a lot ab each other. we only started becoming close friends when he left to canada to study. he was gonna kill himself in canada, and back then, i managed to convince him to wait until he comes back and i'll try and help him. we started dating when he came back, i thought i was in love and i could help him somehow but as time passes, i fell out of love with him and was just emotionally drained in general. i still care about him, so we kept talking after we broke up, maybe that wasn't a good idea since he is in love with me and i'm giving him some kind of hope. i just wanted to be friends with him, but he kept saying we can't be friends, so eventually i just gave up and we got back tgt again (i asked him out), i thought i could just try to love him since he's a nice person deep down and we get along (i thought it might made him happier, have something to look forward to, i don't know..), he has said many times that if it wasn't for me he would have killed himself. he said he has nothing to lose anyways so he accepted my offer. that didn't work out, i broke it off with him again a few months in when he went back to canada (part of it was because i can't do long distance relationship too). and again we still maintained contact because i don't want him to kill himself, and he's got no one other than me, literally. he loves his mom but because they're so different, they always fight about everything. he doesn't talk to his dad and brother. his best friend blocked him, he doesn't maintain contact with any of his former high school friends, and he says he doesn't trust anyone (but me) nor rly consider anyone his friend. he had stopped going to university completely and just stay at home without talking to anyone but me online. we had mutual friends but when i see them and asked if they still talk to him, they said no, because he was too negative, they all said they're living a happier life without contacting him, which i find horrible at the time and felt very angry... but, i turned out to be the same. these few days we've been constantly having small arguments, he says he can't trust me anymore and he feels like i'm toying him, he says i'm distancing myself (which i guess i was since i don't want him to like me or for him to get the wrong idea while still keeping contact with him), he told me i don't understand the fact that he wants to kill himself everyday. i felt so awful, i didn't know what to do. i told him he really need to get professional help, therapists payed thousands of dollars to study years in schools just to be able to work with people and i'm happy to help him with the process, but he refuses to, he says the only person he wants to talk to is me and he can't trust a stranger. he says he feels like i betrayed and abandoned him since i've said all those things while we were dating like i'll be there for him and now i can't keep my promises. which he is right. i shouldn't have said those things so lightly. i know that's extremely selfish of me but i have no romantic feelings for him anymore. after those arguments, we spent a few days thinking and i've come to think that i definitely do not want him to kill himself, and he haven't got anyone else but me, so i texted him and told him what i thought, he said he can't live without me, so we agreed to keep contact, and i said i'll try to stop distancing myself, and be as natural and ""normal"" as possible. it was alright for a few days, but then yesterday i followed a guy i used to like on instagram which is also a person that he despises, and he talked to me about him before. it pissed him off that i disregard all the bad things about he had told me about the guy i used to like that at the time i acknowledged and listened to him, but now i prove to him that i lied to him since i still want to follow the other guy. that sets me off too and i had a rage saying that i'm sick of him analyzing every single thing i do, i'm sick of him stalking me on every social media (he admitted that he does that), that i can do whatever i want, and it's none of his business, in anger i just said i don't want to contact him anymore because i'm spent and i have no feelings for him anymore and nothing matters. after fighting for a while and everything sort of were settling down i was telling him i'm a rotten person deep down and just because he thinks i'm better than the rest i'm really not, and i suggest him blaming me for making everything worse than it should've been (because i truly believe so, i deeply regret what i've done to him, and my mindset that what i was doing was the best was fucked up), only to leave him in the end like everyone else, he says he knows all of those bad things ab me and he still think i'm less rotten than them, then he finally says alright, thank you for giving me the feeling of hope, etc. and blocked me right away. it's been a day from that now and even though i don't love him anymore, i can't stop thinking about if what i did was the right thing or not, what if he kills himself and i was the one capable of stopping it but i'm just too selfish to just try conversing with him for a while until he can come back home. right now i still can't believe i actually said that, i've always thought about stop contacting him one day but never thought that i would actually do it. i left him when he needs me the most... but at the same time i have no feelings for him anymore. i was thinking of going to his house (his parent's house here, not in canada) and actually telling his mom about his condition, maybe she'll listen, he wouldn't want me doing that, but even if i don't talk to him anymore i don't want him to die and maybe she could do something about it. anyways that's besides the point. i'm sorry that this is extremely long, my thoughts are all over the place. do you think what i did was wrong? please tell me if it really is, i really, really need to know, because this will be the biggest mistake i'll ever make if what i did is truly not the brightest, i know i am extremely selfish but i could've tried harder... personally, i can't trust my own judgement but this heavy, heavy guilt i'm feeling must say something. thank you for taking out the time to read this. have a great day.

293,"Ok so for some basic background on my current situation, i'm 19. I just recently graduated from high school this past year. When i graduated I almost immediately joined the military but that ended up not working out for me.  I've lived in Indiana for the past 10 or so years with my mom and step father, but always wanted to move back to my home state of California which i did in October. Before I moved here, my step mom advised me that, when i move in with them, she doesn't expect me to just sit around and do nothing and basically just mooch off of them, that i'm going to go to college, get a job, etc. Which is completely 100% reasonable and understandable.

 Since I've gotten here, I've gotten a pretty good job at a high end dentist office, albeit it was because of my step mom (she works there and has a lot of pull). I absolutely love the job, so much so that i plan on going to school in the near future to become a dental hygienist. The thing is she doesn't want me to just work, she wants me to go straight to college so i can get a better job than just being an assistant. So she took the initiative to tell my boss that i'm quitting this week and starting school, which isn't true at all. I haven't even signed up for any classes yet. The only reason i haven't even started school yet is because i'm not mentally or financially prepared to make that step in my life. She's telling me that i can just sign up for FAFSA and that cover it and I wont have to worry about anything, but i'm still going to need money for things other than school (Phone bill, helping pay rent, etc.).

 What I want to do is just work for about a year or so that I can save some money, and once I have it saved, I can comfortably start school with a bit of money saved up. Her problem with this, is that she thinks i'm gonna get comfortable and lazy, not wanna leave my comfort zone, and then not want to go to school after a year of working. The thing that pisses me off the most about this is that she's assuming this purely on the fact that these are things my dad has done, and since i'm his son, i'm probably gonna do it too. I know i'm not going to do this because I've done the whole 'work for a year then leave my comfort zone for the greater good' thing before when I left my old job for the military. I had been working at that old job for almost 2 years and loved that job more than I love my current job. The people i worked with there were like a second family to me, but I left that job because I knew I wouldn't get anywhere staying there. So, like I said before, I moved on for the greater good. Now i'm in the same situation, but she doesn't think i'm going to go through with it so shes forcing me to do things her way even though i'm not ready for it yet. 

I need any kind of advice you can provide for my situation, because frankly, I don't know how to even handle this. I don't want to come off as ungrateful because i honestly am not and i know she means well, but I need her to understand that I know what i'm doing and that she needs to trust me. ",27Dec2017,1
294,"For anyone who reads this,
I am using gaming as the way to describe my issues, please understand that this is just the easiest example I can think of to explain my problems.

I have been playing an MMORPG, I love these games because they appeal to obsessive behavior (I can grind for hours) and they have a nice social aspect so I can meet and talk with many like minded individuals. My problem is that I find myself overly obsessive with what others are doing, I feel jealous of the fact that they have certain things that I don't or that they have extra time to play when I don't. I find myself thinking to myself that if only I could be that lucky, or have that kind of help. I know this is shitty behavior and that I am just a petty person. 
I have some friends who say just don't be obsessive about what others are doing and just enjoy your time, but I think about it and whenever that I try to do something of that sort I just lose interest. It sounds weird to say this out loud, but I feel that when I am not obsessive over something I find no reason to continue it at all. In this case when I try to let go of what others are doing and focus on just myself, I either swing back towards my old behaviors or I slowly lose interest in the game.

There's not much to really take pride in my work, I just clean rooms. However, lately my boss has been very toxic towards her coworkers, so much that she's being passive aggressive towards us and berating our work. It's... belittling and it can effect us on getting the job done quickly.

Today, she told us a room got a complaint that it wasn't dusted properly that it was our group who did that room that day. One of the girls stepped up and said she simply forgot and that she's sorry. That wasn't enough for my boss and other than punishing her, she's punishing the whole group... now all 3 of us are being put back into training to learn how to properly clean a room.

It was my first job and I absolutely loved it and my coworkers. We were like one big family. I finally had a place where I felt safe and happy. 

I’m having a tough time at home right now too. My Christmas was awful do to my grandma getting really drunk on Christmas Eve and just feeling like I didn’t belong on Christmas Day. I just feel like I don’t belong anymore. Whenever I say something someone always has to make me feel stupid or make a comment about what I said. 

On Christmas Eve, my cousin, aunt, and I went to the store to grab a few last minute things for dinner. Now, my aunt is never really around at all, and I don’t really like to call her my aunt. She’s only ever around to get something out of someone like money to gamble. She doesn’t even live with my uncle and cousins but they are legally married. (My cousins are both 18+) She lives with friends from work. So, I don’t really like her. Anyways, we were checking out at the store and she didn’t like how I loaded the cart so she said “you don’t do it like that!” And took everything out and rearranged it. Then she proceeded to tell me that I’m never going to get a job anywhere, not even at a grocery store. (This was 5 Days after I found out about loosing my job that I absolutely loved) 

Everyone just makes me feel so shitty. On top of that, I am questioning my sexuality and my parents aren’t supportive of the LGBT community so it makes me very stress and nervous. The girl I like is straight and is now dating a guy that I happen to know. He’s a really nice guy and I’m supportive of them. I️ just can’t seem to let go of my feelings for her which sucks. I’m happy she’s happy and I want the best for her. I just really like her.

I have absolutely no idea what to do. I don’t want to be miserable the rest of my holiday break, but I’m finding it hard to be happy right now. And I feel like I really missed out on the holidays. I love Christmas and of course it only comes once a year. I feel like it was just a waste this year.. I don’t know what to do.
