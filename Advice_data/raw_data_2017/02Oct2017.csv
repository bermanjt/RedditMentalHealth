2,"So there is this girl I met about 4 years ago. I've tried to go out of my way to make sure I'm not in the friend zone. Want to get that out of the way. I know because we have mutual friends and things are different between them verses me between her.... sorry if that was confusing. Any way we're not close in the sense that we talk 24/7 and we are like brother and sister and blah blah blah. I'm a Christian and I met her at church. She is beautiful and guys hit on her all the time but she isn't interested in any of them. I spoke with a fee of her friends and found out that she is the kind of girl to consider dating someone only after they have become friends. So I decided to wait and become friends with her. I also had some stuff I was working on myself. Including confidence. During this waiting period also figured out that family is THE most important thing to her so I became good friends with her brother and got to know her family how ever I could I.E. go with them to a concert once, and I help volunteer at there Hispanic church on Wednesdays. Well I've now let this whole process drag on for 3.5 years and I'm at the end of my rope. I need to just talk to her and move on with us or move on with me. I had 1 Girlfriend in the past 4 years and my heart wasn't in it because I was caught up in this other girl. That relationship only lasted 4 months. I'm not sure how to even prompt this conversation or exactly what I would say. Help.

Also I apologize for being all over the place. Not exactly focused ATM

TL;DR.  Need to tell a girl I like her and it's been 3.5 years and I'm not sure how to do it or what to say.",02Oct2017,1
3,"I am 28 years old and I currently live with 2 friends (We'll call them Nick and Larry) and my sister, all around the same age. When I was moving I convinced Larry to move with us since he was still living at home and he could really use some time out of the bubble of his parents house. We've lived together in this house for about 3 and a half years. The house has its problems, mainly some wiring issues where the fuses blow if you have 2 appliances on in the kitchen or if you have 2 ac units running upstairs for example. And that my room is barely bigger than a jail cell.

In July I applied to transfer to DC from Philly, since the company I work for was expanding into that area. I always had thoughts of going to another town and re-establishing myself by...myself. I love my family and friends but I always had this want to strike out on my own. So fast forward a few weeks and I find out that I was accepted. It would be before the end of the year and more info would be given relatively soon. I go home and find out that Nick and Larry really had it out. They always just tolerated each other but it worked for so long it was never an issue. So I get home to find out that Nick declared that he is leaving and expects to be out by the end of the summer and that we should all ""Get our finances in order"". I asked if there was any reconciling this and he said no. So I had to go and email my bosses and pull my application and tell them I could no longer do it. I going to have a hard time saving for DC and paying bills as it was, but throw moving to a temporary place until december and it just wasn't something I could handle. 

When I spoke to Nick and told him what I did, he totally changed his tune and was saying that there wasn't a deadline and that we all just need to save so we can all move and go our separate ways. I told him that I had to turn the offer down and he acted as if it was the first time he heard about it. 

As far as going our separate ways, I can't. My sister is probably going to move in with her SO, and Larry doesn't make enough to live on his own. I feel trapped and guilty since I convinced him to move out with us in the first place. I want to move out on my own and have my own space. I want to get up and get coffee or do laundry or have lunch without being engaged from all sides. 

Not sure what to do.

TLDR: Convinced friend to move out of his parents, 3 years later he doesn't have the means to support himself, housing situation fell apart and I want to move out on my own but feel guilty.",02Oct2017,3
6,"Hello, so I have commented here as I am a shy/anxious junior in high school with social anxiety, so like I got rid of the crap on my face. I'm worried if others will say, like I did last year and this white girl named Emma said and yelled""Holy shit you shaved!"" and everyone was looking at me. I don't want anyone to find out I shaved, and I unwanted facial hair I have bits of it, I don't want it to fucking grow, I hate how I look, I didn't ask for this shit on my face. Just because I'm ""growing up"" doesn't mean I want it, and a lot of people my age don't have this crap. They're gonna be like ""you look different."" I get so nervous because of that. How do I stop this fucking growth? It's insane, my dad told me to shave once every week to prevent the hair from growing. I want it to stop, so I can stop it makes me uncomfortable, I literally don't want this, please. I'm a south asian-Pakstani. I got into a huge feud with my parents and i cried a lot and my mom said"" people who cry are like 4 year old kids like your cousin yunus"" ""you put all the stress on yourself, and it is your fault"" i told her to respect my boundaries, and ill respect yours i shaved and so she got mad and said ""don't hide your blanket"" i was going to put it away anyways downstairs but i told her about my self harming problem and how you told me i ""joke about suicide"" and other past stuff she assumed i was ""joking about"" and she said ""i'm sorry i didn't realize that, i don't know what i said suicide is a joke, and you're not alone i used to have suicidal thoughts myself"" i cut myself so hard because i was sad i'm sorry i broke it i suck ass and anyhoo, when i was driving she told me that"" she got fired from her davis job, and she's been trying to find a job for 7 years, and i do care about you, i tell you about religion because it helps me, and allah will help everyone and everyone will go back to him, i believed in allah"" ""allah knows our strengths and weaknesses, and please don't suffocate yourself with a pillow, i put the blame on you because you want it to be, i'm not giving you pity, attention"" i'm fucking tired man i was screaming/crying at her and my dad came in the closest and told my mom to ""leave me alone let him calm down"" i said i ""ruined things, and clearly you guys don't love me and care about me, i self harm(shows my cuts) and i tried to suffocate myself with a pillow, i feel like this is all my fault and i'm alone"" she got all shocked i told her i might plan to go to ditch school tomorrow or at least a few days and she told me ""not to, have faith in allah he will help you"" i told her"" i don't believe in god, and i hate religion"" and she said ""i used to think that too, and when i had faith in allah he helped solve my problem while allah did have let out the bad devil, he does good and you know how you write in a journal on about how stressed you are? you should do it""",02Oct2017,2
7,"So I'm interested in buying quite a rare car, the location of which is a 3 and a half hour drive from where I live. The add recently had a price drop from 18000 to 16000 which is more in my price range. I called the seller and he had some news that put me off a bit. The car is under finance. 18000 owed on in. I told him that kind of put me off but he assured me that I would pay his finance company the 16000 and he would put in the rest.

10,"I Live at my dad's house with my stepbrother. Our bedrooms are right next to each other.

A little back story. I'm 29, have been in a happy and committed relationship for over 4 years.
My stepbrother is 27 and just recently knocked up his new GF of ~6 months. She is 21, already has one child ~2-3 years old, and they have decided to keep this second child.

Lately, I have been hearing them arguing in their room, and from what I've been able to pick up from their *very loud* arguments, it involves my stepbrother feeling the need to check his GFs phone and what sounds like he doesn't trust his new GF.
Beyond that, I actually have no idea what the situation/circumstance is, but it definitely sounds like the root of their problem is strong issues of trust and control.

When it comes to dealing with people, I consider myself very saavy and capable of working through social problems, or at the very least understanding what is going on. On one hand, I feel like I should go up to them and try to help them resolve their problem, but on the other hand it's their own problem and really none of my business, just that I have to be listening to it lately.

It's concerning that this girl is very young and is having a second child to a man she's only been dating for half a year. If the relationship is already tearing at the seam this early, it doesn't seem to bode well for the future of her and her children, which I'm more concerned about being a person raised by only parents myself.

Should I just continue to keep my mouth shut and let their life play out through their own mistakes, or should I try and help them resolve their relationship issue?",02Oct2017,1
13,"I've never used Reddit &amp; therefore have never posted something, but I could really use a sense of community right now and giving this a shot came to mind. 

I'm really struggling with my anxiety. Sure, everyone gets anxiety from time to time, but it's been a constant uphill battle for as long as I can remember. My parents are against medication (understandable but long story as to why) but I just don't know what else to do. The symptoms are there -- I'm an extreme worrier with intense hypochondriac moments, I'm constantly very negative and always thinking the worst will happen, and minor things like texting my land lord telling him my check will be a day late as I'm sick and he responds saying it's fine but then I don't know if it truly is fine and I need someone else to validate my feelings, etc... I guess what I'm asking is... how do I get my life back? I constantly need validation from others. I have a demanding job that I love and am good at, but at the end of the day I have no energy to do anything else. I come home, watch TV, go to bed. It's affecting my relationships, the way I interact with others. I live far away from home and from those close to me. I've never felt so alone these past few years and I don't know how to overcome it. I've tried getting back into playing music, coloring, running, everything. I would try therapy but i don't believe my insurance will cover it.

19,"I was adopted two weeks old by my father. My mother abandoned me as a child though I visited her sporadically through my adolescence. For the past 20 years its been my dad and I.

When my dad was a child in the 1960s, he had two other siblings and a dedicated mother. My dads father  left the family picture while the kids were infants. Growing up my dad worked for everything he had so he could make the best of the situation for being gay.

29 years later and my dads father came back in the picture after starting a new life in Texas with his male lover. He disappeared from my dads family picture because he was gay. Its inexcusable for ditching family like that. 

My granddad, my dads father, passed away the same month I was born in so I wasn't able to meet him.

20,"It sounds juvenile or whatever, but before I got into a relationship I was constantly receiving attention. I would post a lot on social media, go out to bars almost every week, talk to random strangers all the time, etc. Now I don't post selfies or go out much unless I'm with my SO, who is a quiet and not very sociable person. When I'm with him, people don't seem to want to talk to me as much though. I don't engage with other guys or post pictures of myself out of respect for the relationship too.

Because of this I've noticed a considerable drop in the amount of attention I get. Sometimes I feel invisible, weird, hideous, insecure in general. I know it's not good in general to depend on other people for my self worth, but it's been playing tricks on my mind. I feel less confident and less socially skilled and also less attractive.

21,"A year ago, my parents forced me to sleep down in the basement, as a punishment. The basement has no door.  With no door, anybody could come in and out, leading to more interaction. They did not believe in the fact I was simply an introvert. I have told them I am not antisocial and am open to interaction, but enjoy my space. They thought that I would be more outgoing, with these conditions. But, I am more aloof than ever. 

But anyways, I had been informed by my younger sister, that she had spotted a black mouse. I had got a plug - in, mouse repellent, prior to her saying so, but I have heard those do not work that well. I'm constantly stuck in this cold, dark basement, that I feel like is haunted. ( Call me crazy, if you wish, but I had seen the outline of a running, brown mouse/rat. A ghost, probably. ) The insects here are awful as well. 

Would the said mouse harm me, in any way? What should I do? I just can't live like this anymore. ",02Oct2017,1

But bottom line - I can't grow into the person i need to be around him. I am planning on moving to a relatively cheap state west of Tennessee to be closer to my girlfriend who I miss very much.

high blood pressure

schizophrenia

I take meds for schizophrenia, high blood pressure, and for the cardiac dysrhythmia. 

I got weight loss surgery in July and am not losing because my meds interfere. I want to go off all my meds but don't want to die so I'm thinking I should stop the schizophrenia medication and keep the blood pressure and heart one.

35,"I'm in a bit of a sticky situation. Just to warn you guys I'm gonna delete this in a few days' time just because I don't like my personal shit being so out there for too long.

Anyway, I (F/21/bi) met a girl (26/bi) a few months ago and we both feel that we're perfect for each other. But there's a catch.

She has a boyfriend, a mortgage and cats. She's not really happy with him as he doesn't satisfy her sexually or emotionally, but they bought a house together. We met and have been talking every day since. We both want the exact same things from life and have the same values, and are insanely attracted to each other.

She came back to my house after a night out and we kissed a bit and fell asleep cuddling, but I said to her I'm not willing to do anything more until she breaks up with her boyfriend as I don't want her to physically cheat on him.

We both feel like we're in high school again, like the strength of a first love. She even introduced me to her friends as her ""future wife"".

Earlier on she said she masturbated thinking of me and told me in detail what parts of my body she's been thinking about all day, so I almost got off too so jokingly said to her finish your boyfriend so I can do things to you. She said she wishes she could pack up and run off with me but it's ""not that simple"" and that her relationship is not ""just a bit of unhappiness and is more complicated than that"".

We both got very upset and decided to stay friends as we were before, and I believe that could work as we have so much in common. 

She drunkenly confessed her love to me only about a week ago but there has been tension for a while.

All of our friends agree that she should dump him for me. Even when we said we'll remain friends I said you never know we might end up together in future, and she said god I hope so. We're still going traveling together so at least we have that.

What I'm wondering is, where the fuck do I go from here? I think I'm going to stay single in case but not get my hopes up, because I believe we have something but at the same time I want to stay on Earth. I'm planning to move abroad anyway and she actually has said multiple times that she wants to come with me.

37,"I’m struggling with figuring out what to do about being in high school and having a receding hairline. 
Here is what I'm dealing with: [https://i.imgur.com/Nx6jjpp.png](https://i.imgur.com/Nx6jjpp.png)

I’m the only guy my age in my entire high school that's balding and it makes me really stand out. People keep making jokes about me having a receding hairline and I don’t react and laugh along so it looks like I'm cool with it and so everyone moves on, but I still get made fun of all the time. 


I’m worried it’s affecting making first impressions, especially when it comes to meeting girls. Whenever I’m talking with a girl I’ll get anxious because I’ll see her eyes looking up at my hairline and back down and then I'm embarrassed. All the other guys I know have full heads of hair and always get compliments from girls for their cool hairstyles and my confidence tanks because that never happens to me. 



My older brother has a full head of hair and gets told he’s attractive all the time and even my dad has a full head of hair and gets complimented on it which makes me jealous. He’s says it would probably bother him if he was noticeably balding in high school and that he’s glad he doesn’t have to go through it, but then encourages me to just be confident and move on. 


What do you think of my receding hairline? What should I do about it? Is there a way I can reverse the recession to get more hair to look like the guys my age?

He doesn't remember anything specific thing he has done to me-- including raping me when i was younger.

We were going at about 55mph and no one was hurt and the other driver wasn't even that angry about it he was very calm.

I was ticketed with following too closely and failure to reduce speed. And I understand no matter what since I hit him I'm at fault.

I never get into any of these sort of things. We're both under State Farm and it was handled. I know if he doesn't show up then it'll be dropped. My questions are:

1. I know the cop will probably show up because there were multiple accidents that express way that night and he had to handle all of them. He wasn't there to witness mine so are either of the charges contestable?

2. I know that it isn't a serious accident and if for some reason the other party shows up what should I do? of course the goal in mind being the best available option.

Thanks for all of your help.

So I am a scribe at a hospital (I follow the doc around and document the pt's presentation- history of present illness, past medical history, medical decision making, etc), as I need clinical experience. Recently a new doc, fresh out of residency, has joined and I am pretty darn attracted to him, which is very rare as I hardly ever feel attracted to people. I guess I have 2 questions. One, realistically, do I even have a chance? I mean he's a doctor and he's pretty good looking. I am 10 years his junior and while I would say I'm attractive, I'm definitely cute and not sexy. Is a huge age gap like that as much of an turn off to guys as it is girls, or are guys generally more okay with these types of age gaps? And second, how could I even show my interest while still remaining professional? I don't plan to flat out ask him out, as that could make work awkward. But what other ways could I hint my interest? And just to clarify, I don't care that he's a doctor (in regards to money- because I know some people will think thats a reason I find him attractive.

55,"When I tell people where I work and what I do, they think it is very cool and interesting, and on the outside looking in; it totally is! I work in television and this is my first job out of college. I've been in this position a little over a year and I'm feeling bored, under-valued, and ready to make a move towards something in the industry that I want more than where I currently am. 

These feelings are enough to make anyone depressed but in addition to the normal job woes, I also struggle with an anxiety disorder and depression. My anxiety doesn't typically manifest as me being particularly shy, in fact, I'm a people-person who loves to be center stage and social. However, my current position is changing that. I find myself anxious to go to work, anxious to speak up, anxious to be myself, anxious to make any mistakes. Part of this has to do with the fact that I sit directly next to my manager during the day and they have seemingly gone out of their way over the last year to make me uncomfortable, unsure, and afraid to ask questions. This person is only 3 years older than me, so it feels like a bit of a power trip.

I guess my question is: How do I find ways to make Mondays and the upcoming week in general more bearable? I've already been applying to other positions and utilizing my connections at other places to get my name out there, but I spend every Sunday night with a pit in my stomach dreading the week ahead. None of this feels fun anymore or beneficial to me so how do I continue showing up until something better comes along? How do you cope?

62,"Hello people of Reddit, this is my first post and I'm in a bit of a situation that I don't want to address to people around me irl. 

I work at a store, idk how much info to place on here but let's say this store has a good reputation. You get paid reasonably and you can some how manage to afford $650 a month for rent while barely saving much of anything after gas,food,other bills etc.

This is all part-time, you got fairly good at your job since you've been working in the same position for well over a year. So you're stuck, you're making alright money. But you've started to get tired of this job, this position. You know you have the potential to move up and you're willing to work hard for it but all you end up receiving are false hopes and promises from management. 

Things start to dawn on you, you begin to see the relationships with your peers as something other than friendship. You're there to do a good job, nothing more and nothing less. You can feel proud of yourself for something you accomplished but no one will ever see it unless you go out of you're way to be a narcissistic ass to try and show it. You're starting to burn out, this doesn't seem worth it. The job begins to seem pretty pointless if you're always staying in the same spot.

Later on an employee who is working on stuff you wanted to achieve makes a comment. You've always believed this employee to hate your guts and tried telling others but no one really understood where you were coming from and just blamed you for poor judgment.

But this comment struck something, the employee told you how they already taught you something you've been wanting to do for months. You first deny it making it a common mistake to think maybe someone else was taught by them because you would remember something so important. So to end the conversation you tell them since they remember something like this then perhaps it is true like they said.

This manages to piss them off entirely and they end up accusing you off walking away from them teaching you. You feel like you deserve more than where you are, you know they're not going to promote you no matter how hard you try, and to top it off you have a delusional coworker who you now finally got proof hates your guts. 

What should you do?",02Oct2017,1
63,"Me (19m), and my girlfriend (19f) have only been going out for a little over 3 months, and I know that she really cares about me, and I really care about her. The thing is, she is constantly getting attention from other men, she'll post a picture on instagram and will get messages for days after about it from random guys. She is constantly getting invited to places by guys, and hit on randomly. 

I am naturally a jealous person, but I never show it really, and am usually able to rationalize things in my head, and not let it be a problem. I've never been with a girl that receives this much attention from other guys though, and it's starting to bother me.

She gets super messy when she is drunk, and her personality is just very spontaneous and impulsive. I know I cant stop her from cheating on me if she wanted to, but just the thought of it freaks me out, since its like always a running thing.

72,"Alright, I’m gonna sound arrogant for a bit, but stay with me. I am currently in a We the People class and I disagree with the teacher. My dads a lawyer, so I have relied on him for most of this because this is a class based around law. I said something in a paper that my teacher disagreed with, and he put in poorly thought out and irrelevant points against me, as well as saying that I am disagreeing wit 100 Supreme Court justices. I have given quotes, definitions, perspectives from the far left and far right, and I even gave a quote from the creator of the laws in question and I have taken down all of his points with valid points and substantial evidence. He then sent me an email that said that if I did not take instruction then he would help me find another class. I became very angry, because it was only a polite way of saying agree with me or I will use my executive powers. I have proven him wrong, I have a large number of people on my side, and he did argue for a few minutes. I started using his own words against him and I disproved one of his two sources in the same way as he had dismissed one of my five. After I did this, he sent the email.

Here is the major problem, I am invested in this class. I just dropped $300 on a suit for the competition. I can’t get kicked out now. However, he is teaching false information, and when you prove him wrong he threatens to kick you out. I was raised not to just stand by and watch while he misleads a whole class and blatantly lies to them. I also know that I am stuck with him for the rest of the year, and I am afraid to even post this because if he finds this then I will probably fail both of the classes I have this teacher in. He would give me awful grades.  He will ruin my life if I drop the class because I am the only one really working on it, and I actually intend to go to college. If I fail two classes in one year then any shot at a good college is gone. I need help. 

Should I just agree with him on everything, let everyone be taught wrong, or fight and risk getting Fs with a small chance of staying in and winning the competition, which would give me access to just about any college. Should I stay safe or risk 100 to 1 odds of a better future. I can’t decide. I want the safety and the possible future, but on another hand I want to do what is best for everyone and make sure that everyone knows the truth.

My initial thought was to produce the top 3 players from every game and assign them points like 1st- 3 points, 2nd- 2 points 3rd- 1 point or like 10/7/5 points or something like that. 

My other thought was to do it like mario kart and give the top 8 points in a descending amount. 

I don't want to have 1 player run away with the tournament so that it might be decided before the last game. I have thought about making the last game worth extra points but would prefer to keep all games worth an equal amount of points.

Is there anything wrong with just giving the top 3 points? I'm expecting roughly 10 people to show up to play. Producing placings for 8 people vs 3 people might be more difficult but I could make it work. (like needing a game to decided 3rd vs 4th if they tied etc)

For example, if you have a bad boss you might find yourself letting go of certain behaviors in order to keep a job. Swallowing a bit or even a lot of your pride.
If you are in a tough relationship you might sometimes let them win some arguments to keep the boat steady and to decompress the stress.

In an ideal world these things may not happen and justice and fairness and ""being right"" may always win, but in the real world it seems that's not always the case.

The internet makes it seem like you should always give ultimatums upon every conflict...but REALISTICALLY speaking-to what extent do you actually have to back down from time to time  to keep things steady in your life?

What battles do you let go of? Where do healthy boundaries lie?

I still live with my parents and have a great relationship with then in terms of trust. I have quite a bit of freedom because I never hide things from them. 

I knew bringing up birth control to my mom would be really awkward but it felt right for me so I sat down with her and talked through it trying to be as mature as possible. She got really frustrated and said things like ""you've only known this guy for a few months and you want to give yourself to him"" and ""i never thought you'd think of doing those things yet.""

She asked me if I could at least wait until I'm done with university which is in two years...she ended up getting really worked up and wanted to stop talking about it.

I feel like she's being extremely unreasonable. I know it's an awkward situation for her and a lot to take in but I wish she would understand I'm growing up. I'm sure a lot of you will think that I'm not ready for sex if I'm an adult and can't get birth control on my own but it is kind of scary since it's my first time and I would feel a lot better if I didn't have to do this alone.

We are both gamers and play online a lot together, and her personality is super shy - even though we live about 20mins since I recently moved to the city, we haven't met up yet even though we have plans to.
Skip to recent events, I asked her a few nights back if a friend could join us to play (who is also a girl) and she blew it off just like that saying (nah, you play with her tonight. Ill play with the others).
We had been getting along more than ever this week so it seems really odd she would give me such a blunt response and then ignore me for multiple days (still haven't heard from her, even though she's online).

Hey there, a week ago my friend asked if any of us had Prime in the group chat and I said I do. He then asked if he could use it to order something and I said sure why not. He purchased a couple hundred dollars of audio and music recording equipment and it arrived at his place last week. Well tonight he messages me out of nowhere at 12:30 am with the following message, ""Yeah I'm gonna need to return everything lmao"" I ask why and he responds with, ""I don't need it"". Because of the price of the order and the short span he had the items I am concerned he is trying to attempt return abuse/fraud. Since the order is on my amazon account I am hesitant to agree to this without going over the reasons he is returning the items in detail but he won't give me a real answer and keeps trying to pass it off as no big deal. This account is associated with my Prime and Twitch which I am affiliated on. I am against return fraud and don't think I should allow him to return the items since I don't want to be associated with said fraud. Am I overthinking this? Am I the asshole here?",02Oct2017,1

My mom tried to get me tp take out max loans for that (As she did and she hasn't even finished), but I declined that all the way. No way I want to go into the same debt she has. Even yelling at me when I didn't. After my first semester was up, my mom and I moved across the country to an area outside of LA so I could pursue a career in acting. There, I applied to jobs to try and get some other things that I wanted/needed done whilst in pursuit on my main goal (Acting). I got no reaction from any application over those 3 years of. The places I'd go to physically, all told me to apply online. Asked my mom to help me land a job multiple times since she is more exp, but she pretty much said the same thing as they did. Only exp I have is from constantly mowing our lawn for about 3 years. Never got a job. Only got into 1 Commercial acting class that was 5 Saturdays. 

Now, we're on S8 so they gave us a 1 bedroom voucher worth 1100-1300. We try to move into the city of LA looking for a 2 bedrood of course. Can't find a place and running out of funds for hotels, we move back to GA with my cousin, but continue to look for places online.  But, you know we find none because that voucher is pretty much the pricing of studio apartments in LA. So we move back to GA. Back to applying to jobs with no luck. It's been a few months. To make it worse this time, our things have been in storage since last sept when we started looking in LA. Laptop, ps4. Pretty much no ent to distract my mind and applying to jobs on a phone sucks. Can't practice my animation without my laptop either. Firesticks gets old pretty fast. Even her car is still in LA in one of the airport lots. I still lack my driver's license - passed the written portion every time, never got to use the car.

The time we spend together going out or whatever is fine and we get along well and have a good time. Last week we had an argument and out of it came “I love you but I’m not happy anymore”. Despite trying to talk this through she has said “maybe time and space will help”. She has promised there’s no one else involved and I believe her. 

We’ve both kept relatively busy over the weekend. The hard part for me is as soon as I’m not busy it hits me really hard. I am really struggling with this. To make matters more complicated we’re supposed to be going on holiday in 2 weeks time with a group of mutual friends; I really want her to come regardless of what happens but she’s unsure. 

There’s so much stuff saying go full no contact but it’s really hard, especially with bits of my stuff at her house and not a lot of room back home to put it at the minute. We have the same hobby which would mean we will always inevitably see other throughout the year. 

I had thought about asking her to go for lunch at the end of the week to talk? Is that too soon? It seems it but we also need to talk about the holiday...

113,"This maybe one of the hardest things I have ever written in my life. 
My sister is a person I've have looked up to for as long As i can remember. Let's call her Angie. Angie is the type of person that everyone runs to for anything. Because that's just the type of caring person she is. 

Angie was married for 10+ years until she met the cancerous piece of crap she's with now. She spilt from her husband to be with this guy who is just not the person for her. We'll call him Carl. 

Angie and Carl work together. They were friends, I guess you can say ""work husband and wife"". 
One day out of no where Angie comes into my room to tell me she's not going to work but to spend the day with Carl. Yes. She was cheating on her husband with Carl. And Carl was cheating on his wife with my sister. 
This was the beginning of the downfall for Angie. 

Fast forward a few weeks. They get caught by Carl's wife. She had followed Carl and saw that she was getting in Angie's car. Carls wife confronts them and ends up coming to the house to tell Angie's husband what she had discovered. 
When the shit hits the fan, my sister and her husband, they decide to get a divorce.  We move out. By ""We"" I mean my sister, her kid and I. 

This entire time I think she's made a horrible mistake by starting to date Carl.  I don't say anything because it's not my life. She's a grown ass woman she knows what did and ultimately, it's her life. 

We settle into our new place and he comes over every night. Spends the night every night. But he refused to ""officially move in"" because our rent was too high and he couldn't afford to split rent three ways. 
One day I find Angie really upset and sad. Looked like she's been crying all day. When I finally get her to talk to me she tells me that ""Carl is going on a vacation and I think he's going with his wife."" Turns out, he did. 
Carl's wife made her usually private IG account public. And what do we find, pictures of them going to the beach, selfies here and selfies there. 
When Angie confront Carl, first thing he says is ""who told you!""  Didn't deny anything. Just wanted to know who had told her he was away with his wife when he told Angie he was going to visit family. 
They fight the entire time he's away. Sometimes he even makes fun of the situation by saying ""damn, I almost got away with it"". Which I don't think is fucking funny at all. 
A week later, he comes back and she forgave him. 
She sat me down, told me she was going to give him another chance. At this point, I hate him. I no longer want him coming to the house and I demand that she get his copy of the key back (which I never agreed to him having in the first place). She and I get into a huge fight because I expressed how pissed I was that she was going to give him another chance. 

Now, he knows I don't like him. He knows why I don't look his way when he would come to the house. He knows why I don't acknowledge his presence. Which he expresses to Angie that he doesn't like. 

Again fast forward a few months. Angie approached me to ask how I felt about him moving in. I said ""i don't give a fuck about him, but if it means my rent is gonna drastically lower, fine"".  Carl pretty much is living with us for about a month, come rent due day, he packs his shit and goes back to his parents house. (Yeah, he's that loser who lives with his mom and dad). He tells my sister ""yeah, I think it's time for me to go back home.""  
That entire month he was there, my sister and I did not speak unless it had to due with bills.  The entire month he was there he'd bring his three bad ass kids. Yes. He has three disrespectful ass kids. Which by the time the rent was due so was all the other bills. High water bill. Higher gas bill. Higher electricity bill. Which my sister and I got stuck paying for. 

Another month goes by and he tells Angie ""oh by the way, I'm going to an amusement park with the kids and their mom for a long weekend get away. I'm telling you now, im going whether you like it or not"". 

This is when I knew I really hated this piece of shit. 
Besides him always pressuring my sister on when she was going to finalize her divorce he was still a family man with his wife and kids. Pretty much having my sister on the side.  This guy is such a piece of shit that he  and even takes Angie out. I once heard him say ""I want to go to go the movies."" My sister responds with ""I'm broke""  And he says 'ugh, never mind then, if you can't afford movies tickets neither can I"". Cheap asshole. 

My sister and I are constantly fighting because I don't want him coming to the house anymore. I don't want to see him in my home. I don't want him spending the night and moving his shit in and out of our home. 

Till one night. My sister gets home late and the door bell rings and it's him. He walks in and I look at him. Roll my eyes and say really loud ""UUUGGGHHH!""  And head on upstairs to my room. This piece of shit didn't like that I expressed my feeling about him being at the house that he went to the bottom of the stairs to throw his coffee mug at me. I storm back down stairs and he gets in my face like he's going to hit me. Has his arm cocked back ready to punch me but instead spits in my face and calls me every name in the book. He destroys our living room because my sister is telling him to get out and he's in disbelief that she's not defending him. Angie's kid calls the cops and he takes off before they get there. Yeah, this son of a bitch spat in my face. 

You guessed it. She forgave him. She justifies the situation by telling our family that it was both of our faults and that I had pushed his buttons. By now my family knows what a disgusting asshole he is and can't believe that Angie is with him. They don't recognize her anymore. Angie's was this ""take no shit from anyone"" type of person to letting this asshole manipulate her life. 
She and i barley speak because she knows that as long as she's with him I have nothing to say to her. My mom knows what happened and my mom is upset that she's still with him. Our older brother who we look up to is in disbelief as well. Everyone is highly upset with her. 

Now, moving on. They have an on and off again relationship. He wants her to kick me out of our house so he can move in. ""As long as your cunt sister is in that house, you and I can't begin our life together.""
But he's still, after almost four years, refuses to get a divorce from his wife.

My sister has busted her ass to get her first house. Yet he never once congratulated her. Instead he said to her ""I get it. You got a small house so I wouldn't move in. So my kids wouldn't feel welcomed because they don't each have a room of their own. But you made sure your sister and kid are well taken care of"". 

Carl has never met ANYONE in our family but he finds it easy to disrespect my mom. My brother. And my entire family. He has crossed the line many times and Angie just let's it slide. 

Carl disrespect my mom by calling her names and saying he can suck his dick...  Carl has called my bother a piece of shit because he refuses to meet him. Carl has 100% crosses the line with me. This guys is so fucked up in the head that he asked my sister the following question: ""Why don't you want to hang out with me on the weekends anymore? It's like you forget about me.  Hmmm almost like you have someone else fucking you. Is your sister fucking you so good that you forget you have a boyfriend?""  Yeah. He asked if I'm fucking my own sister. Who in the hell says these things!!!!!!???!!!!
Angie swears back and forth that he crossed the final line after how he spoke about our mom. But she still talks to him. Still texts him. Always has an open line of communication with him. 

I made the mistake of calling her a low life, when I really wanted to call her broken. That this emotional vampire was sucking here dry. That he was weighing her down. That he was dimming her once bright light. That he's just not good for him. I yelled at her that by her still
Having any kind of communication with him, she's justifying his action to be ok.

Now she's mad at me and I just don't know how to get her to understand that Carl needs to disappear. It hurts me to see her in such agony for a guy that just isn't for her.

In a bit of a dilemma here but not sure what to do.

I am currently in 2nd year studying a double degree in medical science and masters in optometry. Recently I taken interest into the corporate finance field and planning to change to a target university to enter this field.

I'm not sure if I should drop out of my current degree and transfer into the bachelor of commerce at the target university which will allow me to enter the corporate finance field or should I finish the 3 year component of medical science and receive a bachelor of medical science and then transfer?

I am worried that this one year difference will mean a lot in the field I want to go into as I know that they like to hire young people for junior positions.

Currently 20 at the moment. If I was to finish both degrees I would be graduating at 24. If I was to drop out now and transfer into the new degree I would be graduating at 23.

So to try and make things short a sweet here goes. My friend (26/M) reached out to reconnect a little while ago. We have been in contact on and off for years, no reason for the off just distance/growing up/life in general, but more recently having gone through a break up not too long ago, I have some more time to spare and catch up with old friends. I've caught up with him on the phone/whats app and he invited me to a concert in a few weeks which I was up for going to. We have some similar interests and have both recently gone through tough break ups so it's nice to share advice, purely platonic this is in no way shape or form a rebound, just some support from an old friend. However, yesterday he'd reached out to his ex and had some difficult conversations with her. I consoled him over the phone for a while and then the texts and whats apps continued of screen shots and quotes about life and her and all the details... I felt so overwhelmed because this morning I woke up to even more after not responding since yesterday. He is not a close friend, he never has been, we just recently reconnected and I just offered some advice from a female perspective. I almost feel like now he has cut the ex off he is trying to fill the gap with me and to be honest, it's way too much for me. I don't want to talk constantly, I don't want to hear about their problems because it's making me think about my ex in a bad way when I was starting to pick myself up and cope better.
I don't know what to do now - I feel like he is projecting his emotions and negativity onto me and offloading and I don't want to fill that void to be honest. How can I tell him this? I've tried not responding but he just keeps going... Don't get me wrong if this was a CLOSE friend I would be consoling them every step of the way, but in my opinion this is so random and I don't have the time for it!?

126,"Hey all, I'm really stuck and I'm not sure how to handle this situation.

A good friend of my wife and I committed suicide a few weeks ago. He was one of my wife's best friends since high school, and a Bridesman at our wedding. She's still incredibly broken up about it, and misses him terribly.

Last week, his widow offered my wife and I the chance to buy his car. It's a somewhat-older car that he put a lot of work into customizing. I would love to buy his car because I love the particular model it is, my wife wants it because it belonged to her friend, and I sold my car before I deployed, so it seems perfectly reasonable to buy it.

The only problem I have is the price. His widow is trying to sell it for the remaining balance of the loan. She intends to pay off the loan first, to make things easier with the bank. But the value of the loan is a few thousand dollars higher than the value of the car.

My wife and I don't really know how to approach this. Money is not the issue for either of us; his widow is not in need of the funds, and my wife and I could afford the higher payment if we had to. But we're still trying to pay off our wedding debt, and the payments we'd be making towards the car would take away the payments we're making towards the credit card. On the other hand, bringing this up seems heartless to do to someone who just lost her husband.

So do I try to negotiate a lower price from our friend's widow? Do I take the price as-is? Or do we turn down the offer? (Neither my wife nor I want to do that)",02Oct2017,3
127,"I volunteered to work at a charity event but cancelled on short notice. To apologise and try and regain a little respect, I've decided it would be a good idea to hold my own fundraiser where all proceeds go to the original charity organisation.

One idea I thought was nifty would be an adaption on the regular jelly bean jar pay-and-make-a-guess method. The altered version would have three differently shaped jars, and people pay one price to make 3 guesses, one for each jar. (they don't pay per jar. they make one payment, which allows for one guess per jar.) I feel doing it this way would make it a little more successful, but this idea is also relatively low effort.

Bake sales are also generic and fairly successful, but considering the original charity involved a bake sale I imagine this would be in bad taste.

Just wanted to get some opinions on contacting a girl after a one night stand? I went out Saturday night and met this girl who I found 10/10 insanely attractive (albeit with heavy beer goggles) and we had a great time. We ended up going back to her place and the sex was fantastic! I stayed over and we woke up at about 8am.

Normally, in my experience, I either make a stealthy exit or make my excuses and go home. However, she was already awake and we just started talking. It was awesome, it turns out we have loads in common and we just spoke for a good 3/4 hours. We had sex again and then I said I had to go as I had a prior engagement that afternoon. Kissed her goodbye and that was that.

Now I'm sat at work two days later and I'm considering looking up her and getting in touch. I really enjoyed het company, sober as well as drunk and I'd love to ask her out properly. The only things that stop me are: 

* She's 3 years older than me

So, a little background to start. I'm a 20-year-old engineering student. I've been single for the past five years, and I want to change that. I just don't know how to... It feels weird and clunky to just go up to a girl in public and just go ""hey, want to be alone together"" or some other such nonsense, but engineering tends to be kind of a sausage festival, so it's tough to meet people in classes. I tried Tinder and some other similar apps, but I just cut it off with a girl yesterday after she stood me up, claiming ""we didn't talk at all so I just assumed we weren't hanging out."" Suffice to say I've ruled it out as an option. While not detrimental to my self-esteem, at least, not as much as it used to be, it hurts to see all the happy couples on campus and in my life and I'm just here playing Diablo or Rainbow Six until my eyes turn red. I'm looking for anyone who's been in a similar situation. How'd you get out of this? What steps did you take? Any and all feedback is appreciated.

141,"Hi guys,
up until maybe a year ago, I never had a problem with weekends or days off. I would mostly just chill at home and keep busy with gaming, music, reading, and rarely sometimes go out. I always loved free time and knew how to keep myself entertained.

That has changed for some reason. Normal weekends are not too bad since it's just two days. But, I can feel on Sunday evenings that I tend to become nervous and kinda grumpy. I get bored much more easily. It's worse when there are more days in a row and I don't have something special planned. Like, I still read, use the computer, listen to music, go out for a run... but somehow time seems to pass much slower and I feel like I'm just wasting time if I'm not currently busy with something. It almost makes me wait for the week so I can get back to work and be occupied. It's worst when I just sit in my flat and basically wait for the time to pass, I get really nervous and tense.

The obvious solution I guess would be to do more or different things on the weekend. I don't really have friends - well I have one friend, and we meet sometimes, but not every weekend - and all my hobbies take place during weekdays. I like being in nature, but where I live it's not really easily accessible (very large town). I've been looking for meetups and stuff, but very little is interesting to me. Maybe soon I'll start doing pen and paper on Saturdays, that would at least be a solution for one day. 

Mostly however I wonder why this change took place, I feel like it's not right that I get so miserable when I have to spend time by myself. I always liked that and this complete flip is weird.

Anybody experienced something similar or have any tips?",02Oct2017,3

I made up my mind a while ago to leave my current hate cubicle position for something smaller where I'm on my more mobile. Full disclosure is that many of my peers including myself have been treated badly. Along with the stress level of an extremely high paced job, they have continued cutting jobs and threading current employees with termination if a mistake is made. This is the nutshell version to give you all an idea, but I've finally found a job which is more mobile,pays similarly and offers good benefits that would also be more fulfilling However, I have an issue:

I am planning on starting my new position on 11/1. My current employer is known for walking employees out when they turn in their two-weeks notice and I am interested in getting the most money possible from my current company. I am wondering if I should I put in a two-weeks notice on 10/13 and work my two weeks (if I'm not walked out), or turn in a letter or resignation on 10/30 stating that would be my last day, getting a full months check?

153,"Some context- I'm 18 and have had counselors/therapists since I was in grade school. The school referred me at first because I wasn't talking/interacting with the other kids, but when they found out why they tried to help but it didn't work out. CPS was called numerous times but couldn't/wouldn't do anything, so I was stuck in this terrible situation until I was 13 and moved in with my mom.

I've seen six therapists to deal with my childhood and I still haven't gotten over it yet. We only see each other for a few weeks or months before they abruptly stop the sessions with no closure. Is the money a factor in this? Are there ""guidelines"" or something that say that I can't talk about certain things? Because no matter what, when I get into the heavy stuff the therapist breaks all contact with me. They'll listen to what I have to say, tell me they're sorry that happened and that we'll work on this next time, and then nothing. Every time I go see someone new I think things will be different this time but this always happens. It's very draining and discouraging. The counselor I'm currently seeing has made me lose any hope in therapy. I told her about this traumatizing event and she said the same, we'll talk about this in the future. I go to our next session to find out from the receptionist that the appointment was an hour before, which doesn't make sense because they have always been at the same time. I email the counselor telling her that I hadn't known that she changed the time and apologized. She hasn't emailed back and so I have no clue when our next session is or if there will even be one.

158,"Ever since I was young I always took education seriously. You can say that I am a complete nerd because of it because I internalised the mentality that I should **STUDY! STUDY! STUDY!** all day, everyday. I got the mentality that education is the most important factor in my life but …. It gave me a lot of problems.

The demand is often so high that it gave me a lot of neuroticism – anxiety and depression and it is often so demanding that instead of  increasing my arousal, it actually depleted it *(arousal theory)* and I often did not make any effort in education or avoided because only lately I realised that I made up a core belief that I am too stupid or too incapable of anything and despite my outmost attempts to do well in school, I got average results which only reinforced my self-destructive core-beliefs and over the years I developed a phobia of stupidity *(as in I am often very afraid that I am as stupid as I think I am yet at the time, I truly believe it and I know that it is a core belief meaning it can be re-evaluated and I know that it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy but I cannot help but believe it)*

Over the years, the depression and anxiety and other kinds of neuroticism kept building up over the years and I felt I was alone and hopeless and cannot do anything right and sinc most of these started when I was a teenager, I managed to get little help because the idea of teenagers being emotional was considered as a part of puberty or going through a phase or was too good to be true because some people thought that mental disorders only happened in adults and the mental illness taboo still existed during that time *(and in my family)*. 

*(and when I was a teenager, like many other teenagers, I was confused, pretty overwhelmed with emotions and days without clear answers and I was pretty stubborn so effective help was not very successful. So those days, I eventually internalised that I am too broken to receive help. Plus, I forgot to mention that I am an overthinker. No wait, scatch that – I am probably THE overthinker. Left, right, up, down, sideways, all around, square, circle, triangle, pyramid … you fucking name it. If you mention something, it probably crossed my mind and never managed to get of it)*
So I mostly internalised a lot of self-destructive thoughts and beliefs over the years and felt pretty much like a walking zombie *(and a useless one too)*

When I started going to university, something dark popped up and it progressed slowly. 

*(remember the depression and anxiety that I mentioned? Turns out that they were also a product of extreme child bullying, parental abuse and a lot of other tramas that I repressed over the years but had little success in coping with them because of my self-destructive core beliefs and I was unable to connect with others so according to social identity theory, I actually thought to myself as a piece of fucking shit and my social skills were garbage. I am 24 and I am still very naïve in social situations. It is improved, I will admit that, but damn it, for a skill that I should have developed during adolescence but instead spent years in isolation and reclusiveness, I feel ashamed that I allowed myself to go down that road)*

So while the results in my first few years in university were not that good which still reinforced my core belief *(to this day, I feel ashamed of it)*, I decided that I had to get help.

For three years now I have been going to therapy. Progress is very slow as it involves going through layers and layers of repressed unconscious feelings *(while simulanoeusly trying to face them without overthinking about it because I never really managed to find a way to switch off my fucking brain)* but my mentality has improved a tiny bit. It’s pretty bad but not as shitty bad as before.

I put a lot of effort in my studies in this year and I studied from A to Z so I mostly know every detail in the book that there is to know … but my results are often average. I mostly get Cs and if I am lucky, I get Bs or As *(those were mostly assignments so I had the time advantage to rethink my methods and my writing)* and after all those hours, weeks or even months of effort and studying, I often feel betrayed.

And for that, I often feel afraid of my future. 

I know that may sound completely irrational but I fear the world. Not only I do not trust myself or my heart but I have a lot of paranoia against the world because I see it as a competitive place. Not only I inherited the idea that grades are everything, intelligence, cognitive ability and future success but I inherited the idea that whatever I do, someone will know how to do it better and that person will have a better chance of getting a good future than me and in the end, I will feell like the failure I already believe that I am and let all those people who wronged me, bullies, parents, shitty teachers, I let them all win in the end *(Pygmalion effect)*

It’s like I am both stuck in the past and the future at the same time. It’s like I am both afraid of my past and my future. I have this “competitive” nature because of this paranoia but due to the fact that I had a lot of fuck ups in my past and lots of wrongs and flaws and have a lot of self-beliefs that I know will take forever to face because it is an ugly experience, I fear for my future

I fear that despite my efforts to push hard and play hard and get semi-average results, I fear that I will truly became the piece of shit that I already think I am 

*(and yes, I know. I am not actually living. People told me that I prioritise so much in my education that I have little, if not, no thought  at all for other things. I really like to do some fun in my life. Heck, I sometime procrastinate because I both desire some relaxation or social bonding in my life and the fact that the anxiety can be unbearable but can you really blame me? I see the world, most of it anyway, really compeititive and scary that I HAVE to be prepared for anything. I feel like I am in a Hunger Games type of setting or some form of apocalyptic setting or like I am being Batman who is so paranoid for anything that he literally prepares for anything, even the possible situations that have little probability to actually occur)* 


I truly understand the paranoia that students have in America because of the standardised tests and the phobia that a number or a letter has lots of effects on how they see themselves and how they see their futures.

Heck, I will admit that have a phobia of grades as well. As if a number of stapled on my forehead tells me what I really am, even though I am well aware that grades and standardised tests are not really the only or most efficient way to define one's ability but we all know how the general idea is that people always look for As and Bs and the winners keep on winning and the losers keep losing 

*(and yes, I am aware that that last sentence is very irrational and even offensive or sensitive for some because I see myself as the loser in this story and everyone else as the winner.)*

Aside from her job income we run a small business for computer repair near a small town so we don't make much money.

I recently got a job after taking a year off working to travel and I'm feeling dumb at work. I take forever to understand simple things and get super anxious when I'm being asked something. My anxiety really isn't helping my situation at all! 

The nature of the business I'm in is rather fast-paced but the company tries to relax the working environment and people which is nice. Unfortunately, the stress still gets to me. I'm trying to get smarter by training my motor skill brain muscles like writing/brushing with my less dominant hand, planning on taking up piano.

Also, my direct boss who is super nice but I can't seem to get along well, makes my anxiety worse when I have to deal with him, resulting in me saying or doing sillier things.

I have the tendency of exasperating people whenever I have difficulties, because they have better things to do than helping someone who could learn how to do things alone and without help. So I try my best to do everything without help in order to keep everyone else at peace, and prevent any troubles I could cause by harassing people with my complaints.
- Whenever I do anything wrong, no matter how minor, I'm scared that people are withholding the punishment I deserve to stack it big-time later. I'd wish people were stricter with me, so I could have at least some peace of mind that people won't lash on me worse in the future.
- In that regard, sometimes I wish that people explicitly treated me badly, instead of either faking a good persona, or genuinely treating me well and me being unable to prove it's not a plot against me.

Apparently my attitude towards others is harmful towards my social convivence. And of course it should be, if I can't prove beyond doubt if anybody is being actually double-faced or just treating me well. Since I can't prove it otherwise, I must assume the worst case scenario every time, and that means being unable to trust anybody. I can't ask what to do because the answer is probably ""doing nothing"", or ""trusting by default"" and taking the risk of falling right into somebody's trap. What I can ask for is for ways to have a better time around people when I can't trust them.",02Oct2017,0

181,"I love my wife, we have been together 9.5 years and married for 6.  We have the most amazing 2 year old daughter and seem to the outside world to be very happy.   I have had a fairly high paying job for most of our life and her income has not mattered much, but as we have progress in our relationship she has contributed less and less, and in the last 5 years she has contributed around $3,000 total to our entire life.  That said, she does not contribute in a reasonable way around the rest of our life.   We talk time and time again about the things she needs to do to be an active part of our life, and to be and adult, a partner to me and parent to our daughter.   She promises to do better and to fix things and to do certain things.  When she doesn't do the things that she promises, I get up upset.  I tell her how much it hurts me when she breaks her promises and doesn't take anything off of my plate.   I tell her how much it hurts me that she doesn't do the things she has promises to do to ensure she gets things done.   After I tell her these things she almost ALWAYS gets very defensive and then starts attacking me (not physically), then I attack back, and argument ensues, and then she shuts down for DAYS.  Making me a stranger in my own house, and it just keeps getting worse.   I tell her time and time again, that she just needs to stay organized.   Make lists and schedules of things you need to do, and she agrees, and when she does that she is very successful, but she consciously chooses not do to things that need to be done.  I am not talking major things, but things like getting the mail, making car and doctor appointments, etc....   She just refuses to do them.   She just always thinks she will do it ""soon"" and never gets to it.  I work a lot, and pay for everything in our life.   I work from home most of the time, so I am not distant.  I am very involved with her, and very involved with my daughter, who I love in ways I can't express in words.   I bring my family with me when I do anything as I love them and want them involved.  I never shut them out of time or keep my friends from them.   We talk frequently about since she has chosen to not have a job, and wants to stay at home that means doing somethings around the house, and if we hired someone to do what we expect her to do, what that would look like.  And we talk about what she would do with that person if they were only doing what she does, or doesn't get finished with items they do, and she agrees we would fire them.   My wife is loving and wonderful, but just doesn't act like an adult, a responsible adult.   She also feels like the small things she does, like making me coffee should be enough.   I try to explain to her that there is just more that needs to be done.  The analogy I have tried to use recently is that if you go to the bank, and you have a favorite bank teller who is amazing and friendly and gives your kids suckers, and your dog snacks, you would love that person and always want them to be your teller, but if that person just never processed your deposits, or never gave you the money you requested, you would be VERY upset, and no amount of suckers fixes that.   The little things make life better, but you have to do the base things or they don't really matter.  I am going through a work transition currently and am VERY stressed, and am at a time where I need love, support, and to have my partner pick things up around me and help take things off of my plate, but at the time I need her most, she is just piling more things on.   If the gender roles were reversed, and I just sat at home all day and didn't add to our family, everyone in her world would tell her to toss that deadbeat husband away.   I don't want that.   I love my wife.  When we are good, we are amazing, but we are talking about separating and I am just broken.   I seem to be the only one fighting to make us better, and for things to get better.   I have tried everything I can think of, everything she says she needs me to do for her to be productive, I do and we try, and it doesn't help.   Everything I suggest, she promises to try, but ultimately tosses aside, and doesn't do them.  I am broken, we are broken, I am so sad about it and don't know what else to do.   I have never asked for advice on reddit, and doubt anyone will even respond, but I don't really know who else to talk to without poisoning friends and family about this, and I don't want to create sides or divisions.

I have a problem and it's preventing me from having a relationship with any girl that I meet.

It's been about a year since I broke up with my ex and ever since I've been on my own. I tried dating some women and I just can't build any emotional connections with them and since emotional bonding is essential for me I can't ever move to the relationship phase with a new girl. I'm not interested in sex if there's no relationship. Why do I find a hard time bonding with women? I feel like I don't have anything in common with most women that I meet. 

And I know it's not a healthy way of thought. I can't find someone identical to myself and I shouldn't expect that. How do I be comfortable with the idea of sharing my life with someone I haven't got much in common with?

191,"#Possible trigger warning. Please read entirely before commenting.

So topics like politics, race, religion are sensitive and loaded topics but for this post I will focus on religion. As it is a form of ""core identity"" to many, the people around me usually bond over religion (Eid gatherings for Muslims, church services/camps for Christians, temple rituals for Hindus etc). 

I have had a respectful (i.e. listen before speaking, do not interrupt, be objective) discussion with a Christian once about god, the afterlife and predestination. Although I showed skepticism towards his beliefs he was able to address it objectively, showing that he was secure and sincere about discussion without allowing his emotions to take over. We exchanged numbers but I stopped contacting him as I feared being preached to instead.

Why so? Discussions about religion I have heard are not always positive, as I have experienced firsthand religious people using emotional blackmail or using opportunities such as this to preach to (sometimes) the already converted. Hogging airtime to tell people how true the holy written word is without any regard to answering questions. Eternal damnation and/or being labeled as the heretic of the family. Also, the questioner's person/character is attacked and insulted instead of the argument. (there is a term for this, but I don't remember what it is)

TBH The bad rep religion gets is the ""my way or the highway"" mindset, and I see that people are unable to let go of this mindset when discussing religion.

How do I objectively discuss religion reasonably and objectively with others? Have you encountered such an experience before?
How do you deal with such emotional charging?",02Oct2017,1

194,"[[TL:DR My roommate wants utilities compensation for my boyfriend visiting me about 10 or 11 days of the month, keeping tidy and to himself when he does visit IF I'm not in the house, and so far, no acceptable solutions have been provided by either party.]]

My roommate delayed paying me her half of the bills owed this month because she wanted to talk to me about my boyfriend contributing to bills.

Her main points: 
- He lives here
- Him being here makes me uncomfortable
- If he can't spend less time here, he needs to pay so I can rationalize how often he's here and how uncomfortable he makes me.
- You said he would be staying for the first few weeks but didn't tell me he would still be living here after. 

My main points: 
- He spends less time in our apartment than he does back in his home town, therefore does not live at the apartment.
- Because he spends less than half his time here, he shouldn't have to pay. 
- He contributes by cleaning, and does not leave my bedroom if I am not home unless it's to get food or use the bathroom. He does not use our shower if I am not home. 

[[SIDE NOTE: My boyfriend's income is sparse right now as his job is a self-contracted job making furniture out of his workshop in his hometown 3 hours away. He spends time bouncing between my home and his family's home where the workshop is. Due to the nature of the field he wants to enter, it makes no sense for HIM to lock down a year lease or get stuck in a job that won't let him travel for interviews. We're basically living a scheduled long distance relationship until he can lock down a career job.]]

A few back and forth arguments we had based on those points:
- Me: He spends less time here than away, definitely less than half. Her: But it feels like so much more. 
- Her: My previous roommmate's boyfriend lived in the apartment and made me feel uncomfortable, and so this situation gives me so much anxiety that it's hard for me to talk about. Me: I understand that you have anxiety but it's unfair to compare me and my boyfriend to your former roommate and her boyfriend. 
- Me: I can give you $10 extra dollars a month for his visits. Her: That's not enough. 

A few things to consider: 
- I was not upfront with her about how frequently my boyfriend would visit. He has never spent more than one week consecutively at the apartment, and never more than half the month (if that). However, I do understand I should have been open from the beginning.
- She had told me about her former roommate and her boyfriend, and when I asked about Tanner staying consecutively for the first few weeks told me ""As long as your boyfriend wears clothes around the apartment, it's fine."" She was never upfront with me about any other levels of what would make her uncomfortable. 
- My boyfriend and I clean up after ourselves, are gone at least half the weekends of each month, frequently buy needed items around the house (i.e. paper towels, toilet paper, dishwasher fluid, etc.), and have our own food in the fridge - nothing is shared. 

I have looked around a lot of sites that say an SO should be required to contribute if they're taking up a lot of space in the apartment, are messy, are basically live-ins, etc., which my SO is none of. I've also heard from numerous people that they've had roommates in serious relationships who had their SO over all the time and those people never expected roomie's SO to pay due to visits being expected when a person is in a serious relationship. I also understand that as my roommate who pays an equal amount of rent, she has her rights, and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable in her own apartment either. 

My current, temporary solution is: My boyfriend was in our apartment for 11 days in September, and those days we will calculate the bills split equally in 3rds and take his portion from her ""half"" of the bills. (Bill total/30 = daily utility total, [DUT]x11 = bill amount for days he was there, [previous total]/3 = how much we all owe equally for those 11 days. Turns out to be 17 and I'm taking that 17 out of HER half of the total bills). 

I am afraid that she won't accept $17 off her half if she won't accept the $10. Her only solutions presented in our conversation were: ""He needs to be here a lot less so I don't feel uncomfortable"" (his current visitation average is about 10/11 days a month) or ""He needs to pay more than $10 monthly so I can rationalize my comfort levels."" 

Is there a solution to this issue aside from me moving out? Are we both being unreasonable idiots? Advice and insight needed.

I had a guy do the video, and it took about 15 days past when he said he would do it. I asked him to change the results about 4-5 times, and each time it got significantly better but still wasn't good at all. I showed the video to my professor and he said since I cannot use it because it's bad the school will not reimburse me for it. They will only pay me for a video that is useable and he thinks it's bad. 


Now I owe this guy $1,000. I'm a broke college student and genuinely do not want to spend my whole paycheck this month on a video that will not be used.

203,"A little context: I am a freshman at a small (2500 students), isolated college in upstate New York. I come from Portland, Oregon, which is on the smaller side of cities, but still a city. I came here because it seemed like the academics and music were strong, but I didn't factor in how much I would miss being in a city. I visited NYC this weekend and stayed with my ex-girlfriend, who goes to NYU. Hanging out with her friends and feeling the rush and anonymity of a big city felt amazing. I feel trapped here. 

The other problem is this: I tend to give up on things, and I worry that I may just be missing out on whatever the opposite of my situation is. The problem may be internal; I might not thrive in the big city. A lot of it is also my anxiety around how well my girlfriend (we broke up for college and are still in love with each other) is doing. I'm socially isolated here and miss her, so I think that's factoring into my anxiety.

I originally said I could work Friday nights, and Saturday and sunday mornings when school started. Unfortunately they only gave me night shifts, which was a little annoying considering I told them only mornings on Sat and Sun. I also knew that working 3 days every week was going to be alot to handle, but I wanted to help them out and keep my schedule as available as possible because were short staffed. Fast forward few weeks, i'm pretty stressed with school and aroud 20 hour weekends. Then comes this last weekend. It was honestly terrible. I worked 30 hours including a 15 hour shift in which i only had a 5 minute break to scarf down a taco. Managment didnt seem too concerned that I was clearly very tired and overworked near the end of the shift. It was terrible. On top of that I have 3 tests this week which I feel unprepared for.

The next closest person to my age is around 38 so that's still a 16 year difference... All of them have kids and cottages and boats and all of that family oriented stuff. This makes it nearly impossible to relate to these people. All they ever want to talk about is themselves and their families and their cottages. This is very frustrating for me because I don't have a cottage and I don't have kids or that kind of family oriented outlook. I would like to talk about world events, or new discoveries in science or new technologies, or politics (that's a tricky one for work) or even entertainment related topics like celebrities and movies. 

Suffice to say these people are stuck in their ways and I don't know how to interact with them. I find myself thinking that I'm a loser or just super lame and don't know how to talk to people, but I don't think this is the case... I normally don't have issues conversing with people. I don't know what to do, I find it very unsatisfying going to work and doing boring work and then on top of that having nobody to talk to during my breaks, it's just very lonely (I work alone on my projects). I have 3 more months left with the company, so I'll suffer through it, I just wish I knew how to get along with these people a little better.  ",02Oct2017,1
209,"Moved out of my parents house into a house share a few weeks ago. Great location and my housemates seem decent enough.

The problem: The landlord has a dog. When I first moved in the landlord asked if I wouldn't mind opening the back door whenever I get in from work so that the dog can go out. I agreed because that's easy enough. Last week the dog got an operation on its leg and the landlord sent me a long text about how ""we'll all have to pull together and look after the dog."" I'm now expected to take the dog outside on a lead in the back garden and feed it whenever the landlord or other housemate isn't around (90% of the time).

Maybe I'm just being an asshole but I don't feel as though this should be one of my responsibilities. I pay rent to live in a house and look after whatever I use. Not to look after a dog that isn't mine. I wouldn't mind if this was a thing I'd have to do every once in a while (like every couple of weeks) but the landlord gets home late on most days of the week, meanwhile the dog just sits at home all day crying. If I weren't here, would the landlord just let the dog go hungry and piss/shit itself in the house?

I find it really cruel (to the dog) that she'd leave the it at home all day on it's own, and I have to come home and take care of it. It cries all evening when the landlord isn't there and I feel so bad for it. I feel like I'm going to end up in a situation where one day if I don't feed the dog/take it outside for whatever reason (busy/forgot/lazy) the landlord is going to get pissed off at me for not doing it. Really not sure what I should do...

How can I make it clear that the dog isn't my responsibility and the landlord shouldn't count on me for taking care of it? Again, I don't mind looking after it every once in a while, but if it's something that occurs more than once a week I don't really want to...",02Oct2017,1

4. I have no friends because my age group's all about fun &amp; drinking and they don't get me.
5. My mom is sick and I’d love to take care of her, but she lives in a different country. All she wants for me is to finish my bachelor’s degree.
6. My dad’s a narcissistic asshole but he expects me to talk to him &amp; finish my bachelor’s degree because he sends me money.

8. I lost all my passions and my best mood is a pronounced state of misery.
9. I have nowhere to go or no one to talk to when I’m down/suicidal.

I am a 20 year old college student athlete. Due to my schedule as a student athlete, finding time to work has always been an issue. With school and class on weekdays, and lots of traveling for competition on the weekend, I would truly only be able to work 2 weekends of the month.

However, I worked my butt off all summer and am on scholarships so I'm not in desperate need to get out and put myself out there and try to find somewhere that can work around this. However, if I could, that would be the go to option.

Any who, I am looking for advice on the best use of excess time. With no job, I have been having lots of free time on weekends with no competition and after class. I have been spending lots of time watching sports and playing video games. However, I realize there is other productive things I could be doing, without spending money.

Can anyone recommend any side hustles to make a few bucks? Any new or interesting skills/hobbies with low start-up costs? Places to hang out in the Denver area to meet new people without spending money? Thank you!

Of course he dont know even my fav band or what i like, nothing. And i do know his stuffs. 

So, had enough i moved ahead ad said i dont want to do this. I didnt blocked him, but i didnt wrote to him since. But he thinks im joking. He writes to me every month like""are you still mad? Or, cmone dont be mad"". He is so fkn selfish and egotistical, he never said ""sorry i understand what you want, ill change"". It would be the minimum i think because his thing was, every few months he acted out, didnt spoke with me until i begged for apology (best friend lol).

Now he invited mi to a house party and here is why i wrote here. I made a choice and i stick with it. I suffer with him, or be better without him. But now im fkn lonely.

241,"I have an older brother who's now 27, and after he graduated college he has always lived with my mom (about 5 years now). He has never lived on his own, and doesn't help my mom with the mortgage payment, do chores around the house, help with the car payment for the car she gave him, or even help with the cell phone bill. He doesn't have plans at all to move out, and has never held a job (all of them manual labor) for more than 4 weeks without getting fired. His last job he 'think he got fired, but never followed up' because he just simply stopped showing up and didn't communicate with his managers on why. He also would frequently complain about his coworkers, looking down on them because they didn't have a college degree. He would devise petty plans to sabotage them, like mess up their timing cards for their shifts and talk nonstop about how everyone hates him, blaming his unhappiness on them. This pattern repeats for almost every job he has, and he claims that he can't stay in any job because 'everyone is out to get me'. Personally, I wonder how every single coworker he meets is out to get him, or if really he's the one at fault. 

In addition, he also has never helped around the house. When I come home from college, I help cook/clean/mow the lawn, and my mom is astonished because she isn't used to having someone else help her. He refuses to help, but then gets angry when my mom or I don't cook meals for him. He complains to me that my mom stopped cooking for him when I left for college, and now he eats smoothies and protein shakes every day, never bothering to wash his own dishes.

He now mostly spends his time on his phone indoors. He also fussed for my mom to buy a laptop for him, which he only uses to browse reddit or watch dumb videos. He currently has no job and no social skills, and is extremely prideful and rude. I made food for him the other day, and he responded with 'you think I want that shit? fuck you' when I offered. There were leftovers the next day, which I was going to eat, but took the bowl of food away after saying 'you think someone would just leave a bowl of food for you? How much of it did you eat already?' 

I also think he has Munchausen's syndrome- where he constantly thinks he is dramatically sick in some way. Recently, he thinks he has needed surgery on his shoulder, surgery on his forearms, thinks he hurt his eardrum, and injured his back and can’t walk. All of these ended up not being anything, and every time I come home from college it’s something different. Any money he gets he spends on expensive tests and MRI scans, racking up bills and debts he cannot pay off. He goes to the gym every day and is a lot healthier than the average person, so none of these illnesses make sense to have if he’s able to swim a mile a day and squat 250 lbs (I’ve been to the gym with him). 

It's not like he wasn't raised right- My mom raised us the same way, I attend a prestigious university on almost a full scholarship for engineering, and secured an internship in NYC. I actively work on my own to I try to get anything I want in life, be humble and listen to people as much as I can. My mother is kind and generous, and I learned everything in life from her. I don't understand how he turned into such an asshole, and it’s not like he grew up depraved and without human contact.

Anyway, I could go on and on about how he’s entitled and piece of shit. He's a total loser and lets his pride get in the way of everything, and me and my mother can't take it any longer. Speaking to him is like walking on eggshells- if he hears something he doesn’t like he will shut down and forever be resistant to that idea in the future. He just needs so much to be corrected with himself that I don’t know how to help him.

Prior to that he had received a $35,000 payment from an insurance company and in 2 months had spent the entire thing. Some on debt, some on a car, and most (I'm assuming) on drugs.

Anyways, car still didn't start, I had it towed to my mechanic, and I had broken a rod which means the engine is shot. 

Backing up a few years... when I was 16, I saw a beautiful antique trumpet at my local music store. Incredibly unique, old, and still had a fantastic sound. I saved up all summer and made payments to the owner, and by the time summer was over, I had it all paid off ($1,000).  

I originally attended university to study trumpet, but after one semester, I knew that I did not want to play for the rest of my life. Music is still a huge part of my everyday life, but I am no longer studying the performing aspect of music (which means I don't really need the trumpet). 

My question is, should I sell the trumpet to try and get a head start on buying a used car? I am in college still, and only make enough to put maybe $100 a month away towards a new car. I'm hesitant though; this trumpet truly is an old piece of art that I had always imagined would stay in my family.

I dont remember exactly how we were introduced to each-other but we clicked immediately. Infact, that night we hooked up in her car. Unbeknownst to me, my close friend, who I will call C, had been crushing on her for months, but had not scored like I did. I felt bad but this girl was a catch. For the next several nights we were hooking up and even had sex. 
But than the weekend came around and I had to fly down to Miami to visit my sister. I start to noticed via Social Media that S and C are hanging out even while we were flirting through text messages. I felt something very off about it and texted C telling him that we are just being played by S. He liked her ALOT and didnt want to stop, so I decided that I didnt want to be apart of the games she was playing and stopped talking to her. One week later S and C are dating. This is literally one week after i just had sex with her. 
They end up dating the entire summer. Than comes the School Year. S and I attended the same Community College while C went off to his University. S and me never stopped hanging out but it wasn't sexual. We end up making alot of memories but there was ALWAYS this elephant in the room, this weird tension that I dont know how to describe. Months later, during one of S and C many ""break-ups"" I asked her if things would be any different if I never went to Miami and she said Yes. Since it had been a year since we met and since the damage had already been done I kind of just accepted it as it was and moved on. Flash forward to August and me and S are attending the same 4-year university. Her and C have officially broken up. S and I just cant seem to get away from each other and there is some SERIOUS sexual tension going on. Whenever we go out she will grab my hand and pull me through the bar to get to the front, she'll grab my face and my arm, she even slept over at my house the other night.

257,"        My friend and I had a disagreement. We were best friends for over 3 years. We would talk a lot to each other. Since he is older than me, I am 22 and he is 30 I would ask him for advice regarding life, dating, education, career, and etc. 
He said that he thinks that I am rejecting men for no reason and isolating myself. I tell him all of the time that I am not and that I am just being patient for the right guy. Many of the men who approach me aren't being serious and eventually show themselves out. I feel like I am being punished for not persuing something that is not good for me. 
    We had a big disagreement on Friday. He thought I was ignoring his text and calls but I fell asleep. I asked him if he is safe and ok but he never replied to any of my messages. This morning I asked him about the Las Vegas incident because he has a relative there and he thanked me for asking but then told me he no longer feels comfortable with our friendship.
   That really broke my heart. I looked at him like an older brother. I am sooooo heartbroken and distraught. It is like I am losing a sibling. I asked him if we could talk tonight and he has not answered me yet. He is a very sure person so once he makes a decision he makes one. I do not get what I did wrong. I have apologized and I am still crying. I cried at work and on my way home.
    How can I get over this friendship that has ended? I imagined him being a lifetime friend, but I guess I was wrong. Please help me. ",02Oct2017,3
258,"Hello, I am Zoinks. I am 20 years old. I live at home. I just graduated beauty school. I am licensed in my state, I have passed all my state boards. 

I went to a beauty school well known in the town for being a shit show. The owner only cares about making money and tends not to teach anything about hairdressing. Most of my learning was from on my own doing. 

I was hired at a well known company known for accepting new hairdressers fresh out of beauty school. I worked there three weeks. They trained me, they told me repeatedly that they understood I was a baby in this world, and they understood my beauty school didn't help me out any. They scheduled me in to go to their training seminar in our capitol, they bought me a practice doll, and they helped one on one. Today I was scheduled to work the night shift. They haven't let me cut any real people. I was very excited that they might let me tonight, so I could show them I've been practicing everything they've taught.

They fired me. They told me they didn't have the resources to train me, and they needed someone on the floor immediately. I was basically told I was more trouble than I worth.

That location was great for me. They provide a lot of training, they're well known for accepting new people to the hairdressing world. And to be frank, I don't even want to be a hairdresser. I loved it there because you only worked six hours a day, the clients were provided for you, and you worked for an hourly rate. Also, there was no color or perming only cuts. Basically I don't want to be a ""real"" hairdresser. I just want something to pay my student loans off while I figure out what I actually want to do.

I have no idea what I'm suppose to do with my life. I have no idea where I'm suppose to go. If I'm not even decent enough to start out at a place just for new people, where am I suppose to go?",02Oct2017,1

261,"Hi, so I'm a 14 year old girl and I struggle with body image issues. Just a month ago, I have noticed stuff from my room going missing, moved to another place, my laptop and my diary opened and curtains (which are always closed) weirdly open.

The thing is, I don't let anyone else come inside my room, I clean up after my own messes, everyone in my family knows this. And I believe that this is a huge infiltration of my privacy. Worse, when I asked our helpers, they said they saw my stepfather go to the back of the house and look into my window while I was either changing or hanging out in my room. (My room's on the 1st floor)

I am 100% sure he watches me change as one time, I saw a pair of eyes look through my curtains and I didn't think anything about it. But now, I'm sure about it. I told my mother about it and she says he probably just checking if I've been up to bad stuff or whatnot. She won't take any action against this and I'm terrified that he might do something if this continues on.

What should I do?

263,"I have been sharing a house with the same person for a few years but now I want to move out. The reason I want to move is because I don't like living with this person anymore. I find being around her to be quite stressful and I already have enough problems to deal with. I don't want to live in a place that I can never relax in. The only thing stopping me from moving out is that I feel guilty if I just leave my roommate because she cannot afford to live here on her own. She doesn't have a job at the moment because she was laid off two months ago and has yet to find another job. It can be difficult to find jobs in the small city that we live in. I know people that have spent 6 months to a year looking for jobs, and even then the jobs they find are only part time. 

I don't know what to do. I can wait around until she finds a job, but I have no idea how long that could take. If I move out I feel like I am responsible for causing the financial difficulty she will face when I leave. 

I'm very confused about this and just want some advice or to know what you would do in this situation. 

Thanks :)

I've become so apathetic to everything - so numb inside. Nothing brings me excitement anymore. The major highlight of my life was writing a car commercial that would've starred Robert Downey Jr. but never got made. I was still paid quite a bit of money for my work, which I spent up within a year or so, instead of investing it (because I'm an irresponsible idiot). I've distanced myself from and closed myself off to all my friends, and pretty much burned all my bridges. All I want to do is scream and cry all the time but instead I just suppress my emotions or finding ways to distract myself. I've lost complete sight of my future / goals and feel like I'll never bounce back, just keep spiraling downward until my wife can no longer tolerate me and I end up homeless and alone.

270,"I have a bit of a problem right now traveling... 

Tiny back story of the problem: So i have double nationality in both Sweden and Chile. Although i'm born in Chile. This April of 2017 I wanted to visit Chile for a longer time, so i traveled and came into the country as a SWEDISH (aka tourist with 90 day visa). Before the 90 days passed, my dad (that lives here permanent) told me that we should go out as swedish, and enter as chilean, so that we no longer need to worry about the 90 day visa. We didn't think much more about it, so we did.
I got to stamp in my Swedish passport that i've gone out of chile, the 12th of July. Ever since i'm here as a Chilean.

Now the problem:
It's now time to travel back to my home, in Sweden. And it suddenly hit me that holy damn, i'm not here as a swedish anymore, i'm here as a chilean. And i don't even have chilean passport, only ID (which is the root of the problem). Why is this a problem, well, i didn't enter Chile with my swedish identication, so in the ''system'' i'm not here, right? Meaning my tourist visa is finished. 

I just need advice, my flight is in 15 hours and i'm starting to panic, should i go to the embassy tomorrow before the flight? will they not let me pass? 

TL;DR. Entered Chile with Swedish passport, exited the country as Swedish, came in again as Chilean. Now i'm leaving Chile with Swedish passport. And no tourism visa. (hope this makes sense)

279,"A year ago I had a sedated surgical abortion. (I don't care for negative opinions on this, pls leave)

It was traumatic for me. Not losing the pregnancy, but the whole procedure itself. 

I was already terrified of surgery beforehand but the actuality of it only sent my phobia into over-drive. I had so much dread and fear beforehand which I do for all medical procedures (I'm chronically ill so I've had plenty of scary tests done etc and they don't get easier I always react really badly) The anaesthetic caused burning pain in my neck, when I came around I was in so much pain and every nurse completely ignored me and I felt like I was in a nightmare screaming and no sound came out because they were so reluctant to acknowledge my existence or pain and then I watched them to do the same to the next girl who came into the room scared and half-sedated. When I was aware and conscious I was fainting every time I tried to stand up. I had nightmares for weeks because the whole idea of what they did while I was sedated (I have no memory) freaks me the fuck out. All I remember was how much they were rushing once I was in the theatre and that terrifies me, like being in a rush with surgical tools up and around my intimate areas, the thought of it and having no memory of what happens next it sends shivers down my spine. I bled for three months afterwards.

Anyway once this was out of my mind I was fine as I didn't need to think about it, so I've never pursued any counselling etc.

The issue is I'm having an unrelated surgery in a week and for the last week, I've been an anxious mess, verging panic attacks at 1 am, freaking the hell out about how suddenly it's so soon, I'm having nightmares and flashbacks. My doctor gave me valium which is hit and miss for night times. Every person I talk to about the fact I have a phobia (I don't really explain why it's as bad as it now is) says ""it's going to be fine"" which is absolutely no use to me at all as I'm fully aware it's unlikely there will be complications in surgery. What I'm freaking out about is what is 100% going to happen, surgery. There's something about the thought of knowing I'm next in the theatre or when I'm on my way into the theatre that's really freaking me out. What the hell can I do in one week to help with this? I'm also going to have to have a draining tube left in me overnight and that is something I just don't think I can deal with. I've had blood tests every 6 weeks ~ for 2 years and I can only face them with numbing cream and distracting my self even now (which is an improvement from fainting every time too be fair) let alone a tube sticking out of me over night..

282,"So here's the story so far. 

Basically since freshman year, I've had a roadblock in my way, making it very difficult to keep up with my studies. During freshman year, I had multiple operations which left me with an ileostomy bag, kept me in and out of the hospital and limited my school attendance. Then, during sophomore year, my mom passed away from a very long fight with breast cancer. During those two years of freshman and sophomore year, I developed habits of not studying as much as I should've, and as a result I performed poorly throughout most of those years, my only saving grace being midterms and finals. But now, with nothing holding me back this year, I find myself in a very disheartening and deflating rut. I can't seem to make myself do any work. I tell myself that I am going to go home and do my homework, only to find myself three hours later with nothing done. I've tried going to the library after school, which has helped more than I thought it would, but being the older brother of three sisters who are not of driving age yet makes me the one who has to drive my sisters to and from school, sports and different activities throughout the day while my dad is at work, making it very difficult to find a good routine that I can stick to. 

In all truth and honesty, I'm scared to death. I know -- trust me, I KNOW -- that I need to get myself out of this very dark hole I've dug myself into. But no matter how hard I try, once I get home, I can't bring myself to do it. I don't want to. I want to get into a good college with my friends and have a good time, but I just fear so much for what is happening now that I can't even begin to imagine such a future for myself if I continue on this self-destructive path. And, not to sound haughty, I do consider myself a smart individual, but one who just doesn't work as hard as I should. I get distracted easily, and my mind wanders off a lot, sometimes at fault of my own, sometimes not.

285,"I really need help in kicking a habit, and am looking for advice on how to stop this. I have what you would call a sexual fetish. It has to do with female wrestling. I am a life long wrestling fan, and about 5 years ago I found out that there are websites where up and coming female wrestlers visit and provide fans with the opportunity to commission matches and photo shoots of them in almost any scenario.

It started off as me buying the already filmed matches and photo sets. Usually about $9.99 to $24.99. Then once I landed my first job in 2013, I started commissioning my own picture sets. I don't think the content is important to mention here, but eventually these sites restrictions started to annoy me and I wanted more.

So I began to reach out to female wrestlers privately via email and Facebook. I began to ask them if I could commission these pictures and videos directly with them for more money but with less restrictions in terms of attire and content.

This has been going on now for about 2 years. Its really getting out of control, as most nights I will get drunk or high and just start messaging any and all Facebook profiles asking for these requests.

I am 27 years old, I make 55k per year. I have a girlfriend who I live with and have been dating for 5 years. It has gotten to the point where I have a fake Facebook, Twitter, and Email account that I use for all of these requests. So far, YTD I have blown $9,500 on these custom requests.

My girlfriend wants to get married and so do I, but I dont want to get engaged and start planning a wedding with only $7k.
