8,"I'm 12, if that is relevant. My problems are not dire, i just need help on organizing my thoughts and fixing certain areas.

1. I'm bad at math. I don't know why, all my friends are really great at it. I can't problem solve.

2. I used to be so bright, so innocent, and very smart. Ever since Sixth grade(last year), I changed. I know masturbate(I can't stop), and I'm very slow at many things. I want to become my younger self again.

3. I want to be charming, and make my teachers like me. Any advice on how to be a charismatic, charming girl?

4. Self-control. I lack it, and therefore my whole life is going downhill.

5. There is this girl, my friend. She is very calm and is always so intelligent. Enroll her in anything, and she will ACE it. How can I be like her?

6. Is it too late to change my ways? I'm so afraid my life will go to waste. Recently, I had a dream where I died because I chose to, and I asked the angel/devil whether my name would have been known for doing something great if I had lived. The being hesitated, and said, ""I'm afraid not, you see, you did have potential, but you lost it.""

I woke up in cold sweat.

7. This is the ideal me: I am quiet. I can strike up a conversation with even an adult and they will love me. I am a pro at tennis, and therefore I am skinny. I am great at everything, my focus is unrivaled. My parents are proud of me. My reputation is great: ""Alicewithjoker? She's AMAZING, you know, you should be more like her."" I'm like a child genius, you know, one of those kids that are like adults. Chess, I am great at. I never forget anything. I am wonderful and an amazing student.

What can I do to be like that person?

I will probably add more, but that's it for now. 
Thanks!

12,"Hello my name is abigail and im 16 years old, my father passed away last year and I was completely heart broken I didn't know how to deal with it, I still dont know how to deal with it. It was a big traumatic even that happend and I lost my best friend and my king. My dad was everything to me, he was always there for me. Btw my parents split up when I was at a young age so I grew up having 2 different lives. Ive lived with my mom since I was 7 but I got to visit my dad a lot. I just found out almost a week ago he left me money, not going to say how much because it doesn't matter but now my mother wants to spend it and buy stuff with it. I don't want that. I don't want the money period. I want my dad back the money means nothing to me but I dont want my mom to have it and use it for personal gain. My problem is that How do i stop her from even touching the money. I ask because I know my dad wouldn't have wanted me to give it to her or left her use it for a selfish reason nor I for a selfish reason. He would want me to save it for college or give it to kids for education because my dad always liked to help kids who wanted a better education to help their families. And she seems really excited to have the money she keeps telling me things she wants to buy and have and I can't help to feel like its wrong and I dont want that.

Our church is dying, the 40 or so people who attend each week are mostly in the 80-90s. Meaning there is only about 7 people in the choir. They told me that when I'm 15, they will make me join the choir and ""you will like it, and if you don't, you will pretend to like it"" which honestly sounds like a threat.

15,"So I'm 18 years old, and I'm kinda broke, so in order to have a drink on occasion, I like to brew my own alcohol instead of buying it, as it saves a bit. So I bought yeast and some juice, and I made my own hooch/wine. Well, I keep it in the garage since I live in a year-round cold climate in the US, though its well hidden. The other day, my parents were cleaning out the garage while I wasn't home all day. I did not find out until today, where I then went to go check on my alcohol, and it was gone. Sure enough, I found the emptied bottle in the recycling bin. Funny thing is, my parents found the alcohol, but never said anything all week; its been roughly 6 days since they found it. My parents are super religious and strict, and within the last week, have been even more strict and worrying (or I may just be paranoid). I asked this week if I could take a trip with some friends over the summer for a few days, since I'm finishing high school, and they were really strict on saying no, since people will be drinking and stuff, they think. (Could just be bad timing)

So basically, I guess I'm wondering, do you think its likely that my parents didn't notice it was alcohol they threw out, since it was in a juice bottle?  For what its worth, they are usually rather naive about these things. Or do you think they realized, and that could explain their recent behavior? If so, should I say anything? Or could I just be really paranoid and their response to the trip would've been that anyway? (I think it would have honestly). Sorry for being so long, just not sure what to do :/

**TL;DR:** Parents threw out alcohol made in juice bottle, didn't say anything to me yet, could they have not noticed, or should I say something?",15Jan2017,1

20,"First let me explain, I have had little to no luck with women my entire life. I have been cheated on, ditched and straight up told I'm ugly or 'not worth it'. Last year I met someone who had similar troubles and it was great to have a friend and have someone who actually understands. Then outta the blue he finds this girl (one of his sister's friends) and soon they start dating. This girl is like a 1/million chance of finding a girl. She's beautiful, funny and easy to talk to. The part that stings the most is i'm a huge horror fan and so is she. My friend isn't really. But now my friend has changed, he won't shut up about how she was amazing in bed and bragging how he's no longer a virgin. And he has become somewhat inconsiderate. I shared with him a dark detail about my past about how I was taken advantage of sexually, it's one of the main reasons I took me so long to start pursuing girls. But him he's been lucky and she literally comes out of fucking no where and I can't stand it. He's 3 years younger than I am and he's had no where near as bad a treatment from women as I have. At first I was bitterly jealous and now i'm just depressed. I keep trying with dating but I can't find anyone like her. Someone's who's as gorgeous as she is, as funny and caring. It's become so bad I've talked to my therapist about it many times. And I know this makes no difference but I've even gotten mad at God for it. Everyday I wake up in tears and look over to the side of the bed where my girlfriend would be if she existed and say ""Where are you?"" It sucks to be a young male who knows he not ugly and live alone. I always wanted a love where I met someone while we were younger (late teens-early 20 period) that seems to be when most people meet. But soon i'll be running out of time! She talks to me sometimes and unintentionally pours salt on the wound by telling me how happy i'm going to make some girl and that me and her are so unique it's hard for us to find people. If I only met her first.. my question is should I just tell her how I feel? And/or tell her it hurts too much to try and be her friend. ",15Jan2017,1
21,"Long read, there is a tl;dr on bottom.

I am a 29 year old Female.

I have lived with my Grandparents for about 6 years now.  Helping care for them cook, clean, etc.  While working very part-time from home, living mostly on my savings.

Grandma needed the most help, her dementia was pretty severe towards the last couple years of her life.  Grandma passed away about 2 years ago.  

About 3 months after Grandma passing, my Uncle's home caught on fire.  It didn't spread too much, fixable.  But with it being winter, he and his cat came to stay with my Grandparents (and I), while he worked on repairing it.  Meanwhile, his daughter set up a gofundme type account for him, to help repair his home.  

After Grandma passing, Grandpa (90 years old at the time), understandably, was highly depressed.  He stopped doing much, sat around watching TV.  I'd sit right next to him, holding his hand and we'd mourn together.

During that time, my Uncle stopped ""working on his home"", which from what people witness, was him only sitting in his yard reading on his kindle.  He switched to sitting in Grandpa's garage, reading, avoiding Grandpa's grieving.

After it became cooler again, my Uncle came in to read/watch TV in the same room as Grandpa.  But still in his on world.

Meanwhile, about a year ago, I needed to start working full time again, after 6 years I had depleted my savings and wasn't making enough part-time at home.  Seeing as my Uncle, being like 58, should be well enough to care for Grandpa's basic needs as needed.  

I would leave prepared food in the fridge for them, so it would be simple to care for Grandpa.

Well, about a month of my going back to work, I find out that my Uncle is planning a 3 week trip to Texas to visit his adult children.  Did my Uncle tell me?  No, his Daughter emailed around to see who would give him a lift to the airport.  He never did mention it until literally ONE day prior,  and only to make sure I'd feed his cat.

So, panicked that I had no one to help Grandpa out.  One of my Brother's  stepped in, doing so well.. better than my Uncle ever had.

Grandpa admitted to hoping my Uncle would stay with his kids, that my Uncle would get upset with him for not understanding things, or would just ignore him.

My Brother couldn't stay forever, he has 3 young kids and a job to get back to.  

Back again, my Uncle came home with a new tablet.  Which is what all his focus goes to, that or on the phone with one of my Aunts (his Sister).  He'll be on that phone for hours at a time.

-From unmentioned family Drama, I know he talks about me to my Aunt, and not so nice things.

-He doesn't help out around the home- cooking, cleaning, etc. I do all that.

-He gives Grandpa his lunch and breakfast(prepared by me), and 4:00 pm pills.. and that's it.  

-No helping Grandpa remember to shower or get dressed.

-No taking Grandpa to appointments, or pick up pills.

-He does the least possible.  

-His cat pees on stuff

-He, after several notices and chances to care for his ACTUAL home, the city took his house.  They claimed it to be abandoned and a few other things.  My Sister offered to buy it off him for a more than fair price but he declined.

-Who knows what he did with that money people donated to him, didn't go to the house, that's for sure.



My Uncle already spent like 20 years mooching off my Grandparents prior.. and now he's doing it to me.

His home was pretty much given to him in exchange for some handyman jobs by one of my Aunts.

The other Aunt that he is on the phone with ALL the time, thinks he deserves handouts.

I am getting fed up.  I feel like when I leave Grandpa, it is neglect.  I come home stressed, having to care for someone like my Uncle.

I have no idea what to do, I can't live like this much more.

Grandpa is lonely in his own home and his own Son is 'with him' all the time.  It shouldn't be that way.

tl;dr:  My Uncle is a lazy, mooch, who does the bare minimum care for my Grandpa: heats up food I made, and Pills.  While I am juggling work and doing everything else for all of us.

Help me out on what to do.  I want to move out, but I can't abandon Grandpa like that.

25,"Posted this to the wrong subreddit last time. Hope it is in the right place now.

About me:

I cannot imagine a life without woods to walk through. I want to live in a very rural area far from a city. I wish to seek employment either in a gardening/nursery center or through illustration (work conducted mostly online). As long as I have a bathtub, electric, running water, and an internet connection, I think I'd be happy. I don't want to get rich. I make my food from scratch (I can forage when seasonal and I am learning the laws about hunting and trapping to take it up in a few years.) and I plan to garden for some food, too. I taught myself to can jam last summer. I really like the quiet life and I'm not joking when I say that my plants are my closest friends. I have no religion and I don't fit on the standard political spectrum, but I don't talk religion or politics with anyone. Also, I like the mountains but I'll be happy as long as there are forests, even it's a flat area.

28,"I own my own home and have a couple of guys who rent rooms off me. Is it unreasonable of me to expect they keep them a reasonably tidy standard? 

Both of them look like a sows crate and it pisses me off each time I walk past them and have to look at it. I don't ask them to do anything around the house and I pretty much all the cleaning for the rest of the house. The advertisements always stipulates someone tidy and I also mention I expect their rooms to be at a reasonable standard. Nothing outrageous but being able to see the floor would help.

One of them is actually using some items I have provided one of these being a bed which now hasn't had any sheets on it for at least 2 weeks so he is just sleeping on a bare mattress which I think is really unhygienic and the mattress will need to be steam cleaned if I was to let anyone else use it. I went out this morning and brought him a mattress protector. Previously I'd used a blanket which he also clearly isn't bothered with. 

They are nice guys and we all get on well but I've had problems with people in the past including one flatmate who damn near set fire to the house on two separate occasions but throwing newspaper and clothes over unattended heaters. His room was treated like a shit tip as well. 

I never set foot in their rooms but if I have people over I have to close their doors cause it is embarrassing. They are grown men not teenagers and I am not their mother. I'm not a naturally tidy person myself. I get it. But at least make some kind of effort. 

It might sound stupid but it's true mess causes damage. I didn't spend $1500 on getting some gorgeous curtains made so they could have mould growing on them because you pile wet towels and clothes in the corners or scratching up the native hardwood floors with piles of crap or turning it into a cat feeding station.

29,"(I'm a guy)
So over the summer we established a core group of friends, 6-7 of us and we became really close. Over time however for some reason I've become frequently annoyed and disenfranchised with one of them. (We are the only co-workers so maybe I've spent too much time with her)

However, this person is essentially the matriarch of the group, everyone looks to her for advice and is viewed as purely as a human could be. If we were a cult she would be the leader.

I still love the rest of the group, they're some of my favorite people but this hatred has become mutual and I'm now being invited to less and less hangouts because of our disdain. Again I still really enjoy the rest of our group but I specifically can't click with her

Should I jump ship and try to keep some of the ties or should I power through and try to see better?

30,"I'm a 26 year old male who is going through divorce after a 3 year marriage. The marriage was a disaster and it's probably good it ended, but I'm feeling completely lost.

I ended up quitting my good job in HR recently too because I fucking hated it. I really was only doing it to afford the lifestyle my wife wanted. I had tried to pursue other career paths several times but she always put her foot down so I stayed doing jobs I hated for stability and money. Maybe I quit for the wrong reasons, like just ""fuck you ex-wife, I can do what I want now!"" But I really did hate working in HR. It's just sort of the first good opportunity that happened when I was first married. I knew a guy who knew a guy, etc. it was not what I wanted to do. But now I don't know what to do or even where to start. 

I moved back in with my parents for a few months because it was the only option I had, but I just moved into a house with some good friends I used to live with in college. They're good friends, but somewhat immature or something... which sounds mean, but it's just that I was married and had a corporate job and they still work dead-end jobs and smoke weed and drink all the time and occasionally do other drugs. The house is a mess too. I'm not a snob about smoking weed or anything, but it's not something I want to fall back into the habit of doing often again and I definitely have a drinking problem that has gotten better since the divorce, but I want to be careful.

32,"I am Ojus, a 19 year old male, about to turn 20 in a month and a few weeks, and I am currently lost in life. I have no direction; no idea of what it is that I want to do or where I want to go or how I will get somewhere. About 1 and a half years ago, I had a set path I wanted to take. I knew what it is I wanted to do in my life, where I wanted to go, and how I would achieve it. In high school, I was an A+ student, who was a member of a few clubs, and had great relationships with his teachers. I also had very few friends, but those friends mattered very much to me. I also cared a lot for my family and what they thought of me, and I always went to my family when I needed advice. Fast forward to the present, and I see an Ojus that is very ashamed of what he has become, and an Ojus that doesn’t know what to do next to get back up in life. 


About a year and a half ago, I knew what colleges I was going to be attending, as well as what career path I had chosen. My first semester of college was in the fall of 2015 as an architectural engineering major, and that semester I did alright for a first time college student. I was in two clubs, and I was making connections with multiple people in those clubs. I was making a few friends, close friends, with whom I knew I could hang out with. I was also doing alright in my classes, and by the end I received 1 F, 2 C’s, 1 B, and 1 A. As a student who had great grades in high school, those grades did make me a little discouraged, but at the same time they were no surprise to me. It was of no surprise because of how different college was to high school and how ill prepared I was for that. I also know that throughout that semester I never sought for help on subjects or classes, even when I needed it. There was also a change in my personality that semester. I for the first time in my life lied because I didn’t want to hurt people. I realized too late that when my loved ones find out I lied, they will be hurt even more. I was keeping my grades a secret and whenever my dad asked me about them, I just said they are great even though they were mediocre grades. During my first semester of college, there was a definite negative change in my morals and ethics, as well as my personality and what values I hold true to myself. 


During my winter break of 2015, something did happen in my life that I don’t think affected the outcome of me now, but sometimes I do have doubts that it may have had a little bit of an affect on me. On December 22nd of 2015, my grandma died as she was holding both my older brothers’ and my hands. I miss her very much, but I never shed a tear, I was the brave one, the one cheering all the others up. I don’t think the death of my grandma was something that affected me to get me to where I am in life now. My grand ma will always be an inspiration and a role model to me. 


Now we go to my second semester of college, the spring of 2016. Before this semester started, my father found out about my grades, and he was very disappointed, but my older brother was very understanding. He told me, it happens, college is very different from high school, and mostly everyone, even A students, do poorly their first semester. After this I knew I needed to do the spring semester differently, but it’s one thing to know something whereas, it’s another to act upon it. During the beginning of the semester I was doing better than last semester, but sometime during February I started to go downhill. I stopped going to the clubs I was in, as well as stopped taking care of the friendships I had created. I was still going to my classes, but I wasn’t paying attention at all in those classes. It just became something I did, not something I wanted to do, which was drive to school, stay there, and drive back. I wasn’t studying anymore either, instead I was focusing my energy into video games, YouTube, Netflix, and more “distractions.” I ended up receiving all F’s that semester and I did the same thing to my family members again; I lied to them about my grades. That summer I told my dad the truth, and he got very angry. I knew I had lost his trust by now, and slowly I knew I was becoming a different human being. My brother again was the one that was more relatable and wasn’t angry but instead was asking me a lot of questions. I now understand those questions but back then all I was saying was IDK, or I would just make an excuse. During my second semester I know I failed in life even more to the extent that I thought that was the ultimate low I can go. 


During the summer, near the end, I started to be a rebel to my dad, started arguing more, and a week before the start of the 2016 fall semester he stopped talking to me. The last thing he said to me was” you have changed into someone different whom I don’t trust anymore, I am your father and I will give you food and a home etc., but I will not prosper this relationship anymore. When this happened, I like a stupid person accepted it and just let it happen, I didn’t even say sorry, that’s how stubborn I was. 


Next is my third and last semester, the fall of 2016, the worst semester. This semester started out even more worse as I started school a week late. I again kept on telling myself, talk to your counselor, and your teachers, but I eventually didn’t do that. I never went to a single one of my classes, and all I would do is go to campus, find a building to sit in and watch YouTube, or Reddit, Netflix, etc. I did at the beginning find out a high school friend of mine was attend my college (who was going onto senior year of high school as I was going onto freshman year of college in 2015), so I called him and we met up. For the first few weeks I kept in touch with him, but then I stopped growing that relationship up. Near the second half of the semester I started to not even go to campus, instead I would go to my local library, or the mall, or just go to a park. I started to waste my time, and not do anything worthwhile anymore. As you can guess, I received F’s for all my classes, and that semester I was on academic probation, I am now on dismissal, meaning I can’t go back to that college. I wasn’t necessarily lying to my dad because since he wasn’t talking to me, he wasn’t asking for updates on my grades, but I still haven’t told him nor any other family member about my grades yet and my decision to drop out. By the end of this semester I knew that at this moment in my life, college is not my place to be, and I also knew my past self was now only a ghost to present me. 


I want to note that now my dad and I are in a better relationship then we were a few months ago. We have started to talk to each other, and we don’t argue as much now.


So I just want to say with everything that I have done in the last 1 and a half years, I know for a fact that for all of last year I was insane. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. I was doing that in my college life, my personal life, my social life, and my family life. I might have told myself I need to learn from my past mistakes, but that never turned into actual actions. I slowly went into a slump, where I am now addicted to video games, YouTube, Netflix, and other pleasurable things. This year I vowed to myself that I will be not insane anymore, I also vowed to myself that I will lower my addictions to “distractions”. 


In this part of my essay, I would like to go into detail what I mean by addiction. When I say addicted to distractions, I mean I now only spend time on Reddit, YouTube, Netflix, video games, Discord, and Skype. I don’t care for anything else, and usually I don’t have the motivation to do anything else. All I am today is a couch potato, who has no reason in life anymore. I have started to lower my addictions this month, Slowly limiting myself the time I have for these “distractions” on a day to day basis. 


I ask you all for what it is I should do, guidance, but first let me describe what I think it is I should do, or at least an idea I have. I know for a fact I don’t want to go to college right now, but I do know that I still want to continue learning. I am considering looking into apprenticeships, as well as learning from experiences. I am also looking into getting a job, seeing the best opportunities a high school degree can achieve, and seeing which of those opportunities I like. I also know that I want to reconnect with older friends as well as make new ones, make my social life better again. I said awhile ago, one can become knowledgeable through experiences, and I know I want to do this during this time. I feel like it will help me figure out what it is I want to do in life as well as learn more knowledge. I agree my time to have done this would have been in college, but I ruined that, so now I need to do it through a different method, even if it’s the harder method. I also know that I need to grow my family relations back up as well, not just with my dad but with everyone, as well as myself. Whenever I look in the mirror, I am very ashamed of the person looking back at me, and I know that one of my goals is to change this into acceptance. I want to be able to look in the mirror and be proud and very accepting of the person looking back at me. 


The question I ask you is what job opportunities do you think would be best for my current situation, as well as what other things I need to do to get back on my feet. How I should go about refurbishing my social, personal, family relationships. As well as how I should figure out who I am to the extent that I am accepting of myself. 


I am very sorry that this is a very long read, but I have trouble being concise, plus I thought there would be more understanding if I wrote about the whole experience of me going downhill. 


Thanks soooo much for taking the time to read this and for all the advice and guidance, I appreciate it. :D

33,"I work as a PIC at Panda Express. I started as a counter girl and have since become the only girl to be able to run the kitchen solo.  As a PIC (person in charge), I act as an extension of my GM when he isn't at our store. 
For the most part, I lead our closing crew, which consists of two front of house employees (including myself), a dishwasher, and our cook. 
When I first started working here, I had a reputation for being really sweet and kind of a push over. But then I became a PIC and my job changed from making sure I do everything right to making sure everyone else does their job right. 
The kitchen crew constantly undermines me. Most recently, I instructed the cook to wait until a half hour before closing time to shut down and close the grill. It takes 10 minutes to cook a batch of grilled teriyaki chicken (one of our most popular items), and if we shut it down too early we run the risk of running out of food and having to cook more, after taking the time to scrub it down. 
This particular cook is an 18 year old boy, who in my opinion doesn't take me seriously because I'm a little 20 year old girl. After I told him not to close it, I heard him say that I was stupid and he was going to close it anyway. He was trying to be sneaky, but since I heard I wasn't going to let it slide. I told him once more not to close it, this time more stern. He rolled his eyes and the whole kitchen proceeded to ""whisper"" about how annoying and rude I am, and how I don't know what I'm talking about. 
This same cook has been known to leave a wok full of boiling oil burning unattended for ten minutes before he remembers. He constantly disregards food safety guidelines and acts like I'm inconveniencing him when I correct his actions. 
But he will listen to my male coworkers if they tell him the exact same things I do. 
So, last night I asked him to sit down and have a chat with me after work. 
I explained to him how hurt and disrespected I feel when I work with him, and how I'm only trying to do my job. I apologized for sometimes coming off aggressive, and told him I was going to work on it, and asked how he would like me to approach him in the future, and he interrupted to say that I'm not aggressive, he just finds me super annoying and that I piss him off. 
I don't care about being annoying. I just want him to do his job safely and correct.
He told me when I correct him about leaving hot oil burning I'm annoying because I sound like his mom, and he doesn't have to listen to me because I'm a front counter girl, not a cook. 
I explained to him that I might be a counter girl, but I've done his job before and there's a reason my boss trusts me to run the store. I explained to him Panda values, and how we value being proactive, which means not closing the grill so we can avoid having to go the extra step further to correct an avoidable mistake.
He got angry and told me everyone agrees that I'm annoying and that I'm not better than him. 
I just don't know what to do. If I'm too nice, they don't take me seriously. If I'm serious and stern, they think I'm being a bitch.
And this cook isn't the only one who treats me like this! It's my whole team. 
I'm hoping to find a solution or a better approach to try before I bring the issue to the attention of my manager.
Please help!!",15Jan2017,11

42,"So, where to begin? I met my friend S about four or five years ago, he seemed nice, chatty, etc., and I suspected he had a slight crush on me. I didn't think anything of it as our friendship was pretty innocent and I wasn't interested in him. 

Fast forward about a year, we started hanging out more frequently, I began to value his opinion and thoughts on things and I felt like we were becoming good friends. Then he asked me if I would ever consider sleeping with him to which I responded ""uh...I don't think so, we're really good friends and I don't want to ruin our friendship"". I assumed that pretty much cleared it up and figured he got the hint that I wasn't interested, but it's become clear to me and everyone around me that he's still hoping I'll decide to begin a relationship with him. 

And, what was just one awkward conversation about the boundaries of our friendship has become this uncomfortable topic I try to avoid. I can't even mention someone I find cute or someone I'm seeing as he gets upset and at times a bit...angry. I had kept it all to myself until I went on one of his social media accounts and saw numerous references to times we've hung out and personal details about myself being used as reasons on why he couldn't get laid and his hopes that I'd eventually cave and fall madly in love with him. It made me feel awful and guilty and I don't know if I'm in the wrong here, or what. I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I also feel like he thinks if he makes enough comments or waits long enough I'll cave and choose him.

43,"Hi guys! Recently I've been having a horrible issue with myself over high school. I know this isnt a big deal compared to a lot of what I've seen here, but I feel like I cant talk to my parents or friends about this until I'm sure.

I currently go to a smaller private Christian school. I've been going to this school since kindergarten and I am currently a sophomore, just started 2nd semester. However, I am somewhat unhappy at my school. Because we're a smaller school, we don't offer ANY theatre classes or  theatre clubs or shows at all. I'm pretty sure I don't want to do anything with theatre as a career, however I quite like it. As well, I am planning on probably doing something with foreign language in the future. I currently am in Spanish 2 and am the Founder and President of our National Spanish Honors Society. However, spanish is the only language my school offers. I have about 7 close friends there, four of whom are seniors and will be graduating this year. My other close friends are in my grade, and one of them I really love, he's great. However, he was thinking of possibly transferring as well but he isnt too sure. One of my other friends is quite awkward and I love her, but sometimes its too much. I just feel so trapped there and I feel like theres no room to grow. I really dislike all of my teachers except my Biology and Spanish teachers, the rest are quite bad. Next year, all of my teachers should be quite good though. Im not allowed to run for student council again next year due to a Bad incident so theres that as well. I dont necessarily hate any of my classmates at all, like I said though, I just feel as there isn't any room to grow. In addition, I have been with most of these kids since kindergarten and Im not saying I have grown tired of them but I know them all a little too well. 
If youve made it this far THANK YOU! Keep going please ;-;
My option for transferring is to a local charter school in my area. This school is actually in the top 30 or so schools in the NATION and the academics are outstanding. You have to get in by way of lottery, though. They offer four different languages and have a theatre program and club there. In contrast to only around 320 people in my current high school, there are a good 570+ people at that high school. I know a few people from church and Instagram that go there. One of the girls I talked to online about it said she didn't really like it; one of her main problems was the people. I feel like it can't be too much worse than my school though. She said the teachers are pretty good and that we have a good amount of clubs and course selections. I am pretty sure my parents would let me apply to the lottery at least, and Im almost certain theyd let me go if I got in. 
What Im really trying to say is, is it worth it to switch after sophomore year for junior and senior year to another school? Will this effect any college admissions? I know high school isnt supposed to be some fantastic, amazing experience, but I would like to have some nice memories. I know going to the other school would expand my friend group, but is it worth it to start over with college so close in the midst, only two years away? I'm planning on apply to some lower Ivies and more rigorous out of state schools because I definitely think I have the grades and ec's to make it in.
Why am I stressing so much about this? Is it wrong to want a High School Musical high school experience? Anyone advice please  ;-;

44,"So I've been dating my gf for about a year now and things are going great. One problem, and it's a problem I really haven't discussed, is her occasional pot use. She only does it with really good friends of hers but I still feel extremely hesitant and pretty uncomfortable. I've only heard her reference using it three or four times but every time it feels like a knife in my chest. And I know it isn't rational, part of it is the government's prohibitionist policy, propaganda, etc. but I also grew up in a very conservative family and constantly surrounded by really conservative media so I know that had an impact. Not to mention I was once in an emotionally abusive relationship where this guy would mention how many drugs were around him so that I would talk to him more/agree to do things with him that otherwise I wouldn't. My main question is this, even while rationally accepting the fact it isn't a big deal and it by no means is an addiction, how do you get over someone's use of the substance? I'm getting myself completely worked up over it and honestly that's the thing that bothers me the most.

So I'm a commuter student at my college who's hoping to get more involved and social for the new year. There's a sorority that I was interested in last semester but never worked up the nerve to join. But recently I've found out they're accepting new members and having an event next Saturday. Unfortunately, this conflicts with my work schedule-I work every weekend.

Normally I wouldn't be too worried about asking off. I've been there for seven months, do a good job, am rarely late, and only took one day off when I had a splitting sinus headache. But my boss recently told us that if two people were taking off on one day, then no one else could take off. So I checked the calendar to see how many people would be gone, and sure enough, there are already two people listed as taking off.

So now I'm a little hesitant to ask for the day off. Should I risk asking?

59,"I've always had a strange relationship with my father, going through periods of time where we talk frequently to periods of time where we don't talk at all. He has a history of lying and manipulating other people (my mother and his previous female partners that I've created bonds with included), and in my 23 years of life, I've been able to put most of the pieces together. In the last few years, he has had a baby with another woman and is still going strong with this family unit. He was never there for me when I was a baby and lived across the country for almost my entire life (still does). Since starting this ""new family,"" he has sent me pictures of the baby reaching all of his milestones in every single birthday and Christmas card he has sent me. This wouldn't bother me so much if less than a year before that he didn't up and leave my mother (yes, they got back together briefly and he moved back to his home state for this brief time period) AND the woman he was with prior to his second go with my mom (let's call her Sally*). Following? I know it sounds crazy, but that's what the situation is. So naturally when he tells me a baby is on the way, I ask if it was with this woman that I've known since high school (knowing they already had broken up at this point). He tells me it is with a completely different woman who I've never heard of and acts as if it's totally normal. Now not to sound superficial, but every year he would send me a card and a gift card on my birthday and for Christmas. Of course I never expect these things and I'm grateful no matter what I receive or do not receive. However, I do not think it is a coincidence that ever since this baby came along, he stopped sending me anything but a card with baby pictures inside. I understand babies are expensive, so I didn't get upset about that in particular until I stopped receiving personal messages from him. Every single ""happy whatever holiday"" was in a group text to my entire family. Every ounce of communication we had was suddenly minimized and mainstreamed to fit with a standard message to the whole family. The main focus of his life was his brand new, perfect family. Knowing the things he did to my mother and to Sally on top of the drastic decrease in communication, I lost all respect for this man. My entire life I was going out of my way to communicate with him, the adult. Now that I'm an adult as well, I've been pulling back and putting the responsibility on him since he never truly took hold of it at any other point in my life. In the last year, I haven't spoken to him other than thanking him for well wishes on the day of my college graduation. No happy birthdays or any other holidays. Until today. I received a Christmas card from him saying ""I hope you had a great xmas. I love you.... Dad,"" including a gift card and a picture of my baby brother with Santa. Here is where the conflict comes in. I saw the card, note and gift card and thought ""wow, I should really text him, this is the first I've heard from him in almost a year, maybe I should be open and honest about everything."" But when I saw the baby picture, I couldn't help but immediately become annoyed and dismiss all of those thoughts. It's not that I don't care about the baby. I would love to meet him! But I can't seem to get past the way he went about telling me the news, the way the situation came about in general with all the lies and cheating attached to it, or the way he seems to gloat about his perfect new family to the daughter he was never truly there for. Every once in a while I am overcome with guilt for not speaking to him and know that if something were to ever happen and our relationship goes unresolved, I will have guilt for that for the rest of my life. But I also know that eve if I tell myself I'm approaching a reconciliation with him with zero expectations, I will still be disappointed in some way. I'm sick of feeling like the adult in the situation and being disappointed by my parent, but the idea of feeling guilty if something were to ever happen really gets to me. It  feels like no matter what I decide, there will be some positivity and some negativity involved. I need to choose what is going to be the best decision for me in the long run, but I really do not know what that decision is...

When I was a small child and under a lot of stress I had an issue with biting or ripping off my fingernails, cuticles and hangnails, which extended to doing the same to my toenails. I grew out of it and seldom bite my fingernails when stressed anymore.

When I hit high school I ran cross country and track. I would cut my toenails short because I didn't like the way they felt as they dug into my shoes when I'd run hard. That and I built up tougher skin on the tips of my big toes, so growing them out was just a pain for me.

**Today:** I've been trying to grow my toenails out for a few months now because I'm tired of being so damn self conscious about my feet. A few days ago I was cleaning out the corners of my nails when the side of my big toenail looked the way tempered glass cases being pulled off your phone looks. Concerned, I reluctantly decided to use nail clippers to clip my toenail in that spot and ended up finding out that that corner of my nail had actually come up off the nail bed! There wasn't any blood, it toughened up, and it doesn't hurt but now my nail looks terrible! I figured it was just a one time thing until about 10 minutes ago. I got out of the shower and started drying off my feet when I snagged a piece of the towel under my other toenail. So I went to scrape it out when the same thing happened. *What the hell is wrong with my nails and what do I do?!* Its really freaking me out and it looks ugly! I'm afraid of getting an ingrown toenail. Can anyone relate or has knowledge on this king of thing?!

70,"Hi, I am coming to a crossroads in my life. The grades from my first semester at law school are coming back and they have been really bad. I've gotten 2 C's and an F. Unless I get an A in my final class (which guessing off the other two classes), I am getting kicked out of law school. I'm 22 years old and this is all I really planned for. I always dreamed of being a big city attorney and it finally was happening. I got a full tuition scholarship to a Tier 2 law school and a big city apartment; ready to conquer. But Law School was hard; it was like a different language that I had never heard of before and I had a really hard time. In my Legal Writing class, I fell behind after having a few days of feeling sick. And then I started missing deadlines, and I told myself ""Well if I turn in good work, it won't matter how late it is."" The work was solid, but late work is heavily penalized in law school, which I knew, but for some reason put in the back of my mind. I let myself get behind in all my other classes too, like an idiot, and before I knew it I was turning in Legal Writing assignments a week late and December had arrived, and I didn't feel exactly prepared for my exams. I still sat on them anyway and basically shat on them. Well, it looks like it is all coming to an end soon. My school has a no appeal policy, if and more likely when, I don't hit the GPA threshold, I won't be put on probation. I will be dismissed. I have absolutely no fucking idea what to do.

I always thought I was a smart person, and things have always had a magical way of seeming to work out for me. Until this. I was so proud of myself for making this happen by myself (with encouragement from family of course) and finally being something. But it turns out that none of this is really true. I'm incredibly afraid and alone, 1500 miles away from home. I've never failed before. No one in my very high achieving family has ever failed before. I'm so fucking scared.

So, I guess why I'm writing this is because I don't know, I'm looking for a little bit of positivity. What can I do? Do you know anyone who has been through this? What did they do? I know I've made an unruly mess here and that I am an idiot, but right now I just need someone to tell me things might be okay.",15Jan2017,6

Anyway, I've been having roommate problems. Her and her girlfriend and very petty and violent people. There are holes in doors and walls, they constantly fight and we have to always turn our tvs up, and not get involved. Because we have tried and it turns into a disaster. They eat and throw away my food that I pay for. Half the time I wait til I get to work and don't eat til late in the day because I have no food to eat. I'm actually hordeing snack food in my bedroom. They use my things without permission and break my things without telling me and hide it. They leave the house a mess and treat my things like garbage. And if I leave a dish out by accident I get screamed at. They're very manipulative and very disrespectful. 

One thing that made me really upset and made me really learn how petty they were, is they kept throwing or eating my chicken, that I had set up for meals because I'm trying to eat healthier and more affordably. And I wrote on a bag of chicken ""please do not touch"" I come home later that night and everything in the kitchens as written on saying ""don't touch!!!"" It pissed me off. I confronted her about it and she shrugged it off making it sound like I attacked her.

So I want to move out as soon as possible especially with all these holes in doors and walls.  This is something I don't want to pay for. And I can barely afford this place anyway. I'm done biting my tongue to avoid confrontation and getting kicked out. So my plan is to move out when I have the money, and get a bunch of people I know and a U HUAL when my roommates arnt home and haul all my stuff away, leaving the rent and my keys behind. 

Is this a good way of doing this? What should I do to protect myself? 

TL;DR: roommates are petty and disrespectful and violent, want to get out without them even knowing, until the last second after I've moved out, leaving behind the rent and my keys. Is this a good way to do this.

80,"My senior trip is in about 3 months. It's going to be to Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. I have never been outside of my country, which is Egypt. I really want to go with my friends but the problem is it's too expensive. It's 30k EGP which is about a year worth of rent for my family. I have already cost my family so much money with my international school and soon college. My family tells me to go and to not worry about the money. We are like in the middle class in Egypt which isn't a lot. It means we can afford minimum luxury. I don't want to miss out on this experience with my friends but at the same time i can't help but feel guilty. What should i do and please tell whether to go or not. No ""follow your guts"" or ""do what you think is best"" crap.",15Jan2017,2
82,"So let me start at the beginning. October 1st my gf and I seperate after 9 years of being together. I wont go into details because they arent important to my post but long story short she landed a better paying job then me and split without warning. This royally fucked with me, like lost my mind briefly fucked with me. 

In the same week i hit the dating app scene, im 28 havent dated anyone but my ex since i was 19 so completely new to the dating app stuff. Talked to a couple girls, ended up messaging the girl im seeing now and we hit it off. She was refreshed by the fact i didnt just send a dick pic and sex wasnt my goal with trying to meet someone.

We plan on a date after a week, then 4 days into messaging she wants to meet. Again long story short, i spent everyday with her for 2 weeks when i wasnt working. I lived in a nearby town but needed to move out of the place i was staying because i couldnt afford it at the time, so i moved in mid october with her and her sister. After several interviews i was hired into an amazing company with amazing pay and im currently in training at said job.

Fuck im sorry but this is gonna be a long story. Sooo her 21 year old sister and my new gf (25 yr old) moved in together earlier this year due to 2 fucked up situations. Her sister was a victim of extreme domestic violence and my gf was left by her fiance because she was talking to other guys while they were together. They both have trust issues but had no problem with me moving in because im extremely nice non hateful understanding person, complete opposite of what theyve dealt with plus i offered to pay 1/3 of bills and make life easier. 

I fell in love with the girl im seeing and despite red flag after red flag after endless red flag ive stayed and Busted my ass for this relationship. She has 2 children (ive never been a father so im learning) a 6 year old girl she doesnt have custody of, and a 2 year boy who she gets 3 days a week that ive been acting as sortof stepdad for. I work my job, clean the house after both of them, i understand she works 10 hours a day for four days a week then has her 2 year old so im ok with it, her sister is still having issues with ptsd so its ok im not too bothered by all the chores i have to do.

Now the father of the 2 year old and her are like 'friends' 'coparents' wtv you wanna call it and at the beginning of our relationship he would drop him off outside and she would take T (the 2 year old) back after the 3 days were up, usually with me in the car. Then it started being her ex would come inside and drop off T, and she would go inside his apartment for a little bit with me in the car to drop off T.

Im ok with everything to this point, shes convinced me she just doesnt want T to see his parents hate each other. Last week T was sick so she decided to goto her exs apt with her sister while i was at work and see T, since she wasnt going to pick him up that week. Well she ended up staying at his place for a bit, watched scooby doo and drank a coffee, and took T anyways. This kinda bothered me but i rolled with it, I dont want to be any negative influence in this boys life or take anything from him. 

So tonight she gets home from work gets a message from her ex saying he needs diapers. Ive been at work all week and i barely get to see her anymore but i agree tell her go ahead ill be here when she gets back. She gets home after an hour and a half or so and tells me about how she helped him cut Ts hair and put him in the bath. Im bothered by this i dont know if i should let it slide or keep on being 3rd wheel so to speak. Ive left so much out of the story, just know that i deal with crazy on a daily basis in this house.

 I dont want to be just another guy to leave her, but this relationship is painful. She spends time with her sister, her friends, and now her ex, with me being halfway down the list of priorities. I just want to move into family mode and get past this fukin do whatever you want phase. Now the painful loneliness from my ex leaving me is wearing off im wondering wtf am i even doing. Im a real person in Ts life, in their life, i put up with so much, but i feel like this is only going to get worse. 

I had a talk with her tonight about how i feel, and it just pissed her off and made her pull the old ""if i wanna do bla bla bla with My Son"" card. I just told her i understand that but if it would be better if i left or we were just friends i would be ok with it. This caused her to start saying stuff like im such an understanding person, and there is No One else who would ever allow such a weird situation, and we can get through this just trust her. We made up but im laying beside her in bed right now not knowing what to do.

I have a place i can move to if i decide to leave, and i am getting drained from working, then coming home to clean after 2 girls and a 2 year old, and then feeling disrespected by her doing whatever she wants. Theres also the fact that shes tried to fuck over everyone who leaves her but Ts father mainly because he didnt take T out of her life like the first baby daddy did with her daughter. What the fuck should i do! I want this to work, but im not comfortable with her going over to his place to play pretend mommy and daddy while im at home alone. 

I know i should have left way earlier, mind you she could have half custody of her daughter if she quit smoking weed which she refuses to, and she goes into fits of rage over shit. Something about her taking me in when i was at my lowest though when my ex left has made me stay to this point. I just dont know anymore.",15Jan2017,1
83,"Probably 5 months ago me and my gf were playing pokemon go and we're in the movie theater parking lot at like midnight. This big suv gets on my ass and follows me for awhile and wouldn't stop. I called the police as she was following me and she quit following me as I went toward the police station in my town. I hadn't thought of it for forever but then I get a message from a random old chick today that says:
     ""Why don't you tell me why you or someone in YOUR car was meeting up with my husband at 1am in the morning in movie theater parking lot. I was there and got your plate and ran it too and came back to you. I know your friends with Alex and his gf so there's a connection there."" 

I don't know any Alex's? I'd normally ignore but don't want this to escalate to something where she shows up at my house trying to harm me or something. She ran my plats so I'd assume she knows where I live? Idk.

85,"Hey, everyone...I promise to keep this short since I don't have a ton to say...

I'm a recent college graduate (political science) at a crossroads right now. I turned 24 a few months ago. I work at a great company full time, even though I don't make a ton of money (without getting into specifics, I make just under 30k a year...before taxes). I graduated college in the summer of 2015, so well less than a year ago.

My biggest goal for 2017 is to move out of my parents' place. I'm paying off student loans and a car, however, that is on top of my various other mandatory expenditures. To round it to a good, even, workable number, I'm paying 500 bucks a month in bills...that's not cool when I pretty much only make 500 bucks a week.

Granted, I don't plan on staying at this company for more than a year, I've been there for five and a half months, so I'm getting to the point where I either plant my roots or look for something else. I'm trying to go for the latter. I'm updating my resume and my LinkedIn profile and once I hit the 6 month mark, I'm starting the job hunt again. If there's a silver lining to my situation, I stumbled into a GREAT internship at the end of college and the job I work right now is highly technical, so I'm pretty confident in my resume.

Anyway, I could live on my own if i found a cheap enough place, but I'd be struggling. My best friend is 3 years younger than me, and he's the ONLY person I'd consider living with. My friends who are my age are deadbeats, even though I love them to death. Unfortunately, he's a computer technician (graduated debt-free with an IT degree) with a long term girlfriend who's more than happy living with his parents and girlfriend for the foreseeable future. So, realistically, I can't count on him to decide to move out any time soon.

On top of that, I lose my insurance at the end of this year...I have Crohn's disease and asthma, so I'll have to start paying out of pocket for my own insurance AND my own medicine (I already pay for my own medicine, insurance is a different animal) in October. Just one more thing to pay for, man. I'm scared to death that I'll be living with my folks at age 30.

I'm probably overthinking things, and I'll be looking for a new job in the coming weeks, but I'm freaking out and could use some advice. I hate to say this, but damn, this is one time in my life that I wish I had a significant other to team up with. I've spent most of my adult life being single and I enjoy the stability and lack of commitment, but fuck, I feel like I'm getting a little old for that too.",15Jan2017,1
86,"Quick facts on my individual case which could be deemed necessary to answering the question

*I'm a freshman in my 2nd semester, and 1st semester I was able to manage straight As so my GPA is in good standing right now.

*I want to be a teacher, which COULD mean grad school later on (it'd make me more hirable and give a boost to my salary).

*I also want options outside of teaching open to me, and I want the best GPA possible, but I also want to enjoy my college experience.

*The classes--in case you're wondering--are Intro to International Relations as the easier course and Intro to Political Theory as the harder course.

*I am a double major of political science and history.

On the class difficulty, Intro to INR seems like I could more predictably land an A in it given that I put in the necessary effort, which shouldn't be an issue. But an A in intro to political theory will probably require a lot more work, especially for the final paper which is worth 50% of my grade. The minimum for an A in the course is a 95%), and the professor says he has never given anyone a 100% on the paper, so his standards seem tough. Also, his Ratemyprofessors rating say that he's a tough grader, but you will learn a lot.",15Jan2017,1
87,"As of right now, I'm really torn about whether I want to go to my father's funeral. The reason: I've hated him most of my life, and I think I hate him now.

As a kid, I had the feeling he either hated me or just didn't care for me. He was abusive. And only to me, my siblings never experienced that from him. When he and my mother divorced, she got a new boyfriend. They sent me away to live with him because I got in the way of her new relationship. And in that time, it was a confusing time of living with my drunk father while he begged me to help him convince my mom to be with him. My mom has also told me that in the divorce he refused to pay child support, and that he asked to keep my siblings, by name, on multiple instances. She has admitted he never asked for me. He was also a drug addict. And due to his activities, he became homeless and I haven't seen him for 15+ years. 

I grew up and stopped hating him, and I even felt nothing for him. When I learned he had died, I just didn't care. I was neither mad or sad. But it became my responsibility to plan his arrangements. I was just doing whatever would satisfy my mom. But then there was a conversation with his brother, who was holding on to all his possessions from before he was homeless. There was pictures of people and places from his whole lifetime. Birth announcements, and wedding souvenirs. Stuff from all my siblings. And nothing to show I existed or even meant anything. 

And just like that, I find that I hate him all over again, and I even feel malice in his death. I feel like I don't want to be a part of the planning anymore. And I don't want to be present for whatever happens. I know I make my feelings known everyone is going to hate me. I can't be wrong right? Is it okay not to help others honor someone I hate even though I feel it's my duty?

Edit: I think I made a decision, and though it may not be the popular consensus, this thread really helped. I have decided I allowed to have a dead person, a horrible dead person have too much power over me. And I will go back into my uncaring feelings of him. However, I will be continuing with the planning and I will attend. When he left, I was 9/10 years old and though I didn't deserve it, my mom forced me to grow up and be the man of the house. And in that responsibility, that was thrust upon me, I have a duty to follow through. Why? I have no other reason than that is what a real man does: fulfill his duties regardless of the situation or emotions. Thanks reddit family, this helped. ",15Jan2017,18

90,"I have always liked traveling, and am coming up on a major transition point in my life, and with all the options I have available to me, I've considered just taking some time off and backpacking Europe.

I have money saved up, and was thinking something like 2 months would be an amazing way to travel around from country to country seeing all the sites would an experience of a lifetime. I've got a good deal of experience traveling around and realized one of the largest expenses of travel is lodging.

To help with this, and transportation costs, I've strongly considered buying a small van, to drive around, sleep in, and store my things in. At the end of the trip sell the van and fly back home. In theory this would give me an amazing amount of flexibility and save a ton of money on lodging... 

Is this nuts? Too much of a logistical hassle? Any advice/thoughts would be helpful. This is my first post on reddit so be kind. Thank you guys.

91,My girlfriend and I started dating March 11th of last year. We are very up front and truthful with each other. She told me when we started dating that she had a one night stand on a vacation in California on March 4th (we didn't hang out before March 11th) . Doesn't matter to me because didn't know each other well at the time and I was doing the same.  We have sex March 12th and every night after. She has a period on the 27th. A month goes by and she misses her next one in april. We go get an ultrasound a little while later and the doctor dates her conception as the 27th of march. Obviously she is born and she looks exactly like me. Logic says she is mine and I do plan on having a paternity test soon however I was just curious if obgyn can be that off?

92,"I'm an undergraduate looking to go to grad school and enter academia. I want to do this because I know that I can do the work (never had anything less than an A+), I know exactly what I want to research, I have already begun research in said topic for my PhD thesis (about to enter junior year), and my previous research experience has told me that I really enjoy it (even the stress and competition). 

My supervisors/professors are all pushing for me to go on to PhD and a few have suggested some projects I could do with them, despite already having verbally agreed to work with someone else in freshman year who I continue to work with now. They insist that I'm ahead of my peers and am in good standing to be successful in academia. But a grad student I recently met has told me that they're all lying to me in order to use my cheap labour. Said student thinks that my chances of being successful are absolutely abysmal, and that I should just give up now and go into industry. He wasn't just warning me about certain aspects of academia, he actively *hated* academia with a kind of hatred I have not seen in a person before. 

I feel that industry is not a option because I cannot study my particular niche topic concerning black holes in industry, and there are no other topics or areas in which I would like to work (although I can get a job in government studying this topic). I have no interest in 'applying my skills' to other areas. I am deathly passionate about my area of research and I have little doubt that I would eventually kill myself should I not be able to research (I'm not suicidal, it's just a fact). 

I want to go back to my professors and candidly ask them if they truly think I could be successful, but I already know that they'd be encouraging no matter what. They would either lie, or not realize just how unlikely it is given that they were obviously successful themselves. Given that I am a female in a male dominated subject, I think they may be pushing me to get into academia not for my own good, and not because I am actually good enough, but because they feel obliged to. 

However, the student I spoke to did not know me or any of what I have achieved. He was also quite physically ill, in pain, nearing the end of his PhD, and couldn't even remember the topic he did his PhD on, so I have reason to doubt that his opinions have too much value, but they still hurt to hear. 

So who is right and who is wrong? I know that at least some of what the student said to me has merit (about academia being sexist/misogynistic, working PhDs and post-docs too hard, there not being enough positions available), but I feel that he has greatly exaggerated these issues and is not giving me credit for my own personal experience and academic standing. I can't trust my supervisors to tell me the right thing because they may not realize just how competitive it is and they're not impartial to my going to grad school. I have asked in the r/GradSchool sub, but their opinions were very US-centric and I feel that the academic climate is different in my country. ",15Jan2017,4

98,"I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years half a month ago. The last year of the relationship was very difficult and stressful, and because of this a lot of things in my life went out of control. 

1) I gained 20 lbs. (I used to be very slim, but emotional eating and drinking took a toll)

2) I left my job because I couldn't handle it anymore

Now I have finally sorted it all out and I'm back trying to do my best. Trying to lose the weight actively and get another job, all while sorting myself out emotionally. 

My parents who I live with are adding a lot of pressure to the situation, and not really being understanding. Little remarks about my weight here and there. Pressuring me to send out job applications, which I'm already doing. It's really sending me into a meltdown. Maybe I'm over sensitive but I can't help it at this point.

Today, I have a job interview in a few hours. I ate my breakfast and read up on the industry I'm applying for. As I got up from the table my dad took a long look at me, then said - ""aren't you gonna go for a walk""? 

I know it's not a big deal, but it really hurt. Now I'm in the bathroom upset and wondering how I'll get myself together to face the job interview. 

It's so hard to move on, and I already feel like I made such a mess of my life. I'm trying. I have asked them to be more supportive and encouraging but that's not getting through to them. And then I get told not to be so ""touchy"".  I'm already super low in confidence right now. I don't understand why they're behaving like this - maybe they're just worried?

I honestly will go into a meltdown with all this and don't know what to do. I have nowhere else to go now either.

101,"I have had a really embarrassing and at times debilitating issue for a few years now.

Sometimes my eyes just get really fidgety. It's difficult to explain but let me try. It's not painful, but I get a constant twitch and I can't physically focus my eyes. It seems like it happens most often when I am talking to people one-on-one, but I can't tell if it just seems like that because that's the most embarrassing time for it to occur. Closing my eyes completely for a few seconds doesn't help, the twitch/discomfort persists even with my eyes closed. It sort of feels like its in the muscles around my eyes, and not just my actual eyeball. I get an urge to touch my eyes even though that doesn't help.

**The best way to describe it is that if for example I'm focusing on looking at a person (like in conversation) it is like their head (where to focus) is like a bright light and that I'm trying to look into it and a lot of times I just end up squinting a ton. My eyes just don't want to be open and are in incredible discomfort.**

 It happens in other scenarios, but I can't isolate a cause. It's not just talking to people, like today I was at the movies and it happened for a few minutes during the movie. It happened at church on Christmas. I do have very light sensitive eyes but I can't determine any specific lighting that causes it. I have gone to the eye doctor who didn't notice anything wrong other than mild allergy issues. He gave me eyedrops which did not help. 

I am currently seeing a therapist and have brought it up to him but he hasn't offered any solutions so far. It actually happened the last time we met, so I will bring it up at the next session. 

It's just really awful because I can't explain exactly what it is. I do know that it really affects my life and that I need to get it solved, even though it's embarrassing to talk about. I just can't find anything on the internet about this so I thought I would ask if anyone had gone through this and solved it, or if anyone had any advice.",15Jan2017,2

I was a victim of bullying for eight years, due to my shyness and cold attitude. I didn't (and don't) care about insulting, giving me a silent treatment or being looked down. Thing is I hated when they threw me paper balls and slaped me or hitted me, so I tried to give that back. Sadly not only they seemed to feel no pain from the punch, but also their hits hurt so much that my body got shocked. I couldn't move and so I was an easy target. I felt frustrated and used

Some years later I had another bullying experience. Although this one was far shorter, it only took a month to make me feel so scared and humilliated I had to change schools, all of it because I knew that I couldn't face him as the pain would make me turn into an statue.

I have 23 now and I'm planning to become an androgynous bi guy. I'm gonna have a feminine appearance so I could be beaten up by some jerk.

She thought I was sleeping but surprise bitch, awake asf.
Ahem...My mom said she had been doing it since around thanksgiving, heh explains why we didn't get jack for Christmas I guess.
My cousin was pretty surprised though actually, so was I though, like I'm so disappointed, you guys.

I have noticed she has been acting different lately, she snaps at the smallest things, its pretty scary if I'm being honest.
She doesn't have a job and acts like a teenager, always in her room on her computer.
 She never eats either (shes been on a really REALLY strict diet) and our dad is a total bum (and homeless), and we ""homeschool""...actually though...me and my sister stopped trying a long time ago because we don't know what we were doing and she doesn't help, and my poor brother (8) barely knows how to read. 
Dumb bitch was supposed to put him in school this year but she can't afford his clothes.

107,"Before you read. I don't know if I'm looking for advice per se. If you wanna give any go ahead. I'm mainly looking for validation through comments that say I'm not crazy and that I'm fine and that everything will work out and be ok. Will live tl;dr.

TL;DR: This is such a shit post and it's just me freaking out about how uncertain everything is. This is a disaster of a post and if it stays up I'll be surprised.

To expand on the title, I've been receiving a few comments from one of my friends about me not having a girlfriend and therefore not getting laid. Did I wish I had a girlfriend? Yes. Do I wish I was getting laid? Yes. So why don't you get a girlfriend and get laid? Cause I don't wanna be with someone I don't care about.

Friend is getting on my ass cause I'm a virgin primarily though. I'm 20 yrs old. I'm at a college that primarily consists of above average women. I'm a decent-ish looking guy. And I'm not getting laid. This is not a post about how to get laid just to make it clear. If I really wanted to I could've done it a long time ago. It's not hard tbh. After repeated attempts of going out, getting drunk, partying, and talking to potential partners. It probably would've happened a long time ago. Reason why that doesn't happen is 1. I don't go out (partying) a lot. 2. I don't drink like at all. and 3. I rarely find anyone I truly actually like.

To expand on 3 though, out of my almost 3 years in college I've had one ""fling"", a few random make-out sessions at the few, random parties I've been to, and then a whopping 2 girls I've actually liked. One is a best friend that we're not going to talk about and the other is some random girl that's name is Crystal that I've met 1 time, but is super duper cool and have never seen again, but I constantly see a mutual friend, but always forget to ask about her so I gotta make sure to ask about her next time. Basically I'm picky af and I'm a hopeless romantic and I'm probably gonna end up a 40 yr old virgin if I keep this up.

I'm at a dilemma in life where I feel like I'm quickly losing my years as a college youth and am going to end up quickly being alone by the time I graduate. I'm afraid I'm going to move away from my friends or that my friends are going to move away from me. I'm afraid I'm never going to find love. I'm afraid I'm going to settle and end up with someone I don't love. I'm just really feeling anxious about all this uncertainty with how I'll end up in life.

I'm not worried about my future career. I plan on applying to a program that hires teachers in disadvantage areas so as long as I don't get shot I'm fine. I'm just worried I'm gonna have to rely on a match.com or bumble profile in order to find love which I would really not want to do, but I can't go to a bar because I don't drink and I feel like if I try and just, for lack of a better term, ""pick up"" women out where ever it'd be an annoyance to them maybe 50% of the time idk. I don't even wanna pick up girls. I don't even wanna think about love. I just want it to happen whenever it's supposed to happen. This is bullshit. Fuck this.

Is my friend an ass and should I get a new friend? (this is sarcastic; I'm not getting rid of him)
Should I give up on my quest to only put my dick in something I love or should I just latch on to first consenting orifice and fuck the shit out of it?
Should I continue my life searching for my one and only through the encouragement of all your incredible tales of how you maybe found the love of your life? No. Well alright I guess we're just all alone here.

Feel free to ask questions. I'm happy to answer. If I ever post this exact post again it's because I'm pissed that this probably got zero attention and I've been at this for like half an hour.

Thanks for reading this shit post this far if you actually read this shit post the entire way instead of skimming to the bottom.

108,"Hello, just a little back story. My mom bought a condo unit in a rent/own apartment building. We moved in and everything was good for a while. The upstairs neighbours are noisy and we have filed a complaint with the landlords/company who owns this building. They've emailed me back that they have sent a notice to the upstairs tenant.

However, their water is always running at night. It starts around 11pm and lasts till 3am, and I don't know if it's a plumbing issue or not. It's taking a toll on my mom cause she has trouble sleeping and works early mornings. She's probably not going to get 3 hours of sleep because of this water noise.

I have told the landlords that they're always running their water at night but they said it might be a plumbing issue. It sometimes bothers me at night too. It just sounds like they leave their shower on, and that it's constantly draining.

Should I confront the upstairs tenant? How is the best way to approach this? I don't really think I can call the cops on running water. I know that we have a right to a comfortable living environment, and this is not comfortable with my mom. She started to cry today, and said this was torture to her. What should I do??",15Jan2017,2

122,"(Throwaway, I'm sorry this got so long. I just kept typing.)

So. High school.

I'm in a place where school begins in February, but I'm already awake at five am worrying about it. 

I'm fine with the learning part of high school, and the teachers, and the subjects, but I am not quite as fine with the girls there. I've never really fit in at school in the first place. I've always felt more comfortable doing guy things, dressing up like a guy, etc, but I've been bullied heavily for it in the past by boys, and had rumours and been shit-talked behind my back by girls, all through elementary and middle school.

 My high school is one I've been roped into with a scholarship kind of deal, but it's all girls, and religious. Easy enough. Let's see how it goes.

Freshman year went well. I was still the weird one, but freshman year was when everyone was new and wanted to be friends with everyone. Weird equalled quirky. Quirky equalled fun to be around. The girls were nice to me, and it went great. The only bad side would be the constant gay jokes. It was the in thing to pretend to be gay and laugh about it for four weeks. I bit my tongue and kept going.

Sophomore was when everyone became more picky. Sides were chosen, groups were formed almost overnight. Throughout the year, I just felt purely uncomfortable, like I never belonged in any group in the first place. I was a triangle and everyone was a circle shaped hole. The gay jokes got worse this year, homophobia becoming more and more prominent. I couldn't fit in, but it grew even worse when I realised how unhappy with myself I was. 

Over the year, I worked out that I'm still not happy with my own gender, and that I might be somewhere on the nonbinary scale. I've always felt better doing male things, and there's a weird giddy feeling that would go through my chest whenever I did something as small as gave myself a male character on a RPG game or something. I felt like a guy, and I've always known that I'm gay, and the whole uncomfortableness thing seemed to make sense.
I'm a guy, and I like girls. And I go to an all girls religious school. 

I worked up the courage to ask one of the teachers in private if I could be referred to by a different, more gender neutral name. They agreed, but when the freshmen and sophomores of my school found out, they went to high heavens with it. 

I became the new joke. After months of people purposefully not looking at me in the hallways, they would come up to me and shout ""HI, (MY BIRTHNAME!)"" and spark up fake conversation where they incorporated my original name into sentences as much as they could while their friends sniggered behind me.

The true pinnacle of comedy. They wouldn't let up on the joke, the activity spanning for a month, and it wasn't until the last week when it really affected me. 

I was walking to class when it happened. 

The freshman did the usual schtick, hi birthname, how are you birthname, the joke is that I'm pretending to care about you birthname. For the hell of it I went along. It was the last week. Why not. 

I was polite as I could until I turned to go into class. 

""I LOVE YOU SOOOOOO MUCH, (BIRTHNAME!) I'M A LESBIAN FOR YOU (BIRTHNAME!)""

Double whammy. That really got to me. I spent the last half of the week pretending to be sick, because I felt like if I went in the hallways again I'd just start crying. 

I've tried to go to the school counsellor for a separate problem before. Their method of helping was to go and rat on me to my parents, and get in trouble for showing weak points in school and whining to the teachers. So that isn't an option. 

I want to move schools, but I feel like it'll just be the same thing as usual, triangle peg and circle hole. 

It's possible they've forgotten about the joke with the summer break, but how long is it going to be before there's another joke? 

How can I even make friends like this?

Is there anything I can even do to make it better?

This is fine and wonderful but there are a lot of roadblocks of which I have lost answers to. I will list all of them that I see are ruining any chance I have of getting away.


 I have no driver's license

 My mother is manipulative, controlling, and lazy

 I have no phone

 I have no job

 I have no friends

 I have horrible anxiety and depression

 I have no family that would help me (I've tried)


So, I've had a job and a phone and obviously internet but things hit the shitter when I couldn't make it to work anymore.
I feel as though my mother is trying to hold me back as much as possible. She wont try to help me in any sort of way.


The only thing she has done for me is changed my name (And never actually finished the process) so I had to beg a family member to take me two different times to fix my SS and my ID TWO YEARS after she had changed it just to even have a chance of working since my name is different.
Things have gotten worse and worse since we live in an oil town, we lost our car, then our phones, then our home. Now we're living with family that have their own lives and my mother just seems to let life take her wherever it wants rather than just get a job.


So, to give a better picture on why I feel she is lazy... She will imply that I should get a job (Which I am definitely okay with) but when I do get a job she refuses to help in any way what-so-ever until I am nearly in tears. Even then she tries to find a shortcut to what I need and tries to thread me alone something that obviously wont work and the time passes in which I lose my job or something large of that nature.


She's manipulative because she tries to get my to feel like it was my fault for not ""Remembering to remind her"" even though I had told her a day before and my anxiety makes me hate hovering around people because I am scared they'll blow up.


And she's controlling because she heard that I wanted to move so she went ahead and called my girlfriends mom, told her I was lazy and she's been trying to get my to work forever and I wont, then tells her not to tell anyone. (Which her mom told my girlfriend and told her not to tell me) (Which she obviously told me)
Even when I was learning to drive because I begged a family member the very first time I drove with my mom in the car (which happened to be about three weeks into driving) I drove just fine and when we got home she told me that maybe we should go through a class or something because she didn't like the idea of me driving without a permit.


Even when I was trying to get my G.E.D. they wouldn't allow me to take the tests because my name was different than my ID and when I told her this she never once spoke to me about it again and any time I brought up that I needed to do it she'd give me an excuse till weeks had passed and I was to scared to ask again.

 

Reddit, I am losing my mind and I need your help.

 

What do I do at this point?",15Jan2017,3
127,"Dear Reddit, I am currently in 10th Grade and getting average grades in all of classes except one, Chemistry. It is the bane of my existence because it causes me so many problems at home and is a cause of friction between my parents and I. I recently bought an Xbox One which I had been saving up for for around 20 weeks and it was to be my new gaming console which I had bought for myself and I owned alone (self determination). I had it for one day and my father proceeded to take it away stating that my science grades were sub par and therefore he should take them away. I don't know exactly how he feels taking away something that I had worked so hard for and put time and effort in for earning money can just be taken away like that. I understand that grades are important to him but they aren't exactly as important to me. Especially in Chemistry, which is so far away from what I want to do with my life (I would like to become a filmmaker). In the end, I'm not exactly sure how to confront him, I didn't put up a fight when he took it away because either my phone or computer would have followed with my Xbox. The thing is, 5 months previous to me saving up and buying the Xbox, I had saved up and bought a PS4 with my brother which was taken away and never to be seen again because I was constantly bickering with my brother. 

My brother, because he gets acceptable grades to my father, is now allowed to play and I am not. I feel so much rage inside because it is not that I am not trying in the class (Chem), it is just that it is too difficult for me. I don't know what to say to my father without it escalating into a fight, which is what usually happens. Any thoughts on how I can confront him and possibly get my Xbox back?

Up to those six years, she's never once exhibited signs of wanting to be a boy at all, because she wears dresses and has longish hair and acts like a girl is supposed to, but she told me that she wants to be a boy like about six months ago? 
I was, like, a bit surprised when she told me, because obviously she didn't seem like it before, but I kind of gave her some advice. I told her to trust us, and that I'd see her in the exact same way, so she needn't worry. Like I told her I was feeling down too, and she's get over it - like you'd normally give somebody advice. I thought she might be uncomfortable, so I didn't bring it up again. She's brought it on and off - only ever by text. I keep on encouraging her and telling her that our friendship group is supportive, but she hasn't done anything. Recently, she's been kind of dissing our squad - by saying stuff like she doesn't like the term ""squad"" and kind of distancing herself the idea of a group, so I asked her about it yesterday.
Long story short, she kind of got mad, because I brought the trans thing up and she said stuff like ""this is why I'd never tell anybody else"" even though she's told another friend, and she got so strangely defensive but she's only ever scared and not mad. And I'm kind of getting the vibe that she's really embarassed about the whole thing but also mad at us. I told her she's be better if she trusted us, but that really set her off. Basically, she said that I was blaming her and that she was never going to tell any of us, and she'd most likely just cut off all contact when we got to uni in a year, and she said that i was just throwing the responsibility off myself - which i kind of was. she said a good friend would actually be active. but i don't get what she wants me to do here? i mean, i give her advice whenever she comes to me, and its not like im brushing her off? she said some really mean things, like ""i only told people i was prepared to lose"" and i got really mad and we haven't talked since. should i be doing more to help?",15Jan2017,1
130,"I went to a very small high school where I had many friends. With my friends I was a completely different person than I am now in college. In high school I was so loud and outgoing. Most importantly, there was always someone wanting me to do something with them. I had many Xbox friends that I would play with, I had my jock friends that I played sports with and partied with, and I had my casual friends who I would say were the ones I went to events with (movies, park, bowling, etc..). When college started I just gradually began losing all of them. 

I'm now in my 3rd year of college and I have hardly any friends any more. I've made a few, but they're like individual friends, not groups of friends like I had in high school. It's like every few weeks I feel more and more depressed about my life. I've gotten into a stage where I actually think there is something wrong with me. Maybe I am too ugly, maybe I am too quiet, maybe I talk about weird things, etc.. I've just become so insecure about myself over the years and this is the complete opposite of who I use to be. I guess I am just looking for someone who has been in this situation before. Is it just college that's doing this? Is it my particular college? Is it because I'm missing something important?

After they fought, my mother went into my room and slammed some stuff around and suddenly shrieked and began sobbing. I heard her from another room. I think she may have hurt herself. My dad just got in the car and left the house, I think my mom is still here.. I'm so scared. I think she may hurt herself but I dont want to talk to her in fear of making it worse.

And there are 2 girls I get along well with. Not like ""sexually"", just female friends. And one started writing me these ambiguous messages and we also talked a little bit ambiguous. And now she asked me if I was trying to flirt and I affirmed that. And she just said ""practice a bit and try again when I'm back home"". Now that until now I never have been in this situation I don't really know what she means by that. A polite ""you suck at flirting"" or something else?

This has been happening a lot recently. I am a computer engineering student and today we had a class on Asymptotic Notations. Basic Stuff. I was taking more time than most of the other students to grasp the topic. Our professor asked a very simple question (In case anyone is wondering, it was a question involving '*small omega*' notation). I couldn't come up with a solution and the concept was taught just few minutes before. Most of my friends were very easily able to answer and I couldn't understand it until the professor explained it. Few mins later the professor asked me a question involving '*omega notation*' to which I answered, but it was wrong and some of the students were laughing at me. After the professor explained the solution I realised what a stupid mistake I made. (Assumed omega to be upper bound, even though I definitely knew that it is not. I don't know why but I continued with upper bound)
This has been happening a lot and I constantly feel lost. Yes, I am putting efforts on my part too but still I feel it is not enough or it will never be enough. I keep making such silly/stupid mistakes. This is really troubling me. I now feel that I am not capable at all.

139,"Hi there,
A few years ago i noticed that my lack of confidence and self esteem was hindering my progress in life. Previously i had been flunking school back in Year's 9 - 10. and resorted to a lifestyle that was conducive to gaming and not much else. Because of my selfish lifestyle back then my relationship with my single mother had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer feasible to live with her.

In a stroke of luck my father who i had not previously heard from for about 10 years contacted me and asked if i would come and live with him and his spouse. I immediately moved up whereupon i entered another high school and graduated. At this point in time i felt my confidence was a little better but my relationship with my father and spouse had grown worse.

I decided that i would jump into the deep end and throw myself into social situations that i knew not a lot about and enrolled into university. I completed most of the first semester before my parents even found out i had enrolled into a course.


Now 2 years later out of a 3 year degree, my relationship with my parents is what i would describe as stable. I feel the bond we used to have has perished but that some time and space would go along way in repairing this. My social circle has grown to the extent that i have many friends, but my real true friends (Who i consider brothers) are very close.

Lately, after a friend asked for some advice they kindly told me that i should try and build my confidence up a bit. Hold better conversations with others, develop some more sympathy and have a higher opinion of myself. I feel that throughout my whole progression since year 9 that i have developed my confidence greatly. There is still much, much more work to be done and at the moment my self esteem seems to be quite low. Starting projects, hobbies and the like and not keeping to it, getting a little more secluded back at home.


I am so often giving advice that i don't feel qualified to give (and express so), but also lacking the ability to apply this on myself. Any advice on how to move forward, get better at conversations and develop some stronger self esteem would be greatly appreciated.",15Jan2017,1

141,"The whole situation is kind of hard to explain but I'll try to make it brief as possible. 

A friend and I both liked the same girl. He started going out with her, and I supported him. 

I still had feelings for her so it was very difficult to be around either of them. The girl asked me to go to the library with her and I said yes. In my stupid teenage brain of mine, I thought going being in a work environment would help me get over her, but it made me like her more. So I stopped and told my friend what I did and that I was sorry. We made up and everything was fine for a few months. 

During those months he and the girl were having problems with their relationship and I helped him with them, even tough it was hard on me since I really like this girl. I would feel jealous, alone, and depressed because of the situation but I never took it out on him. 

Later my friend sends me a screen shot of a text he was having with someone else, talking about how he was hurt that another friend was making a joke about me and the girl liking each other because we went to the library. I ask him why he sent it to me and he said: ""to make me feel guilty."" So after I sacrifice my feelings to help him because he's my friend, and make sure not to hurt him just because I'm hurt, he tries to hurt me over one joke a friend made.

I tell him I'm sorry that I hurt him, how much the situation hurt me, and how hurt I felt because he tried to hurt me. I said that it still hurt to think about her and stuff like that. His response to all of that is ""so you still like her?"" He didn't care that I was sorry or that I was really hurt, he just cared that I still might be a threat. 

Later he apologizes (because I asked him to) and I say that I needed time to think about whether or not I should still be friends with him. 

This all happened through text and I'm going to talk to him in person on Tuesday. I feel utterly betrayed and I'm not sure if I should forgive him. Another one of my friends stopped hanging out with him too because of a situation similar to this but the difference is that they both wanted to end the friendship, and only I want to end this one. 

Should I forgive him?

Disclaimer: we have kissed once and hold hands and cuddle regularly because we are THAT into each other. Yet Kate is constantly held back by her adopted Christian values that she must have a partner whom God and her parents will approve of. 
Kate has said that we will be able to date if I ultimately become a Christian like her and accept Jesus as my lord and saviour. This, as you can imagine, is extremely difficult for me and I respect her, myself and our relationship enough not to lie to myself or her. I have promised that I will continue to research this phenomenon and educate myself further. Although I fear that I will end up in the same place I am now. THEREFORE meaning that we can never be together which absolutely kills me and Kate. What the hell do I do? Do I: 
1) Try my hardest to move on from Kate?
2) Keep educating myself and go to church groups in hopes of converting to Christianity
3) Try and convert Kate to secularism (dangerous game considering certain circumstances and previous obviously failed attempts).
4) Other (please help)",15Jan2017,1
144,"Hi guys,
Sorry if I am posting in the wrong place, I am new to Reddit. Let me tell you a bit about myself:
- Male 
- 22 - 5 ft 7 
- 61.5kg 
- Work out 30 minutes a day, everyday

My question is about dieting. As someone who is new to ""bodybuilding"", I do not know enough about what I should be eating, and there is too much conflicting advice online!

I do not know if I'm eating enough, if I'm eating too much, or if I am eating the correct proportions of carbs (complex carbs), protein or fat.

I would like to know how you calculate how much you eat, what you eat, and whether you're seeing results. My goal is to become toned rather than bulky, and any advice you have to offer would be much appreciated!",15Jan2017,1

So in my church there are around 12 of us in the group. The only difficulty I find is that literally the other 11 have radically different interests than I do. Normally I could just go like oh I'll just find other people but this is my church group so I wouldn't want to leave just because of that. The thing is I grew up in a more nerdy neighborhood, so I'm more in video games anime and that stuff associated while these guys like sports and manly stuff. Any advice would be appreciated. Also I don't plan on leaving the group so I would like some advice on getting along. It's just weird when everyone's able to be buddy buddy and I'm just there on the sidelines lol",15Jan2017,4

147,"The first thing I need to mention is yes, I am a bit younger. I won't say how young, but you get the gist of it.

During the summer of 2015, I worked my butt off to afford a Wii U, which I got around December of 2015.

It has now been more than a year since I got my console, and the Nintendo Switch has been revealed. 

My question: **Should I try and get a Nintendo Switch?**

One thing my older brother pointed out when I asked him was that, ""You don't really play on your Wii U a whole ton."" He's right, unfortunately. Before getting my Wii U, I had a lot of extra time. Now, I'm moving into harder highschool classes and also some college classes, and I don't have as much time as I'd like to play my Wii U.

Another good point is that the Switch has a paid online subscription now, and I don't have any kind of steady job to keep a subscription going.

153,"I am a 22 yo guy. I have good qualification and have a degree in engineering. I have NO friends, I never had. I have a sibling that I can call my friend but there are boundaries because of the blood relation. I am a secretive guy. I am single and never had a GF. 

My relation with my immediate family has gone sour because of a property (that I was VERY attached to) they sold without getting me in confidence. It's been almost a year and I haven't talked to my mother or father because of what they did. I do talk to them occasionally but it's a small talk with no expressions or warmth on my face whatsoever and they KNOW it.

My feelings and mind is so clouded that I am facing difficulty in properly expressing my mind here as well so *I apologies profusely for my gibberish.*

I have always been an average guy or so I think. I have scored good grades with top distinction in almost my entire academic career but I had to work my ass off to achieve that.

During my studies I landed a job at a very reputable company and was getting paid handsome. Probably due to my over sensitivity and lack of clear communication with my employers, I got fired. This took a huge toll on my health and for the next 6 months I was VERY sick. After those 6 long months, I got a new job but this time it was a small company that isn't paying me even close to what I was getting at my previous place of work. Let's say I was making $700/month at old place and now I am making ~$500. This reduction in my earnings has hit my confidence alot.

My family often tells me I am ruining my life. They tell me I don't have car, I am not pursuing higher education, I don't have a good job, I don't take care of myself and stuff like that. And I TOTALLY agree with them in all the matters because I have assessed myself and they aren't remotely wrong.

I have grown desperate and agitated when I see my peers who were making half of what I was making a year ago, now making more then twice of what I am making. This makes me jealous as well as hurts me to the core that instead of making progress, I have regressed.

I have to work 2 jobs to get close to what my peers are making even then I often fall short. *The second job is temporary and the contract will end in 2 or 3 months.* This have me worried plenty. I have been asking around in desperation to get some contract part time job. I am also searching for freelance work online but so far I haven't been successful.

I have been thinking to move to another country for better opportunities but I can't afford that unless I get a job there or the employer sponsors my travel. I haven't stopped trying still.

I am a coward. I get scared of almost everything. I am scared of meetings, I am scared of confrontations, I am scared of demos, I am scared of meeting clients. You name it and I am sure, I'll be scared of it too. I can't go to a shrink/psychiatrist because there aren't really any in my small backward town.

I have low self esteem. I always compare myself to others before taking a single step. I have been trying to overcome this bad habit and let's say I have been successful by 40% but it's still not enough IMO.

I have NO ONE to open my heart to that's why I have come here to put a fraction of stuff that's bothering me. 

I have so much more to tell but I just can't put that in words atm. 

IDK what should I ask you guys that can help me in some way?

What should I do? I want to make more money and match or surpass my peers but it's been more then 4 months and all my tries have been in vain. 

How do I calm myself? How do I reduce this anxiety? How do improve the quality of my life?

What am I doing wrong?

159,"Hi Guys, so this is a long one.
A friend (friend A) of mine paid a ticket for me, it costed £80. He paid for both mine and his. This was 1 month ago. I asked my parents if I could go, and they both said no. But my friend keeps asking me for the money. 

I found another friend (Friend B) who said that he could buy my ticket from me, and pay him.

Seems ok so far... But A refused for B to transfer him the money. He wants me to transfer the money. But I don't want to let my parents know that I have transferred £80, because reasons. 

So I want to open up a bank account temporarily, so I get the £80 from B, and then transfer the money to A. 

Is this possible, or are there any better ideas. I am a uni student, living very far from uni, so giving money by hand is out of the question.

Thanks  for reading,
TL;DR, A bought £80 ticket, parents refused, B offered to pay, A said I should pay, I don't want my parents to know.

161,"Hello! I'm currently beating myself up over asking this one guy out. Allow me to explain:

I'm overall a pretty confident person, but after my last break up some of it went down the drain and I'm still working on getting it back. Recently a guy in my class asked to take me out and we both agreed it was a great time and talked about hanging out again. We've talked frequently since and have good conversation. However, we've both been very busy out of town/etc and haven't gotten another chance to plan something. 

I feel it is my turn to initiate seeing one another again, but I'm overthinking like crazy and don't know what to do. Bluntly, I'm terrified of getting rejected and making a fool of myself. To protect myself, I want to ask very casually so if anything were to not go as planned, it'd look a little less silly on my part. I know he's been working on his physique, so I thought about asking him to go to this new pizza place that's openening in my city. Thought of doing a little 2 in 1 by complimenting him by saying something like, ""have you been working out?"" and then easing into it by then saying, ""how about we both do cheat day and go to the opening of that new pizza place?"". I think that's in my comfort zone and a good way to mention something he's personally trying to accomplish (a better body) and asking him out at the same time. Any thoughts on that plan? 

I was also thinking of asking him to a football game with my friend and her boyfriend but thought that may be too intimidating- am I wrong? He doesn't know my friend or her boyfriend and to ask him would make me assume he's coming to make it a double date, and I think it would be uncomfortable for us both. All in all, what do you think is a good approach to this? Do guys appreciate girls that make the first move at times? And how do I not fear rejection/embarrassment? I appreciate all help that will be given and look forward to your responses. ",15Jan2017,4

165,"I was dating a great guy who broke up with me after he moved for grad school.

I'm clearly not over him, and after no contact for two months, we started chatting again. We communicate every now and then on snapchat, like each other's posts on social media, and texted a little over the holidays.

I know I should let him go and should look for someone else since he didn't even give long distance with me a chance... but he's moving to my city in a few months and I can't help but hope we might get back together. I really liked him and he really liked me; the timing was just off and he wasn't mature enough at the time to work at keeping a relationship through school. He had said he wanted to stay friends through this, told me how great I was, and even introduced me to his family before he left/before he ended up breaking up with me a month later... he told me long distance wasn't for him. I was too hurt to respond to a cowardly and disappointing breakup text, so that's when I ignored his last message and maintained no contact until he ended up reaching out to me. We didn't end things roughly; I just needed time apart to heal was all. 

Communication with him is affecting my decision making in terms of dating. While I don't feel ready, since it's only been 5 months since the breakup, I have been encouraged by family and friends to get out there. A part of me wants to give new guys a chance, but another big part of me wants to hold on to my ex so I don't lose him. When we dated, everything was practically perfect: instant chemistry... While we only dated 3 months, we spent a lot of time together within that period, got really close, etc. 

I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to start dating someone else, have it become serious, and then when my ex moves here, if he's interested in reconnecting, put myself in a complicated spot where I have to choose one and end up hurting the other... But at the same time, I don't think I should wait for something not guaranteed for me/put my life on hold and risk closing myself off from someone who ends up being equally as amazing, especially if my ex ends up not wanting to pick up where we left off. I don't see why he wouldn't unless he starts seeing someone more seriously between now and then.

I know it's bad to think this way, but if I knew for 100% certainty that my ex would want me again when he moves here, I'd work on just doing me and not dating because I'd have him soon enough. But if not, I could move on a lot easier and open up more to someone new. 

What do I do? Do I date others but not get too serious so that I can see what happens when my ex moves here? Like I said, aside from breaking up with me, he and what we had together was beautiful and perfect. Or do I forget him for now, potentially seriously date someone else, and then cross that bridge when I come to it even if it terrifies me and seems destructive? I want to be fair to myself and others... It's just hard to let him go because deep down I don't want to. I just want him back. ",15Jan2017,2
167,"I've been dealing with this for most of my life. I've always known the way my dad treated his immediate family wasn't right. From when I was born to 13-14 my dad was a down right narcissist. My mom has finally admitted he was. But now she says he has changed and I don't think so. (I am 15 now) The only reason he ""changed"" was because he was caught having an affair. He has to get back into her good graces. So he seemed all nice for a couple months but as time went on I'm begging to see how he didn't really change. How he's the same person he has always been he's just a better manipulator now. She refuses to acknowledge any of this. It's hard because the way he treats my brother and I we are the kids he's supposed to boss us around. (But the way he has done it has never seemed right but he's my parent so I can't argue. I mean he's parent I'm child but there's a line you can cross going to far, just by the way he is demanding and mean and doesn't show basic respect like saying please or
Thank you) anyways the only real way I can pin point his behaviors is a my mom. He treats her like she is an idiot. Like she is a child that's needs to be told what to do. My parents have never been equals. The way my dad treats my mom isn't okay. He threaten her and tells her what to do like you would a child. She is a grown woman. When I point this out to her she 1) gets mad and stops talking to me and pretty much just refuses to acknowledge I said anything 2) says that I'm just seeing it wrong that he doesn't mean to be like that or he's doing it out of love because he knows better. She tells me I'm crazy and I just say these things because I hate my dad. But the way he treats her isn't right. And I understand as a parent you have a lot of authority but my dad abuses his authority over kids. He thinks he can do whatever he wants whenever because he pays for everything. And even if u do agree with that, that he can do whatever he wants I hope u don't agree that he can treat his wife like she is bellow him, he rests her like she is a child. It's sick. She just refuses to see his behaviors and idk what to do. It's not healthy and she makes excuses for him. And I'm the only one who sees any of this. He is very pleasant around everyone his real side comes out when we are alone (the 4 of us) we even took my friend on vacation and for the whole week he was super nice and my friend was like why do u hate ur parents so much they are so nice to u.

189,"Hey guys, as the title reads, I'm at a major crossroads in life and in desperate need of advice

Just to give you some background on my life:

Growing up I was very privileged. My dad was an investment banker and we lived in the richest town in the US. I grew up in a family filled with love and happiness. When I was 9 my dad started his own investment company from home. At 16, the 2001 stock market crash happened and my dad lost almost all of his life savings. He was emotionally traumatized and never worked again.

We moved and my mom became a special education teacher to support the family. I still managed to get into Cornell which really pleased my parents. 

All of my life I felt like an outsider. Disillusioned by big business. I loved art, creative people, music, nature, etc. I am not an intense person and somewhat sensitive. I went to go work in NYC and hated every job I ever worked in. I kept making more money with each job however and was well compensated. The city felt too intense for me to stay long term. At 28, I decided to take the chance to fulfill a long term dream of mine to travel the world and quit my job.

The first 4 months were so amazing and I learned so much about life. But somewhere along the line something snapped. I went into an extreme depression and started having panic attacks. I decided to come home after 7.5 months of traveling. The next 7.5 months were hell. I stared getting more panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and paranoia. I got a great job but was fired after having a nervous breakdown. I was prescribed an anti depressant which made me manic. I then checked into a psych hospital where they theorized I was bipolar. This was after having no mental health problems previously.

I dont believe I have bipolar anymore. I still am dealing with depression and anxiety but am much better. Now im trying to determine my next step. I am interviewing for jobs in NYC but the city is so intense. I am basically chasing $ and status by interviewing for these sales jobs, which pay well, please my family and get me back to where i was financially before all of this. But I wonder if its too stressful for me to handle the rest of my life.

My other choice is to go to San Diego without a job lined up. I have always dreamed of living in a more laid back atmosphere on the west coast. I have essentially worked 6 weeks in the last year and a half after having a thriving 6 figure career where i worked for great companies. There is a huge gap in my resume and its hard for me to get a job anywhere near my old level and compensation. I live in the tri state area where I grew up with my parents and am 30 years old.

I am worried bringing this up will hurt my mother and make my dad really uncomfortable in this position, but at the same time my supposed half sister is trying to reach out to me and get to know me.

I'm not sure how to meet people my age that could have common interests?

I honestly don't like to do stuff during the week because I get home late, but on Fridays or Saturdays sometimes I'd like to meet people and do things. Friday nights I feel lonely and usually I just go to stores and look around or I'll go to a fast food place and eat alone and play on my phone. But it gets boring.

I live in a small town and I've tried meetup and Craigslist but they have nothing anywhere near here. I don't drink and don't like bars so that rules out a lot. I've tried church and made friends there but we drifted apart and most people live too far from to hang out, and there's only a few people at church my age.

I've also tried the gym but don't fit in there personality wise. I've been to Starbucks too but never see anyone there to meet, it's mostly older retired men or students busy studying when I go.

And the other social events here are mostly like women's painting groups or antique car shows, all older people things mostly. I rarely see anyone my age when I go out.

I don't know what else to do, you can't just go to stores or restaurants to meet people, as they're not usually looking to meet. I'm shy too so it's even more difficult.

It was a lot easier in school or college because most people were my age.",15Jan2017,1

However, the next thing I do is usually to comb over every detail and facet of the game and find every single mistake I made, how it impacted the game as a whole, and come up with an idea in my head for how I was the only person responsible for my team losing. I'm always trying to be as positive as I can to everyone except myself.

205,"For years (no, pretty much my whole life) I have harbored a very deep, passionate desire to take up a certain hobby. So why, then, have I waited over 15 years to do this thing? Well, it's complicated. But it basically boils down to one, me not having the money or resources to get involved with it, and two, being so embarrassed to ask my parents to put me in classes. I'm not sure why I've been so embarrassed to ask, but I have. I haven't told them *anything* about this, and as far as they know, this activity hasn't ever crossed my mind. 

But here I am, 21 years old, and the desire has just become too much. Me not being able to take this hobby up has caused me to become depressed, self-hating, and just plain miserable. I can't take it anymore. I've done a bit of research and have found a couple of different places around town I could take classes for this hobby. At affordable rates, too. Since I now have a job I've decided the time has finally come for me to ""come out"" about my secret passion. Now, I'm not actually planning on doing it for a few months. Since this is an outdoor hobby I want to wait for the weather to warm up. Plus, I need some time to save up some money. But in the meantime I feel like I need to emotionally prepare myself to tell my parents (I *need* to tell them, by the way, because I don't have my driver's license yet and I will need them to take me to and from the building.) So obviously they're going to find out. What I think I'll do is, when the time comes, message the instructor over Facebook and see about getting into one of her classes. Once that is set up, I will tell my folks. I'm actually expecting them to respond very well to this, as they're always telling me I need to get out of the house and do something – I think they'll be very accommodating about driving me to classes once a week. But the issue is, I'm *embarrassed.* I took dance class when I was in 7th grade, and because I struggled so much with body image issues at the time (and still do) I quit after a year. With this, it's not so much that I fear my parents' judgment over how good I'll be at it, I just don't want them to know I'm interested in it. Don't ask me why, because I don't know. It's just one of those things you want to keep a secret, you know? I can't really explain why. 

But over the last few days I've put my foot down, and decided that come hell or high water, I *am* going to take part in this activity. In fact, it is one of my new year's resolutions. I've made these kinds of goals in the past, but this time I'm serious. 2017 is going to be the year I chase my dreams and start to make some positive changes in my life, including getting enrolled in college. I've been depressed for quite some time (that's another story entirely), and I feel such a strong urge to *do* something. I'm tired of sitting around all day depressed, sad, and full of lethargy. Those of you who struggle with depression will know what I'm talking about. I'm actually going to force myself to go after the things I want. Change isn't going to happen overnight, but I need to at least make a start. 

Anyway, I'd just like to know what you guys think of my plan, and if you have any other advice to offer. Again, I don't plan on ""coming out"" or taking up classes until spring, but I need to be preparing myself *now*. ",15Jan2017,7

208,"I will preface this by telling you, dear reader, that my age is a number, nothing more. I prefer the company of adults, and have always shown a level of maturity far above those of my peers. You have no evidence to support this, so I am asking you to trust me when I say I am a thoughtful and mature individual. 
I began working in a monotonous retail position at a restaurant and bar in June, where I met some of my best friends. I also met the 22 year old kitchen manager who began flirting with me. Thus, we embarked on a romantic entanglement. I had never and likely will never again feel emotions that strong for another person. He spoke of marriage and building a life together, and for the first time I felt an intense longing for children. He was my home, my rock, my other half I had been searching for, and I felt a sudden vulnerability and trust I didn't understand. We continued our strange relationship for about two months, until he realized I began to change my plans to accommodate him. I wanted to attend a local college over my dream school after graduation in May. He decided that it was neither responsible nor fair to influence my future so drastically, and broke it off.
I suffered for the following 3 months. I saw him every day at work, and would have great difficulty holding myself together. I am not an emotional person, and typically have trouble in relationships because I refuse to show myself, so the sudden vulnerability and emotional instability was new and intolerable. I could feel he wasn't comfortable or happy either, or interactions were awkward, and on two occasions he called me just to say he was sorry.
He began dating another girl we worked with, who was prettier and more age appropriate, and it was painful to watch. Nonetheless, it made her markedly worse at her job and ended poorly.
Midway through November was the dramatic denouement of his career: he was fired (from a managerial position) for having two verbal outbursts. He disappeared suddenly, and I felt a little better not seeing him every day. I would still look for his car in the parking lot, I would still look for his bedroom light in the condo he shared with his cousin 500 ft from the restaurant. He wasn't present, but he was there.
He found work elsewhere, but ultimately decided to move back to Chicago, where he grew up. At that point, around the 10th of December, I had swallowed my pride and my tears and was capable of easy conversation with him. I asked if he wanted to grab coffee or dinner before he left, a neutral and friendly way to disguise the closure I desired before he left. He agreed, saying he missed seeing me and would love to ""catch up"". 
Naturally, as the world is unfair and cruel, he left 5 days earlier than expected to avoid a heavy snowstorm. 
It was hard. There was comfort in knowing he was there, and suddenly the condo was always dark and I felt empty. But I can cope with anything, so the emptiness became a reminder of personal growth, a connection not as clandestine as I had wanted, but meaningful all the same.
Less than two weeks ago, I woke up to an email from him saying, ""Can I ask you a question?""
""Do you believe in soul mates?""
As I am a hopeless romantic under cynical wraps, yes, I do believe in soul mates. To know that 1073 miles away, in a new city and a new life, he was still thinking about me and what we had broke my floodgates. 
So, for the past 10 days, I have spent about 10 hours on the phone talking to a guy who thinks we are meant to be together. Every time, he asks me to move to Chicago after graduation, to help him open a restaurant, or to go to the Art Institute, or whatever vision occupies the moment. There is nothing I have wanted more in my entire life. But I know that the worst possible mistake I could make would be to throw away my aspirations and plans for a guy whose intentions I may not truly know. 
I do not know what I want from life. Other than to love, be loved, and raise honest, just, and thoughtful children.
I am successful for an 18 year old. I am, to be blunt, talented. I have won awards for sculpture and ceramics, scholarships for dance, received a 35 on my ACT, and have successfully balanced two jobs and a perfect GPA. No, I have no idea what the real world is like. Yes, I know it can only get harder. 
My question stands thus: is moving to Chicago, pursuing a career in art or dance, or heck, even business management, and being with my proverbial ""soul mate"" the worst decision I could make? Could it work out?
Or should I continue on through a state school and into a medical career that might make me miserable? What matters most? What will I regret not doing? Do you have any answers?

209,"...and I think I know who it was.

I work at a middle school as a 7th grade social studies teacher.  I park in front of a parking lot by the entrance closest to my classroom everyday.  It's a campus with 1,200 kids, about 50 teachers and at least 100 more support staff, parents, etc that we also share these lots with.  Teachers are generally there 1 hr+ before anyone else, so we tend to park together, but not always.

I paid my car off Sunday, which makes this more annoying than it might otherwise be too.  I've been pretty good on buckling down toward our financial goals and paid off my 15 Jeep and my wife's 14 Jeep with the assumption that this would free up cash each month to put toward our house. Pretty proud that we have two fairly nice cars free and clear. 

So, Thursday I worked really late and didn't notice it, but Friday morning in my garage I clearly saw the dent(s) and blue paint on my silver door.

Basically it looked like a really bad door ding, like someone slung their door open like an asshole.  I frantically and angrily rubbed off all the blue paint, which I realized was dumb because I didn't get a picture, but it did all come off.

After looking at the way it dented though, it's a little clearer that someone probably tried to take a turn too tight with their car and hit my left rear door with the front right end of their car.

I was explaining what happened to some of my coworkers in a pretty animated and angry fashion when a first year teacher (who happens to drive a blue car) walks up and very awkwardly tries to change the subject.

My school has cameras that I will have access to on Tuesday. My question is, how should I approach this?  Assuming she did hit it, did too much time pass to bring this up to her?  Is that too petty to make a big deal out of?  What's the legal standing, since we both left, and I rubbed off the paint like an idiot?

219,"Hi /r/Advice - 

I need some help making a decision, I've been thinking about it for nearly a month and I keep waffling back and forth. I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but there are a number of variables. 

I've received a job offer for a consultant position in Washington D.C. paying north of $90K. This position would allow me to keep my security clearance which would otherwise expire in the coming months, my clearance is above Secret. The exact job is unknown to me as I would essentially be a government resource and put where they need me, so until I get started I don't know who I would be working with or what I would actually be doing. 

I've worked in the DC area before as an intern and then a government employee, and I left after about a year because I absolutely hated the area - the traffic is an absolute nightmare and the people are generally more career oriented and much more.. assertive than I am. I've always been an anxious person, but living in that area before caused my anxiety to spike and I was completely depressed living in that environment. It was a very isolating experience being nearly a full day driving away from my old friends and family. 

Since I left, I've moved back to my home state and taken a job as an analyst at a bank, and I've been much happier - I'm closer to my friends and I make a decent salary considering my location. While I'm much happier now, my job is certainly less fulfilling than my role in DC was and I'm not sure if losing my clearance would completely shut me out of those opportunities. 

I'm wondering if moving back to DC would be a mistake, it's been nearly 2 years since I left and I think I've matured a lot in that time and adjusted considerably to working life, but I'm not sure if that would have any impact on my happiness once I got back to DC. The money is considerably better than I am making now, and the job would likely be much more engaging as well - plus the experience would be extremely unique. I just can't get over the worry about moving back to DC - I get anxious just at the thought of being back up in that area. 

What would you do? Is there something that I should consider that I'm not? I appreciate any and all advice!
