7,"My dad left when I was around nine. Right now, I'm 14 and still live with my mum (she's...better now) (she's relapsing at the moment)

 Some fun memories include:
- My mum's alcoholic friend raising a wine bottle to my head and screaming at me while my mum laughed- she was stopped by another friend.

- Having to climb through a window to unlock a door because my mum forgot the keys in her drunken stupor.

- My mum chain smoking and drinking in our kitchen more or less every night.

- I had a boy from school take my stuff for no reason and later try and convince me to kill myself.

- The same friend from earlier smacked in our door, threw dirt under it and accused my sister of fucking her boyfriend.

- My drunk mom trying to take over the steering wheel of some guys car with me and a friend in the back. Both were drunk.

- My mum fell down the stairs and shattered her arm when drunk. I thought she was dead. 

- My mum saying it's okay to pick on me because I'm her daughter. 

- My mum yelling at anyone who tried to talk to her while she she was drunk. Which was every night.

I was never beaten, starved or anything. Just some bad memories. I'm sure there were happy times. People go through worse. I don't understand why I'm making such a big deal out of it.

I was around 6-11 for most of these.

None of these memories cause me any PTSD like symptoms, but I think they could play a part in why I'm so mentally screwed (not to sound edgy). Idk idk idk

I always thought throughout High School that I will go to a 4-year school far away from home, but reality hit and I am stuck in community college. I have no idea what to do with my life and that frightens me. I failed 2 classes one semester and failing one this semester. I have no friends and I just sit in my room playing video games.

So this will be my umpteenth time trying to quit, but this time, I actually want to. I've been a smoker for less than two years but it seems that everytime I do try I always land back on square one. I've tried cold turkey, patches, gum, you name it. But I think the thing that's lacking is support and motivation.

I want to do it, but I figured here'd be a great place to start with the whole support aspect. So to quitters out there; do you have any advice for me? All of it would be appreciated, even if I have heard it before.

18,"Ever heard of Wheaton College? Not the one in Massachusetts, the one outside of Chicago. What comes to your mind when you think of that school? Decent, small... fundamentalist? 

I came to this subreddit as I'm not sure where else to ask to get a consensus. My basic situation is as follows:

I am currently a senior in highschool who got royally fucked in the application process. Who knows, maybe it was my fault, but none the less I expected to get into several ivy leagues and other schools of a similar caliber and ended up with bupkis. While most of my compatriots are busy deciding between Dartmouth and Cornell I have been pining over my only realistic option for college, which is Wheaton. 

Frankly, I'm embarrassed of my failure to get accepted to any of the top colleges I applied to and am unsure if I will be able to attend Wheaton with any level of confidence or sense of achievement. So far the only replies I have gotten from anyone I ask are that they either haven't heard of it before, or believe it to be some ""weird fundie christian school"". Yet my parents and all the staff I've talked to (unsurprisingly) assure me that it is a very prestigious and exclusive school, and I should be exited to attend. ""The Harvard of Christian Schools"" they call it. 

At this point I'm at a loss. Having visited the campus, I see that there are a lot of positive aspects of the school. At the same time, I have a number of objections to it, starting with the fact that I've been a closeted agnostic for almost a year. But I'de be willing to move past all that if I could just receive some confirmation that after graduating I will be able to advertise my academic history without being looked at like I grew a third head. A graduate I talked to said she had difficultly finding a job due to Wheaton's relatively low notoriety in our area. 

I apologize for the wall of text, it just feels nice to write this all out. In short, what do you think of Wheaton? What would you think of someone who graduated from there? What would you advise me to do in my situation?

Thanks.",17Apr2017,1
19,"TL;DR Asked my friend and former manager to mail my last paycheck to my PO box after moving across the country. I haven't seen it in 3 weeks. Where could it have possibly gone or why is it delayed so much, when I've been receiving mail in a timely fashion from my grandmother?

I recently moved across the US from the East coast to the West coast. Prior to moving, I was employed by Mcdonalds with my manager being a very close friend of 6+ years. They didn't have direct deposit, so all my checks were paper. 

At the time I was living with my mother, who became very aggressive and spiteful after I decided to move. She refused to give me back my stuff so I didn't feel comfortable having my last paychecks from Mcdonalds being mailed to her house (since I wasn't in the state long enough after leaving to get the check in person). I asked my friend to get my check for me and have it mailed to my PO box on the west coast. He agreed and had it mailed out.

It's been 3 weeks since I first asked him. A week after I asked, he told me it got sent back to him because he forgot to put a stamp on it. It's been 2 weeks since then and I haven't seen the check. I know I can receive mail, I've been getting mail from my grandmother within days of her sending it. 

I've also asked my mom, who stopped being petty about me leaving, if she has seen it. She hasn't. She thinks my friend took the check for himself. I just don't agree with that logic. He makes twice my check in one week and has sent me money to help me out. I doubt he'd steal my check. I also doubt my mother took my check since she's been helping me out with money too. She knows if I don't get this check then I can't eat, and I'm pregnant so she wouldn't put her grandchild's well being on the line like that. 

I just don't get where this check is or why it's taken so long. I've asked him if he wrote the address right and he says he wrote it exactly how I sent it to him, which was correct. My PO box is at the UPS store. Would the post office in town have it for some reason? Would the UPS store have gotten it and misplaced it by accident? ",17Apr2017,1
20,"Half happy meaning he doesn't cheat on me, doesn't hit me or verbally abuse me. We are just like roommates. And sometimes bad ones at that. I used to think he would balance my seriousness with his spontaniety and his candor. We used to have fun together. But now that we have a child, I feel like I'm the only parent and he's only a babysitter. He goes out drinking with buddies, and leaves me alone even when our child is sick. He also forgets birthdays and Christmases. Forget anniversaries. When I struggled with my brother's drug addiction, he just told me to get over it. When I cried over my general feeling of exhaustion with the baby, he told me to just stop crying. I have told him my frustrations and about my need for more emotional intimacy. He listens and says he'll be better, but he hasnt changed. I am feeling sad and lonely and I'm wondering if I will stay this way forever. I want more out of marriage, and out of life in general. 

I think I've fallen out of love and can't bring back not just the feeling but even the desire to try regain some feeling. I am just so empty I think. Pleas give me some insight.

23,"So, in high school, I was friends with this kid named Cody. Cody and I were pretty good friends my freshman year: we both loved Pok√©mon and Magic: The Gathering. He had an insult-based sense of humor, but at the beginning, I kind of brushed it off because we had some good times. He took me to an out of state Pok√©mon tournament and it was fun. 

But the more I was with him, the worse he got. He'd call me names (sometimes as bad as 'faggot' but I always thought he was joking) and never really said good things about me. Every time I'd try to call him out on it, he'd turn it on me, saying I'm overreacting or make me feel stupid. Sometimes, I feel like he'd use me for rides places too. Remember that Pok√©mon tournament above? He asked me to ask my parents to drive us to one out of state. When my parents said no, he got upset and treated me even worse. 

He moved away, but he would still message me on Facebook sometimes (mainly to brag about his latest Pok√©mon tournament win) and even though it's a toxic relationship, I can't bring myself to cut him out of my life. Nowadays, he's a well-known twitch streamer and one of the top Pok√©mon players in the world, so I feel like if I unfriended him and he noticed (which he most definitely would) he could use his power to harass me, or say mean things about me. But even through Facebook, he still insults me. Recently, he tagged me in a post saying ""tag the most Jerry-like person you know"" (for you Rick and Morty fans, that's not a good thing) and a post for ""Denver's worst person."" He's also a horrible person. When there was a video on Facebook about a disabled kid who had a panic attack, he reacted with the laughing face.

I don't know what to do. I want to cut him out of my life and be done with him, but I'm worried about the repercussions. He's still got my phone number too, so he might be able to harass me there. Do I just grin and bear it? Do I talk to him about it, but risk further insults? How do I deal with this?

So, I'm currently in an LDR and my SO is in the UK, while I'm in the U.S. A year ago we met on a gaming community and we pretty much hit it off the first time we started talking. About a month into our friendship, we became really close and he soon confessed that he liked me. I was surprised at first and didn't have strong feelings for him like that at the moment, in which I told him about. During the summer, we stopped talking. Nothing bad happened between us but I guess we just lost communication, and I was caught up in my own thing at the time. We started talking again in the fall and he was still crazy about me. Saying how badly he wants us to meet, saying how amazing I am, etc. At first I didn't have those kind of feelings for him, but then they started to linger, which brings us to our relationship status now.

Okay, this is where I need your guys' help.

I haven't exactly been 100% truthful in our relationship, and what I mean by this is......I lied about my age and my school status. I'm a (17/F) turning 18 in June, while he's a (20/M), but he thinks I'm 19. I know, it's a stupid thing to lie about and it's probably the biggest mistake I've ever made, and I feel so much guilt for keeping this lie up for so long. So, when I first joined the community we met on, which was in 2014, I was 15 at the time and lied about my age while making my account. I didn't think I was ever gonna go on the community again after joining, but it turns out I did. In our relationship, we never really discussed age but he does believe I'm 19...and that I'm a junior in college. I've NEVER lied about something this big before and I feel extremely bad for doing it. I wanna come clean to him about it, but my worst fear is is that he'll leave me and never talk to me again, since he's basically the only person in my life that makes me truly happy. Overall, we love each other very much and plan on meeting each other soon, but I feel like if I tell him about this, that won't ever happen.

I feel so bad and disgusting for lying like this and I'm scared what the end result might be. I know if he leaves then it's for a good reason, but I want him to forgive me and trust me even after all of this......I really need some advice on this....please help....

32,"Hey guys and girls of reddit
Coming to you with a bit of a problem.

Me and my girlfriend has been together for about a year and a half now.
And you might have guessed it, she is pregnant.
What do we do ?

Some more info: (trying to write as unbiased as i can).
We have been together for 1,5 year during that time she has tried to kill herself 7-8 times, actually hurting herself with a knife once.
Currently she is undergoing therapy and is medicated (cipralex 20mg daily dosage).
(She has been this way since early childhood / preteens).
A summary of some of the things;
Low selfesteem, major depresive disorder(diagnosed) has been comitted during her early 20's for a while. (Prior anorextic, borderline disorder).
Bodily issues, and a prior history of both drugs and being at the reciving end of 3 accounts of rape.


She started working last year (finished her nursing bachelor), and things have gone both up and down in the relationship.
I am currently applying to universities (she knew this going into the relationship.

We have been having discussions about what to do, and i have clearly told her i would support her choice of action but that i need to go to school.

She countered with silence and the comment ""you dont love me"".
I tried to explain to her why school is important (also tried telling her she would be postponing her own master).

Have also learned she cheat during the first few months that we were a couple (she got herself of with some guy fingering her and kissing one guy during an academic visit to another country) she has been accusing me of cheating / looking at girls since that time.



Here on out you will get my side of the story;

I have been thinking alot about the issue and have as a backup plan to my prefer universities and subjects started the process of applying for universities that are closer to home.

Being blamed for not loving her makes no sense to me, as i have tried to reason and plead with her, showed support etc.

She finally asked my opinion about it (being pregnant), and i told her my opinion; Currently i dont think we are ready for a child and we dont have the economy, emotional availablity or time to raise a child correctly.


She as you might think went ballistic on my ass ( if you have ever been in a relationship with a depressed person this is not uncommon, i suspect that there are some anger issues)
Would not listen to even a single thing i tried to tell her.


This has been the standstill for the past 3 weeks; she has been leaning both ways and have gotten the number to the clinic; but told me tonight she doesnt know what to do. 



I just dont know how to explain to her that me being against is not the same thing as i dont want anything to do with her.
My arguements webt along the line of...
You need to get better before we think about such a big commitment.
We borh need to finish our education.
We need to save up money to get our own place to live.
Etc

TL*DR
Pregnant GF, has psychological issues, want to keep the baby even if we dont have money, place to live and both of us are not finished with our education.

35,"(Super long, sorry!!) I'm very close to being an adult now, but I feel like it's sucking the fun out of holidays. My family has slowly abandoned the holiday traditions as my cousins and I got older, and now it's to the point where holidays are basically normal days for us.
For example, today just felt like a normal Sunday with the exception of a short Easter brunch. No Easter baskets, egg hunts, or even a special trip planned after brunch. We basically ate and went back home to do our normal routines. My friends, even though they're around my age, still do the usual fun Easter activities just like what everyone did when they were kids, but even if I suggest to my parents to do something like baskets, they just refuse and tell me that I'm just too old for it. 
Christmas isn't as boring, but it still feels like we aren't following our traditions that much anymore. Compared to when I was a kid there's hardly any presents under the tree, and my family doesn't really come over for a long time like they used to.
Halloweens are really depressing. I used to go out and run around the neighborhood with my friends, but again my parents said I'm too old even if I say to them that most of my friends are still doing trick or treating. 
At this point it may seem like I'm jealous of my friends, and that may be true because they've still managed to uphold all of their old traditions from when they were kids while I couldn't. Holidays haven't been as happy as they were, and they're beginning to lose meaning because a lot of the traditions were abandoned. Can we still uphold our remaining traditions (or even bring the lost ones back), but if we can't, what can we do so that holidays are special like they used to be?",17Apr2017,5

I'm top 1% of my class, I win awards for academic things all the time. I enjoy school. But I can't find it in my heart to go to college. I've always felt that college is a waste of time for so many jobs and while I do enjoy academia, I want to spend some time on my own without more pressure from schoolwork.

I've thought about taking a gap year but that also means that no matter what I do during that time, I'll need to prepare for more education, which is the opposite of what I want. I want to work and make money and not be responsible for so many things that I feel overwhelmed. I want to only be responsible for myself.

Everyone is very discouraging of this, especially because I ""have so much promise."" But I want to be more than that. Being a smart kid in high school shouldn't mean anything in real life, academia barely translates to a real job anyway, and I think I have this desire inside me to prove this point.

Sometimes, I talk about going to college and how excited I am for it, but I know I'm more talking about leaving my parents' house and doing my own thing for once in my life. My parents have always been pretty strict and I think I just am excited for the freedom. I talk about applying to college, which I'm going to do, but it's not really because I want to go but because everyone else is doing it. Sure I'll talk about plans for college with my friends, but in the back of my mind, I am always questioning the college path for myself.

All my friends tell me that the only way to make money and be successful is to go to college, but I don't care about money. I just want to be secure, with a roof over my head and dinner on my table and maybe a bit more to splurge, but I don't need a house and I don't need a fancy car. I don't think I'll hate a blue collar job, and I can barely make up my mind what I want to do with my life anyway because every career just seems so monotonous to me. But I receive no support from anyone, so I'm concerned on how to tell my parents.

Everyone says that it sounds dumb but right now, my plan is to work over my senior year and then move to Lima and try to find work at a tourist place or work at a church or something and maybe wait tables too. I don't mind working a full time job and a part time, I don't mind working at all. I speak conversational Spanish and I just want to get out of my comfort zone and do something for myself.

43,So back in 5th grade I had major anxiety issues due to my teacher and was diagnosed with a stress induced stomach ulcer.  My parents and I tried to make it work by going to therapy sessions and meetings with the teacher themselves trying to get me to calm down. I wouldn't budge. I'm not sure why I did any of this. Even to this day (I'm 16 now) it's still an enigma to me. All I know is that school caused it. My grades weren't the issue I was a straight a student in elementary school up to that point. After everything the only option we had was to pull me out of school and enroll in homeschooling. This is where the issue arises. My homeschooling was really haphazard. A lot of unorthodox methods and teaching. I really spent the next 4-5 years majoring in computer engineering. I've never written a long form paper on any specific subject. I've never made a book report. I've never had to study for a major test.

44,"My friend got her breast cancer diagnosis about 3 months ago and had a double mastectomy another month later. They did not get it all. She is currently going through chemo/radiation.

Now her 20 year old son has been diagnosed with leukemia.  

I want to be of service to her and her family in some way. I've already offered the typical ""I'm here for you"" stuff that people always offer and are usually never taken up on. 

Her sisters are visiting and staying in shifts to help out. I've given them my number and made sure they know the nature of my offer, I can take their dogs for walks or grooming, make dinner and bring it, yard work, shopping and things I might need help with if my entire life was talking apart. 

I am looking for ideas to actually help this family. Her husband is an absolute delight, a sweet and gentle selfless man who is always cheerful and I can't imagine what he is going through. 

This friend  has been extremely good to me, and I already feel like I owe her so much. I thought about getting my bone marrow tested for donation for her son? Is that absolutely inappropriate?

What can I do? ",17Apr2017,3

It's really simple, three circles divided by one line. 

The three circles signify the three elements of reality (the individual, within culture, within nature). 

The line between them is to remember that that they all have two 'faces'. So the individual is both the hero and the adversary, culture (the mythological father) is both wise/protective and tyrannical/oppressive, and nature (the mythological mother) is both creation and destruction. Hope that makes sense. Makes sense to me. 

I was thinking either, getting it as a tattoo more or less like it is, very simple, or maybe find an artist that I really like, explain to them the concept and ask them to do their own take on it. 

Any thoughts? ",17Apr2017,3
46,"My car was stolen. I was a party and a certain group that came in were kicked out because their reputation of doing crazy shit(including a guy who is always strapped). They left a bit angry as anyone would but we didn't notice that one of their friends stayed at the party (we think he came separately). When I first arrived I was in the kitchen just chillin and took off my jacket and put it on a chair, which had my keys in them. Later on I left the kitchen and went upstairs but forgot to take my jacket with me. I was upstairs from around 12 to 1.30ish when I went downstairs to grab my jacket. And thats when I thought I just lost my keys but then once i checked outside I saw that my car wasn't there
My friends and I figured it was that kid that stayed from earlier for 3 reasons.

1 He was walking in and out of the house the whole time and wasn't there when we noticed the car wasn't there anymore

2 One friend was outside in his car for about 10 minutes and noticed him walking in and out of the house. When he walked in he saw him outside

3 One friend saw the car leaving but didn't think much about it b/c he thought it was me leaving. And he walked in a few minutes after the friend in the car walked in

We reported it missing to the police that same night. I found out where he lives and started to search for the car around that area the next day and found it.
While we did find the car, we didn't find the keys that the guy originally took, so there's a big chance of him or someone still having those keys (keep in mind that my house keys are there too. so if they were to follow me home they would know where I live and it would be extremely easy for them to come in)
So now what i want to know is if i should go press him for my keys. I can easily kick his ass, but what I'm concerned about is his friends, some of them are strapped and they wouldn't think twice about jumping me if they had a problem with me.
So what should I do next?",17Apr2017,2

56,"Hey guys, buddy-bun-dem here.

I've never posted here before, I don't think, and I don't browse here typically either. But something compelled me to come here in order to justify my feelings, I guess. You see, I have a sort of personal dilemma when it comes to girls. And people too, to an extent. To know the problem, you'd have to know me I guess. Please bear with me!

I'm 17 years old. I started NoFap a few months ago in order to improve myself and disobjectify women in my mind, stop being depressed, etc. Thus there arose an extreme sense of self-drive sort of - a kind of longing to be a better person and the way to achieve it. I want to become the perfect man - essentially, the Magnum Opus. Literate. Strong. Stable. However, sprouting out of that belief came a question. If I'm to strive to be the perfect man, might there be someone out there who wants to be the perfect woman? 

Of course, nobody is perfect. I realize that. But simply asking the question makes me realize that my standards are high; they are almost impossibly high. Years of watching porn have made me strive for perfect beauties with hourglass figures, and it'll be much longer before I can cast off that illusion. But that, combined with my longing for someone who shares my views - who strives to grab life by the horns, who doesn't want to live their life in quiet desperation, who understands things and if not, tries to understand - creates an almost impossible being. The chances of me meeting such a person and, if we were to be friends, the chances of being more than such are astronomically low. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, *are my standards too high?* (**EDIT:** This is an important question too, but I can't find a way to slip it into the TL;DR or title) Should I just forget about the whole idea of the perfect woman? Or should I keep holding on and hope that one day I'll find someone like that? 

I know all of this is speculation. I know that my thoughts are disjointed, my ideas bizarre and to some degree, I probably sound like a prick. I'm as confused as you are. I don't quite understand what I want from a woman. I know it's ridiculous to sit around and wait for someone to appear in one's life. I guess the real question is, should I even worry about women at this point? I'm going to enlist in the Marines so I can go to boot camp after high school, which would be in about a year... should I just forget it?

I don't think I can really take this post anywhere else. Please tell me your thoughts or answers to any of the above questions. 

Thanks if you've stuck with me all this time! I'm not really good at this kind of thing.

I dropped out of University around that time due to some psychological problems i was succumbing to. However, after extensive family support, and a stable job for the past 7 years, I've learned how to manage priorities and am ready to pursue a degree. 
 
However, the universities around my area (middle east) and most in general demand physical attendance, which would cut into my current employment, something I rely on.

From what I've read so far, they are both regionally accredited in the US.

Im looking to pursue a BS in Business Administration, as I feel it can give me a broad stroke for future employment opportunities.

68,"For a bit of context, today, my sister, my mom, and I celebrated Easter by going to the beach.  It's an old tradition of ours, and we thought we'd revisit it since the three of us haven't spent time together in quite a while.  We started throwing rocks into the lake and made a competition out of it.  We started going for heavier rocks, and my sister and I found an especially large one (about the size of a shoe).  I prompted my sister to throw it, and when she did, her hand slipped, and the rock went flying high into the air and started dropping right above my mom's head. 

My mom is in her late 50's, and there was only so much she could do to quickly get out the way. This all happened in a matter of seconds, after all, and at the time, all we could do was shout and brace ourselves.  Yet, by the grace of whatever forces that be, the rock landed a mere foot or two away from her.  We clambered over to her, hugged, laughed, and tried to pass it off as some crazy, hilarious thing. 

But the truth is, it was terrifying. And it didn't resonate in us as to how terrifying the whole thing really was until after the fact. After discussing it, my sister and I both concluded that if that rock had collided with our mom's head, she would have been killed, or at least suffered severe damage.  

I know that my mom is fine and that no harm was done, but a part of me just can't get over the ""What if"".  It makes me feel queasy, and I know my sister is suffering with guilt more so than I am. This has really started bothering me, and I even broke down a bit thinking about what might've happened if my mom had gotten hit. 

I guess I'm just wondering what are some ways my sister and I can come to terms with what happened, and how we can move on and rationalize that (thankfully) nothing came out of it and ultimately let go of this gnawing guilt. Your thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.


Edit:  I really appreciate everyone's input. This has definitely made me aware of how precious and precarious life can be, and it's a lesson to not take my loved ones for granted.  Everything can change in but a moment, and that's both frightening and humbling.  ",17Apr2017,9

74,"  Hi Reddit, my name is Hunter and I live in Alabama. My dad is a youth pastor and my mom is a band director. We just moved to another city and although this is my second year here, it's becoming hard to adjust. The funny thing is, I do perfectly well at my public 6A high school in the city area. I have many many friends (especially in band which is my favorite thing at my school) and it is a place where I feel comfortable, happy, and surrounded by support and friendship. However, when I go to church, not so much. Our church is 40 minutes away from where we live and I will say this.... It is one of the most southern places you can go. While the adults are really nice and welcoming, the kids my age are not. The town in which the church is located in, is very small and only has one school (Which isn't the school I go to.) The kids there have a very strict social hierarchy where basically if you do not play sports, hunt, fish, or love going outside, you do not belong. 


  I do none of those things. I am the complete opposite of those things. I hate sports, I don't like to hunt or fish, I'd rather stay inside and read a book or watch YouTube than go outside. Other things about me that no one else there is in common with: I am obsessed with Disney. (Yes I am a dude, but Disney is life and don't judge) I love to read books which none of them like, I am also obsessed with K-Pop!!! (Shoutout to all the ONCEs, iGot7s, Buddies, Carats, and Reveluvs out there!!!) And of course I am a total Band Geek!!!


  My dad keeps trying to make me talk to them more, but how do you talk to someone who is the complete opposite of you? At this point it's almost like I am living in two different worlds... One world where I am in band at my high school with a ton of friends and, living happily with my Disney and K-Pop obsessions where no one at my high school judges me and some actually like the same things I do! And then the other world where I live in fear of social rejection and where no one talks to me or likes the things that I do.... It is also frustrating when your dad is not also just the youth pastor there, he also coaches baseball at their school... He also spends most of his time there and it's beginning to come to the point where my dad is closer to the kids in the youth group that are nothing like me, than his own son... (Just in case it wasn't clear, my dad is just like them. He loves me and tries to understand me and I love him too, but it really is coming to the point where we know almost none of the same things and while of course our family is no where near splitting apart or anything, I'm just getting very distant between my dad...) My mom on the other hand is like my best friend! She completely understands me! (not so much with K-Pop though, she was just like ""I don't really like it but you can do whatever"") It also helps that she is a band director so we talk about band stuff all of the time and we generally spend more time together as she is always in the city like I am because that's where her school/band is, and she takes me to and picks me up from school every day.


  What do you think I should do? My dad tries to tell me to stop liking those things because they aren't ""normal"" and if I didn't like those things I could be more in common with them. However, I don't want to stop liking these things because they make me happy and they are a part of me.....

78,"So here is the backstory. I am a 17 year old male, and I live with my dad (parents are split up). 

I used to live with my mom, and when I did, we used to play video games called Guitar Hero and Rock Band a lot together. If you have never heard of these games, basically they are music games where you have plastic instruments, being a Guitar, Drum Kit and a not so plastic microphone. The guitar has 5 fret buttons and a strum bar, and on the screen you see the 5 fret buttons lined up, and you have to hold the proper fret button and strum the note when it comes down the track. [Here is a random video of Guitar Hero gameplay](https://youtu.be/4Sfg2RG0kTw) if you're interested, but know it isn't very important to the story. All you need to know is that it isn't anything like playing real guitar. 

Anyway, around 3-4 weeks before Christmas, I was visiting my mom at her house, and she still has our old Wii that we used to play Guitar Hero on. We popped it in and played for hours. At one point, she said ""Wow, you are pretty good, I bet you'd be good at real guitar too! Would you ever be interested in playing real Guitar?"" (Again, keep in mind, they are nothing alike.) Without really thinking anything of it, I said ""Sure, that would be kinda cool."" 

Sure enough, I go out to the living room on Christmas Day, and see a strange guitar shaped box wrapped up beside the tree. And to my surprise, it was a real guitar, along with a copy of Rocksmith, which is a ""game"" software that teaches you how to play guitar, and some extra strings. I was really excited at first, as I love music, and especially music that emphasize guitars, and thought it would be fun to learn to play it myself. 

I tried it out around a week or so later, and could never get the game to calibrate the guitar properly. I figured I would just try again a few days later or whatever, but since then I have just lost all motivation to play guitar. I'm not interested in learning it, and I wouldn't have any decent opportunities to play it once I have learned it. Plus, other family living in my house have very conflicting work schedules, meaning at least 1 person is almost always sleeping, and we don't have the biggest house in the world. 

So yeah, I have some things I want to buy, and the guitar hasn't left my closet since around the start of January. Should I sell it since I have no use for it, or is that a shitty thing to do, considering my parents bought it for me? Keep in mind it's not a crazy expensive Les Paul or Gibson or something like that, it's just an entry level Fender guitar, can't be worth over $150-200. Sorry if this post was kinda long, I rambled way too much. Thanks for any help

Can anyone think of ways I could be helping him in the future?

84,"My Marijuana DUI trial on 4/20.

I've never posted here before so I'm going to try to make this short and sweet.

Mesa, Arizona.
May 6, 2015. A little after 12am 

I was driving home from the gym, when I was pulled over by a police officer.¬† It was Cinco de mayo technically, so cops were out look for drunk drivers.¬† 

Before the cop pulled me over, I observed him behind me, instinctively I looked at my speedometer and noticed I was going 50mph.¬†¬†¬† He fliped on lights and I pulled to the side,¬† he approaches and first thing he said to me was ""I clocked you going 58"" and I immediately said ""I was going 50""¬† I know this for sure because I always look how fast I'm going when I see a cop.¬† 

Well That made no difference because it was 40mph zone... I was fucked either way.¬† So on it went, the officer¬†asked me if I was drunk. I said no not a drop. Asked¬† me when the last time I smoked Marijuana,¬† I said ""last night"" and told him i have a mmj card.¬†¬†¬† He didn't believe me or care.¬† he gave me a sobriety test and found his own dumb reasons to arrest me. Took me in and took a blood sample.¬†¬†¬† Towed my car, gave back my weed and sent me on my mary way...



Blah blah blah.¬†¬†¬† Fast forward to today.

The case has been continued several times.¬† Finally last week I had my pretrial conference. Jury trial set for this Thursday.
The charge is driving with THC metabolites in my body.


I Have a public defender.¬† He seems knowledgeable and professional at his job.¬†¬† According to him,¬† we have the burden to show proof I was not under the influence and I was not impaired from the Marijuana I smoked the night prior. Apparently my mmj card is not enough to win my trial.¬†¬†¬† 

I need to win over the jury.¬†¬†¬† 

I need advice or tips from people with similar experience.¬† 

How do I get a jury to like me?

How do I prove beyond reasonable doubt that I was not impaired from smoking the night before? 

What should I do? 


Any real advice would be appreciated.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

92,"I've basically lived in small towns my whole life, except in college. I've never liked living in a small town, and when I was in college I never got to experience the city. I live in a small town/suburb of a major city now because I got a job here and it's the only job that gave me a chance when I applied for jobs out of school because my resume is apparently shit. It's okay as a temporary thing but that's all it is and all it ever will be, my manager is nice enough to circulate my name to other teams but apparently a consumer electronics company has little to no need for someone with an electrical engineering degree. The city itself is an hour away, so if I were to get any new job I'd have to relocate, and if that's the case why not look elsewhere? I've never felt a strong connection to this state, it's just where my parents chose to live.

Family commitments dominated 2016, so I applied for jobs in January this year. Only one got back to me for a phone interview. That job flew me for an on site interview in March, and two weeks later I got a job offer. I accepted, because it makes perfect sense for me being my exact field I studied in college, it's a rock solid company (a person can actually work their way up, one of the few still doing that), and their initial offer beat my opening expectation. They'll give a sign on bonus and all relocation is completely covered. It's been two weeks since I accepted the offer.

Here's the problem. It's a DoD contractor. As such, the job is contingent on getting security clearance. Because of lack of priority within the government as well as things like the big OPM hack, clearance has been taking long for people to get. I have zero expectation that I would be denied the necessary clearance (fellow Gray Wolves may look down on the job, but politics comes after taking care of myself). It's just going to take a while to get it.

The start date I was quoted on is like September, meaning I may not even move until August. The whole point of my job search is to find a job that puts me into a decently sized city where there are things to do and people to meet. I have no reason to make money if I can't find experiences and people worth spending that money on.

I could get lucky and get there before September, but I could get unlucky and have to keep waiting. Even until September, that's a long time, and every day I find myself more and more irked by the little things about living here. I hate how roads are laid out here (winding with very poor sight lines because of trees and bushes), I hate not even having the option of any sort of live entertainment (only such attractions are at least an hour away, and I just can't justify that drive except I spend a whole day in the city), and I hate the time zone (I can't stay up watching the NBA until 1am when I have work). I need to go west.

The company that gave me an offer was one of a few dozen that I had applied to back in January, and apparently none of the rest of them thought I was even worth talking to. I don't have any confidence that I'd be in high demand since my resume is (apparently extremely) weak and I would require relocation in any case. I'm not interested at all in staying in this town, though I could be convinced to move to the city itself. But even that, I'm not sure there are opportunities here like the bird in the hand I already have.

So I ask, should I keep applying for jobs? Or should I just count my blessings and stick it out? I know at least I won't get laid off through at least September so I have some semblance of short term job security.",17Apr2017,1

In the beginning I got with a group to eat lunch with because I had no friends. The group has one person in which I am around a lot and talk to. But I do not particularly enjoy hanging out with  these people. It has shrunk into a smaller group of 4 others, and I while I don't dislike these people, I do not have a connection with them if that makes sense.

94,"This issues began to effect me a few months ago. At first I thought little of it, I hoped it would go away with time. It hasn't though. Much the opposite, the uncomfortable sensation has become more common, and feels worse. 

It is especially bad while I am at work. I run a conveyor system in a warehouse and I am constantly on my feet, rushing aroung an enourmous building. If I stand/walk/run for sometimes as little as over a half an hour my left leg begins to go numb. It begins on the front left of my left thigh, about 4 inches above my knee. The discomfort quickly spreads to both my knee joint, as well as the left side of my hips/pelvis. The only remedy I have found it to sit down for a minimum of ten minutes. If I want to stave off the discomfort for any great ammount of time I need to sit for at least 25 minutes to a half an hour. A friend of mine exxageratedly said it sounded like a blood clot in my leg, which terrifies me. I am somewhat overweight, 245, due to drinking more often I have put on about 20lbs since last summer.

She's always been said to have dementia since 2012ish, but the symptoms were not present to me, more than likely due to her medicactions working well. However, just this month she has declined extremely suddenly.

I'm up at 12 am now because of it. Basically the classic symptoms of dementia have all of a sudden truly surfaced. She's having trouble with basic tasks like flushing the toilet. She also doesn't seem to recognize some people, including my mom and I at times.

I feel heartbroken because there's a part of her aware of what's happening. She says she's not the same anymore and her time is coming soon, but there's also this dementia state where she's clearly 'gone' and she's spending more time in that state with each day.

99,"I recently met a girl called Natalie from tinder, and i treated her as my friend until we met each other. That was the time i started to fell for her and i kept asking her out. She's the most honest, open, cute and special girl i've met. 

So this happened, 3 days ago we went out to a mall for lunch, we had really great conversation and everything was going well. I found out that both of had never been in a relationship (i'm 21 and she's 20). And we had many things in common! 
So there was a question i asked out of random, like... Do you think the shop manager's a gay? Because the way he wears looks like one (it was a joke obviously). And then i asked her for fun : ""What about you? Are you a les? :P"" 
That's when she started to look awkward, and she confessed that she is a bi (i think she meant les, you'll get what i mean after finish readin). 
My body felt really cold and my mind was full of confusion, i was really sad and i lost hope out of sudden. It was very awkward for us. But then i managed my emotions, and i acted really normal. So i asked her since when did she found out she's a bi, she said when she was 17. And told me she gave me 3 clues for our last few meetups, 1st one is Aguy kissed her in a club, she didnt enjoy it (i thought it was just the guy) 2nd was she friendzoned all the guys and that's why she never had a relationship. 3rd she's from a girls high school. and things got less awkward, and i naturally became myself. (I used to treat her in a calm formal way, now i'm bullshitting and talking crap and lame jokes with her) i somehow got over those feelings in just 30 minutes
And so l told her i needed to buy some clothes from H&amp;M and MPH for books. Here's the weird thing happened, we held hands, like u know the fingers hugging fingers (idk what it's called xD) and cling to me. I was really confused, my mind was blank so i played along. We were flirting and telling dirty jokes, just like a couple. And when we entered the car, to fetch her home. I held her hand, and asked ""Can i ask you a question? You really never had feelings for any guys?"" She was thinking and said she couldn't recall. So along the way home, we were holding each others hand for like an hour (traffic jam) while i caress her fingers. It was the best moment of my life. When she got home, she thanked for today and went back to her dorm. 

So... I felt really confused, first thing in mind is why did she held and flirt with me after telling me she's a bi? Maybe she's happy that i did not show her any negative feelings after her confession? And because of this, i felt full of hope , that maybe i'm the first one that made her develop a little feelings towards a guy? My mind was full of question. And it was obvious that i showed her that i like her, it's impossible for her to not get it. But i really can't tell whats going on in her mind. I get a little bit desperate in our whatsapp and snapchat because usually i'd wait for her to reply if she's late like 1 or 2 days? Now i'd ask if shes busy now? Are you free tonight? I really want to meet her again to talk about what's in her mind. And i somehow felt that i'm invading her space, and obviously she's pulling the coversation. so i'm starting back off a little..... I really can't tell whats going on now, everything seems so messy to me. What do you guys think? She's really a special person. i am pretty motivated as well. Isit possible that she's feeling weird and cannot accept it because it's her first time experiencing feelings with a guy?

100,"I keep getting distracted or losing interest in things. Heck, I can't even read books anymore because eventually I end up reading the same line over and over again without realizing it right away. I don't know when it started, but I know it's been this way for at least a year and a half, and it's slowly been getting worse.

I'm just really frustrated at the fact that I'm so slow that my peers seem to be leaving me behind.

I'm so slow that in one of my language classes, the professor talked to me in private and said he advised that I drop because he ""doesn't want to cause me excess stress"". I'm so slow that he probably finds me pitiful. (I didn't drop, haha.)
I'm so slow that I quit my degree program (computer science) out of shame, because people think I'm so much better than I really am. I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like I was working thrice as hard to get the same results as everyone else.

106,"TL;DR- Well-intentioned best friend has dog he doesn't have time for who's developed awful and dangerous habits. He wants to get another one &lt;___&gt;. How do I (or should I) point out what he's doing wrong or try to offer my help without insulting his parenting?

My best friend- let's call him John- bought a Pomeranian mix a few years back. Let's call her Spot. My family has rescued and rehabilitated dogs since I was born. I worked in a vet's office for a while. I'm no dog whisperer but I know basic training things and dog behavior, which makes watching these problems with such simple solutions going unchecked extra painful. John had never had a dog before and has kind of been learning as he goes, but Spot's not a dog to him- she's his child. He's absolutely smitten and dotes on her in his way. Unfortunately he's provided her no boundaries, consequences, or consistency and she's turned into the dog version of Cartman. 

Her panicked, strident barking is nearly constant if she's not sleeping or her mouth isn't full. She poops and pees everywhere in the apartment, even on top of the kitchen table. She's pretty aggressive even to family members (his little sister has a scar on her face to prove it) and was to me before I started working with her. She pulls on the leash for the duration of all her walks, which isn't a big deal to a lot of people with little dogs, but I worry about her trachea being damaged from the constant pressure. John aggravates all of these problems by inadvertently rewarding her whenever she does something wrong (he picks her up and pets her during barking fits/after she snaps at someone) and by not walking her enough. She's an extremely high energy dog, but John works full time, she doesn't get out to walk nearly as much as she needs, and a lot of anxious energy/the failure of his housebreaking efforts result. Whenever I bring up any of these problems it's generally met by complacency/excuses on his part, as if it was a one-time occurrence and not the chronic problem that it is, either that or he gets a slightly cold, dismissive tone that tells me the comment was unwanted. I try to limit my advice to when he directly asks for it, but those occasions are few, and the advice is never consistently put into practice. 

I love my friend so much. I love spending time with him, but when I come for visits the experience is a little soured by the broken record of Spot's deafening barks/aggressive snarls and John declaring things like, ""Oh my God, my Spot, my baby is so well trained!"" ""So beautiful, so perfect! My baby!"" ""You're so happy, aren't you?"" while I try to hold a poker face that is probably getting worse by the day. I keep telling myself it's not my dog or my place, even though she's peed on/scratched up a few of my things and tried her best to bite me, but holding my tongue has really started to wear on me. I used to be mildly annoyed at the dog for all the concessions I had to make to visit my friend- never being able to leave anything on the floor because she'll find it and destroy it, washing urine off of my pillow, playing steeplechase over the doggy gate they need to make sure she only goes to the bathroom on the tile, but as time goes on that annoyance has turned towards John as the source of the problem, which is a new and unsettling feeling towards my bestie of 12 years. 

I don't know if it's 'cause I find fault with how he treats his dog or just that it hurts my ego that he doesn't generally ask for or take my advice on something I have a great deal of experience with. I know these behaviors aren't a big deal to him but I feel like they're to Spot's detriment- her not being housebroken means an already anxious dog has to be trapped in a crate for hours at night or when no one's home; if she bites the wrong person I'm pretty sure they can have her put down; she doesn't listen when John calls and bolts out of the door when she gets the chance, which is problematic as she's not spayed; and how he responds to her barking and snarling feeds into her anxiety. Anyway, he's already set on getting another dog, when he doesn't seem to have the time to take care of or properly train this one.

I can usually talk to John about anything, but this is the one subject I feel scared of bringing up. I get the feeling the dog is very much an extension of his ego. I think he wants to believe she's doing great because it makes him feel good about himself. I don't want to let this get in the way of a good friendship. Should I have a talk with him about how I'm feeling? Should I have a talk with him about how he cares for his dog? Is this none of my business and should I just keep grinning and bearing it?",17Apr2017,1

My ex and I were together for almost four years but since the beginning we have had problems, mistake #1 was me staying . She has always mistreated me in the sense that she's very controlling and use to emotionally abuse me( I only noticed looking back now ) it wasn't till recently where I decided that it just wasn't worth it anymore. I tried mentioning the idea of breaking up and how we were so dysfunctional but each time I did she would put the emotional card out and simply use that against me . she would often threaten me with suicide , hurting herself , scream cry in distress . At that point I didn't know what to do other than to comfort her and give in and apologize for ever thinking that . Then things would all go well for a month or two maybe three then boom back to same spot . This is somewhat how it went ... anyways we started to get more intimate during the last year that we were together ( these last few months ) so she went on birth control ( I am deathly afraid of having a child because I am simply not ready financially or emotionally and to top it off my family would disown me .. ) so I can feel more secure about having sex . She's comes to my college one week and we have sex using protection and everything nothing appeared wrong . A few weeks later we both had enough and we break up with each other and she absolutely hates me and blames me for everything . and just recently she tells me she thinks she might be pregnant . She doesn't tell me why she thinks she is but she says she's sure . Going into the relationship we had talked about this situation if she ever did get pregnant and she agreed that she would get an abortion if it ever occurred but now how the tides has shifted .. she wants to keep the child ( she has still yet to go and confirm it ) for the sole purpose of getting back at me and revenge . I'm freaking out . I can't take care of a child . I'm a poor college student who lives X amount of hours from her , soon to be taking out loans just to eat . I'm scared and honestly don't know what to do any advice would help . Thank you for your time .

109,"I have this friend who is kind of known at school as a big moocher. She eats your food, expects you to do stuff for her, promises to split costs and never pays, always contributes much less.

Anyway she has been mooching off me for a while and because I have quite a good inflow of cash I never took notice of the ¬£6 here, ¬£3 there etc. She always made herself out has having no cash and stuff (even though coming to think of it she flaunts her wad of cash when I go over and talks about her allowance all the time)

She also has no bank account, so if you pay for the uber on card, she can only pay you back if she has cash, which is never since she will hold out on paying you by claiming she has nothing.

Anyway fast forward to a few weeks ago we we went out to dinner with her sister and I owed her ¬£8    Because she just payed it all in cash to make life easier for the waiter.

We leave the restaurant and she goes I want my money NOW. I was like k let me find an atm. I couldn't find one so I said I'd transfer it to your mum (she literally wanted it that night). Anyway she kept asking me for the money and saying 'this is all I have, I only have ¬£12 to my name right now and I need that ¬£8' her sister stepped in and said 'LOL no you have ¬£400 in your room in cash' she then looks at me and says 'I KNOW you have money and you will pay me back'

On my walk home I realised about her mooching and how actually in the restaurant she had eaten half my food and drank my drink when she finished hers. I had let her do this because she pulls the 'I would do it for you' trick. 

I had also totalled the amount of money she owed me recently and it's ¬£10+ so I texted her and said wouldn't it be easier to call it even since you owe me so much? 

She took it better than I though and said yeh,  but she has been really cold to me since and I'm worried she will like spread stuff about me at school to get back at me etc.

Tldr: took Steps to end a friend mooching , and I'm scared that she is going to spread stuff about me at school, and I have lost her as a friend.

117,"Not sure where to start, I could just really do with some advice and help right now.

To start I am 19. Never had a job, no money, can't drive and no friends. The last time I put my social skills to use was in my college course 3 years ago, ever since I've became a recluse and now suffer anxiety over simple tasks. Also, I am sure I am stupid. The only thing that interests me is art, and even then people joke about how dumb it is to do as a hobby. I feel like an absolute joke.

My life has gone to shit. Roughly three weeks ago my older brother committed suicide, and I am distraught. My family doesn't have the greatest mental health. Not only that, my father's work contract expired the day after my brother died, leaving him jobless. My mother doesn't work. My family have no income, and there is a very high chance we will be losing our home shortly. My grandparents are the ones paying for the funeral, and it's sick, my dad can't even afford a nice suit to wear to it. My whole family is in ruins. I lost my brother, and next I'll be losing the place I call home. My dad is applying for jobs like a madman, but no one is interested. I can see it is crushing his soul.

I don't know what to do. My parents have never pushed me to achieve anything, and now my brother has killed himself they fear I'll do the same one day.
Please help. I have no work experience, I couldn't handle a shitty job in retail due to anxiety, there are no creative jobs in my area, and I'm not talented enough anyway. The only ambition I have is to maybe be a graphic designer or a concept artist. I don't want to be rich, I just want to be happy and create. Like I said, I'm too fucking stupid to do anything else.

That's all. I'm watching my family struggle and lose everything, and I am terrified.
Thank you to anyone who has advice. I appreciate it immensely.",17Apr2017,16
118,"I don't want to sound like this edgy teen that diagnoses himself with depression just because, but I really need some help.

For background info, I've been diagnosed with depression last year. I stopped caring, and I just lost hope. I changed from a good school to this shitty school, and that really fucked my mind up.

On late November to early December 2016,I lost two close ones in a week. That's when I started feeling this way. Two funerals in a week fucked me up badly. My dad became more aggressive (not abusive, don't worry), my mother got more paranoid. That which caused our relationship and communication to break. 

That's where I want to get to the point. I've never felt so much more alone. I've become an asshole douche to other people in my school. I've ruined my reputation by getting suspended for two days and pretending to be a Neo-nazi (racist jokes about Jews, doing the right arm salute, yada yada...), just because I wanted to get people to ""like me"".

122,"I am an Engineering major in Europe and I am currently taking a compulsory ESL course related to job hunting at my uni. Our assessments include submitting a resume and application letter in response to a job advertised in a job search website as well as attending a mock job interview.

I know that a lot of it has to do with selling yourself to the potential employer and this obviously involves some language skills where you want to be as persuasive as possible. However, the problem is that I sometimes feel like I don't have any skills and abilities which are required for an engineering job. The truth is that I have spiraled into depression since uni and I've been failing courses and getting terrible grades throughout the year. I didn't get any internships and I don't have any friends at uni. 

I really don't know what I should put down in a mock resume as I feel like I can't even meet the basic requirements of being an engineer. This is especially the case when all of my peers seem to be smarter than me. I'll be honest and admit that if I were an employer, I won't hire myself as well given how screwed my grades are.

Tbh I sometimes feel like I have picked the wrong major but obviously I cannot say this during a mock job interview. I do have my own strengths and abilities but I don't think that they're applicable in an engineering job and I think that the marker will penalise me for putting them down.

So... what should I put down in my mock resumes and application letters? The same applies to these mock interviews - what should I say to get good marks when the truth is I am screwed? I don't want to get bad grades in this ESL course given that my grades for my Engineering courses are already extremely low.

127,"I currently study at uni. Despite suffering with 5 years of anxiety, particularly in social situations, I'm still super ambitious with big plans for the future. Around two weeks ago, I came to the realisation that the causes of my anxiety could be irradiated with consistent practice and improvement (getting out of my comfort zone etc).

I've just come back home for the easter break. Being here for too long just seems to suck the life out of me, you know? My friends for 10 years+ are still doing the same shit! They're so content with where they're at. We're all around the same age - 22/21. Most of them are big stoners, they medicate throughout the day and live so carefree, and from a 3rd person perspective I see their lives spiralling down.

Actually, I can't be too fatalistic because some of them are doing really well for themselves. Despite this, I have no urges to see them just because we're all on different paths. Because of my current situation, if I'm not moving forward and improving, I quickly fall back into old anxious thinking patterns which makes me feel like shit. 

The same goes with my parents. I love them to death of course, but they are happily content with their current routines and I'm happy for them. However, in order for me to function around those I love, I have to 'degrade' myself almost. I'm not saying degrade as in ""I'm better them"", I just have to mould myself to fit their own realities. This drains me of energy, makes me feel worthless.

Since focusing more on myself, I'm much more conscious of this. I realise that if I was where I need to be at to feel a sense of wellbeing, I'd be able to function with them perfectly because my own reality would be intact and true-to-self. Because I'm not 'complete' myself however, right now it just doesn't work.

Can anyone else relate to this situation? It's something I've been pondering on for the last couple days. I regard those friends as family now; we will never *not* be in contact. As ""family"", surely theres a line that must be drawn?

Any help would be much appreciated! I honestly wasn't sure where to come. I really need a mentor or something right now. 

**Edit:** I should probably also mention that my current anxious state may be playing a role in my current thoughts on the situation. This has led me to many irrational conclusions in the past. I'm more happy to hear any thoughts that contradict what I've just mentioned!

131,"My parents have really put me in a pickle. Back where I was living till I turned 18 there was no drivers ed. I was working 60+ a week on top of high school to support my parents. And they refused to teach me how to drive for years. I got some friend to do it when I could manage a free hr. But it was never enough nor frequent enough to learn anything. So now I've moved into a new place back in with my parents. And surprise surprise I'm working a fuck ton of hours and barely driving again. I tried to find a driving service near me but there isn't which is super frustrating. I've had a car in my name for a couple years now. It's this beatin up lil gold car my neighbors pity gave me because they felt bad. (I'm very grateful tho) my parents keep pawning me off to family to teach me but they keep taking me back to square one and then just stop teaching me. Over and over with different people. Same goes with friends. So I don't have a license. I don't know anyone here to move out with. There's no place in walking distance of work I can rent out. Nothing even biking distance. Everything here is in highways. I had two grand saved up to rent a new place and they took advantage of my money again and it's quickly dwindling. I'm just so fucking frustrated. Because there's just no easy way out without being screwed on my end not there's. I don't want to be homeless. I don't want to keep hitching rides off of people. I just want to have my license and my own life. After verything my family put me through I've earned a few solid years of solitude if anything my own right to get food when the fridge is empty üò≠

When I bring these concerns into my family, telling them I need serious help from them so I can get out and mature they just turn it into a circler arguement about how I never help out and I just throw tantrums. (Aka tell them I'm not okay with them just taking my car whenever they feel like it. Or steal my money from my room.) oh yeah and I don't even have a bank account right now because they refuse to take me into town for it. So I have to hide my cash tips or they'll steal them. Like I know I could just steal the car or something but I really can't drive that well because no one will teach me. Or dedicate to it anyway. What do you guys think I should do. 
I'm genuinely scared I'll never have my own life. God I want to date and be able to sleep naked. Fuck I just want to be able to pee when I get home from work and not wait two hours because all my family likes to read on the toilet. Like I've fought with them for years and now they are somewhat pleasant but I'm still suffering from their negativity and abuse from before. I just want to be free to make my own decisions again. If I spend myself into debt that's my choice to make. Not there's. I'm sick of working myself to the bone and barely having enough to eat after a 12hr shift. And I'm not even close to being 19. 

I know this sounds like a childish thing to say but it's really unfair my own family has put me in this position. ",17Apr2017,1
132,"We started off as friends, and then one day she asked if I was gay [no biggie]. I told her I wasn't. Shortly after, she began aggressively hitting on me. 

She asked me out for drinks. I didn't want to be too presumptuous and treat it as a date, so I made sure to ask first. She kept playing it down as just ''two friends getting drinks after a stressful week''. 

So I went on this date, and when we got really drunk she confessed to finding me incredibly attractive and that she wanted to kiss me. I took her home after that. Since she's a co-worker, I see her regularly and we talk. She's brought up insinuations that I'm gay and in the closet, and I've asked her politely to stop calling me gay. Her response?

&gt;*''Buy why? Everyone in the store thinks you're gay''*. 

This cut me deep. I wasn't sure if she was trying to give me self-esteem issues or if she was just being unnecessarily honest. 

She texts me whenever she seems to be bored. I politely respond since we're work colleagues. 

She hits on me and tells me I'm pretty and that she likes me. She's also bisexual. 

It seems whenever I push back any advances she makes in text, she gets stroppy and bitchy and then makes insinuations that I'm gay. 

She kept spamming me all day today urgently [I was busy]. When I finally responded, I asked her what's going on and she acted like it was nothing and just acted casual and asked if I had SnapChat. I told her no, and she called me a liar because SnapChat tells her I do have it... [I just don't want to add her]. 

Anyway, I said I must have uninstalled it. But I am tired of having to justify myself to someone who I'm not even dating. As soon as I rejected her and said I wasn't going to add her on SnapChat she started up with the homosexual insinuations again.

My friend did something hurtful related to how he's scary when angry and I became quiet while internally wondering if my reaction was justified or I was just a cunt. Eventually, my friend and I start talking (arguing) about and friend says I could do anger him because I could not stop things after he had signaled with body language that I should stop. I bring up that he didn't read mine either, he makes a hurtful comparison and I yell at him to get out the room.


the entire time, as in literally word for word, thought for thought like an internal monologue  I was wondering if I was being manipulative, I was putting up how the situation would sound to reddit, switching the posts perspective between me and him to see if one was more likely to be seen as manipulative , over analysing each little word,movement and tone of voice coming from me to see if they were controlling or abusive.



the friend comes back and i leave the room, sneaking out to a little green place outside my house and decide to sit and wait- while also wondering if im manipulative-, deciding i should return when i could no longer see a certain cloud i spotted. I eventually come back having spent the entire time wondering - you guessed  it- if i was being manipulative. he says sorry and i imideally start asking him if i was manipulative and  he ask how i feel and i realised something.

*i had spent so much time wondering if my reaction was manipulative i diddnt even know i was okay.**

this leads to him saying manipulation is when you try to change/overdo a reaction for a result i bring up things like peoplebeing more assertive to stand up for themselves and parents trying new methods on a toubled kids and ask if thoose are to. he says no but still assures me im not.at this point my reaction was to teel him the worst thoughts i had because if he accepted them i kneew i wouldnt be manipulative.

I know high school relationships rarely last but I truly thought we would be able to make it work. The problem was, we were too different to begin with and over time we grew further and further apart. We grew angry at each other and would fight over e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g. We would be so reliant on our phones to keep us connected that we forgot how to have real conversations when we're together. We would see each other less and less, until it got to a point where it was normal to not visit for weeks at a time. The issue is, through all of these obvious red flags and problems- I still loved him... and I still do love him. I know love isn't enough to make a relationship last and I'm pretty sure he's extremely angry at me for ending it... but it got to a point where we were toxic for one another and I feared we'd only end up resenting each other if we went any longer.

139,"So I don't really know where to start, but here goes.  So I've been dating my girlfriend for 2 years now, and her family has a little more money than mine. Both of us really don't care about it, but her family, especially her mom and her sister, seem to have some stuff to say about it.  They never told me, I've heard through her, but they thought it was weird, for example, one time I came up to see her before she went away for a trip, and I didn't take her out to a restaurant.  At the time, I couldn't afford it, but apparently me driving an hour and a half to see her (she lives far away but goes to school close to me) wasn't enough.  
This came to a head yesterday. Apparently her sister was complaining that I don't take my girlfriend to expensive restaurants and buy her gifts.  Now her sister just broke up with her boyfriend, who did all that stuff.  So I texted my girlfriend something along the lines of ""no wonder he broke up with that gold digger"". Except that her sister was secretly reading all of this over her shoulder. Her sister has said some screwed up stuff before, never to my face, but behind my back (one time on Christmas she was saying shit about the fact my mom is an immigrant). The problem is that my girlfriend just lets her get away with this stuff and the mom doesn't step in because she doesn't want to deal with it.   Another thing is her mom is obsessed with her weight, and apparently bothers her about it all the time (she has put on a little weight recently). Yesterday was Easter and she was texting me from her bathroom crying because they had family over and apparently everyone was being judgmental of her. But my gf tends to be really sensitive so I don't know if it was really that bad, or she was overreacting.  
So my girlfriend is at school most of them time, but every time she goes home, she texts me and complains about her mom and sister, and it seems every time they have something to say about me. It honestly makes me feel like garbage, and it makes me want to end the relationship. There are other reasons why I don't think this relationship will work out unrelated to her family, but this bothers me the most.  Any advice? ",17Apr2017,2

1 year later I quit again and here we are. What drove me to quit was the fact that I am not a night person at all, I thought over time it would get easier, but it just kept getting harder and harder to stay awake and work as efficiently as my coworkers.

We have been understaffed for 1 year and it's basically been 10-11 hour shifts 3 times a week. I get that long shifts are just something you do as an adult, but overnight is another story.

I sleep from about noon till 8pm most days, go into work at 10 pm and get off at 6am. It's always been very difficult for me to keep that sleep schedule. The worst part about it is that I miss 9/10 family and friend events. Yesterday I missed easter with my father because I had to work that night, meaning I slept all day.

Normally I try and stay awake for those things but the pallets in our store were getting out of hand and I needed as much rest as possible or I wouldn't be able to be worth a damn. I can't talk to any co-workers about this, because they all appear to be super human nocturnal soldiers.

Reasons are that I get very bad hangovers, never remember anything from the night before, drink too quickly, have quite an addictive personality and am unable to sleep or function well after a night out drinking. *Solution: cut out all drinking from my life.*

Sounds simple, however all of my friends drink (a lot). We're young and it's socially accepted that that's just what you do at our age. And I find it very difficult to reject drinks every time we go out. People also always assume your trying to be better than them or just find it odd that you dislike drinking. I also get the feeling that people don't want you there if you don't drink. And being the only one sober around drunk people isn't fun either.

From experience I know how to avoid situations where an excess of alcohol will be consumed, although that would mean I can't go out with my friends. And I've tried that, usually resist to go out for ~3 weeks and eventually I just give in and get really drunk.. 

What I can do is just drink moderately. However I find it very difficult to control myself in the moment. Knowing that taking another beer will feel even better than before. And you also run into the same problem as before, drink 2 beers and say you've had enough?

The only solution I can think of is to get new friends. But besides their drinking habits (which is normal here) I really like them.

 Is there anything I can do, or is this something he'll have to handle alone? If this is one of those 'it takes time' things, what do I do in the meantime to make sure my decisions are mutually beneficial?

164,"Hopefully this is the right place to ask. 

We've been best friends for about 10 years now. A few years back he and his wife got divorced and he had a really tough time. I mean spiraling depression, alcohol, etc.

Eventually he pulled himself out of it and met another girl. Now mind you he was always clean and well groomed before. Once he met the new girl his personal hygiene (and hers) have tanked. It's to the point of me not being able to go over their house because it's filthy and they're filthy. I feel like I need a shower whenever I finally crack and go over.

Now they've started coming over my place instead and bring their new unwashed puppy that's also filthy and sheds like mad. By the time they leave my house stinks like BO and dog. 

How do I ask them to clean? I can't take it anymore. I put up with it for this long but I just can't. I tried so hard but it's horrendous. 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to hurt his feelings or wreck our friendship but this needs to change if he wants to hang out in person.

165,"I‚Äôm not freaking out about this or anything I just thought I‚Äôd ask since my insurance hasn‚Äôt kicked in yet. So, I just moved into a new apartment that is pretty great and they did a cleaning before I moved, but I like things a bit cleaner and there were a few things I had to do when I got in there (fix some caulk issues in the bathroom, add a bit more paint to touch up some discolored spots, a few other things) nothing major. While doing this I was drinking ice water with ice from the freezer. After my third glass the automatic ice maker had to catch up with me, and when I saw the new ice cubes I notice tiny beige bugs frozen in the ice cubes. I threw out that batch of ice and made a few more thinking it would eventually flush out all of the bugs but it‚Äôs been two days and there are still bugs in my ice. They look like fleas but larger and have a light brown almost white color. I called maintenance to come by and fix whatever the problem is or provide a new refrigerator.  

I feel like I likely drank one or two of the bugs in my first few glasses of water which is probably not a big deal. But, I‚Äôm also worried that I may have drank the eggs of whatever this creature may be and may have some sort of parasite. Mostly, this popped into my head because a friend of mine recently had a horrible experience with worms after a trip to India and she told me about it in graphic detail.

172,"TL;DR: A creepy guy won't leave me alone. I contacted the campus police (we go to the same school), and they said they'd talk to him, but now I'm afraid that he will get pissed off and hurt me. I need advice on what to do at this point because I'm terrified. 


I think a guy might hurt me. I was on an online dating site for a while, and this is where we first came into contact. We messaged back and forth for an hour or so, and he asked if we could meet up pretty quickly. I said that I wasn't comfortable with that since we had just started talking, and he said that it was fine but he would like my number so that we can talk more easily. I agreed and (stupidly) gave him my cellphone number. We texted for a little while, and all was pretty normal. He didn't push me to go out with him, and he seemed to have had decent boundaries. Like I said, all seem normal, so after a few days of texting regularly, he asked again if we could meet up sometime. At this point, I had been on three unsuccessful dates since my breakup, and I thought, ""what the hell, why not?"" He seemed nice. I wasn't free anytime soon, so I told him that it'd have to be after Spring Break. He goes to the same school as me, so we had planned to meet somewhere at school. The first weird thing he said to me was something like, ""I'm not going to let you back out of this!"" I hesitated to respond, thinking that it was a bit aggressive, so I didn't. I then got a text a few minutes later from him explaining that he meant it in a joking manner, and he hoped that I didn't take what he said the wrong way. I shrugged it off and continued texting him. I don't know how much longer after this it was, but he started asking really weird and random questions, like: do you put milk or cereal in the bowl first? Peanut butter or jelly on the bread first? What's your dream car?
Just totally out there and random. I eventually asked him what made him ask such random questions, and he said ""that's just how my mind works!"" I eventually stopped answering the questions because it was weirding me out. Then he started asking very personal questions: Do you watch porn? How often? What kind? 
Now, some people think that watching porn is a deal breaker, so I vaguely answered with ""sometimes, it varies what kind""
Then he told me that he was going to go masturbate. I stopped talking to him after that, and he apologized saying that it might've been too personal. I admitted to him that yes, it did weird me out, and that I don't want to know when he does that, and he said he's sorry and that it won't happen again. I started trying to stagger off the conversation after that, thinking something might be wrong with this guy. One night sometime after that, he texted me telling me that he trusts me completely. THAT was weird. We had only been talking for a few days, and it was a big red flag that he trusted me completely. He then told me that he didn't have any friends and had never dated or kissed a girl. He then admitted to me that he has dark thoughts about other people that he would never tell anybody about, not even his parents. I asked him to clarify if he meant that he has mean thoughts about other people, and I admitted that I do have mean thoughts about other people sometimes, but he said no, he has dark thoughts about other people. I told him that I've never had dark thoughts about other people, but I have had them about myself. I then found a way to end the conversation and quickly blocked him on all social media (he was my FB friend and followed me on both of my Instagram accounts). I then noticed that I had had a photo of my class schedule on my Facebook that he could've easily seen. I think that's when I started to get really freaked out. The next day at school (I get there in the morning while it's still dark), I locked myself in the sculpture room and turned off all the lights and hid from the windows until somebody else came in the room. He texted me that day, and I told him that I was no longer interested in a relationship, that I needed to get over my ex because we had just broken up, and that I needed time to myself. He said okay, I'll wait for you because I think we could be something great together, to which I replied: don't. 
He then told me that somebody had ""hacked"" him and to ignore the video of himself masturbating that was sent via Facebook. I had already blocked him at this point and never received anything, so I ignored it. Also, at some point between all of this, he started asking me which buildings I was frequently in at school. He asked multiple times, and I eventually lied to him saying I was somewhere else, in case he was planning on ""running"" into me.
He left me alone for a few days and then texted me that he was very stressed out because his insurance rejected his new Crohn's medication, and now he has to use injectables. I texted him telling him not to worry. I had to inject myself with blood thinners for weeks, and I told him to have his parents give him his shots. That was all I said, and he texted me nonstop for about three days until he stopped again. Then I got a text a few days later saying that he misses talking to me. I ignored it. He then told me that he would not let me ""push him away"". A few days later he said that he explained our situation to his coworker, and his coworker told him that he had fucked up. He promised to leave me alone unless I messaged him. Hallelujah! He didn't text me for a few days, and then the other day he texted me saying he was very depressed and needed somebody to talk to. I ignored it because it was obviously bait for me to start talking to him again. Two days later I received and email from him saying that he misses talking to me and that he thinks we would be great together and that he will leave me alone unless I message him back. Then he explained that he found my email via the campus directory, and that's when I contacted the campus police. The police listened to my story and said that they'd contact the guy and tell him that if he doesn't leave me alone, then there will be consequences, but I feel like the officer wasn't taking me seriously. 
Now I'm paranoid that the stalker guy is going to show up to my classes and shoot me or find me and kill me in some horrific way. I have an awful feeling in my gut, and I don't feel safe anywhere. I don't know what to do anymore, and I need advice on what to do. I'm scared shitless, and I'm even more afraid to go to school. Finals are in a couple of weeks, so I can't afford to miss class.

174,"Hey reddit, I could use some help. So I'm currently out of work right now and I've been looking around for a while now for jobs on a bunch of different job websites. But I've just realized that I have no qualifications in anything, so I'm not having much luck finding a job because everything is beyond my skill level and they typically want some one with a few years experience, in whatever the job entails normally. I have a career in mind that I'm trying to achieve but, it's not the sort of thing that comes to you overnight so I need something just to keep paying my bills.

So I've decided I should do a course online in something that can just get me a quick qualification just to get me working again in the meantime. What are some courses worth taking do you think?

TL;DR: I'm out of work, with no qualifications of any kind, I'm looking to study a quick course online just to get me working again. Before I make a commitment to study something.

175,"Sorry for the clumsy title, but I wanted to include all the basic information at a glance. 

To clarify and provide useful information as you read this, I just turned 18 and she just turned 20. I'm a senior in high school, she's a sophomore in college and also in the Army Reserves (this will be important later). We will also coincidentally be attended the same college next fall. 

So I met this girl at work, we both work at the same restaurant part time (before you say anything, several other people who work there are in relationships with other employees; it's not frowned upon by management. I know some people say ""don't date people you work with"" but that's a totally different conversation, Im not asking to hear that now). Anyways, I would just talk to her while we worked but I didn't think much of it at first. Later on though she asked for my Snapchat and all that shit, and in general it became increasingly obvious she liked me, which is cool because I've come to like her too. Well recently she essentially said something to the effect of ""I like you, let's go out""  to which I said would be nice. 

I mentioned all this to my dad, and he's pretty cool so I expected him to congratulate me and wish me luck, but instead he started acting very strangely. He said ""something's not right here"" and that ""an older girl never likes a younger guy, it just doesn't happen"" and also ""she's in the Reserves, I've met people in the reserves and I know how they are. I think she is trying to get you into a mess that you can't get out of.""  I asked him to elaborate on any of these things, but he couldn't, he just said ""this is just the way things are, I know it."" And he advised me not to see her outside of work, ever. But he added that if I want to, I'm old enough to choose what I want to do, but it will take a long time for her to gain his trust. 

So to me this isn't fair. I know this girl well enough to trust that there's nothing shady going on here. I may be young but I'm smart enough to understand people, and I'm pretty good at reading people, so with all this in mind I don't see a problem as of now. Obviously I could be wrong, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. I also have no idea why a 2 year age difference is weird. I even talked to my brother, who is 30, and he says there's nothing weird at all about the age difference or anything.

So is there anything I can do or say to my dad to get him more on board with this? Or should I just say screw it and do what I think is right, especially considering I know this situation way better than he does (he's never even met this girl!)?? And finally, do any of you agree with my dad here? And if so, can you please actually explain why.  

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks internet strangers!

176,"I'm a 27 year old female. I was 19 when this occured. When I first turned 19 I came out as a lesbian. Being in a smaller town, I didn't know many people in the LGBTQ community but I quickly became friends with a group of lesbian women who hung out together all the time. They were my age and I was pretty much best friends with one of them (used to spend weekends at her place and party a lot). There was a lesbian couple who also used to hang out with us and they were in their early 20's. At first everything was fine. We would hang out at each others' houses and drink, have bon fires, go to the lake, go camping, etc. But, soon one of the women from that couple took a liking to me. She was nice, but really not my type and she was also in a long-term relationship. Both her and her girlfriend were very masculine. There's nothing wrong with that, but I'm very feminine and have only ever been sexually and romantically attracted to very feminine women. Anyway, that's beside the point.


One evening we all went over to their house and they had made drinks. We were drinking and they both made a move on me together. Apparently they had an ""understanding"" where they could sleep with other people if they did it together. I had only been with one woman at this time and wasn't very into the idea so I told them no. They respected it but the one who had a crush on me was more adamant. I felt uncomfortable and went out onto the porch with my drink. She came out behind me and said something like ""I might have to take advantage of you"", but then she laughed and played it off like a joke. It freaked me out a little. I'm very petite and they were bigger built and muscular. I went home that night weirded out, but also I was 19 and stupid and reasoned it was just a joke.



Now, here is where the incident occurred. The next weekend my friend had a party at her place. It was small and she invited the couple in question. I don't remember much of what happened. I know I got there early before they showed up and drank a beer. When they arrived I had a shot of a liquor they had brought and another beer. Now, at this time, I wasn't a lightweight. But after this second beer I don't remember what transpired. I just know that I woke up behind my friend's shed and both women were having sex with me. I kept coming in and out of consciousness in the wet grass. I'm not sure if I remember this correctly, I feel like someone was watching, but since I kept blacking out I don't know if that part was just a dream or not. I just sort of remember the silhouette of a man standing behind them. When they were finished, I guess they put me in their car and went home with me because I woke up the next day at their house miles away.


The one who had a crush on me drove me back to my car and we didn't talk on the way there. I felt super sick (nauseated and headache and dizzy), and before I got into my car she told me she was in love with me. I didn't really ever hang out with them after that but sometimes saw them in social situations.


I felt guilty for a long time after this happened. The idea of assault didn't even factor into my mind. I just figured I was some drunk 19 year old floozy who had no self respect. I started viewing myself as ""slutty"" and although I didn't consider the idea that this may have been assault, I started down a road of destructive sexual relationships shortly after this event. I also started drinking more heavily.


I've since calmed down. I'm married to a wonderful woman and although we do like to go out dancing once in awhile, I do not drink excessively anymore. I also have a great career. Despite all of this, the memory still comes into my mind, especially at night. It causes me to wonder whether I'm a bad person for engaging in this behavior or if they took advantage. Did I like it? Did I initiate it? Did I not think to say ""no"" in my inebriated state? Am I one of those girls who calls ""rape"" just because she regrets a consensual sexual encounter? It's the ""never knowing"" aspect of it that still bothers me.

177,"I haven't really been in a relationship for about 2 years now and I feel like I actually finally found someone who is worth my time. He's very sweet to me, 100% my kind of guy, we have a lot in common and connect well.

With my new bf it seems that sometimes I lose myself and feel like I'm not good enough. I'm always aware that it isn't his fault at all. Maybe because I care about his opinion more?

I've tried explaining to him before about the trauma that I have from the previous relationship and that some things might be hard for me, but I feel like he doesn't quite understand or see it as big of a deal as it is. Do you think maybe this is a sign that it's too soon for me to be in a relationship after what I've gone through? I've only been with him for about a month.

Then they said ""I have a zoo that would be perfect for you, you won't ever be able to get out, but don't worry, you'll live really long."" I didn't appreciate them being sarcastic to my honest opinion. Because I hate unnecessary meannesss, I played along and said ""I'd love to live in a zoo because they're so pretty."" Then they said ""Haha, you're full of shit."" then I said ""you were sarcastic first, I just played along, but I really do believe zoos are the lesser of two evils because they keep species alive longer. But that's just my opinion on the subject, you have a nice day now."" 

But they came back and said ""I wasn't sarcastic, I was saying you're full of shit for saying you want to live in a zoo."" Then to end it all, I made a paragraph being honest and apologetic. I said very clearly that I was joking about wanting to live in a zoo, but believe that they're good for animals as a whole. And we have different opinions on zoos, but that's okay because they're OPINIONS. And I apologized for joking around because it seemed like I was being sarcastic, but was trying to avoid confrontation. At the end, I said ""let's call this truce, and sorry if I was mean at all, I just want to end this."" Then they went on again about how I'm so horrible, and that it's weird I want to live in a zoo! I JUST APOLOGIZED AND SAID I WAS JOKING. But they're STILL on something I was not serious, but JOKING about!

183,"sorry in advance for the lengthy post:
I currently work in the IT department of my company, and by department I mean a team of two and a half men. Basically I run support and work directly under the current department manager. The semi-retired CIO went into a consulting role for us.

Basically to jump to the chase we are moving to a google cloud solution which will allow us to make all intranet sites via google sites, a pretty easy to use tool if you have any technical ability at all. I AM NOT a web developer by any means.

The situation I am in is that the IT Consultant (former CIO) pinged me in a group message, including the current department manager, asking if I could throw together a training site with Google Sites. I said yes of course no problem, because it sounds like I can work on some new skills. My manager immediately interjected saying that we don't need a site and that the person doing the training can just share everything via a google calendar, mostly because he believes are department already takes on too many ""non-IT"" responsibilities and doesn't want to have to support yet another platform.

However, I think that a training site will get people more involved and having a portal to go to and easily access all the required information is a plus for the company.

Anyway, I went ahead and threw together a quick google site, on my own time. It is nothing fancy but I am pretty satisfied with the functionality.

My question is should I present the site to my manager first and explain to him that I think this is a great idea and I do not mind supporting it myself, he really doesn't need to have any involvement? If I do go this route there is a pretty high probability that he will kill the whole thing off before anyone else even gets a say.

Or, should I send the site over to the training person to start up a conversation about it's potential and then he would naturally be brought into the fold. I feel like this could possibly lead to him resenting me a tad as he has already tried to kill the idea?

I don't want it to look like I am going over his head, I am just trying to show that I want to help the company and that I have plenty of untapped potential.",17Apr2017,1
184,"So long story short, I'm consistently unhappy with my freshman year here at college. I like what I'm studying, definitely!

But the problem is that I feel like a social outcast, even among my supposed 'friends'. They all seem to be really close and personal with each other. What's more, the original 'squad' from 1st Semester has started to include people the 'squad' never talked to till this Semester. Meanwhile I think (fairly certain, I think) that they are consistently either deliberately keeping me from their plans OR/AND are forgetting me. They also do not share memes with me, even though I sent them some memes (like wtf).

Essentially, what friends I felt I had are now seeming distant and vague. Even in the Fraternity that I managed to SLIDE into (with 8 votes, the lowest they ever let someone in) is growing distant.

This, me thinks, is a consistent pattern in my life so it's probably my fault. I haven't any idea what to do about it, but I have tried a variety of things and advice. I even read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"". I was considering having a 3RD go at the book, but I'm increasing tired of this. 

This summer I am going to do intensive research to see if I have some sort of mental condition that might be fixable with medication and will in all likelihood attend at least the first semester of my sophomore year (my college does not have an Associate's Degree).

I  thought it started out good but the condition seems to have eroded. As I said before this is a consistent pattern in my life and I thought I beat it by the end of High School, so having to deal with it again is terribly disheartening.

I do have a few friends who went to other schools, but I really don't want to leave the programs here.

Currently my options are:
1) Transfer at the end of Sophomore year (I have summer plans)
2) Take a Personal Leave of Absence
3) Stay.

185,"I have one year until I graduate with a Computer Science degree from a small state school. The job is taking over the role of my mentor (Software Developer) who just gave their 2 weeks.  If I accept this job offer, my graduation would be set back possibly a little over a year, maybe 2? I have 6 core classes remaining in my degree along with random advanced electives required (typically easy), overall 10 classes left before graduation. 


Perks of accepting would be discounted class rate, since it is a job for the university, employee benefits and willing to allow me to be a part-time student and work around the scheduled class times (6 credits), normally taking 16 credit hours a semester as a full-time student. 

Cons of accepting would be no longer really having the sense of freedom of being a college student and being able to accept internship offers in Silicon Hills (Austin, TX), where my older siblings have a large professional network that I can take advantage of for internships in large tech companies (e.g. AMD, Samsung, Facebook, Amazon, Rackspace, Intel, Silicon Labs).


However, the offered salary ($45k) does seem low compared to national average for my field. Though I don't really care about money right now and as a college student I don't have a sense of worth, salary wise.

Think Stars Hallow meets Pawnee Indiana (sorry not sorry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ).

187,"My boyfriend and I have known each other for a little over three months and have been dating for about two months now. In this short period of time, we‚Äôve become very attached to each other. Resulting in him being well aware that I'm an alcoholic. And from time to time he witnesses my substance abuse (pills).

He has picked up on my PTSD and basically forced me to speak with him about it. This all started because he quickly found out about my need for violence in bed. He does not enjoy and cannot handle hitting me. I explained I hadn‚Äôt had ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sex in over 3 years and that I was willing to change for him. I also explained that my therapist said it would be a healthier choice to have ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sex anyway. And I do enjoy it‚Ä¶ it's strange but I still like it. Yet, he still has trouble and some nights just stops in the middle of sex and changes his mind.

So of course, I had explained myself. This is what I explained to him:

Back in 2016, in order to feed my alcohol addiction, I started attending parties where I could mooch on some free booze. My girlfriends and I would sleep over at people's houses all the time and get wasted. But I was always drinking the most. I didn't understand why the act of me drinking more would affect my friends so much. Until they told me it was my turn to get the booze for the party. They pulled up to a 7/11 and Sarah got out and walked up to a man in a pickup truck. All she did was talk and twist her hair and then less than 10 minutes later‚Ä¶ we had booze! Seemed simple enough to me. I was a bit scared, honestly intimidated, while approaching my first stranger. I came up to a man in an old red pickup truck, talked to him a while ‚ÄúHey Mr. What are you doing tonight?‚Äù ‚ÄúDon't you look fine‚Ä¶ how do you like me?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy friends and I really need some booze for tonight‚Ä¶ will you help me out, sir? Oh if there's anything I could do‚Ä¶‚Äù. It worked. It all worked like a charm.

Eventually, I found myself engaging in this activity multiple times a week. Seemed harmless at first. Yeah so sometimes I'd have to flash a guy, talk for an hour, or give some head. I had nothing better to do anyways. I loved meeting these men. They all seemed so alone deep down inside. I just knew they needed some lovin. I took care of them for them taking care of me. Simple as that.
Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse when my Madam (Sarah) was replaced with a pimp.

Leo from Russia. What a nice guy. What a pimp.

The girls and I would roll up in an escalade to some mansion and be admired by men. We looked cute and were very sweet to everyone. Was Leo getting paid for bringing these girls over? Probably. In fact, I'm sure of it. But did I get paid? Rarely. Anytime I received cash it was purely because the liquor store would close early so I'd have a wad of cash to give some dude outside of the 7/11 that night or the VABC the next day.
But as the months went on, things got serious.

Some guy, dark skin, Jes√∫s‚Äôs cross tattooed on his back, rolling a blunt had some white yellow tinted powder. It reeked of death but I had a taste for danger. He sprinkled it in that blunt and licked it shut. Puffed it and passed it to me. And I hit it. And then I hit it again. And again. And again. My head opened and tingled. My brain slowed down as if I hit the breaks and were in a state of shock after a close encounter with something in my way. But what was in my way? What was blocking the connection between myself and my own body? I started reacting crazily and do not remember much except for being absolutely terrified of everyone. I smoked PCP 4 more times in April.

These men did not care for my well being. I couldn't leave because Leo insisted he'd call the cops on me. Tell my family. Find my family. ‚ÄúTake care‚Äù of them. I couldn't let that happen. I did an excellent job of hiding my personal life from my personal decisions on the street. I'd get dropped off on a corner. Meet up with some traveling man. But I refused to go to their homes or hotels. I knew I'd end up in a ditch somewhere. Barely coherent sometimes due to the overwhelming amount of codeine in my system (I developed a bad codeine addiction that still lasts today), I'd request they took the keys out of the ignition for my well being.

Soon I was permanently moved into homes. No longer on the street. This was the deal all along: ‚Äúyou sell yourself and in return, you get all the drugs and alcohol you want‚Äù. I was a fucking idiot for believing that would be all.
I was beaten, abused, spit on, pulled on, scratched, slapped, bitten, burned, and fucked.
All my other girlfriends had it easier. I was obsessed with pain. I would be close to death and in a way, mildly suicidal. Subconsciously hoping I'd get murdered instead of doing it myself.

I found myself in different homes, sometimes more than two in one night. Holy fuck... Drugs. Booze. Girls. Men. Guns. Money. Money. So much money. I sat on people's laps, ate acid, danced, whatever. One thing I did was always have my men wear condoms. Sounds lame but I chose the chance of being slaughtered instead of living my life with STDs. Most men were nice about it. Some not so much. Some complained. Some punched me in the stomach. It varied. As a result, my most recent STD screening (last month) reads negative on all panels. Which I told my boyfriend and also offered to show him it.
I also explained that my men were sometimes married. In fact, I acted as a mistress for a solid month for one man. He later got his wife pregnant and they moved out of state. He didn't tell me where to‚Ä¶ as if I'd follow that fucker.

I found myself in bad situations where there were high chances of getting my brains blown out. Sometime in March, I had a gun pointed at my face because I was in bed with someone I really shouldn't have even been near. I was told to slowly grab my clothes and leave with my hands on my head.
Sometimes on my way to a new crib at night, I'd pass my good friend Heather. I tried so hard to always be by her side. She was small. Shorter than me. And I knew she'd get hurt alone. But the strange thing was she and I and everyone else did not hate the position we were in. We were living life. Partying. Having sex. Doing drugs. But the difference between me and them was my affection for BDSM and the BDSM community.
One night in May I got punched in the face. The lower right portion of my jaw. Because I refused to let a man fuck me in the ass. And I screamed and kicked and cried and bled. The rest of the girls were on the other end of the locked door. Begging him to leave me alone. Eventually, some hood rats showed up, heard the commotion, and even though they were hard on the street, they got me out of that room. I was unconscious and still do not know how I was released from that room. Leo got us all out of that house and didn't say a word driving us back to Kristen‚Äôs house.

That was the end of all that.

I later got rap*d in June by my two best friends just before high school graduation.


My boyfriend was shocked but very kind to me about it all. But he‚Äôs been out of town for a week to go visit his family and last night he called me on the phone (like we‚Äôve been doing every night this week) and told me he couldn‚Äôt sleep last night. I asked him why and he said he was having a lot of anxiety about me. I asked him to talk to me about it. But he replied ‚Äú I woke up every three or four minutes for about six hours last night. And I wrote down all the things that were giving me anxiety and stressing me out. It‚Äôs a long list and it has everything I need to say to you. When I get back in town (THIS WEDNESDAY) I want to see you first thing. And then after we hug and kiss and all, we need to talk.‚Äù I asked if he‚Äôs breaking up with me and he said no. And he also said this needs to be done in person because if he wasn't looking at me, he'd mess up and say the wrong things.

I have less than three days to prepare for this conversation. I feel that maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have told him about my past. But I know that an honest relationship is extremely important. I really need advice. Thank you.

tl;dr: My boyfriend is out of town this week but coming back in less than three days. I confessed shortly before he left that I used to be a prostitute for the first 5 months of 2016. He called me last night telling me we needed to talk as soon as he comes back. I need to prepare myself but don't know what to expect. How would you have reacted to all of this? ",17Apr2017,1

190,"So i've been with my company since Jan 2016. Not long, but I'm a go-getter and it shows. I started as a regular manufacturing worker. A posting came up and I applied and got promoted to team leader in Nov 2016. I like my role because it gives me the ability positively influence my whole team and not just my own work space.


A new job posting came up that's open for a couple more days. It takes me down a different path than the one I'm on, but it sounds interesting to me. I'm computer savvy, technically/mechanically inclined, and that's just what the posting is asking for. And yet, I like my current role, and if things go right over the next few years I could see myself climbing big steps up the ladder.


FWIW the pay is about the same for the new posting and my current role.

We are not frenemies, but every time we hang out I'm left wondering why I'm friends with her and why the rest of our friends would pick her over me. 

She's extremely demanding. You have to be all in or not, and that's now how I view friendships, I don't see them as unconditional things. I'm not going to stick around helping you bury bodies. 

At this point I've had it. I've been working 10 hour days and the minute I get off work she calls to vent about things for hours so I told her that I was really tired(in a nice cheerful funny way) and today I find out that she's mad at me bc ""I don't make time for her"" 
And she then she does this whole thing of like ""I don't need anyone though, I'm used to people not making time, I don't care, I won't tell you next time"" Totally playing a victim.

We are just too different, we have total different values, she's even anti-semitic. I don't know where to go from here. 

How do I distance myself from her, but keep our friend group? The only reason why they're friends with her, is because they haven't gotten close enough to see what she's really like. I truly believe that's the reason.  ",17Apr2017,3
196,"Tl;dr I have had bad breath since childhood. I didn't pay much attention to my bad breath but was told many a times by my classmates that I've horrible breath. I'm 19 now and have been suffering from bad breath since the time my memory begins. It was always there. The smell from my mouth does not go away even after brushing, cleaning tongue, mouthwash. 

My dentist checked me for:

1. Gums

2. Tonsils

3. Moisture

4. Bacteria


He approved everything as alright. 

Now, I've searched a lot about bad breath and have heard about gastritis, h pylori, bacteria in intestines and similar problems. Some of the additional problems I suffer from are:


1. Overweight (don't eat a lot, still)

2. Stomach makes sounds (roars, maybe). It happens to me so many times, especially in classes, that my stomach growls and makes loud noise that everyone in the class can hear 

3. The smell in toilet is usually very bad after I'm done pooping

4. I poop once or twice in 3-4 days. Taking a shit is not even in my daily routine and I never feel completely ""light"". It's like gamble. Poop may come, may not.

5. I've horrible body odour too. I shave my underarms, wear clean cotton clothes, but still start smelling badly, so bad that half of the class can smell me. I smell of garlic. I don't eat garlic much, but my underarms' smell is much like garlic most of the times. 

6. I sweat a lot and heavily. (Maybe hereditary, but still mentioning)

7. Even right now, my stomach is growling. It feels like there's something trapped inside my stomach and it's taking rounds and making thunderstorm noise.
 
8. My scalp smells a lot too. After taking shower, when my hair gets dry. My head gets sweaty and smelly. 

9. It might not be related. But there are dark long thick lines at both the corners of my lips since 2 years now.

10. Bad breath has never gone away. Right since my life has begun, not even a single second I've lived without bad breath. I'm very sad. What is the problem? My smells are too strong and can be smelled from one had distance very easily. 

I don't have any internal diseases. Also, this is with me since childhood, so I can't figure out if it because of my lifestyle or eating habits because they have changed a lot since childhood but the breath was always, always, always this bad.

I did an enema, but after 10 minutes all the liquid came right out. I am well aware that I am not anxious, and my parents know this too. He has always been dismissive, so I had a feeling he would just tell me I'm anxious and send me on my way. The only exam he did was feel around my lower abdomin. A couple of years ago, I had a bowel obstruction (the doctor was on vacation so someone filled in, she indeed took me seriously. I found out through the X Ray that I had the obstruction). The same thing might be happening , but my doctor told me no X-Rays, because according to him all it is is harmful radiation.

I feel this is at the point that I need to go somewhere where I would get a thorough exam, and get this dealt with. I can't be missing days of school due to this, and I'm so tired of being bed ridden. my parents will absolutely not take me to a hospital, because they don't want to spend the money on it and they find it extremely inconvenient. I also may be forced to school (my mother is only allowing me to stay home one day), but i will not be able to walk around campus comfortably or properly concentrate on my work. I may have to just stay at home regardless of what she says, as I truly am in too much discomfort :/

205,"Hi Reddit,

I'm an early (getting toward mid now I guess) 30s single male, looking to move on from Seattle WA to one of the three cities mentioned. I've spent the last week checking them each out and am very torn.

Work situation is that I'll be a remote tech worker. My salary is a good West Coast salary and will remain the same no matter where I choose - of course, local taxes will differ. Move will be occurring within 2 weeks, so beginning of May.

Criteria for my decision:
Dealbreakers: Somewhere different from Seattle. In particular, less rain, more friendly/less introverted people, and more attractive and less ""alternative"" women. 
Good property value; looking to buy within 6 months. 
Somewhere fun to live, good social &amp; dating scene in the 25-35 age bracket, the type of place that my friends would want to come visit

Nice-to-have's: 
Mountains/nature/outdoor activities, good domestic and international flight connections, a diverse city with a good expat community, local sports teams

Here are my thoughts on the three:

Chicago: 
+ ticks a lot of my boxes, May would be a perfect time to move there, the beach and block parties over summer sound amazing, great flight connections, great diversity, international communities, food, infinite nightlife options with 4am bar closing, local sports teams... 
- clearly the winters are the biggest downside; I think as a remote worker I may be able to escape for much of the winter so this may be less of a concern. It can be expensive but from what I could gather in 2 days there is great value to be had if you know where to look. Not worried about crime, just stay out of the bad areas.

Charleston: 
+ Beaches, women, exceptionally friendly, fantastic weather, laid back lifestyle, reasonably low cost of living (though seems to be skyrocketing, according to Numbeo etc) 
- social scene seems quite geared toward college age, not particularly diverse, no non-college local sports, could have difficulty finding people who share my sport and cultural interests, not well connected by air

Austin: 
+ nightlife, music, festivals, weather, plenty of outdoor activities, air connections decent (though not as good as Chi) 
- hipster, might be too similar to the PNW, the ""don't move here"" thing, strangely the least friendly of the 3 - a lot of single guys seem to be moving here and it seems to be a bit cliquey. No non-college local sports. It wouldn't be a new place as I've lived here previously before it got crazy.

I did consider Denver as well, but think I'd prefer one of these 3.

216,"Hello all,

I am currently almost done with my second year at a pretty high ranking four year school, and it seems like going here was a bad, really rushed decision to gamble my happiness on. I already changed my major once (from History Education to Psychology) because all of my classes felt like a huge waste of time and effort, and I figured that Psychology would be a better fit.

However, this has still not changed. My classes still feel like a huge waste of time, money and effort. Everyday is just the same unfulfilling garbage that my both family and myself are paying large sums of money for, only so that I can pursue a career that I don't even know if I want, while walking into a shit ton of student debt. 

Long story short; college has always been the plan no exceptions, but this plan just has so many holes.... I'm not happy here either academically or socially. The only time I ever really feel good here is when I'm trail running/biking or working out. Everything else just seems pointless and useless. I'm honestly terrified that the next 4-6 years are going to be just like this, and that I'm wasting away the prime of my life, all the while digging myself a debt hole. 
My family would kill me if I dropped out to work construction and lifeguard full time (I work them when I'm not at school) , and the military is no longer an option due to a previous situation.

And it's really not my goal to garner sympathy from friends and coworkers, so in a way I don't really want anyone to know how much it affects me anyhow.

But it really is affecting me a lot. I'm more depressed than I've been since I started making a lot of positive changes in my life a little over year ago. 

One of those big changes I made was that I started exercising regularly for the first time in my life. I've grown to really enjoy going to the gym in the morning--I go 5 days a week (which would've seemed insane to me just a year and a half ago). Well, I *used* to go 5 days a week. I haven't been in two weeks (since the week before I broke my toe, due to an unrelated injury), and I know I won't be able to go for another three weeks while the bone in my toe knits itself together. This past week has seen some of the best weather in months, and I can't hike or ride my motorcycle because of the fucking toe.

Every time I have to stand up to go somewhere, I get this horrible sinking depressed / unmotivated feeling. Nothing seems like it's worth this much effort. I force myself to go about my daily activities like nothing's wrong, but I hate how slowly I have to walk. I hate how my left calf is sore from being limped on all the time. I hate how I had to cancel tentative plans to see a show this weekend, and will probably have to cancel somewhat concrete plans to see another one next weekend. 

I'm miserable and uncomfortable all the time. Even sitting around shooting the shit and drinking with friends last weekend was too much, so I went home and I sat on the couch and I felt depressed instead.

223,"I'm talking about a 20-year-old female student at a prestigious university.  She does well enough in school (B+/A- average) despite the fact she does nothing but drugs and turns in most work late.  Objectively, everything seems fine. She‚Äôs doing well in school, has a good major and a couple minors, looks very in shape, and has two loving best friends, and others who care for her.  And although she‚Äôs anxious/depressed she‚Äôs been the happiest she‚Äôs been in ages.  She‚Äôs pretty happy considering she‚Äôs addicted to coke, smokes weed everyday, usually has a drink or two at night.  She doesn‚Äôt actually don't know if she‚Äôs been truly been sober for the last month and a half, or more.  Nobody knows this though‚Ä¶ She wants to tell her friends, but she doesn't want them to make her stop.  Although she does want to stop.  But she doesn't. Because that's addiction.

She used to exercise a lot and use laxatives as a form of weight control (not weight loss), but she doesn‚Äôt have to anymore because she‚Äôs lost so much weight from cocaine.  She doesn‚Äôt exercise anymore because she‚Äôs A) lost a lot of endurance, but mostly B) is scared of stressing her heart.  

She‚Äôs been seeing a new psychiatrist since last July, I think.  At one of her first sessions she was asked if she partook in any drugs.  At that point she didn‚Äôt use drugs that often, so she just said sometimes and hasn‚Äôt talked about it since.  But she‚Äôs used sched 1 substances almost every week since August, save for a couple weeks in December.  She‚Äôs getting scared because she feels herself withering away, yet she‚Äôs terrified to gain weight.  She doesn‚Äôt eat because she‚Äôs anorexic, and also because coke takes appetite away. She hasn't overdosed, but has had on two occasions symptoms similar to those of an OD. 

The reason she is scared to talk to her psych about this is because she doesn‚Äôt want her psych to think she‚Äôs a bad person or a liar.  Up to now, her doctor thinks she‚Äôs an introverted home-buddy who dislikes going out. She didn‚Äôt mean for this to happen or to obscure any of the truth.  She also doesn‚Äôt want her psych to take away potentially addictive medications that genuinely help her anxiety.  She also doesn‚Äôt want to be sent home from college or have her parents know.

But once it becomes a reality for others, and the dream has been accomplished, people begin to look at them differently, like heroes or ""successful people"", or ""world changers"" or simply ""life accomplishments""

But what ticks me off is their stories. Their stories are very similar to mine, if not exactly the same. They had nothing. They started with nothing. They had an idea. But they had very little to work with. They made due with what they had. They wrote a book/made a script/built something/etc. They put it out there. People laughed at them and made fun of them. They faced hardships, anti-supporters, antagonism, disbelief, psychological rehabilitation. Eventually, they got to such a tough point that they could only see one direction:

Forward.

Thus, after losing it all, they kept what they did have: Their idea. And they went after it.

And after all that hard work, it finally pays off. They realize their dream, out of all odds, and become millionaires and famous almost instantly.

Take that writer of Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling. Or C.S. Lewis. Or J.R. Tolking (In who's case, died before his dream became popular, I believe.)

Now, consider that I am one of them. I have this dream... I desperately need. I want to enjoy life, but I only can enjoy it the most if my dream is fulfilled. Dreaming doesn't cut it anymore. I want to see it... in front of me... right now.

I know this takes work and effort. I am doing that right now. But the people who handle my funds (I cannot handle it myself because the ""State"" says I am not capable, due to my past actions and history, all because I have this ""Disability"" that makes it ""More Difficult"" for me to manage myself. Yeah, right.) don't want to put me in danger of going bankrupt, so they don't allow me to withdraw more than a few bucks a week. They also don't allow me access to my REAL debit card, the one that is tied with my Actual bank (account). I am unemployed, and am currently seeking work, but all of the places have either not gotten back to me, or have told me ""Sorry, we are not looking for 'Disabled' people at our work."" :/ I have tried to work at fast food, lawn mowing, but I always mess up on something, and wind up getting fired or threatened (And isn't threatening employee's illegal???).
I make money off of Social Security Disability Income, as well as Social Security Income from my deceased father. I want full control over what I use those funds on, such as house bills, utilities, monthly payments, and... my life's work. But they won't let me!

I want to realize my dream! I want to see it real! Because I am human. And most humans, I believe, have a dream. But only those who persist and can control their own life 100% can fulfill their dreams.

So... does this mean I won't fulfill my dreams?

Also, as a side note, I'm 25 years old tommorrow, and by 30 years old, I will have lost the will to move on. Doctor says I will be this way until I die, but I believe that my life ends sometimes before age 30. Why? Because I've been there. I've seen it... over and over. I can't explain how or why... I just know. If I do explain it, no one will believe me. It's very scary and controversial.

I have about 5 years left. Then, my life is over. I've been doing everything I can to make my dream realized. What am I missing!? Why is it not happening yet?! What am I doing wrong?! Is it that I am just too young? That only ""Geniuses"" actually get a dream realized this early?

Any thoughts?

227,"My best friend is being harassed and stalked by her psychotic ex. He's locked her out of her phone without even touching it, hacked into all of her email and social media accounts, and is even threatening and harassing her friends, making some even suicidal. I am also worried about her safety. She's taken to legal matters and gotten a restraining order. I seriously want to fuck this guy's world up. I'm not involved with him but justice needs to be served besides just a restraining order. I feel as though that's not enough. This guy is relentless and his dad bails him out of jails whenever he's incarcerated, so calling the cops isn't really an option. I'd like to hurt him in the wallet or even worse but don't know anything about that shit. I need help, I'd do anything for her and I just cannot stand this bastard any longer. ",17Apr2017,1
228,"I had the perfect start in life, so much going for me, so much momentum, confidence, integrate, potential. 
I had it all. I was so together with myself up until I was about 19-20 and it started hitting me really fucking hard how old my parents are. My Dad was in hospital with potentially life threading things, as was my mum. He told me casually it could be the end for him. But to me it felt like the bottom fell out of my life. 
5 years on and He's in pretty good health but I am fucked. 
If he was younger there would of been nothing stopping me moving out etc etc. But Ive been falling apart. 
I realise how much of my life I held back because they were old and how I would of been completely different man if they were younger. 
I was entirely conflicted with myself growing up and I feel like I have thrown my entire life down the drain. 
I used to feel so solid and secure in myself. So self assured. So confident.  
But here I am at 25 barely leaving the house. 
Ive gone from being the popular one to the lost cause and I don't know what to do about it.
I had a lot of opportunities with life I feel like I fucked up because I held myself back. - Because I was scared of just fucking off and leaving my old parents behind and regretting if they died. 
But there still alive, and here I am realising I wasted the best years of my life because every year felt like it could be the last with them. 
Ive gone from feeling young to feeling like a pensioner within 10 years and its killing me. 
Im dissilusioned, jaded, and don't know what to do anymore. 

I don't know if its a stage everyone goes through or what. But I have been having a big identity crisis ever since. 
Questioning what I want from life, how I want to live. 
How can I be true to myself and be a good son? 

Its like my heads gone from being in 1 piece to a thousand and Im not sure how to get it back or if I can. 

Im finding money, jobs, relationships don't motivate me like they used to. Not because I'm depressed, But I see how no matter what we do in this life it all comes down to nothing at the end. Ive lost all 3 of my uncles. Ive seen how you can save money your whole life. Or spend your life paying off a house only to get cancer and die at the end leaving behind nothing but money. 

I don't know what I want or who I want to be anymore. I no longer feel secure in myself and its as though Im scared to get attached to anything 'worldly' because it can all be taken away at the drop of a hat, through illness, bad luck, etc etc. 

Another thing is I lost a great girlfriend when I started going through with this. 
She was the same age as me but very ego driven, as I was when we first got together. But I think she is a lot more secure because of her situation. Where mine feels like most of what I once knew has gone or changed. 

Im pretty much the opposite of the person I used to be and its eating away at me every day. 
Living with old parents when your young is painful but most people have no idea what your going through and just make jokes about your parents dying etc - as I would if I was them. But then you go home and you realise you would be nothing without them 2 people that brought you into the world and supported you. 
I hold no hatred towards them because they haven't experienced it. But I know one day they will and they will understand then. 

Im done with selfish egotistical people and the weird thing Is I used to be the biggest one of them all. But Ive changed, not for better or worse. Its just like life has started to break me. 

Ive tried living for god etc. But this is where my identity crisis comes in. The me Ive known my whole life feels like its faded away and I'm left with this question mark looming over me as to what to do next. 

8 Years ago people were still telling me I was an inspiration to them. Everywhere I went I empowered people. But shit job after shit job, realising my life is going no where, partly due to circumstance, partly due to mistakes has crushed me. 
Ive been bored for a long time. But without knowing what way to go or what to do. 

I feel like I need to dive head first back into life get things moving again. Get another challenge, get involved. But I've been stuck in a small town my entire life, everyone knows everyone and everywhere I go is just memories from different time periods throughout my life. 
 
I don't know if this is part of growing up or part of giving up. Either way I hate it. Its as though everything that ever gave me meaning doesn't matter to me anymore. 
Some would say Its depression. I say its reality hitting me with a lot of things. 

Things I used to place so much value on - my guitars, my clothes, my car - None of these have meant shit to me after my parents were in hospital. All these things, materialistic possessions most people are so protective of don't mean anything compared to life, and when you realise that its both a blessing and a curse. 
You appreciate people you never did. You don't take so much for granted. Yet you can't stand people that do. Even though you used to be one of them. Instead of wanting 'things' you just want people you can love, people you can relate to and do things with. 
But no one else gives a fuck - they are all still in their bubbles living happily, and good on them. But its as though my bubble has been popped and I'm exposed to the harsh truths of everything. 

Talk about an existential crisis. 
I could write a fucking book on it. 

They say that an idle mind is a devils playground, and thats especially true when your in the situation I am. 
Unemployment here is high and Ive been down on my luck for a long time. 

Take me back 10 years I felt like a superstar. I had it all going for me, I was going places. Everyone wanted to be around me and people I didn't even know knew my name. I was so confident. So happy and secure, but bit by bit the bottoms dropped out of me, before I made it out my parents house. 

I don't want to see a therapist. I understand that life doesn't always go as planned and its something I have to come to terms with. 

But I just don't know where to go from this, whats the next step in my life. 

Im at the beginning of a new chapter but I can't see a way forward. All my friends have moved on. There working, getting on with their lives.
I feel like Ive grown apart from them all and let life slowly suck me into an abyss instead of getting out and putting my head on right when I needed to. 

Anyone else gone through a stage like this and what did you do about it?",17Apr2017,1

235,"I'm using a throwaway account to post this for many reasons. I need some advice on this.

A bit of the background:
My wife and I were married in early 2015. We've known each other for a few years prior to that, but were never actually ""a thing"" until early 2014.

We traveled together internationally, made good money, had a lot of fun and of course - had sex.

Come 2 years into our marriage now, I get a text message from her while I'm at work. I had noticed that things were a bit off lately with our sex life. She was complaining of pain or that she was getting her period. Whatever, being as naive as I was I just agreed and went with it.

The text read along the lines of: ""I need to tell you something. I got something a few years back from an ex and it's coming up again. I'm so embarrassed to even tell you this, but it starts with an H. I'm having an outbreak right now and that's why I can't have sex. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.""

My stomach DROPPED. Instantly. I couldn't believe this. It felt like I was going to throw up, pass out, and FLIP out all at the same time. I had to leave work; I was nausea as ever.

I went home and sat on what I was going to do. Was I going to file for a divorce instantly? Listen to her side of the story? Ignore her completely and move out until things settled?

She told me everything. She had had herpes for over 5+ years. She didn't have an outbreak for about 4 years so she thought it was ""gone.""

That same exact night I woke up in the middle of the night to a pain in my genital region. I looked down at my stuff and noticed little pimples all over it. It hurt - really bad. It burned when I had to pee, it looked horrible, and I felt like shit and was embarrassed as hell. I woke her up and made her look at it to confirm that I indeed now also had herpes. She confirmed that it definitely looked like that. I immediately went to the doctor that next morning.

After an embarrassing time at the doc, SHE (that's right, had a lady doc for this), confirmed that I had herpes and here was some medication to take to stop the virus from spreading and getting worse. Eventually over a week long period it did go away and die down.

I know I'll have this forever. I can never have another sexual partner due to this. At least if I ever did, I would TELL them this beforehand. I still can't wrap my head around it.

What do I do? Do I stay with her so we can just keep passing this back and forth since we're both infected? Should I divorce her but never have a healthy sex life again? I really need some help people.

236,"My nephew graduated from high school a year early and moved several hundred miles away from his mother to live with me, ostensibly to go to school and have better job opportunities. This was in December right after Christmas. He met this 25 yr old guy his second week with me and he refused to bring him around to let us meet him. We got in a fight when I found out my nephew was sneaking the boyfriend over to spend the night for over a week while he was in between places to live and my nephew said he was moving out. When I talked to his mother about it she acted completely unconcerned and said ""this is between you, keep me out of it"". I pretty much went off on her about this and we aren't speaking now. He moved out and is now living with this guy. I just found out last night that he had been lying to us about this person's name and when I looked him up I found out he was convicted of ""sexual battery"" and ""crimes against nature"" against a 12 year old when he was 16. He is now a registered sex offender. My boyfriend is pissed that my nephew exposed his young children to a sexual offender and he wants to get the police involved. He says my nephew is technically a run away and if the police are involved they'll make him move back to his mom's place.

237,"Okay. This might be a bit long but I am really desperate for any type of objective advice from people who don't have a stake in the claim.

I'm a first year college student in a big city in the United States, and I attend a private university that's ~~obscenely~~ expensive. I am taking out loans to help cover the cost of living and to supplement scholarships I got from the university itself.

In order to cut costs, I decided to sign the lease on an apartment near campus with three close friends. Living off campus is a lot cheaper than living on campus, but I cannot apply academic loans to a third party that isn't the academic institution-- so basically, any loans I take out to cover tuition will not be applicable to my rent.

Before I began my apartment search, my parents graciously offered to cover $400 of my rent cost per month. I am really surprised they even offered as I didn't expect them to contribute nearly that much (in hindsight, there is literally no way I would be able to afford the place without their help, and they're acutely aware of this). My total rent per month is $725, so I will be responsible for paying $325 of my own money each month.

This is where the problem arises. I am away from home studying as a full time student taking 18 credits with no steady work, partly because of my schedule, partly because my city is heavily driven on unpaid internships and jobs are very hard to come by, especially for college students in my area (almost everyone, including my friends, are very affluent and there is no need for the area I'm in to sustain a demand for college student labor). I work freelance positions when I can find them, but it hasn't been as consistent as I would like. I take full blame for not being as attentive in the job search first semester of college-- but, I was also a first year freshman trying to get adjusted to my new life.

I am headed home for the summer, and I have been calling/emailing/contacting literally every business in my small town about employment with no luck. I need to secure a job as soon as possible so I can go start working full time as soon as my plane lands back home in order to make rent. I want to amass at least a few months' rent over the summer so I'm ahead of the curve for a while. It's stressing me out so much though, because there's only so much I can do here in school to secure a job back home. I am beginning to get very nervous that I won't be able to find a job and then subsequently won't be able to pay rent in the fall.

Basically, I'm just being naive and learning from my mistakes at this point. I'm so scared I won't be able to sustain myself without seeking a private loan (which I probably won't get approved for, as I'm literally 19 with no credit). I also do not want to rely on my parents ~~because I'm too prideful~~ because I feel that it is not their responsibility to pay my every expense in college. They're already offering to help me way more than they should.

Reddit, what the hell do I do? I've been searching tooth and nail for a job-- do I just keep looking? Do I pursue a possible loan? My lease is for 12 months, and finding employment in the fall semester shouldn't be an issue. My main problem is making money over the summer to go in with some cash instead of none at all.

I'm not sure if it's autism, some other disorder, lack of experience. I think maybe it might be because I grew up as an expat and then as a returnee to my native country, so my language skills and understanding of the local culture were always behind my peers. I used to get made fun of for my grammar and accent so I barely spoke out loud for several years after becoming an expat and when I moved to my native country at 13 I only spoke the language a little bit for around a year before giving up due to the same kinds of comments.

248,"Alright, this one might be a bit of a doozy, since my situation is so...pathetic (for lack of other words), but here's some background information. 

I'm a guy, 19 now, nearing my 20's. The longest job I've held was for 3 days at Papa Johns, and I'm a shutin.

The last time I had any major commitments was when I was still in high school, back in 2013. I dropped out when I was 15. It wasn't because of some dumb ""fuck school"" rebellious phase, but at the time (and to a lesser extent today), I suffered with depression, anxiety, and a large selection of other roadblocks. For the past 4 years, all I've been doing is sitting at home with my mom, mooching off my family, without really doing anything, but this has only made the anxiety problem worse. It feels like the only time I can leave my room without fear, anxiety, or some kind of related messup, is when i'm high as a kite.

Obviously, this can't go on forever. I'm causing the people I love too much effort and heartache, but it feels like every time I try to do something, i end up screwing myself over one way or another. 

My most recent attempt as somewhat integrating back into society was the job I mentioned earlier. I was on the phone at Papa Johns, taking an order. The man I was talking to had a heavy accent, and I couldn't hear half of what he said, but his tone was very angry (and i dont blame him for this, I know it was my fault for not having very good hearing), however, the angier he got, the less functional I was, to the point I was crying and shaking in the store. Needless to say, I just walked away from that job. There was no way I could live it down, especially since most the people on shift were highschool-age and probably laughing about it and blogging videos of it.

That lead me to spend 5 days in my room, only leaving to use the bathroom, and probably the worst benzo binge of my life. I went through a months worth of Valium in about 5 days. 

I know that it sounds pathetic, and my story sounds too absurd to be true, but I want to find a way I can get back into society, and possibly be somewhat self-sufficient (I've realized the chances of me moving out of the family home are next to none, but I'd at least like to be able to hold a part-time job to help with the bills someday). But even sometimes minor things like walking the dog will cause me to get into a weird mental loop, with paranoia about the neighbors staring at me. (I know this is all in my head as i'm writing this, but there's not much I can do with that when it kicks in, and almost all logic goes out the window for me at that point)

In my town I have a lot of family, all under the same last name. A lot of them are terrible people who have done some pretty bad things. My immediate family isn't as bad but I'm now at a point where I don't like to be around my dad for more than about 3 seconds. We don't get along and I feel trapped into a family that I dislike.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been thinking about this on and off since I was about 10 years old but the obvious issues arise. I'm going to hurt some of my family if they find out? What would I even change it too? Then even though changing it should be easy, I'm going to have to update literally everything I own to reflect my name change...?

&amp;nbsp;

I can't move away. I can't really say much else. I hate my surname just as a surname in the first place. It's long and difficult to say for a lot of people. For that reason alone I've used my step dads last name on occasion. Not that I would want to switch to that, but shows you how much I dislike using the other one.

&amp;nbsp;

Just to be clear, part of the reason I want to change is because my family has a reputation in this small town where I am largely unrecognised as part of the family. Yet whenever I introduce myself to people, they instantly regret talking to me. I don't really care what people think about me and especially not if they are going to judge me by my last name. But it's impossible to get away from.

&amp;nbsp;

Just largely wondering what other people would do. I'm slightly concerned that changing my second name would just lead to people asking me why I changed it and having to deal with that 6 times a day and the big one is obviously having to deal with my dad. Who I'm assuming would disown me if I saw him enough too disown me.",17Apr2017,2
267,"I just got back from a trip to Paris and London. It was a school trip for people who wanted to go and could pay. In London, I wore a beret that I bought in Paris and with my friends we were walking back from shopping to meet up with the group. This guy says hello and looks in our direction and I get confused so I quietly say hi back and stare at him. While he's walking away, he keeps smiling and staring at me, looking back. After, I realize he was staring at me and that I couldn't stop thinking about him. My friends told me that he said hello to and kept staring at me and it was probably because I was wearing a beret (which also makes me think about it more). He was wearing a blue tracksuit and holding a cigarette. I can't stop thinking about his cool confidence and the way he smiled all smug. It's been about 4 days and I can stop thinking about what could have happened if I had gotten his number or something.

280,"My friend sent me a video of an overweigt, not so attractive couple demonstrating their sex toys and showing off their sex room while being almost naked. He commented how shocked and disgusted he was as a joke. With a lot of smiley faces saying he wasn't serious. 

Now, the feminist that I am, decided to tell him I don't get why he's disgusted. I said that if they like to do that, let them be. I was more disgusted by the fact that they were almost naked on television and showed off their stuff. As I also would be if they were super hot, skinny, young people. 

He reacted by basically telling me to fuck off because I took it seriously. So now I feel really shitty.

I know this will pass and we'll forget about it. But do you think I should've reacted with 'omg! You're right' and laughed with him about it while forgetting my principles, or did I do right? And do you have any advice for me to handle future situations like this? Because I get called out a lot on being too serious.

284,"Never really had anyone teach me how to file taxes or the in-depth of owning a credit card or how to buy a car and I'm WAY too embarrassed to ask my parents(who know how to do, not how to explain and get mad whenever I try and ask) I made an account just for this; so I come to you, People of Reddit. 

1.) I only have one credit card and it's my bank, rarely use it except for purchases over $70 and important bills. I think I have autopay to pay the minimum, but I pay it off always as soon as the transaction posts(I watch my money carefully through my bank's app). Am I doing it right to keep up the appearance of a wise trustee and should I just have the one card? And I read that each time your credit is accessed, your score drops?? I just want to have a Tier 1 score so I can buy a house as soon as I leave college. 

2.) I was thinking of buying a car (Kia Optima) but looking at my Debt-to-Income, and I'd have to put a pretty large downpayment on the car (About 10K+). But I keep seeing these things about 0% APR? What's that about? Is it wise or is it a scam?

3.) Is buying a house the same as a car? I know the market is usually dependent on where you are and for security, I don't want to say much apart from I'm looking at a very modest area more inland in the SoCal region after. How much should be put down for a house? What is 'Equity'? And is there a downside to refinancing??? 

4.) Do I need to do my taxes??? Uncle Sam tends to take a lot each paycheck...

So sorry for all the broadness, organization, and all the questions, but i've been thinking a lot about this recently and really wanna start getting all of this in order. Thank you in advance everyone!",17Apr2017,1

286,"My job is a technical clerk for a construction company. This dude (not my boss, but someone in a higher position than me, but not necessarily managing me) at work asked me to print this document that's 575 pages long and put it into a binder. Our printer's hole puncher doesn't work - it hasn't worked for like a year. And I also have to send the document to print about 15 pages at a time because the file is too large for the printer. I suggested to my coworker that I send the document to this local printing company that we often use for printing large documents, especially if we want them bound a certain way, etc. He said, ""I don't know who authorizes those purchases, so no."" And I explained no one authorizes them, I just send them and they get billed to our company account and no one has ever had a problem with it. He still said no. So um.. I'm kind of pissed that tomorrow I'll be spending so much time standing in front of the printer, hole-punching, probably impeding other co-workers' printing jobs. I don't know want to do this.

291,"I have another account here, however I am posting this one under a burner account name to protect my privacy. I currently live in a great little city in Michigan. I make pretty decent money and am on an okay career track in a job that I like well enough (the commute is quite long, but I work from home twice a week). I am in a long term relationship with my girlfriend, she has lived in this town for her entire life (even went to college here). We both enjoy this city and have generally agreed that we would want to settle down here if possible (it's a very pricey little city, average home price north of $300k). We are renewed on our apartment through 2018 and are generally cruising toward getting engaged (I am planning to propose). No debt except for my student loans (around $20k), $35k in the bank between the two of us.

However, whenever I get too deep in the rabbit hole of looking at mortgage rates and shopping for houses, I start panicking. I am, at heart, a city creature. I lived abroad in London for a year in my early 20's and it really was one of the best experiences of my life. I always told myself that after I got established in the world, I would move to Chicago or another of the major American cities. The idea of potentially killing that dream to settle down here scares and depresses me. My girlfriend also has some angst about potentially spending her entire life within a few square miles. I know unexpected changes happen all the time in life, so nothing is truly forever, but the act of purchasing a home suggests that we are planning/hoping to stay here a long time.
We have discussed this before and we both agree it would be worth doing. We have a lot of friends in Chicago and it seems likely that at least one of our close friends here may be moving there soon-ish (another close friend is also looking to move away, which is spurring us to think about this). But moving would mean radically changing our lives and leaving behind both of our families. It's a lot, especially when one person has never lived away before.

Complicating this sightly are our ages... I am 27 and she is 25. Within 5-7 years, we plan to start a family. That would be the ideal time period in which we would like to be settled where we are currently. I can't shake the feeling that it would be rather dumb to move to Chicago with the knowledge that it would only be a temporary situation, but then people move many times in the course of a lifetime right?

Together we make roughly $90k. I dropped out of college, she has a degree in a hard science from an elite university and would have 3 years of experience as a chemist by the time we'd be looking to move. I work in a client facing financial services position. There is a chance I could keep my job, some people work remotely from places like California and Washington, but I have never asked after this possibility. Salaries for my girlfriends job category seem generally higher in Chicago, however I fear I might lose out due to having a less marketable skillset... if I couldn't keep my job, I might end up working as a personal banker or something for slightly less money. The bump in her salary might make up for it, but it's another complicating factor.

I imagine that these feelings are universal, a quarter life crisis. I am hoping to get some advice from the crowd to push me in one direction or the other or at least put my mind more at ease. Thanks!",17Apr2017,4

295,"I've been attending a state university for 5 years now, and will graduate in the spring. Occasionally, there will be something that is absolute bullshit going on with regards to faculty not doing their jobs, giving students misinformation, losing paperwork, and being generally incompetent. The smart thing to do in that situation is just talk shit in the hallway like everyone else, but I've gotten angry about it in the past and have posted rants on Facebook. Nothing illegal, nothing threatening, just straight-up facts on why people, who I've never named individually, suck at their jobs. 


Now I've been told that my application for the school's teaching credential program was rejected, which doesn't make any sense since I sent in a fantastic application. I met all their criteria, turned in all the paperwork, paid all the fees, passed all the background checks, and got all my references. I'm waiting to hear back from someone about setting up a meeting to talk about this, but my suspicion is that they're doing it based off my online personality. 


What I need to know is do they even have the grounds to do this? What steps can I take to fight this bullshit? There must be some sort of protest process. They cannot ignore my qualifications and reject me based on what?

297,"****Spoiler Alert: This post will ask you to help me make a life changing decision. I know that my life/desires/commitments/etc will be different from yours, but based on your best judgment, what do you think I should do?

Background: Hello, my name is Hiren. I am currently a high school senior in Minnesota. I am not quite sure what I want to do with life, but I do know I want to try new things, become a leader, and use my creativity to help make some sort of change in the world. Based on that, I decided to pursue entrepreneurship as a career and a major in college. I want to be exposed to how the world functions. I love to learn, interact with new people, and want to go out and see what the world has to offer.

My dilemma: I have been accepted into two of my top colleges: D'Amore-McKim School of Business in Northeastern University and Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. They are both great for what I want to do in life, however, I would like to see what other people recommend based on what each college can provide.

Northeastern University (NU): 
PROS: This university is ranked very highly for their undergrad business program. It is located in Boston, MA, making it a great place to build connections for an entrepreneur and meet a lot of new college students as that place is surrounded by many colleges. NU is known for its co-op program. Basically, students work full time for a company for 2 semesters, allowing them to graduate with connections to many businesses (usually meaning they can probably start working their right away) and a year's worth of experience (allowing them to potentially skip lower entry level jobs). The co-op program has the potential to jump start my career if I attend this university. It can be a great place for me to get away from home and see what life is like outside of my usual life in MN while also learning to support myself. I do wish to eventually move out to a big city like Boston, New York, California, ect, in order to establish connections I will need for my businesses. Finally, this school is very competitive. I am not sure whether this is good or bad, but I do know that it will force me to try harder in college if I am surrounded with people who are motivated to study and try in school.
CONS: The cost! The cost of attendance is nearly $60,000. Now, my parents are able to afford my attendance at this college if it seems appropriate. Regardless, spending $200k is a lot of money that I can use to potentially invest in my own businesses and ideas. It takes my parents a few years to save up for that money, and I have a little brother who will soon be in high school and will be looking at colleges he wants to go to. Again, my parents can afford to pay for both me and my brother's education, but it takes time to save up all of that money. Another downside is time, the co-op program at NU adds on one more year to my undergrad career. However, for those two semesters, I would be getting paid for the work I do.

University of Minnesota (UMN): 
PROS: Carlson School of Management is known to be a very competitive and reputable school around the Midwest. Here, the schooling will hopefully be cut to 3 years as I have IB credits that will knock off some general classes. The campus is very big, meaning that I can meet a lot of new people and find a variety of people that I talk to. It is located right by Twin Cities Downtown, so this can kind of be my city experience if I go here. 
The cost is a big pro here. In order to expose myself to the world even more, I am thinking about enlisting in the Air National Guard. This will cover all of my tuitions, making my cost of attendance at UMN around $6,000. However, the jobs that the National Guard has to offer are basic jobs. That is the downside of joining the Guard and probably the only factor that would push me away from it. It is a 6-year commitment. 1 weekend a month for drills, and two weeks over the summer for bigger projects. Within those 6 years, I will need to volunteer once to go on deployment for the experience. But chances of forced deployment are not very high. It is mostly support jobs. So I won't be sent to the battleground or anything. I will simply support the base and the pilots at the base.
CONS: Even though this college is very reputable, it is not known to the extent NU is. Statistically, NU is a more competitive, so it is harder to get into NU than it is here. In theory, I feel like this could mean that the students at NU, and especially in Boston, will be the people who become the next leaders and top businessmen? (This is just me trying to make sense of the difference in competitiveness of the two schools. I do not mean to offend anyone. Please let me know if you think otherwise). 

I do not want to be just another student who graduates for a job. I want to be a part of a community who leads and creates solutions for the problems of the world. I want to be a part of the business world by taking an active part of a functioning business. As of now, the only way I see me using the motivation I have is by creating businesses and growing from there.

Based on what I said about me, and the colleges I presented, which college (or route) do you think I should take in order to best help me become a part of a global community?

(P.S. If you have other suggestions about what I should look into, please let me know about that also!)
Thanks so much for your time and help!

For context: he was at our house replacing a toilet in preparation for my sister's wedding. I'm not sure if my mom paid him for the work (he's a contractor) but he was there to do a job and move on. 

I was in my room doing some projects for school that are due pretty soon (21 in college about to graduate) and he came in making a big ruckus about the grass bring too tall. Now he frequently gets pissed at me if anything is messy when he visits so I was used to it but I told him that I was busy with school work and already planned to cut it Wednesday before work (I work the night shift). 

He started getting more angry to the point of getting in my face and calling me lazy and started shoving me back for ""arguing with him"". Knowing his anger issues I told him to back off or I would call the cops on him for laying his hands on me. 

This set him off and he started shoving me and taking swipes at me telling me to do it. When I turned around to go back inside the house (we were outside at this point) he kicked me in the back and started threatening to beat my ass and ""beat me with a 2x4"". His worker had to physically restrain him and I went to my neighbors house (cousin) to make sure he wouldn't follow me anymore. 

My family is telling me not to do anything and sort it out but he clearly is a very manipulative and dangerous person, trying to claim that he's in charge of everyone and always threatening people when things don't go his way.

I don't really know what to do right now because my sister's wedding is this weekend but I can't have him around me anymore. At the same time if he ends up in prison that will cause a huge divide among my family and probably ruin everything.

303,"Hello r/Advice, I'm an 18 Year old male who is graduating in less then 2 months. I am currently looking for a new job for this upcoming summer due to complications at my current workplace. I have been working for a local auction company since May of last year. I was offered the job because they were looking for young strong guys to work during the summer. I was their first to contact due to my father being their primary Firearms and Outdoors Consultant. I gladly took the job and started working 3-4 times a week on 6-8 Hour shifts. I was being paid well above minimum wage ($10). During the summer I enjoyed the work. Though as i continued working, i noticed that I was not being treated like an equal by co-workers, most of them were 45+ and did not respect me or my work ethic, which was offputting because i am a firm believer in working until the jobs done and then taking a break. I am in general very polite and friendly with others (especially customers and my elders), i would get compliments by customers on my friendliness and helpfulness. It came to the point where the customers were requesting for my help instead of the other employees because i was ""helpful and joyful to be around"". Another issue that arise was that my boss went to my father to setup my hours for the month instead of me. This became very frustrating because i would make plans several weeks ahead and would still be screwed over because my father would always ""forget"" the days and dates i'm not available. Everyday I would make it an effort to tell him. Most of the time i would be given a days notice on if i was working the next day or not. Friends became annoyed with my last second cancellations and eventually stopped inviting me to do stuff over the summer. The only way i would know if i was working would be from my father. It was impossible for me to call off for unavailability because my father would go into his roid rages and freak out whenever i said i was not available that day. he would try and guilt trip me by saying how lucky i am with how many hours i get and how much money i make. Don't get me wrong, the money is nice but the way i am treated and the issues i am going to address later, made the money mean very little to me. Towards the end of the summer i got fewer and fewer hours. (I did forget to mention that the auction house is owned by a family that does not believe in working on the weekend). Because of this, I received little to no hours during the school year. It was only on breaks and days off of school that i would be scheduled to work. I started working fewer and fewer hours around the auction house and instead went on trips to pickup the merchandise at a client's home. most houses had very dusty basements/homes with mold forming in cracks and creases. This became a major issue with me because i am allergic to most molds. I would come home everyday after work feeling like i was about to die due to my allergy. i would feel like s*** for the following 2-4 days. At first i wanted to leave the job for the way i was being treated by my boss, coworkers and father. Now i have to add the health issues due to my mold allergy. Do you guys have any advice on how i can quit my job without my boss and father being too upset with me. im activly looking for a new job and i am currently waiting on several applications.

Thanks r/Advice
