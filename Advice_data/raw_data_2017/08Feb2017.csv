5,"I've been dating this girl for 2 years and it's been wonderful except for the fact that she has very thin skin. Earlier in our relationship I was super accommodating, she'd miss the bus on her way home and have to wait for the second so she'd be upset for a couple hours and I'd offer my support in whatever way she wanted (cuddle her, talk to her, just relax with her, etc.). It didn't really bother me at first but has progressively gotten to me more and more. It's almost every time that I see her she'll be upset for HOURS (pouting, snappy, quiet) over something like a late bus, ripped jeans or a test that she didn't do well on. I don't feel like this is normal but maybe I'm the abnormal one, I can't really tell. I would like to know what I have to do or what I can have her do to change this. I've talked to her about it and she gets upset with me for insinuating that she doesn't have a reason to be upset (I make it clear that it's okay to be upset but not to this degree). I want this relationship to work because she has a positive effect on my life just not when she's upset so long and so often; it gets depressing.",08Feb2017,0

Planning on getting a new bed thus week so decided to clear my room (a month or so worth of student life) and upon pulling on an extension cord a few magazines popped out. Needless to say the nature is of an 18+ demographic. Do I leave this? Do I ask my parents who stayed in my room ? The content is...  Obscure... To say the least and the dates are before the time anyone of my age group would have bought so... Yeah...

Tldr porn under my bed, not mine - been at university for a while. Confront parents as to origin or burn secretly?

14,"I've been friends with this girl since last year, she was really nice, chill a bit sassy and rebellious but approachable. Ever since she has been seeing this guy, she's been very quiet, depressed, moody and very defensive. She's randomly snapped at me a couple of times, threw fits and always on her phone. She described her relationship as open meaning this guy is cool. But once we were about to hang out I got a text from him and he was asking me a whole lot of questions about us and told me that he was her boyfriend which was obvious. Ever since the relationship has been closed, she's been more timid and defensive. And I've seen pics and videos of this guy and he looks like a complete pervert. He looks like he uses this poor 17 almost 18 year old as a sex toy. She's describe him as a ""dick"" and an ""asshole"" and they always fight. I really miss the old her, what should I do. Because I feel like she's getting mentally abused by this guy. ",08Feb2017,1

18,"Ok, so this might be a little long, but I think it is pertinent, so here we go.  This girl who I am friends with has had a very rough life.  She was in an abusive relationship (both physically and emotionally) for quite some time, and as a result developed PTSD, and became clinically depressed.  She is Bi-polar as well.  The other thing is that she has a tendency to fall in love with others quickly and hard, which makes things especially hard when she finds out that this feeling of love is not reciprocated.  She will crash hard when the fallout occurs, typically resulting in heavy, drink-until-i-black out, drinking.  She has actually tried to commit suicide on a few occasions, one time in which she wound up in a coma.  She is currently in therapy and on medication, but I do not know much more than that.

Anyways, so I have this other friend (both friendships came out of work), and I generally regard him as a caring person, despite what his demeanor might suggest.  He knows everything that I am sharing here about this girl.  

Now here is the problem.  They slept together during one incredibly drunken night (she was drunk, he was not), despite my concerns about her mental status and the whole ""do not sleep with someone that is intoxicated/someone who can't give consent/isn't rational"" arguement.  I was told it was a moment of weakness from both parties, and that it wouldn't happen again.

Fast foward one month, and I learned that they have been sleeping together pretty frequently this entire time.  According to both of them, it typically occurred when she was in a sate of depression/low self-worth, and she needed someone to make her feel ""special"".  The problem with this relationship is that he has no feelings towards her, and he allows the sex to continue simply because he likes it.  He seems to be completely disregarding her feelings and emotional state/problems and exploiting them for his own personal gain.  He is using her.  They both deny it's a problem, but I have seen her go down this path before, and the last time resulted in her almost dying.  I want to break up this obviously toxic relationship because I deeply care about her, and I want her to be in a happy, healthy, loving relationship.  However, and this Is the selfish part of me speaking, I do not want to risk losing these friendships, and I do not want either one of them hating the other.  How should I best approach this situation?  Yes, I am sorry for any incoherent parts, but I'm texting this in a rush, sooo....feel free to ask me any questions that you think would help figure out the best approach to this.  Thanks in advance",08Feb2017,1
19,"I was caught cheating on a test by my professor today, I know it's bad. I feel ashamed and embarrassed for having done it and believe me I am NOT ever going to do it again, it is NOT worth the trouble. I don't know now if I should drop right now before he charges me for anything, or if I should wait for our next class session to see if he speaks to me about it. I'm worried because even if he doesn't charge me for anything and just gives me a 0 for the assignment, even if I get A's on the rest of the assignments I will be stuck with a C. For my major, a C in a pre-req is considered a fail and I'd have to retake it along with the course's co-req. Some programs do not like seeing that I had to retake a pre-req and some even forbid it. It isn't like having a W on a transcript is much prettier either, but I've never had any other W before. I'm not sure whether or not he will confront me on this because he did not say a word to me after class, and I'm thinking that if I drop the class fast enough I can escape possibly getting a trouble? If I do drop, I'd have to wait an entire year for the next application cycle for the program I want to get into. I'm somewhat ok with this since I'm not in a very good state of mind this year and may deserve a break, but I'm not sure if programs will see this as slacking off. 

Should I drop this course and get a W then take it again next semester? Would this help me avoid any charges or is it only going to make things worse for me? Should I wait to speak with my professor? Please help. There is no specific guidelines on my college website for dropping a course before being charged with academic integrity violation. Thank you.",08Feb2017,1
20,"I have been having an issue lately with my last friend. We were best friends all throughout last year and he was a great support. He suddenly started to develop his feelings for me and I denied him repeatedly. He still remained my friend until I decided to have feelings for him, but I got with another guy to avoid my feelings for my friend. Unfortunately, I lost the friendship we had and I still have these feelings (like ""I love you"" feelings) for him, but I have hurt him so many times before and said sorry so many times as well. What do I do? Do I leave him alone and let him be or try to say sorry again and hope to have a relationship or friendship with him?",08Feb2017,2
21,"So I just moved to a city from a fairly rural area, and I have a question about exercise. Where I used to live, I could get exercise just by running down a back road that barely sees any traffic. Or if I was in the mood to go harder, I could run through the woods. So far, Washington doesn't seem to have that amenity.

So for those of you used to city life, I'm wondering if it is a weird thing to just go jogging down urban sidewalks. What about sidewalks in the burbs? Is there any kind of etiquette I should know about if I'm running down a busy street/sidewalk? Basically, what can I do to break a sweat without resorting to treadmills?

Also, for those of you in the DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia) area: are there any good hiking trails in the area?

Sorry if these questions are weird; I've never been in a big city for longer than 4 days, and I fucking hate treadmills for running.",08Feb2017,2
22,"So the TLDR of this was basically I had a friend. Due to differences, we ended our friendship on positive terms.

What should I do? It bothers me he's been stalking my social media enough to figure out my new account.

And I'm terrified of them fighting over social media. I've done all I can to keep them from attacking each other. I'd feel guilty as hell if they did, I already regret ever being friends with him. I would explain it to him but I don't want to draw his ire anymore than I already have by having a loving relationship with his enemy.",08Feb2017,1
23,"I'm a freshman attending my first year at high school. One of the teachers, who I am good friends with her son, told me that I need to talk to my counselor immediately  because I am 3/4 the way in a Sophomore math class. This isn't good, because I'm a freshman taking the wrong class and I didn't even know it was a problem. I can't graduate without taking Freshman math. I thought that getting placed into a higher math class meant that my counselors thought I would do just fine. I was wrong.

So I talked to my counselor about it, and the first thing she said when I told her I'm in the wrong math class, is that they just discovered this weeks ago, and that I'm not the only one in the wrong math class. My counselor also said that I won't be able to qualify for this $1,000 scholarship once they move me where I am actually supposed to go. So she hesitated and asked me if it's worth losing this scholarship to be in the correct math class. 

She gave me an ultimatum: Give up $1,000 and switch to freshman math, and risk getting more confused than I am, or stay where I am now, despite how much math I missed, and maybe fill in the gaps with freshman online courses. 

I'm already buried by math that I should already know. I think it's really jarring to graduate high school while missing an entire year of math. Not to mention that my counselors have multiple cases where this happened and their best bet now is this ultimatum. That's really bad. What should I do? I'm going to talk to my parents about it, but I am lost at this point.

26,"This may seem long winded so I apologize in advance. Throughout this post, I will attempt to mask my role in this scenario as I want an unbiased opinion and don't want my part in this to influence any feedback. I would greatly appreciate any input here(good or bad) and can provide further details if necessary. Here goes...

I will start with the parties involved. There is the mother/wife(her name will be Jan) the husband/step father(his name will be Jim) and the daughter(Her name will be Andrea).

Andrea was offered a paid trip to Italy for 10 days. Part of this time would be spent furthering her education and the remainder for her to do as she wishes. Andrea has always wanted to go to Italy, as has her mother Jan. Andrea talks with her mother and they decide to go to Italy together. Plans are made, hotels are researched, flight plans are mapped out. A few weeks go by and Jim hints to both Andrea and Jan that he is going with them. They laugh it off thinking he is kidding. A bit more time passes and it becomes clear Jim was serious and intends to go. Jan informs her daughter of this but Andrea does not like this idea. Her intentions were to have just her and her mother take this trip together. That is what the plan was from the begging and Jim was not invited. As time progresses, Jan starts to side with Jim. Jim sees this as a once in a life time chance and wants to spend it with his wife. Jan now expresses to Andrea that she is likely not going to go if Andrea refuses to agree to Jim accompanying them. Andrea feels betrayed as Jim had never been invited to begin with and wanted to have a ""mother/daughter"" trip. Jim and Jan think Andrea is being selfish. 

This all leads to a conversation tonight between Jan and Andrea where Jan  expresses that if she goes to Italy without Jim her marriage may not exist when she returns.

Obviously much more dialogue took place between these events but I am attempting to paraphrase. I have my opinion on the matter but want to make certain I am justified in my logic before having this conversation with the parties involved.

Is Jim being selfish by forcing his wife to chose between him and her daughter? Is he wrong for inviting himself then getting upset when he isn't wanted to go?
Is Andrea being selfish for not allowing him to go with his wife? Should she be more respectful of the husband/wife relationship?
Is Jan being weak for not sticking to the original plan in fear of her husbands potential reactions? Will Jan never be permitted to enjoy a once in a lifetime experience with her daughter?

I feel like this may be too vague but I am trying not to have a horse in this race.

Please help!",08Feb2017,1
29,"Okay, so I'll explain the reason I'm doing what I'm doing first. I graduated high school last year, and decided instead of wanting to rely on my parents to help me pay for college, I would work to pay for it on my own. So as my first job (I got last year), I started working in a restaurant. That makes me about $4K annually. Now working there, I found out one of my coworkers had a DUI, and was looking for someone to drive her to the restaurant, her job as a school teacher, for her to get groceries, and to go to appointments. I decided to take that on as well as a second job (mind you I drive a 16 year old truck that has 175,000 miles and is slowly dying).

So now I get payed from the restaurant, and $100 a week for being a personal driver.

However, it didn't seem like I was making quite enough. I know I'm going to need to buy a new vehicle soon, and I wan't to still have money left over to put towards college.

So I started looking for a job to replace the restaurant. I talked to a friend of mine, and he has family who works at a local glass manufacturing plant, and that got him a job there. After he mentioned it to his boss, he found out there was an open position at the plant. He refereed me, I filled out an application, and got an interview the same day.

Long story short, they decided they like me, and my first day is Thursday. My position pays $25-$28K a year after state and federal taxes, and my shifts are Mon-Fri, 8am-4pm.

So here's what's stressing me out. I worked everything out with my other jobs, and my weekly schedule goes like this:

Mon-Fri: 7:00AM-7:30AM:Drive my co-worker to her teaching job. 7:30am-7:45AM, Take the highway up to the glass factory (only a 10-15 minute drive from co-worker's school). Clock into glass factory at 8AM. Shift ends at 4PM, leave factory, get on highway, and pick up coworker from her teaching job, and drive her home.

Sat-Sun: Pick up co-worker and drive to the restaurant 12pm-10pm. Work at the restaurant on the weekends with that co-worker and after our shifts, take her home, then I go home.

There will be some Thursday's and Friday's that I'll be needed at the restaurant, but my manager said I won't be needed until later at night so It'll work out with my schedule still.

So basically, the combination of all 3 of my incomes after taxes would be $34,200-$37,200 annually.

I decided after getting situated in my factory job, that come April/May I'll put a down payment on a new (used) vehicle. I decided that I'll see about a 5/6 year payment plan, which would bring my monthly payments to $330/mo (5 year) or $280/mo (6 year).

Considering that my parents are nice enough to support me, they don't charge me rent, and they pay for my insurance. That being said, $300 a month would be perfectly feasible for a car payment, and still leave money left over to put aside for college.

Being that I spent the last year trying so save for college, I have a small amount of money saved, and I plan to apply this coming semester. With my schedule being how it is, I plan to apply to get my basics done first (through night classes) at my community college.

So the reason I'm stressing is because I know my current car isn't going to last another year, and I need something reliable (and I'm not going to lie, with the money I'm making, a little fun too. I decided on a 2010+ Jeep Wrangler which still gets better gas mileage then my current vehicle, and is much easier to work on too (I'm a gearhead)) to get me to my college classes. Working 3 jobs (one being a full time) makes a car payment feasible, and college feasible, but I know it also makes my schedule very tight. Does anyone have any suggestions? All would be appreciated, thanks!",08Feb2017,1

33,"So long story short, I was coming out of a gated trailer park. Both the gates are swinging gates, and open towards the road in order for me to exit. I figured that I'd go through the gates as soon as there was enough room, except that I didn't see a pole sticking outta the ground in between the two gates. So I hit it and knocked it over. While this happened, I was delivering a pizza for Papa John's. And apparently, I'm supposed to have commercial insurance for that but I wasn't aware because I'm 21 and naive. So I left the park, went to Papa John's and told a manager. The next day, one of the owner's supervisors came up to the restaurant and stated that he had it on tape and that he made a police report. Well, the day after that my manager tells me is probably best to confess to the owner that I did it since it's a hit &amp; run. Well, I go to the trailer park office and meet who I initially thought was the owner. He said he'd need my insurance info and stuff, and I had asked if I could settle it outside of an insurance claim with cash. He then says he's not the owner, but the owner would most likely do that since it's way less of a headache. He also said he'd have to talk to the sheriff's office and see what they wanna do since a report was filed. They said they still needed a copy of my info so I let them have it. They then said they'll be giving me a call later that day or the next, and that they'll be tryna get quotes on the repair of the pole. And their estimated quotes seemed outlandishly expensive. I show up later that day since I haven't heard back, and the receptionist said that she hadn't heard anything back yet. The next day (today), a sheriff gets a statement from me and takes pictures of my car, and tells me to make a better decision next time. I then try calling the trailer park office to no avail, unsurprisingly. Just give it to me, how fucked am I? I'd like to know the possibilities of what could happen. And yes, I'm fully aware that I was being a dumb ass.",08Feb2017,2
36,"Writing this in a rare moment of calm. I'm a student enrolled in a 1-year diploma course for concept art in another country. I'm 22 and I've already finished uni with a BA in something else, but I'd been wanting to study digital art for so long. My parents are very supportive and they paid for everything.

I was mostly okay for a few months. Although it was stressful, I did all the coursework required and improved my artwork considerably. My teachers, my classmates, and the school administrators would frequently compliment me on my work. My parents would tell me they were proud of me. I couldn't tell any of these people that I was frequently frustrated with my art, or that grinding so hard at the coursework stressed me out and made me not want to draw anymore, and that several times I thought of quitting. 

I graduate in less than two months. Recently we began a new subject and I'm finding it really hard to deal with this one teacher. I normally have no problems taking harsh critique. This particular teacher had a way of giving critique that made me feel as though the underlying message was, ""You have no idea what you're doing."" He wouldn't tell me what the problem with my designs was, he would stand there and make me figure it out. I got that my other classmates liked that kind of mental stimulation but I couldn't handle it and I always started to panic every time he stood near my desk and told me to explain my design.  I started missing classes. Every time I tried to do my assignments I would start panicking and it became hard to breathe, so I stopped. Every time I thought about going to school and explaining to that teacher I hadn't done my assignments, I felt anxious so I stopped going. I know the coursework is piling up and I'm missing lectures.

I've been thinking a lot about ending my life.It's actually not the first time--I remember having similar thoughts during particularly stressful times in uni.  I get that it sounds really petty and kind of spoiled; I know how stupid it is to want something and then to feel like giving up when it gets too hard.My parents have spent so much for me. I couldn't face them if I gave up on school, I'd rather die. My parents don't know I've been thinking about this, but I told them I was having problems.   

I talked to an administrator about my problems and asked if he could connect me to a counselor. He was really supportive since my performance up until this point was really good, and I applied for an appointment yesterday. I feel like I should have done so way back when it started in uni, but at the time I thought I was just being lazy/spoiled/overdramatic or whatever.

In the meantime, I'm sitting here at home when I should really be at school, trying to breathe, trying not to think about the piling homework, or my attendance sheet, or that teacher, or my parents, or killing myself. I know I should think positive, have courage, and face my problems, but it feels beyond me at this point and I don't think I'm strong enough. I feel like I'm in a state of panic all the time, just varying levels of it.

Sorry for the long post. I think right now what I'm asking for is advice for dealing with the panic, and perhaps different perspectives on my problems. Please and thank you~ ",08Feb2017,2

We talk and were cool and I've comforted her while she cries, I've known her in high school but lost contact.

39,"Tl;dr: Short lived, but intense relationship with ex. She broke up, claming she wasn't in a point of her life where she could date anyone. I move on. She re-adds me on Snapchat out of the blue, anxiety resurfaces. Find out she has a new bf, inadequacy and anxiety amplifies. 
(I'd really appreciate advice, so please bear with the wall of text and read my story!)

To make a much longer story short, I had a very intense fling with a girl last year for about a month in October/Novemeber. It was one of those relationships where we clicked instantly, and it was perfect. She wanted to make us offical, and I agreed. A month later she broke up with me literally out of the blue. She told me I did absolutely nothing wrong, and that she needed to hold off on relationships because she was having health issues and her life was a mess. 

I went from cloud 9 to the depths of the Earth emotionally in the matter of hours. I had no warning, and the relationship had zero red flags for the breakup. It took me till about now to realize I was finally over that relationship, or so I thought.

Today while at the gym, my phone goes off. Someone added me on Snapchat as a friend. I look to see who it was, and was met with the name of my ex. (We had removed each other from all social media platforms. General NC type stuff). Instantly emotions I thought I had delt with pertaining to my ex resurfaced almost instantly. The anxiety made me want to puke.

Tonight, as if the universe is out to get me, I stumbled across a picture of my ex and a new guy. Through a friend I find out that apparently she is dating someone new. It took all I had to calm myself down before I had a panic attack. I'm angry, confused, upset, and feeling just about as anxious/depressed as I did the night of the breakup. I worked so hard these past couple months making sure she wasn't on a pedastal, and I was doing nothing but improving myself. I lost around 25 pounds and put on some muscle. I graduated college, and changed my diet for the better. I had worked my ass off trying to put myself out there and improved myself in every way I could. But, now all that insecurity is rushing back. 

To help explain this though, I feel like I need to give some context. When she dumped me (via text), there was literally zero explanation. All she said was that she still thought the world of me, and that it was 100% because of herself and personal reasons. She refused to even meet up to talk about it. The breakup was very qiuet, and while I did express my shock, I'm not holding someone in a relationship against their will, ya know? It's a two way street. I knew deep down that (or felt like at least) that she was letting me down softly and didn't really want to tell me why. All in all, there was no closure to the relationship, and we haven't talked since she cut the chord. ( At the same time though I had solid reasons to believe she was telling the truth.)

Today was the first ""contact"" we've had. 

Now onto what I guess I need advice on is help dealing with this situation. I have no idea why she added me back on snapchat. I wouldn't even know what to say if she actually contacted me. I have no idea why she would even want to contact me. The only reason I can think of is that she wanted to talk to me again about our relationship. UNLESS, she is soley just trying to make me notice how happy she is in her new relationship? I would've never taken her to be that immature though. This leads me to the thought though of OUR relationship and why it ended. She told me she needed to hold off on relationships. And now she's dating someone new not even a month after we broke up?! I'm very sad, angry, anxious and confused. 

As you can see from this post it's obvious I overthink things way to much, and suffer with anxity pretty badly occasionally. I don't have a lot of experience dealing with ex's, relationships, etc. If you read this whole thing, thank you. And thank you for any help you could offer!

Just incase:
-I use to have her on a petelstal, but I've worked to take her off that. (Part of that problem was that she was the first girl I slept with)
-I'm aware that this was a very short relationsip, and that it shouldnt bug me nearly as much as it does. But it does, so please help.

41,"My ex girlfriend has been texting me for almost a year now randomly using a random phone number generator apps I think. I would ignore her but every time I do she texts my girlfriend and completely bashes her, I live 2 hours away from my ex. My girlfriend suffers from depression so you can imagine what these texts do to her. I have no idea how to get this to stop.


Extra info 1) No I have not tried the police, it's something I've been pushing for but my girlfriend is highly against it. She has has bad relationships with them in the past. Eventually I might do it anyways but I really don't want her to get mad.


Extra info 2) No I haven't changed my number, although I strongly feel like she could get my number again. She somehow finds out things that she really has no way of knowing.

43,"So in the 2nd grade, I had a best friend who moved away at the end of the school year. She told me that she would come back in the 4th grade but never did, and I haven't seen her since (I'm 20 now and am in college). It wasn't until later on in life that I learned the military base in my town shutdown and her family was in the military. What also sucked was that my family and her family never really met so the only time we hung out was during school.

It's definitely a long shot, but is there a way I could find her? All I really have to work with is her name (though it could be spelled many ways). I tried Facebook and mutual friends, but nothing's really worked. I know that she probably won't remember me, but this is like one of the biggest mysteries of my childhood 13 years in the making. I started to think I made up the whole thing, but I found a school photo from the 2nd grade which pretty much proves that I'm not crazy (for once).

45,"(sorry for long story wanted to give as much info as possible)It is a rule in my house that you have to play piano from when you are 5 years old until you are 16 years old, 30 minutes a day 5 days a week. Both my brothers followed this rule, one turning into a classical pianist and the other someone who plays piano for fun very occasionally. I am 14 I have and still do hate the piano. Nothing about it I like, from practice to preforming. I leave the piano with a bad emotion every time I play. It's not that I am bad, but simply because I would rather do anything else, such as study, play soccer, learn more language, sing and many other things. My Dad feels I should have the choice to quit now and believes the instrument does no good for me. My Mom on the other hand thinks that if I quit I will regret it, and she thinks that piano has many social benefits. My Mom has the ruling voice in my family so I can not quit. I do not see the social benefits of piano. I am very poor at memorizing pieces and will not be able to play more than four measures after not playing for a week. So there is no real ability for me to ""show off"" in a social setting. Also my extremely close brother-like best friend plays way better than me (I have known him for 3 years), practices less and memorizes pieces extremely easily, more easily than I have ever seen from anyone. As for regret I am not sure if I will have any if I quit. I need advice, I have tried to quit and I don't know what to do. Thank you. ",08Feb2017,2

50,"Hello All.  I live in a 4 apartment building that fully furnished with one common wifi.  The other night I was up late having sex with my girlfriend, and i guess it was a little to loud for the new guy who moved in. (a weird chilean man who never leaves the house mid 40s with a ponytail) anyway he banged on the wall 4 seperate times that night, which ok i understand he was trying to sleep.  But then he woke up early the next morning i'm talking 7 am and put his music louder than ive ever heard it and played the drums as loud as he could for 3 hours.  It was a spiteful revenge.  

Had he knocked on the door and confronted me, i would have had no problem, but i don't like people taking spiteful revenge.  I told my girlfriend i was gonna go over there and knock on his door and show him who's the alpha, but she said i'm not allowed to do that.  So instead i realized my internet was a little slow today and accessed the router.  Real easy admin admin password.  Long story short he was the culprit, big time.  Sending an insane amount of packets, lord knows what hes doing in there. 

Well i added his IP to a bandwith rule and slowed his ass down big time.  Ran a test afterwords and i'm getting about 7.5 download 1.8 upload.  I slowed him down to 1 download .5 upload.  

The advice i'm looking for is do you think this is too slow where hes going to realize something is up? I kinda hope he does.  

Secondly, what other spiteful tactics do you think would be appropriate in this situation.  I'm a nice guy but i hate when people try and do slick shit behind closed doors like play the drums.  I know thats exactly what i'm doing now but 1 my girlfriend said i cant confront him and 2 he started, i never had any malice towards him before. 

Thanks for the advice

54,"This is not a joke. So please hear me out. I started drinking tea 3 years ago and it's been on and off. The first time i tasted it, it tasted like nature: tree barks and leafs. I hated it. Then I learned that you can add honey to sweeten the flavor! It was alright. I liked it better. Then i tried it with sugar and then my sister looked at me in disgust saying ""You should might as well drink Mcdonald's sweet tea!"". I still wondered to this day if that was an insult or a joke. Idk. So then a few months ago a dude who made a video about living in america who was british mentioned he drank his tea with milk and creamer. My mind was just dumbfounded. I never fucking knew you can add mixes to the fucking drink. All my life i thought you HAVE to drink it like that (purely) without any mixes but honey. So right now I just made my tea with with creamer and sugar and.....it tastes like foam from packages. 
I'm determined to LOVE this genre of drink because I am just not going to live my life without something to drink early in the morning. (Tried coffee, it made me anxious...but its my second choice) 
What am I doing wrong??
Does the type of tea matters? I honestly just choose any type of tea.

Right now I'm drinking Honey Lemon Ginseng Green Tea. Its okayish. I dont know what the British add to make their tea wonderful.

55,"I'll try to outline my problem as best as I can.  If there's anything unclear, just let me know and I'll do my best to give you more details.  I'm sorry, but this is going to be a really long post.  If need be, I can include a tl;dr, but I'm not sure how to word it, so for now I'll leave it how it is.  These first few paragraphs set the stage.

1 -- This happened in 9th grade Honors English class.  I was a decent student and in a couple other Honors classes.  Mrs. J was my English teacher.  She'd been there for maybe 20 years, so old and a respected teacher, but not so old that she's losing her mind or having any age related problems.

2 -- The PTA at my school decided to give most every teacher a set of those classroom clickers.  These things are supposed to be a way for teachers to poll the class and have students answer anonymously, so the teacher has an idea where everyone is at and no one is ridiculed.

*****

I was an extremely quiet kid.  If I didn't have anything to say, I would keep my mouth closed.  Apparently this led to a few people underestimating me, namely Mrs. J.  About halfway through the year, she had this idea to start having class discussions where we'd talk about the book we were reading, the concept we were learning, occasionally world news, etc, and we were graded based on how many comments we made or how much we contributed to the discussion.

As you can probably tell, this is probably the hardest thing I had to do in that class.  It was all I could do to get my comments in, if I could even get the courage to speak up in the first place.  I simply never had anything to say.  I'd just sit in my chair listening to everything being said.

There was one student who almost dominated the discussions.  We'll call him John for privacy's sake.  John would easily ace the discussion assignments.  Nearly every other remark would be his.  Well Mrs. J has this rather annoying idea that an honors student should be vocal and outgoing.

Now Mrs. J started trying to fail me on unrelated assignments because I wouldn't contribute often to class discussions.  I don't remember how bad it was, as at the time I was extremely quiet (like I said) and I would just take whatever I got, but I do remember a couple times when my mom went in and fought for a couple of my essays because she knew they were worth more than the assigned grade (my mom is a stay at home mom but has her master's in English).

Fast forward to junior year of high school.  Both me and John end up in the same English class, except this time it's AP Literature.  John drops out of the class halfway through the semester.  I continue.  Who's the honor student now, Mrs. J?
*****

Now I'm graduated.  This was maybe 5 or 6 years ago.  I want to email Mrs. J and just give her a brief outline of what I've done since her class (advancing on to nation level for a couple competitions being the ones I'm most proud of) and prove to her that not every honors kid is loud.  The only thing that's stopping me is how long ago this happened.  What are your thoughts?

******
******

Bonus story:  Here's where intro paragraph 2 comes into play.

We started to do test reviews with these clickers.  No harm no foul, right? Just a teacher making sure all the students are ready? Not Mrs. J.  She'd pull up all the results and everyone who got it wrong would have to come up and do 10 pushups in front of the class.

Well I didn't have a phone at the time, so I wasn't very familiar with the keypads where you had to press a number several times for different letters, so I would occasionally enter things in wrong.  I would get a couple questions wrong here and there, and have to do pushups.  In addition to being quiet, I wasn't athletic at all.  It was all I could to to finish those pushups.  The only thing that kept me going was the sheer embarrassment and humiliation of thinking about my classmates' reactions when I couldn't even finish 10 pushups.

Long story short, when I expressed intense displeasure at going back to school the next day, my mom got the story from me and went to the principal who was appalled and shut it down right away.

I'd like to say something about that in my email too, if I send it, because I was absolutely terrified of doing anything in front of the class, and I didn't fully grow out of it until around the middle of my junior year.  What would be your thoughts on that one?",08Feb2017,1
56,"Tl;dr - 100y/o GIL doesn't want to move out of her home even though it's for her own safety, health, and general being, but not medically deemed unable to be by herself to make this easy to do. Grandchildren can't be there for her every day she has issues, her own children have passed away. Constantly complains about anything and everything - but refuses the answer everyone (family, friends, doctors) has been giving her. 

Sorry this is long - but to understand our grief, I figured I needed to share a bit of detail as to why we're having problems with my GIL. 

My GIL is 100 years old. Good health for her age. She amazes people every day. A point of pride for her, I think. Lives on her own in a pretty sketchy neighborhood. The hood it connects with is a known drug selling place, criminals, and dangerous people. Her hood is not as bad, but you know you're not in a ideal place when police do frequent drive thrus to monitor activity. They're not there because they want to be, and she doesn't seem to understand that. 

Her race is different from everyone else's. Literally, everyone else's. Easy target because 1) she's hella old, 2) different and 3) on her own. Usually little old, especially white, ladies have the rumor of holding onto cash in their house somewhere, or have super expensive things. How she hasn't been taken advantage of yet is beyond me. But that doesn't stop people from ruining her yard by throwing their trash in it, or running their dirt bikes through, causing ditches she can't see, or pulling down her fence. And she loves to go in her yard and literally pull weeds. She falls over all the time. One time she fell and sat in her front yard for a hour before someone stopped to help her. A million things could have happened with that. 

Her kids are both deceased (one cancer, one suicide). The spouse of the one who passed of cancer is also deceased, while the other spouse of the other child remarried - and that didn't sit well with her. Even though they killed themselves, which was selfish, what else was the spouse to do with their finances? And their own love life? Anyway - not much of a relationship there. So, ""responsibility"" has fallen to the adult grandchildren. Mainly the ones she lives nearest to and has been closest to for the past 20 years since she moved out towards us, then, which is 2 out of the immediate 6 of them, me being married to 1 that lives close by. The other grandchildren from the other child she had lives across the country. They can't help much besides phone calls. Out of sight, out of mind. She tells them she's perfectly fine, and they believe her. Well, one spouse of a grandchild on that side has been speaking with me recently, and visited one time, so they know better. 

I've been helping her with anything she may have needed - doctors appointments, grocery shopping, etc. Before the one in-law passed, (spouse died first, then the in-law), her keys were taken because her eye sight was failing. So she became dependent on the in-law. Well, they passed and it went on to me because I'm the only one available all the time as a SAHM, and, at the time, were literally down the road from her in between moving houses. Just last year the grandchildren on this side talked her into getting a driver service to help alleviate my responsibilities - because we moved 40 minutes away, and have a very young child myself. But she refuses to use them for anything else besides her hair appt. She relies on me for everything else, mostly, if she can't get her neighbor to help. And likes to spring on me at the last minute her list of things to do. Which we may or may not get to half the time because she tires easily. I can be gone literally all day with her, with my toddler. Can you see my hair falling out? I deal with the tortoise and the hare every time. She requires to hold on to me when she walks, because she refuses to use a walking cane to help her balance. So I have her on one side, while I'm hanging on for dear life of my toddler who wants to play the life-sized version of Frogger, only without stopping to look for cars.

Mind sharp, though starting to slip with recent memory issues. Walks on two legs with some balance issues if she goes too fast. No health problems besides typical old people stuff - eyes getting worse, hearing loss, blood pressure monitoring, easily winded, tired all the time. But she's not bad enough to be deemed ""unsafe"" by the medical people. Though they all have been helping us encourage her to go to an assisted/independent living facility for not only her health, but safety and ""burden"" off of us. I hate to use that word, but we all have to make sure to call her every day on our day to make sure she isn't dead, because she refuses to use her life alert button. Again, she sat in her yard, in a dangerous neighborhood, for a hour before someone decided to ask her if she needed help. 

Before we moved 40 minutes away, we tried encouraging her to go to one of the nearby living facilities. Right near the hospital and near her doctors - which is what she has said is important for her if she was to ever do this. I went and met with the people there to get info, tour it myself, and report back to my spouse and their siblings my findings to compare with other places or just decide to go with this one to present her with. Nothing ever came of it. She flat refused to listen. We encouraged her to move in with us, and she was all about it at first, but quickly got cold feet - ""my stuff, where will you sleep, my independence..."". So we had to get her the driver service, but I quickly got sucked in because of the doctor appts, which I understand. Someone needed to go with her to help answer questions or her to understand what they were saying, and keep abreast of her health. 

She falls a lot. Twice now she's hit her head so bad she had to go to the ER this last year - but was totally fine. As far as ongoing problems go. First time she fell her head split open, but was released from the hospital that day and I had to go 2x-3x a week to clean her wound and redress it because no one else would or were confident how. This went on for a few months. Her and the grim reaper have some kind of truce going on with all her extra lives like a cat. But even cats eventually run out...

Well, year and a half later since we moved, I'm about to have another baby. I'm about to be out of commission for her completely. The grandchildren have pulled out all the stops and researched different places to give her options. They even took her on tours of these places recently , one grandchild drove over 600 miles to come give their support. They left that day with high optimism because she seemed very interested. Even asked their opinion on which would they chose. They told her they'd talk it over, but ultimately want her to make the decision, because she has to want to do this, and give her the chance to do the right thing. 

A few days later and she's making a fuss again. Worried about her stuff, her neighbor getting a bad neighbor moving in later, the cost, her independence, us ""rushing her"" when we've only been talking about this for years. She's even commented that if she were us, she'd be doing the same for her mother or grandmother. We're at our wits end. This lady has been on her own since her husband passed away nearly 60 years ago. She has the money to pay for the place. Finances are not an issue. She lives in a small, very small, home - so the rooms at the facilities are nearly the same size. The place is literally a resort that they all, herself included, loved. She actually knows some people there when she toured it. But she keeps bringing up BS excuses that we've all told her we would help her with and try to reason with her that all the answers to her complaints will be simply answered by moving into one of the living facilities. Safety - check. She falls will someone help her nearly immediately - check. Food service - check. Weekly trips to grocery stores and clothes stores - check. People to talk to in person - check. Activities - check. Health aids - check. Help with minor chores around her unit - check. Hair dresser on site - check. Can she be alone if she doesn't want to go out of her room - yes, check. 

Not to mention the worry burden is completely gone from us because we have to call her each day, on our day, to make sure she isn't dead or someone ransacked her house. If she doesn't answer, which happens a lot because she moves so incredibly slow, we have to keep calling back until she does. Refuses to call any of us to check in in case we have a busy day and forget to ring her up at our scheduled times. Sometimes when we do talk to her, she'll off handedly mention she's not eaten in a few days because she has no food, when we asked her the day before if she needed anything, and she said no. Or that her tv has been broken (she hits input a lot) and she's not had tv in a few days. Or this, or that, or God knows what else. 

Seriously - anyone have any advice on what we can do, before we go the legal route and throw away all those years of respect from her? She's making this so difficult. And we're trying to respect her wishes, but she's now in a very dangerous spot once my pregnancy progresses further. I'm already over halfway done. In two months, I'll still be pregnant but, I won't be able to help her, period, anymore. My spouse definitely can't help her because I need them here with our first child. It's about to get ugly...

57,"Ok I wouldn‚Äôt be taking this to social media if I hadn't run out of options.

The last time I went to the dentist (honestly, I don‚Äôt know when, summer 2016?), the dentist told me a section of my gums had started to recede. They told me to stop brushing aggressively, so that‚Äôs what I did. But guess what? It‚Äôs only gotten worse, and only noticeably worse for about a week. I woke up one day and my gums felt a little weird. Whenever I moved (this applies to now too) my (bottom, btw) lip away from my teeth, it felt like a little chunk of gum was being pulled off and then getting reattached if I put my lip back where it was, if that makes any sense. Throughout the day, it was pretty unnoticeable. At night, my teeth (bottom front two) got extremely sensitive.  Then it just repeated itself. A couple days later-now, I can feel a dull pain in my two teeth and they might be loose but honestly I can‚Äôt tell, and what‚Äôs weird is that I only have one tooth that has gum recession but two teeth are being affected. It seems like they move, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the most painful at night, and I‚Äôve taken ibuprofen and Aleve but neither have helped.

I‚Äôm scheduled to go to the dentist next week. Should I wait it out or go earlier, since it‚Äôs been bothersome?

And...
‚Ä¢What can I do to help it before going to the dentist?
‚Ä¢Possible treatments?
‚Ä¢Could my tongue pushing against my teeth have anything to do with anything?
‚Ä¢Is it all in my head?
‚Ä¢Why is it so f-ing annoying

69,"A quick background: I am almost 30 y/o. I have been diagnosed with depression since I was 16. Medication and therapy have had its ups and downs. Currently pretty stable and happy.

A lot of times when I am about to go to bed, my mind does something weird. It's hard to explain, but my mind starts ""rushing"" thoughts and images a million a minute. Sometimes I start playing a ""movie"", or I'll start recalling all I can of my life; from my earliest memories to right now. Other times it's just stories, like the voice you hear when you read.

It's scary sometimes when I feel I can't stop it, specially when it's fucked up things I'm thinking about. However, when it's something cool I just let my mind wander. Last night it happened again, I can't recall correctly what I was thinking about, but it was a pretty cool ""movie"", I ended it and got upset I did because I was enjoying it. I just became too self-aware of what I was doing, which always leads me to belive it's something wrong and I should stop it.

Edit: Forgot to mention this has been happening all of my life. Not every night, maybe a once or twice a week.

Does anyone know what is that is happening ? Has is happened to any of you?

Thanks!

70,"Some Background:
I was thinking about adopting a dog. I found a few I liked and applied for pre-adoption. In the form they mention they will call my apartment complex to confirm that the building is Pet Friendly. So i go down to management and to let them know they will be getting a call. When I mention it to the secretary and building manager they inform that the building doesn't allow pets. The only reason I see dogs in the apartment is because they are service/support animals and are required by law to let them in the building. I thank them for the information and leave.

So since then I went online and found out I can get a psychologist ESA (emotional Support Animal) letter that makes a dog a support animal. So I took the exam and got a letter from  psychologist in a different state saying that I ""meets the definition of disability"" and ""is qualified to have an emotional support animal(s)"".

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm asking how I re-approach and what do I say my building management (the same two as before) to ask to complete the required forms for a service/companion animal without looking like like I'm totally gaming the system?",08Feb2017,2

72,"I'm in college.  For some reason I can't stay awake during history.  It's at 11AM which is a bit early for me (I have a hard time falling asleep and I'm depressed and have Lyme's disease so I'm always in a state of being really physically tired and kinda out of it but not the sleepy kind of tired), it's my first class of the day when I have it, and I have it twice a week.  But I have an art class at 9:30 on Monday and have no trouble staying awake there, and last semester I had a math class at 9 and only fell asleep once.

I don't know what it is about this class, I listen, it interests me, I take notes, but I can't stay awake for more than about 15 minutes into class, at which point I enter that state where you're so tired your body is shutting down and your head falls and you wake up a little bit only to do it again, and again and again until I can't stay awake for more than a few seconds.

I don't like energy drinks, don't like any coffee I've tried except an iced chocolate mocha thing from Starbucks (which costs like $7 so no way in hell can I afford it regularly), I've tried sleeping a bit later in the mornings, going to bed earlier, waking up earlier and having a good breakfast, all that.  Today I even went to the dentist at 8 and had class afterwards, was awake like normal all morning, and started falling asleep in class again.

I'm mainly concerned because it's extremely rude and this dude is a really good professor.  It's a small class, maybe 30 people, in an auditorium.  I think I'm going to apologize to him and start bringing my laptop + condenser mic with me to record the lectures, but that doesn't really solve the problem, because I always get through classes on memory alone, which I can only really do watching the lecture firsthand.  Plus I don't want to risk the damage to my laptop from always carrying it around.  If I brought my laptop though I could keep myself awake browsing reddit or something maybe but again, that mostly defeats the purpose.  He lets us eat in there and that could help but every type of snack food I eat is noisy and I've only got $50/week for food, and I mostly live off snacks and mozzarella sticks as a result, so eating all my snacks would be bad.

78,"Firstly, I want to address that I am a first-year student at a fairly reputable university in Canada. The transition for me was very rough this previous semester, and I was stuck doubting if I could ever make it into medical school upon completing my undergrad.

Recently, I had a chemistry exam, one in which I did not do so well, but my peers, who I went to high school with, did well. I was a pretty good student in high school, but I feel inferior to everyone, and my self-esteem has been utterly demoralized by the constant mediocrity on exams that I did in fact study for.

What hurts me the most is that I feel intellectually inferior to those that I was ""better than"" prior to university. I understand this self-pity stems from jealousy, but I do believe I should be doing better than them. I felt more prepared for the exam than the others -- they were pretty unconfident going into the exam room, and I strongly believe that I did more practice exams and studied harder than any of them. 

Before anyone says, ""University isn't about studying hard, it's about studying smart,"" I would like to address that I did study smart, not just hard.

Doing worse than my friends and others in university has totally taken a toll on my self-confidence, and I am just not sure what to do. I really want to go to medical school, but the chances are minimal here. Not only that, but I want to thrive and do better than everyone else. I did not expect it to be this much harder in university as compared to high school, and I wish that I, too, can achieve stellar grades again.

I would like for someone to give me some guidance on how to do well in university, specifically science-related courses, and how to not beat myself down upon failing to achieve goals. Also, I would appreciate some advice on how to not be so jealous of others, because that is what damages my self-confidence the most...",08Feb2017,2

So, backstory first. About a year and a half ago, the girl (TG) and I started talking a bit. She messaged me one day because she was friends with my girlfriend of the time, and we started talking a decent amount. We were both taken at the time, so there wasn't any tension or anything like that. 

Fast forward about two months, and my girlfriend and I broke up. TG was super supportive, and we increased our talking and whatnot. She was still with her partner of the time (a long distance relationship), but we got pretty close. 

Another month, and we got closer, talking about feelings and all that jazz. I had moved about forty minutes away, so I viaited for a weekend and stuff happened. She ended up regretting it (for decent reasons :3), and we stopped talking (my idea. I can be an asshole). Anywhom, she ended up moving to the long distance boyfriend's state and got engaged. 

Last time skip :3. Three days ago, she added me on Facebook. Is it okay for me to talk to her? I would really like to (she was super chill), but I'm not really sure.

So, I'm in collage and Iive with a roomate. He recently went through a personal loss and in the interviewing days I thought it was best to give him some space, let him process it at his own pace, and just generally act as normal as I could. I now see that was terrible judgement (I'm really bad at helping people with things like this) and he just wanted someone to talk with. Crappy situation, and I handled it very poorly.
The problem is that he's (rightfully) upset that I didn't do enough for him when he needed me and has stoped speaking to me all togeather. He hangs out in the common room during the day, comes in after I go to sleep, and leaves before I get up. If I try to talk to him he'I'll either ignore me or answer in 1-3 word grunts. The only time I'be talked to him he called me ""calloused"" and said I lacked empathy. He genuinely thinks I'm a selfish prick who was ignorning him when he needed help. I've tried explaining my side to him, but he won't take it. He dosen't want an appology either.

94,"Hi, I'm 19 going on 20 and have left my 4 yr institution after completing one semester because of my extreme indecisiveness. I started at the 4 yr with absolutely no direction, and went with a major I'm genuinely interested in (anthropology). After having my idealism about life stripped from me by reality, I've chosen to leave this major and institution until I have more direction in life. I do not want to earn a doctorate in order to find a job, so anthropology really isn't an option anymore. 

I've since transferred to a two year, and opted to CLEP a few of my general studies courses. However, I have found myself torn by two associates degrees. Computer Information Systems (programming) and Environmental Sciences. 

In fourth grade I started coding, only web development. I loved the thrill of figuring out something that had been stomping me for hours, and I LOVE the satisfaction of the finished product. The job outlook for programming is very positive. I like the feeling of security and ability to be remote with this job. 

Environmental Sciences became very fascinating to me in high school when I took the AP course. Conserving and choosing sustainable options is a passion of mine. The job outlook is also positive, and offers a lot of variety in work. 

My family has not offered much advice. They ask me which one I'd enjoy doing the most for the rest of my life. I have no way of predicting my wants and needs in the future. I do know that being able to work from home as a programmer would be a dream. But the type of work Environmental Scientists can do is also super appealing.

After leaving the country she text me saying that she was pregnant - due to a broken condom and faulty morning after pill. Very bad luck and completely unexpected to both of us.

Anyway, I flew back to Argentina to discuss the situation and told her I thought the most sensible option was abortion or adoption (I live in New Zealand, don't have much savings and can only speak a little Spanish. She lives with her father, doesn't speak english and is still studying). So it would be difficult for either of us to move countries and I also have the concern that starting a life with someone I barely know, just for a child, could backfire.

She wasn't happy with the idea of abortion, for moral reasons and because it's also illegal in Argentina. So in the end I told her I would support any decision she makes but I don't know how I can do that. I think she is leaning towards having the child.

So my question is, with all the cultural and geographical complications we have...what is the best course of action I can take if she decides to have the child. I want to somehow be involved with the child if she has it and not be a shitty father abandoning my child.

100," LONG POST... TLDR AT THE BOTTOM

Hey reddit, honestly you're my last resort, i don't know who else to ask for advice.

I'm a 19 year old kid from colombia, whos dad married an american citizen and was given the holy, magnificent, godly chance to live in the states...

I moved to florida with my dad when i was 13 and i got kicked out of my dads house by 14 and had to come back to Colombia, i spent 3 years wishing to go back to the states, until, a couple months before my 18th birthday my dad contacted me after 3 years of not talking, and told me that if i didn't want to lose my resident status, i had to go back before my birthday, but, i had to live on my own... So i did, i moved back to florida, 17 years old, found a very small efficiency for 650 dollars a month and moved in, i was going to college for film school and working in a movie theater...

It didn't take long for things to get depressing... Here i am, in the country that my dads family has hyped up to me my whole life, all alone, no friends, no family... I spent my 18th birthday, christmas, new years eve all alone in that small as fuck cave i was living in...
In one year i passed through 7 jobs, i failed most of my film classes, i lost my ""studio""... 6 months after that, i was living in a friends couch, unemployed, depressed, failing at school, in debt...

So, i came back to colombia for winter break, i regained some psychological stability, i prepared mentally to come back to the states and rock it, achieve my dreams, etc... I overstayed until february and missed registrations at my college but whatever.

When i went back to florida i got a job in a bar, signed up for online classes at my college, got a motorcycle, rented a room from an old lady and then after 6 months it happened again... i failed my online classes, got fired from the bar, and worst of all i ended up homeless (although some nights i stayed in a hostel), so things got very dire and in a moment of panic i sold my motorcycle and bought a ticket back to colombia.

Now, I've been in Colombia for 6 months and im extremely at peace, im happy, but if i stay longer i can lose my residency... So im stuck in this decision... I dont know if i should stay or go back to florida. I am extremely unhappy and depressed when im in the states but i feel that if i give up my green card, im giving up on my dreams, there really is no film industry in colombia, there's not that many opportunities here... Plus, i know how many people would kill for a green card, and to live in the states, so i feel guilty giving it up.

I dont know if going back and eating shit is worth it for a potential better future... So thats why i'm here... I need some advice.

TLDR: im a resident in the u.s, but my life in the states is complicated, i have no home, no job, and I'm in debt. I wish i could stay in my home country, Colombia, for the time being, but i feel that i would be giving up many opportunities and a better future in the states. since I've been overseas for 6 months, if i stay longer i could lose my papers...",08Feb2017,1

105,"There are a lot of details to this problem that I think would be relevant for context but I'm going to try and be concise because I know your time is extremely valuable to you. This is going to sound very point-formy.

For context, I'm going to a college in Western Canada.

In Winter 2015 I was severely depressed and I had to drop out of school. I dropped after the course drop deadline at my college, so I had to go through an arduous paperwork appeal process to change the ""Incompletes"" on my transcript to ""Withdrawals."" I saw counsellors, went to my doctor for anti-depressants, and I attended a mood disorders support group. It all worked out in the end and I have massively transformed myself from where I was almost two years ago.

I've been back at school for two and a half semesters working hard, but I've hit yet another roadblock. It's this Geomorphology course I decided to take this semester (it sounded like the sequel to Geology 101...). I took the prerequisite four years ago at a university, and according to my prof that prerequisite covered half of what the college's prerequisite course does. I feel lost in this course despite my love of Earth Sciences. No matter how much time I spend in the open lab with the lab technician's help I can't finish the labs because I do not feel confident in my answers.

I'm six weeks into the semester and at this point if I drop the course now (or before March 19th) I will get a ""Withdrawal"" on my transcript which I don't mind, but I will lose a few hundred dollars of tuition... and my parents pay my tuition. This situation is causing me a great deal of stress because if I drop the course I feel like I will disappoint my family and at the same time I will lose time that I could have spent on a course I probably would have excelled in compared to this course.

The thing is that I struggled with another advanced Earth Science course back when I hit my critical level of depression. I'm worried that if I drop this course, it will cast doubt on that one semester I had to drop out. They might be similar situations, but they are poles apart in terms of my mental health (I am so much better than I was back then).

I could try and catch up in the course by using an upcoming week-long break to study, but I'd rather spend the break recuperating from sleep deprivation. In the last three weeks, this dilemma has also fractured my exercise regime that I've cultivated over the last two years.

Do I drop the course, lose time, lose money, and disappoint my family OR should I stick it out and not give up even though I'm struggling with the course material?

If more information is needed about my problem, please let me know.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and/or comments with advice.

106,"Now I know that people grow apart and people don't always stay friends, but I've lost 3 good friends in the past 3 years and now I'm really starting to think it is me. So I want to see what you all think.
So the first good friend I lost was about 3 years ago. We had our first argument in our entire friendship when she told personal details about my sex life to her new boyfriend of a week. He brought it up to me when I met him the first time. It was awkward as hell and I just stopped talking. Luckily we were almost home. I didn't talk to her for a few days because I just didn't know how to handle it and I didn't want to get overly upset with her. I didn't ignore her, we just didn't talk. Then she texts me angry that I made her boyfriend feel awkward and that I really had no reason to be upset with her, but she is sorry I felt upset. So we had a long text conversation and I really avoided being rude or blowing up because I really try not to do those things. Other people read the messages and thought I was being honest without being harsh or bitchy. Mainly I said I was upset she betrayed my trust with her new boyfriend and I don't know why my sex life was brought up anyway. She went on to tell me how I wasn't a good friend and to stop acting perfect. I just said I know I'm far from perfect but I was just trying to discuss how this particular situation made me feel. Anyway. We ended up ending things well, but we both moved away so things never were the same. The first year we talked, but then she failed at what she was doing and had to move home. I am still away from home. She never contacted me once after that.
Second friend was a guy best friend of mine. This is a longgg story but here are the highlights. Basically we never fought for three years of friendship, but anytime he got a girlfriend he would ditch me only to be my friend when they were having a rough patch. We lived a far distance once I moved so for two years our friendship was over text. Well he broke up with his longest relationship about a year ago then he's getting all close to me. Telling me he loves me (which was new) and that he's going to visit. Then once it came the time for him to visit he backed out. So I would get my hopes up to be crushed. So I finally said something about how he treats me. That he's not a real friend to me. I didn't handle this situation well because I was overly emotional about it (no yelling or harsh language but still). Then, I would say I would be over it then down deep wasn't so it showed when I talked to him. So I see where I went wrong there, but the initial telling him how I felt about our friendship I feel was warranted. I ended up ending that friendship once I found out he was dating a new girl and I didn't want to wait to be dropped again and go through the whole cycle again. Last one, my friend of about two years that I made when I moved down here. We are really different people but we always had fun together. Again, no fighting ever. Then on my birthday this year she ditched me while I was on my way to meet her to go out and celebrate. She had talked to me 10 minutes prior knowing I was on my way dressed then, called back to say she didn't want to go. So I got upset. I waited to calm down because I didn't want to overreact. But, then I said ""really... it's my birthday"" and it started into this whole thing, then she turned around and was like come back we can still go out. I said it was too late at that point I was home again and in pjs. I was pissed but I never yelled or said any bad language. Other than saying it was crappy she backed out especially since it was planned for weeks... Yet, she claimed I was overreacting... We haven't been the same since. I don't think we will be. She's also gone hard into drugs in the past month and that's just not my lifestyle. I messaged her today and she flipped out on me and I just kept saying I was just trying to say hey and a joke. I wasn't trying to get into this whole thing or even a conversation but somehow I was the one not being calm? she kept saying calm down. I just kept saying I was trying to just say a joke I never expected you to get upset. I really just thought you would laugh at it and that would pretty much be the convo. Then she was like oh I didn't realize you were just joking with me. So then I stopped responding. I feel that the first time I stand up for myself in a friendship always means the end of it. I really try to handle it maturely, but maybe it is my fault. Advice? Sorry it's a long post!",08Feb2017,1

116,"So 3 times now I've hooked up with this beautiful girl in my ex's sorority (first time, we were drunk). The ex and I dated 6 years. We all go to the same small college. She knows she is backstabbing her ""sister"" but loves hooking up, and so do I. If anyone finds out (besides my best friends), then the girl's reputation (extremely popular girl on campus) will be completely destroyed and everyone in greek row will think she's a backstabbing slut for hooking up with me (since my ex and I just broke up 2 months ago). So it's a very risky situation sometimes scares her.

So I guess my question is how should I act with her in public situations so that I am able to still pull off secretely hooking up with her without giving away any red flags to people? If our friends see that we are very talkative/borderline flirty in public then it may draw some bad attention and scare her away. But at the same time I don't want to not talk to her that much and seem like I don't like her as a person. 

And my other question would be, how can I pull off being smooth and hooking up with her more often. I can't stop thinking about her and see her all the time yet can't do anything about it in public. I've been trying to do subtle stuff like becoming closer with her best friends who she hangs out with most. Another example is that when she bartends at the local bar I'll secretly give her a very big tip that she sees on the receipt at the end of the night. 
Basically, I just want more of her :( And I can't have her, it's just so dangerous. Any opinions on how to be the most smooth in this situation, answering my questions or not, would be appreciated. 

(background info, we barely ever text , no snapchat, my roommates are not really friends with her roommates, her friends have her on ""find my friends"" and can see if she was to be at my house, and let me reiterate, she is easily one of the most popular, well known girls in greek court). 

And NO , I will not simply stop hooking up with her, she is the best that I will probably ever get and this is our last year here.",08Feb2017,1

119,"My sister and fianc√© have been planning to get married in Florida for a while. I live in the UK, and the costs for the marriage on my part will be in the region of ¬£1000-¬£1500 (flights, accommodation, visa, food etc.) for a week, plus use of my limited vacation time from work. Both her and her fianc√© are from the UK - neither are American.

I have no desire to go to Florida, as I have been several times before on family holidays (no offence to any Floridians - it's a lovely state but I have other travel desires!)

Several other friends and family members who were invited have dropped out, and received backlash as a result. My mum has also expressed dismay when I hinted about my concerns around financing it.

Financially, I am in a position where I can probably afford it - however, it's still a lot of money to me and I have many other financial priorities - not least getting married myself, changing careers, and getting on the property ladder. I feel like this is putting my life on hold.

I am worried that if I say I cannot afford it, she will criticise me for any financial expenditure in the following months/year and in the run up to the wedding, especially if, heaven forbid, it's on something that isn't deemed a necessity (e.g. a holiday of my own). She has criticised someone who is not going because they decided to take spend the money on celebrating their daughter's 21st birthday by travelling abroad.

My dad has hinted at paying for me to go. However, I feel I cannot take his money on a matter of principle, especially as he already paying a lot towards the wedding and his own attendance (plus my mum's). He has only just got back on his feet after some financial difficulties.

I am fearful of the rift not going may cause in my family. My sister has always been somewhat difficult and I don't think she has the same respect for my feelings as I do hers. For example, I live approximately 200 miles from her and have done for 4 years - however, she has only visited twice in that time claiming it is 'too expensive'. I visit her multiple times per year.

Her family's income is significantly higher and cost of living is lower than mine, although she does have a child.

She has been mentioning her desire to get married in Florida for 3-4 years now, with serious plans coming into motion about the last 12 months. I accept that I am at fault for not bringing up my concerns before now, but it felt very distant and therefore didn't resonate with me. I didn't have quite the same financial issues then either. As mentioned, a number of others have dropped out in this time - I can only guess that it began to hit home for them too.

With the wedding approaching, I'm now losing sleep over this issue and concerned about it everyday. I am struggling to reply to messages from my sister about wedding plans and hen-do plans, because the whole issue is one of stress for me. She is asking a lot of me already - I am a seamstress and she asked me to make all the bridesmaid dresses and a waistcoat for the groom, at a significant investment of my own time.

So, should I go to the wedding or not? Should I take my dad's money? If not, how should I tackle the issue of saying I'm not going with minimum damage to the family?

TLDR; sister is getting married abroad with expectations of attendance despite significant sacrifices required. Should I go or not? Should I accept family support to do so? And if not how do I go about saying I'm not?",08Feb2017,1

122,"Hello Reddit,

 I recently moved into a dorm building for the spring semester.Being the new kid I naturally set out. To make friends to socialize with as it makes the whole process of living in a dorm much more enjoyable. I've got along well with all the new people and started to feel comfortable around them. Until recently all was going well. Then the other day  my roommate  his FwB(also someone I considered a friend until this event) and I   were hanging out in the room. The FwB  decided to ask/demand she was going to stay in our room the night.  I made the joke I didn't want to listen to sex all night. And therefore she wouldn't be staying in the room. She immediately replied that she would be able to do it without me noticing. To which I replied I was sure she wouldn't . Then made it very clear to both her and my roommate that I would find this incredibly disrespectful to have sex  with me no more then 5 feet away. She mocking replied disrespectful huh and then it got silent. The next thing I hear a few minutes later is her saying. Ow and no but sorta in a Rhythm. A familiar rhythm  that sound. Like moaning.  I called her on it immediately. And the reply I got was ""sometimes I just wanna get dick. It happens ."" All was silent again for a while until I'm now hearing sheets moving.  At that point all common sense went. Out the window and instead. Doing something to them I left my own room and waited until  she had to leave for work. I went back in the room angry ready for whatever happens but my roommate slept or pretended to sleep for  no less then 6 hours well she was gone. Once she returned. He got up left the room and didn't come back until I had gone to sleep.  He asked me the following day if everything was alright to which I replied no then he said that he would never do something like that to me . But I'm nearly positive that was a lie due to way the girl has acted the things she said( she been making sly comments about it since it happened). Couple that with fact me and my roommate constantly talk and do things together and since that incident I haven't said anything to him and he has only said a few words in last few days.  I feel it doesn't take a genius to figure out they had sex in front of me in defiance of my request.  Then he tried to lie to cover it up .  My question to everyone  is what should I do from this point forward. I have no more trust in my roommate and all respect has been lost . I can't relax at all around him now I even washed my sheets and pillows for fear they had used them as well when I left the room.  He hasn't said a word about it even though when I moved in he said his #1 thing was talking about problems with each other  and every minute I'm stuck here I can feel the anger growing. The worst part. Is that I'm sad that he made me hate him this much  that I've been forced into this position because I did truly  enjoy him as a roommate before this incident.

125,"Backround: Last summer i met the girl of my dreams, we started serious relationship and goal was her to move in to Finland with me and start a life together.

So day before december gf's parents got a call from anonymous PI are saying Im being investigated in USA, they contacted a close friend / relative who works for the FBI and he confirmed(screen read) telling that yes im being investigated. 

These alledged crimes happened in Finland and i was told there are 3 victims, all roofied or something like that and all of them went back to their homecountry and reported it. This make no sense to me... One the girls was alledgedly from Germany, cause i live in EU i can ask the police to show me am i being investigated. I got official papers after waiting a month but she doesnt believe me...
So far ive spoken to Embassy, local pd, Usa pd, fbi... Nothing seems to help.
And i asked why im not being charged then, she said the victims family and victim should stay 30 days in Finland to be able to file charges? Thats load of bollocks. Like if i commited a crime in Eu, id be sitting in jail so fast it would make my head spin. 

How can i prove Im not being investigated? I live in Finland and handling this from a distance makes it so hard. Serious help and advice needed.

I have been lately attracted to this girl and there is absolutely no scope of ever getting us together. (It's personal but I am darn sure that we are never getting together). The point is we used to talk quite often and lately I am getting obsessed with this girl. So obsessed that I am always checking her Facebook account and always texting her on WhatsApp to check whats new in her life. Not in a creepy way (okay ! maybe a bit creepy)

7. I can't focus. Ever. Even when I'm wasting time on the internet, I can't focus on one tab.
8. I get angry very easily.
9. I used to self harm- not because I was sad, not for attention: I liked it. The feeling of having a secret, the blood afterwards, the sharp pains.

For the past 5 or so years, she has complained about being fat. She's in her 50s and has gone through menopause already, though she looks pregnant. She has looked this way, increasingly more 'pregnant', for the past 5ish years. The rest of her body is thin, definitely not anywhere near overweight. I don't think it's fat, as she has gone on diets and worked on her exercise regimen over this time &amp; she still looks pregnant.

I think it's a cyst or a tumor at this point. I want to say this to her, as she could have whatever it is removed. Plus, I worry it could be a malignant mass. She has a strong history of cysts, one of which made her third pregnancy dangerous.

She's been to a GP about this, and the doctor just told her she's overweight. I've read some stories that started this same way and ended up with a large tumor or cyst being removed. My mom hasn't had an ultrasound for this, and there's not really a way to tell if it's fat or a tumor or a cyst just by looking at the patient.

How can I bring this possibility up gently? I don't like bringing attention to her body shape, as it really depresses her and upsets her. I'm also worried that she'd get tests done and it would end up just being body fat that is placed in a strange way that somehow doesn't go away.",08Feb2017,13

I moved to a different state for a clean slate, and after I got residency and a job, I started community college. I completed college algebra one point off of a B grade.

There is also a Horticulture for production and landscaping, but I feel that going for these would be too much compromise. I know that the science major has a good amount more of chemistry and higher maths like trig. I want to know if this aspiration is realistic considering my not having a very math intensive highschool bout. I know I have discipline and determination but is that enough? Does University foster an environment that makes it possible to learn these things from a reasonable start, or are you expected to have taken ap honors courses in highschool?

157,I want to get my belly button pierced. I have other piercings that already healed and I was very good about keeping them clean and never had an infection. But I live with my boyfriend who had this hole form on his lower stomach that slowly got bigger and bigger. We discovered it was flesh eating bacteria at the doctor. They said it was contagious but hard to spread cuz you would literally have to put an open wound on the area to get it. It's no longer a flesh eating bacteria but he still has to take antibiotics to help it heal. Since he's overweight and can't see it very well I have been cleaning it for him and bandaging it up everyday. But if I get my belly button pierced I'll be caring for that too with the same hands... Of course I would wash them before cleaning mine plus it's not technically flesh eating bacteria anymore but I'm still a little concerned,08Feb2017,3
164,"Hi, all. I've never really posted before so forgive me if I'm doing something wrong.

To start, my mother has ptsd related to a sexual assault. She does well usually, but now that winter has come it's gotten worse. I'm her source of comfort, but I feel so useless even though I've dealt with this my whole life. I *need* to be there for her- she's the most important person in my life and I have OCD related anxiety, as well as my own depression that's rearing its head now at the worst time.

I'm scared. She promised me she would never kill herself but she wants to die. I'm scared that she's only holding on for me and I can't imagine losing her.

I can't confront her about this. I can't make her feel any worse because she doesn't deserve it. I'm her outlet when she doesn't have therapy but I can't be there all the time, I'm 16 and at school and when I get home I'm just so exhausted I just want to sleep.

Maybe I just needed to vent, but any advice would help.

Thanks.",08Feb2017,6
165,"Hey, r/advice. This question might be asked too much, and I apologize for asking it, but I need advice on how to approach this girl. I go to a community college, and probably like a lot of other community colleges or colleges in general, it's just come and go, and very rarely do people ever approach each other unless it's in a club or somewhere outside of campus like how I met one of my good friends at a movie theater. There's a girl who I'm kind of interested in meeting who's in two of my classes, and she's very pretty and seems very sweet, but I don't know how to approach her considering it's not easy in college since, like I said, it's a very come and go environment. How did you approach someone in college you were slightly interested in getting to know and how did it turn out? Would really love some advice!

Update: She dropped out of my second class, so, now I only see her twice a week. Rip.

166,"Hey all.

im not sure why im making this post. maybe i just need to hear  some other peoples thoughts on my current situation.


let me get right to it. 
Im unhappy. 


Im a 25 year old male, i work in the manufacturing industry as a CNC programmer where i work between 50-60 hours a week. i go to college part time where i am working on an engineering degree. 
I'm also currently training for a 15k race in march.

my daily routine looks something like this. 


wake up, go to work.

leave work, go to school.

leave school, go to the gym.

leave the gym, go home and run.

shower, do homework.

maybe some video games before bed. (i feel this is the only time i get to blow off steam. I know my fiance hates it when i zone out before bed)

repeat.

i always work at least 1 if not both days on the weekend.


i wake at 4:45am and after my daily routine its typically sometime between 8:30-9:30pm


im starting to wonder if i'm doing something wrong. i know i live a good life. i own my own house, car, and i have a wonderful fiance who i have been with for the last 5.5 years. despite this i find myself having pity parties and feeling down more and more frequently. on top of this i havent had sex with my fiance for 3 weeks now. she says its because i dont put in any effort, i strongly disagree with this. my life is centered around trying to provide a good life for us. 


 i try quite hard not to whine and bitch but i think im starting to crack a little bit. im unsure of what to do. 


do i just need to man the fuck up and deal with life? or am i missing something. am i being unreasonable? i think im starting to freak out and i don't know how to deal with the stress. i have typically always dealt with adversity well but im starting to question myself. i feel as though my professional, and personal life are starting to suffer.

I guess i should also include that this stress has led me to start a habit with marijuana. I live in a state where recreational marijuana is legal. I feel that it helps me unwind at the end of the day. I know i should stop but i feel its one of the few things that makes it all okay...",08Feb2017,8
167,"When I was younger I was heavily involved in church and youth groups, it was a happy time for me. When I turned 15 I met someone who convinced me god wasn't real, Christians are stupid for believing there's a God yada yada yada. I went along with it. Called myself an atheist. Got into drugs, started dating the same sex, became a totally different person, dropped out of college, and walked out on the job I had loved for 5 years. Last summer I got really depressed. I'm talking the lowest I've been in my life. I isolated myself from EVERYONE I knew, didn't talk to anyone. Just went to work, went home and sulked in my sadness. Around 3am for about a week someone or something would knock on my door three times. Being the little white girl I am I was afraid to answer the door and I live alone so that just wasn't happening. Shortly after I got a dog. One night Scooby (my pup) woke me up and ran to the front door and just stared at it. Very unusual. Then the knocking started, Scooby growled and barked like I've never heard before (he's the sweetest dog on the planet) and the knocking never happened again. Fast forward a few months, I met this Christian guy (who I later learned claims to be a warrior of God, has prophetic dreams ect) online that I was supposed to meet at a local restaurant for a date. 30 minutes before I was supposed to meet him these horrible thoughts flooded my mind. Kill yourself kill yourself you're worthless you don't deserve a date you don't deserve anything.. And more along that line. I almost killed myself. I read online you can kill yourself by taking a whole pack of antidepressants, my ex left a whole bottle of hers at my place and I started taking them. Then Scooby came up to me and started whining, tried to comfort me and I stopped. I started dating this ""warrior of God"". He later told me that possession isn't like Hollywood makes it seem, it's very overplayed like your bed doesn't fly across the room, your body doesn't twist in weird ways ect. He said sometimes he feels the bed at night lightly shake. When us and the dogs aren't even moving. We've moved several times, and traveled to Colorado and California together and he says everywhere we go he feels it. In Colorado we became roomies for a very short time with this woman who claimed she was a prophet of God. And God had sent us to her. Something was very off about this woman. Her voice would change pitches in the middle of a sentence, she knew things about me that a stranger would not know, she could pull out my deepest darkest fears. But she also knew my bf was a warrior of God before we even had the chance to talk with her about that stuff. Scooby would wake up around 3am and growl at absolutely nothing, that I could see anyway. He didn't like that woman. I was always getting onto him for growling and barking at the person he lived with. He normally doesn't do that, like I said he's a sweetheart. This woman also told us her mother was a witch. I would find some weird voodoo looking pins in all of our stuff. I went into my room one day and she had (claimed she didn't) stuck a pin in our bed, if I wouldn't have seen it it would've stabbed me as I got into bed. Later on the woman got locked up in a psych ward and we went back home. Fast forward a few months and my bf and I start talking about God and church and how maybe we should start going to church again. For the weeks leading up to going to church, and still to this day it's so hard for me to eat. The sight of food makes me sick to my stomach. Even my favorite foods started to taste disgusting, it became hard to swallow food and eventually led me to losing 20 pounds. I am a small person with a good figure, I've never had body image issues. so it wasn't like I was trying to starve myself on purpose, I have a fast metabolism and used to be really active so I could almost eat whatever I want and still be healthy/ look good. Like I said, weight was never an issue so it's not an eating disorder. Eventually he takes me to church for the first time in years. It was uncomfortable. I got hot flashes and chills the entire time. As the preacher was doing his preacher thing I started to get bored and lose focus on what he was saying. I wished in my head he would talk about something different or something would happen. The preacher stops and says ""God is telling me to stop what I'm doing and to save people, if you need to be saved please come forward"". So I did. People prayed over me, spoke in tongues. Someone came up to me and told me Satan was pissed that I'm at church and will try to make my life harder. Shortly after church my boyfriend and I got in this huge fight. Like we've never fought before. I became violent. I am not a violent person. Ive never hit anyone, let alone wanted to hit anyone in my life but I hit him. I felt like something came over me. He also knows how to get under my skin and infuriate me like no other. He told me I was evil.  Later that night as we tried to work things out I came to this realization that maybe people who commit suicide are actually possessed and the demons get their soul after they kill themselves. I said ""maybe they almost won"" but my boyfriend heard ""we almost won"". I don't know if I'm possessed, my bf thinks that I am. I don't think I'm schizophrenic... I read that people who have schizophrenia aren't capable of thinking wether or not they have schiz. Idk. Am I possessed?",08Feb2017,1
169,"So a few years ago I worked as a camp counselor at a two week long summer camp where kids could built robots out of legos and shit with to other guys. One of them was around my age and the other was two years younger, let's call him Bobby. The guy my age was cool, but Bobby was a little off. We were never really sure what it was about Bobby that made us feel that way, but we tried not to judge him for it and went on with the camp. On the last day of the camp Bobby asked me and the other guy if he could get our phone numbers. I think the other guy gave him a fake number, I probably should have too. Anyway, that was the last time I ever talked to Bobby IN PERSON. I say that in all caps because for the last four years I've been getting random phone calls from him! Sometimes he calls me twice in one week and sometimes I go months without hearing from him. He loves to give me updates about his life and to see if I've heard from the other counselor from camp. He's always calling me to give me updates on his life and his plans on how he's gonna make his first million. Also almost everything Bobby tells me sounds either completely fake or the wild fantasies of a child.

He's told me on numerous occasions that I'm one of his best friends, but again I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN FOUR YEARS!!! I used to consider it like a good deed of the day when he'd call to give me updates on his rap album and stuff. I'd just sit there and let him talk for thirty minutes or so just explaining all the details about his upcoming album. I was nice to be there to encourage Bobby whenever I could because it sounded like nobody else did. But now he calls me about how he has a job where he's allowed as many payed days off as he needs when he's sick and his girlfriend who may or may not exist! Recently I've tried to find out if he's actually telling the truth or not, but I'd either get some semi-understandable explanations from him or just other dead ends.

176,"So let me explain my situation right now.  I dropped out of college because I couldn't handle the actual deal with one of my classes.  As a result, I had meltdown and I dropped all of my classes.  Now I'm literally at the bottom of society's ""unsuccessful people"" being unemployed and a college dropout.  I feel like it would be that way and it would just be sitting above homeless and unemployed.  So here's where I'm at now.  I got to focus on practicing driving with my father, get my license, work with some supports I have in place to find a job and apply to jobs.

This is just a bit of a background with what's happening now here is the actual part of the subject.  So after a long weekend of dealing with this...I guess torment in a way.  I had a talk with my father last night about finding out what my passion is...what I enjoy...here's the problem...I have no clue.  I've been your typical guy who does video games and spends time alone all throughout my years of elementary to high school.  I was one of those people who spent so much time wasting their life that they never gave any invaluable insight into themselves and to what they desired for.  Don't get me wrong I've done some things that were okay...but they were things I didn't have a true passion for.  I really don't know what to do now...I've been trying to think of something I could love to do...but I can't think of a single thing.  I don't understand myself at all and my so called ""passions"" if I even have them.

177,"Everywhere throughout my entire city, there are birds. Well, obviously. But not like here, where it's like we live in a fuckin rainforest.  
Right now there's one that I can hear while inside my house, that's perched atop a tree, that's inside my neighbor's backyard, that's across the street, all heard over my loud computer fans and the TV.  
Because they are that fucking loud.  

&amp;nbsp;  
So let's establish some things.  
1. I'm in an urban city.  
2. I don't have misophonia or anything like that. They're just fucking loud. Really, REALLY, excessively loud. Like lawnmowers. They just *are* really really fucking loud. That is just how things are.  
3. It's not worse now than other seasons; it hasn't let up, and will likely only get worse as we enter Spring.  
4. The birds are **everywhere** throughout the city. If there's a tree, there are birds, sitting there, needing to be fucking strangled to death (I would absolutely do that, too). But it's just especially a problem when I'm home, because your home is your sanctuary.  
5. Being absolutely forced to run 6 fans all the time that I'm home is pure idiocy *and doesn't actually solve the problem*, nor does it change how things are if you go outside (which we must do).  
6. It's essentially like having tinnitus, ranging from mild to severe, **all the time**, especially if you're outside (complete hell in the morning, but still really bad no matter the time of day).  
7. I don't normally mind birds at all, but when they chirp absurdly loud and in such a way that you cannot adapt or tune them out, it becomes a problem.  
8. This is not a personal issue; lots of people are going crazy over this.  
9. Not only can I not acquire one (or even borrow one, as I have no friends), but this problem is so widespread that one person running around with a gun just isn't gonna make any impact.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm thinking about calling the city to see if they'll do anything (likely a waste of time). If I can at least prove how obnoxious they are to many people, maybe they'll do something.

178,"A new family moved into my apartment building around the start of November. I noticed the dad is loud. It quickly turned into him yelling curse words every day. I just thought he was an angry man with a bad mouth.

Things have gotten progressively worse, and I'm actually afraid for his family's safety. They have young children. After a few weeks, he started angrily yelling swears and horrible things at his wife. Okay, so he's an asshole and he seems verbally abusive. That turned into him yelling at her until she cried. This happened multiple times. It started out once or twice a week and now it's once or twice a day. Still I was thinking he's just an asshole and she should tell him to gtfo. Not my business. She's an adult.

Things took a dark turn yesterday though. Last night at 10pm I heard running (loud), a small child crying, the man yelling and swearing, and things being slammed into the wall and stuff being violently knocked over. I could be wrong, but it sounded like he chased someone and then slammed them against furniture and the wall while yelling ""f*** you"" over and over and a kid was crying.

So what do I do? Is this obviously abuse? I'm so conflicted because I don't want to get into their business or put myself in danger, but I honestly suspect he hit his wife while their kid watched. I really don't want to be reporting things if I'm wrong. I don't want the cops telling him who called if I call, and I strongly believe I should call when this happens. I'm also deeply afraid that reporting it will only make this worse for his family if the cops come and the wife says there's nothing going on. I can't imagine she'd admit what's happening because I think they'd take the kids away. I'd like to stay out of it entirely, but I'm afraid for the kids.",08Feb2017,4

Examples:
1.  Know-it-all/arrogant.  Does not listen to anyone else opinion's or advice (relationship &amp; financial), even when the failure to heed advice results in financial and emotional pain.  This arrogance has resulted in the loss of at least one of our mutual friends, who I thought was really nice/part of our group.
2.  Flakiness.  Dumps all of her other friends (including my wife) at a moment's notice to spend time with her new bf.  ""Fair Weather Friend.""  Cancels at the last minute or departs early when her bf wants to do something else. Says she's joining us for drinks, then says, ""I don't feel like drinking tonight.""  Why text us then?
3.  Dates losers and is always contacting my wife about her troubles.  Jumps into relationships very quickly, ready for cohabitation/marriage within weeks of meeting the guy.  I just find this extremely strange.  My wife does not seem to mind, but it just annoys me, leave us the hell alone with your immature problems.
I am at the age where I don't want to associate with losers or people I just do not like.  My wife thinks I am overreacting, perhaps I am, but I cannot hide my feelings.  I loathe this woman, she represents every negative female trait and I want her to go away forever.

190,"I apologize in advance for how long this is going to be.

So I moved into my apartment in November with two other girls. It's a newly renovated historic building in a downtown area. The rent was decent and building is beautiful. I got a weird vibe from the landlord when we first moved in but thought maybe he was just a weird guy, he seemed nice enough. When we signed the lease all three of us had to have a guarantor because we are all in college.

When we moved in construction was going on outside of the house but we were told it would only last a week. This was the first issue we had. The construction lasted two more months. They started at 7am everyday, including the weekends. Not only this but they would park in our tiny parking lot and take up our parking spots. When asked to move they would curse at us. When this was brought up to the landlord he would tell us to get over it and park on the street, even though we pay for those spots and if we were to park on the street we would get a ticket. When we finally asked the landlord why the construction was taking so long he said he always claimed it would take this long, even though we all heard him say a week and so did our parents.

The next thing is we originally told him two of us were going to stay next year since it's a good deal, close to everything and even though we graduate this semester we wanted to stay in the college part of town for one more year. Originally he said we had first dibs, he would not list it and he would draw up a new lease after we found a new third person. Not even two weeks after this he emailed us saying he was showing the apartment three times in a week and we had to vacate the premises while this was going on. Confused we asked him how people knew about the property and instead of telling us the truth he just responded with the same email he already sent. After Googling the house we found out he had listed the property without telling us and had increased the rent by $800 next year. Within the next three weeks he showed the house over fifteen times and three of those times he did not tell us he was showing them beforehand even though in our state he legally has to give us 48hrs notice before entering the property. Then without telling us he signed someone to the new lease for next year, even though after all this there is no way we are staying.

Lastly one of the roommates is moving out this month. Apparently she has not paid her portion of the rent even though it was due the 1st. Both me and my other roommate have not heard from her in days and have no idea if she will even come back. Today I ran into my landlord and trying to be civil I asked him if he had heard anything from her about moving out. He said yes but since she has not found a subleaser she still owes him her portion of the rent (which I agree with). Then he went on to inform me if she does not pay her rent he is going to sue me and my roommate for the money she owes if he does not receive it. I asked why he did not just call the guarantor on her part of the lease and he said it was just a casualty and he did not have to do that. After going over the lease while it does say all parties are responsible for their part of the rent, it does say if one party does not pay their part the guarantor will be contacted. I sent him this part of the lease and he said it was not legally binding and if we don't pay he will evict us. I do not have the money nor do I intend to pay her part of the rent. 

To summarize, my landlord has caused distress from construction work he did not inform us would be happening, has entered our property illegally without giving us the 48hr notice the law demands, he is threatening to sue two of us for rent we do not owe and will not contact the third parties guarantor even though in the lease it says that is what he has to do if she refuses to pay.

198,"My mom and stepdad are nice people, but for lack of a better word, they aren't the brightest people and have a terrible history of mismanaging their money. I know this isn't an indication of their intelligence level, but as an FYI, they both dropped out of high school. As a result, I've grown up to be quite the opposite in terms of how I manage my money, being traumatized by things like driving with my mom as a kid to see the landlord because we were paying rent late yet again, being evicted from another house bc my mom hasn't paid the mortgage in months, my step dad filed for bankruptcy before my mom married him (and she was unaware he did this til after they were married), seeing my mom and step dad buy plenty of ""wants"" (not needs) but not saving for a home or retirement (they have the latest and greatest iPhone, tv, cable, my mom buys designer clothes and bags yet makes $14/hour and no benefits), coming home from shopping with mom just to see her hide the bags from my step dad [at the time] because she knew he would disapprove (this guy was financially responsible but they divorced)... yet my mom and stepdad live paycheck to paycheck.

They rent a 3 bedroom home when it's only the 2 of them living there. Their landlord recently decided to sell the home and asked them if they wanted to buy so they wouldn't have to move. They want to do this. Not only is it a terrible time (imo) to buy, it's that they're too old, hardly have any money saved for retirement or emergencies, and I don't think they could afford this. Since my stepdad's a vet, he thinks he can get some sort of veteran's assistance and can buy the house with 0 down. Idk how accurate this is, but regardless, if you can't afford to put 20% down or you can afford to contribute any money to closing costs, I'd say you probably can't afford the house.

So my mom texts me that they're looking to buy the house. I think carefully about how to respond since we've had arguments before on her personal financially situation, so I just tell her it's a seller's market, prices are inflated, and to let me know if she needs help with anything because I have experience in both renting and buying homes. She just says ok thanks. 

I'm my mom's closest living relative, so if they eventually run out of money or can't pay their mortgage, I'm the only person nearby that they can stay with. The thing is: I would hate to live with my parents ever again. There was just too much dysfunction growing up with them (especially with my mom) to even mention here. I am not at all interested in living with them and actually wish that I could move away from them to be further away.

I'm tempted to ask my mom if they could afford this, if they're willing to pay a mortgage loan until they're 75 or 90 years old, to see if they've planned for how they will pay the mortgage if one of them dies (stepdad provides main support for them both but wants to retire soon even though I think they can't afford for him to retire). But my mom hasn't asked for my advice and my mom doesn't like ""being told"" what to do. But this impacts me. I feel like it's just a matter of time before they ask to live with me, or ask for money. And while I don't mind helping family, I would feel resentful for helping someone or lending money to people who have been financially irresponsible. It's one thing to help someone who's been saving, lives within their means, but had unforeseen medical bills, but a totally different thing to have to help someone because they mismanage their money, don't save and buy new cars, cell phones (and other stuff), and now potentially a home they couldn't afford. Please help!

Tl;dr what should I say or do for my parents (or for myself) who are financially irresponsible and are looking to buy a home in their 60s when they can't afford it.",08Feb2017,16
200,"Hey all,

So long story short, I have an interview for a staff engineer position tomorrow. I already passed the phone interview stage and am coming for an in person interview. During the phone interview I spoke with two of the five people who will be interviewing me about a school project in which I made roasted crickets to demonstrate the benefits of eating insects. They seemed to really enjoy the story, and so I am considering bringing in some roasted crickets to give them at the end of the interview to sort of sweeten the deal. Is this a good idea or highly inappropriate? I know bringing a gift in general is a bad idea, but I think this is a unique case.

201,"Ever since I was a kid my mom always nagged me about my persistent laziness and procrastination. When it came to household chores, I always felt the urge to do the bare minimum so I could get back to something that interests me (usually video games, playing outside). Now I have a relationship and a job, and both are being affected by my consistent lack of thoroughness, corner-cutting, and just generally holding things to low standard.

The struggle is that the corner cutting feels almost automatic now. Yesterday, my girlfriend asked me for some medicine. Both of us being in bed already, neither of us wanted to get up. I eventually got up and gave her the medicine. When she asked if it was expired, without having checked, and almost without thinking, I said no. However it was expired. Luckily there were no issues with the expired medication, but I find my behavior to be unacceptable, regardless of how tired I was and wanting to go back to bed.

At work (software engineer), I find myself somewhat consistently now fixing mistakes that could have been prevented had I done a correct and thorough job in the first place, and chosen to test everything thoroughly and diligently.

I've called around to other doctors, but they're either booked up or they won't see me unless I want to completely switch to them. I do have insurance.

209,"I'm 29/M living in the UK and I am pretty tired of being in bottom rung jobs.

I've been constantly employed in various industries since I was made homeless by my parents at 16, this in turn has led to me racking up around 5k in debt which I have no financial means of repaying right now.

Basically because of all this I never got a chance to do any form of education after gcse's and I am regretting it.

I have been looking at a course to train to be a paramedic which requires 4 A levels to access which I'm pretty sure I could pass fairly easily but here is the issue.

I phoned them yesterday and was told by the receptionist that l urgently need to attend an appointment with them this afternoon, to which l asked why, because l have not needed to attend the GP for months and am not waiting on test results as l have been fit and well. The receptionist said she was not sure why l needed to attend, so l refused to go until someone could tell me what it was for.

Today l got another phonecall from the receptionist, she told me it was very important l attend the appointment they have made for me. Again, l asked what it was for as l have not been attending the GP for any treatments or tests in well over 6 months. She then told me that obstetrics needs to see me because of my missed period for the last 4 months and the GP has done an urgent referral for me to see the midwife. I explained to her that this was not the case, l am not pregnant and l have not attended the GP with anything like this in my life, my last complaint to the doctor had been an eyelid infection 6 months previously. She apologized and said that there must have been a mix up with notes and she will look into it.

Now l am concerned that they have documented this in my notes, saying l had a missed period for 4 months and had to be referred to obstetrics, especially since l have not had any children/pregnancies in my life. Obviously my information had been documented on a referral form to the obstetrics team but will this be in my medical notes?

Anyways, I have two electives with the same teacher (3rd and 6th period), both of which take place in a computer lab, AP computer science and Programming in basic. In my assigned computer I decided to download a couple of games, I always turn my work in on time and usually have time left over in class. 

Yesterday the computer was acting up and told my teacher  in 3rd period about how the computer wasn't working properly. Apparently, my teacher got the school's technician to check out why the computer wasn't working, among his inspection managed to come across 80gb worth of game stuff all tied to my account.

Needless to say, my teacher informed me of what the consequences were which was a call to my parents informing them of the situation, wiping all my downloaded files, as well as notifying the district. He told me there was a chance my privileges of using the school's computer might be revoked for the rest of the year, that's okay because I have access to a computer at home. 

What really worries me though, is the fact the he mentioned I was fortunate I was under 18 because of downloading games from youtube videos etc, considered piracy. These games aren't new and include games like far cry 2, killing floor 1, and minecraft since the computers are fairly weak, I do understand, however, that's no excuse for downloading the games.

Basically, we're working with 3D software and had to model an object, and render it so we can present it cleanly at the end. The problem is, we weren't taught in class how to do these renders (this is our first time even touching this), and instead our teacher directed us to online tutorials to fill that knowledge gap. The tutorials were very well done and informative, but they missed something, which ended up giving me a ton of trouble. In the end, I panicked a bit and didn't do that final part, thinking I would ask the teacher about the problems I was having the next day (the day of the hand in). After I confronted them about it, they said if I didn't have that part done, it's an automatic 0 for the entire thing, despite the issues I was having. I perfectly understand the reasoning, it's like in real life where if you don't meet a deadline it can fuck you up big time, and that I shouldn't have finished the night before, but I still can't help but feel wronged, since I sincerely did put in some hard work into this project, which I was proud of.

222,"I don't know what I enjoy, so I just do things to pass time and with me currently being in school, living in a grey and boring rural town and not really having a gigantic amout of financial support or free time I don't feel like I can find out anytime soon.
For reference: I'm a 17 y/o highschooler from germany and I basically spent every week day going to school coming home, doing school work, playing some video games and hitting the gym a few days a week. On weekends I usually spent my time dicking around with friends irl or online.
The issue I have is that I dislike the way I live my life nowadays.
I spend time doing the same boring shit, around the same close minded people, playing dumbass games on my pc and forcing myself to regurgitate the stuff my teachers tell me and so on. I don't want to sound overly dramatic but this is just not what I want to be doing, especially not in the better years of my life.
It goes on from here, I have no idea what I want to do later on in life because working a 9 to 5, spending my evenings passing the time till I fall alseep just to go to work again and grabbing a bear in some local bar with the guys from work is basically what I am doing right now. The issue is I have no idea how to escape this, I thought of leaving my home country to live in a more exciting place, and I still like that idea, the only issue is that leaving germany doesnt save me from the 9 to 5 hell, living a pointless life. I guess what I am looking for is freedom and independence but I don't really know how to archieve those because I dont want to be some fucking hobo either. That and the fact that I definitely have to live my life the way I am living it right now for at least 1.5 more years are things that really frustrate me. Right now I do my best to stay healthy and learn as many things that I am somewhat interested in but I feel that I don't really have the energy to really get into something outside of school right now because of my mild videogame addiction and busy school schedule.
Oh and the fact that I can't really talk about this type of stuff to people I know is also somewhat frustarting because these things go beyond highschool gossip and bitching about homework(&lt;-at least somewhat) and I feel that nobody really cares enough to actually listen. People just listen so that they are not alone themselves and so that they can spew their uninteresting surface level bullshit right afterwards, the times I actually tried to get into more serious conversation with people they didnt really follow or were not really interested in the topic (more serious conversation does not mean exactly what I said on here, I am talking about exchanging views, beliefs, wishes, goals and concerns that go somewhat beyond the next month or beyond finals)
The way I wrote this felt super edgy and melodramatic, but I couldnt express it any other way right now (I actually tried to a few times) so please give me a pass on that one. ^^
My actual question for advice would be how do I ease the distress I'm feeling currently and what could I do to escape this type of life in the future?

225,"This is a very long post. I‚Äôm a 29 year old musician/slacker living in eastern WA who doesn't know what he's doing and needs advice from sources outside my family on where to go next. Either back home to Los Angeles, or to Portland, OR.

So, a bit of long winded history‚Ä¶ I moved here almost a decade ago from Los Angeles after a psychological episode landed me in a psych ward for a brief stay and had I dropped out of college after less than a year. Never getting a degree of any sort has left me feeling inadequate, and I also feel a societal pressure to do so, which I hate. I have always had problems with self doubt, self confidence, and depression. I was heavily medicated for a lot of my adolescence and early 20‚Äôs, but am happy to say that I have been medication free for almost 5 years and my mental health seems to be on the upswing. I‚Äôm mostly financially independent now except for needing to borrow money for some disastrous emergency situations through the years. Mostly from my father. Both my parents have been supportive of me in pursuing my dreams, possibly to the point of detriment. In that regard I feel I've been somewhat sheltered by my parents from hardship and its caused a lack of development and self sustainability. I‚Äôve been involved in music for quite awhile now and living where I do now has been affordable and enabled me to pursue creative endeavors, do short little weekend warrior tours with bands, and not be financially wrecked. Its been fun and i‚Äôm thankful for the experience. 

But I really haven‚Äôt achieved any sort of success with it. I don't have a large ego and I‚Äôm not living in denial that I'm some talented genius. I would say i‚Äôm a bit more driven then my bandmates and other musician friends. I know ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù as a musician is near impossible and isn‚Äôt something one should rely on; and I probably shouldn‚Äôt have been doing that in the first place. Though it is my dream still, I have an internal battle on whether or not to give up. I don't feel ready to do that yet. I especially feel the pressure since I'm kind of old now. I would be happy doing anything involving it, whether it be working in a studio or trying to do session work or maybe even just teaching it. But pursuing this for as many years as I have has left me with very little in the way of practical skills or prospects. Unfortunately most of my interest lies in the humanities, and theres not a lot of stability there. Which brings me to moving. 

I‚Äôm burned out on the city I live in. The affordability of it is nice, but it also makes me feel like I'm settling and not trying hard enough. I get a sense of shame when I tell people where I live and what I‚Äôm doing. And I‚Äôve grown tired of most my friends here. A lot of them are still into drugs and drinking and partying every night, and I guess I got all that out of my system finally. I worry about my lack of skills when I think about moving to either place. They are both exponentially more expensive then where I live now and I know its going to be hard and my quality of life wouldn't be the same. I have a nil amount of credit debt, and a small amount of savings.

 As far as what each place could offer:

Moving back to Los Angeles would have me living with my father at least for the short term, who I have a good relationship with right now at a distance, but have had a lot of trouble with in the past. I‚Äôm scared that our relationship might become strained again if I was living with him. And I would be losing my independence that I've had for the past 10 years. He‚Äôs offered me a room to live rent free and just work for a little while to save money for more financial cushion and figure out whether I want to stay in LA and pursue things there or move elsewhere. I worry he might enable me to slack around more.  At the same time I would be back in what feels like home and could get at least an AA degree pretty affordably at a community college which might make me feel somewhat adequate. And there might be more jobs or opportunities aligned with my interests there. However I‚Äôm also wrestling with the idea that me moving back there is just chasing nostalgia and that I might not find what i‚Äôm looking for.

In Portland I have a lot of family as well and its familiar since I‚Äôve been visiting there since I was a kid. Its a less familiar landscape than LA but I suppose more affordable in the long term. I suppose I could stay with one of them right away, but I wouldn't want to use them as a support system or be a burden. After all I'm trying to grow up and be self sustainable here, right? I suppose I could also go back to school there too, but it would be a bit more financial strain. 

I just know I need to get out of here, but i‚Äôm unsure of the end game in either place. I guess there were several questions poised here, actually.",08Feb2017,1

Oke, now my problem. It's about a girl from my school (always girls haha, no offence) We have been in the same class for 3 years and now for the first year in a different class. That doesnt matter because we see each other enough during the breaks, and before and after school.

For like a year, I've liked this girl very much. We did things together like going to a movie etc. However, I've heard and felt different signals from her, if she liked me or not. One day, I was more than happy, cause I thought she liked me. The other day exactly the opposite. After a month, It did take over my whole day, because I was thinking of all little clues about that (I know, it sounds really dumb) . It took my self-confidence down and I just told myself she doesnt like me and tried to quit our contact, just to get my life back on the rails

3 months later, when the summer break nearly finished. She sent me a weird text, just to start a conversation and do something together. I doubted about it, and said yes. And yeah, you guessed it right, the same path happened again. And as result, my confidence about her decreased again.  I did just want to say my feelings about her, but didnt know how. So I tried quit contact with her again. 

And yesterday, she came again with, in my eyes, an excuse to just start to have a conversation (whatsapp), and do something with each other . Maybe she just want to be friends, or maybe she wants more, however I want to give it one more chance. But I'm not sure and can use tips. I'm just really confused and just want clearness.

229,"I'm a college student starting into the realm of private tutoring. I found an ad on campus seeking a tutor. I emailed him and everything, and all that seemed to be fine. Today he set up an interview with me and his wife for tomorrow. The things about him and his ""wife"" is that they have completely different last names, and his LinkdIn had a bunch of posts under the work experience section, but they were all the same. All variations of ""college board"", ""college board engineer"", ""college board 2"", etc. His name checks out that he is a software engineer working for College Board, but idk man. It sounds fishy... I mean I checked out his wife's LinkdIn and it has a picture, so if she looks like her picture, then I become less suspicious. He wants me to tutor his 2 adopted Columbian children at his house, what should I do to avoid any danger on my part while still making him feel comfortable (in case I am just being paranoid and he just doesn't use technology all that much)?",08Feb2017,1
230,"I've found myself in a crappy situation that I hope none of you have to face. Several months ago my wife and son decided they wanted to get another dog. I accepted this and they decided on a rescue dog. More of classical pit bull mutt type dog, the dog is 50ish lbs and just over a year old. Upon acquiring the dog, everything is great, but sadly things start getting worse. 

The dog is destructive. We appeased her with a boat load of toys in attempts to alleviate her energy, but it only held off for so long. She chewed through a center 4x4 post on my back door, all over a shed in the back yard, and would destroy any item not securely nailed down. Dogs being dogs, its annoying, but we dealt with it. 

She then moved onto digging up my entire yard. Winter and rain didnt help, but the yard has seen better days. We planned to seed before spring, so we dealt with it for now.

The dog then started escaping. We have a fenced yard, but she was able to push her way under the fence. We reinforced the bottom, making it not as pliable. She then took to digging under the fence. Giant 12-18 inch deep holes big enough for a person to get through. We added some additional fencing, remained vigilant about watching her and limiting her time outside to needed time. In short we dealt with it. She some how continued to escape so we doubled our efforts.

Sadly as I was out tending to the fence, my neighbor came up and inquired about what I was doing. My neighbor had his son (maybe 2 years old) with him and when the dog noticed it went crazy. It started snarling and aggressively barking at the 2 year old. My neighbor politely backed away, said goodbye and took his son back inside. 

I've never seen this dog act in this way and I'm beside myself in what to do. My son loves the dog. We've had her for several months and in that time he's grown attached as kids are want to do. I however can't reconcile my son's happiness with the potential liability with a dog who has figured out how to break confines of my yard, as well as showing aggression towards other people. My initial thoughts are to take her back to the rescue I got her from, explaining how the dog hasn't worked out, and provide them with the details. In fact I have called and spoken with them already. I can't help but hating myself for hurting my son by getting rid of his dog, but i also couldnt live with myself if I irresponsibly kept a pet that hurt or mauled a person. I've also been told that any type of incident in this way would have repercussions beyond legal issues, but ongoing home owners insurance and further liability issues as a result.

I know its a strange question, and I think I know what I have to do, but I'm looking for any/all advice on the matter.  

P.S: This isnt our only pet or only dog, just one particular animal we are having issues with.",08Feb2017,1
231,"Can't believe I'm typing this. I'm such an idiot. 
I am currently in a relationship of over four years, but a couple of months ago I fell in love with someone else, and it's not going away.. Yep, that's it. I feel like such a baby and the advice should be obvious, if the relationship is not going anywhere you should just brake up, but for me it's not that simple. Being with someone for that long really makes you care about the other person, and I just can't do it. I cannot break up, I've even tried to before but it didn't really go anywhere. I don't know maybe it's just last minute cold feet or something, I really don't know. What's even worse is that she has a history of (minor) mental problems and even suicidal tendencies, and is currently seeing a psychologist so yeah there's that. I'm scared of what will happen. I wouldn't mind being alone again, but I cannot hurt her, even if I know that on the long run, it'll probably for the best. 
I know, looking at the other people that need advice, my problem is so petty, but it's really screwing with me, cannot sleep/concentrate etc. So maybe just typing this would help, although advice is always welcome :) ",08Feb2017,0

236,"Hi r/Advice. Basically I work for a fast food chain, i had been working there for nearly two weeks when my manager asked if I could transfer to another store for a two week period. 
I agreed because:
1. I need the money
2. It wasn't that much further of a drive
3. I wasn't on the schedule for my store yet so thought I may get no other hours if I didn't take these.
I feel as if I was slightly forced into taking these shifts being told I was taking the place of someone whom was being bullied in the store I've been transferred to. 

So I had my first shift there Wednesday... it was awful, the people could not have cared less about me and made no effort to get to know me, the manager didn't care and give me jobs to do. So essentially on the front counter for nearly 8 hours. 
The manager and other staff member sat in the office for hours at a time and eventually invited me to do so, I agreed simply because I thought we would socialise, but we just sat and watched YouTube videos. 
Some may say this is good as I'm being payed for nothing, but I am actually passionate about working no matter what the job and I don't want to sit and do nothing for hours. 

Now onto the actual part I need advice on, I am absolutely dreading working tomorrow, the thought of knowing I will have a 9 hour shift stood around doing nothing is making me incredibly upset. It is not a nice environment to be in. I'm just looking for advice on how to message my manager about this, to see if I can possibly return to my own store.

TLDR: transferred stores, new store is awful and really dreading working tomorrow. need advice on what to message my manager, to see if I can transfer back to my own store. ",08Feb2017,1
237,"Hi, i've been very stressed this past week for a few reason. We left our dad a few years ago due to him being abusive and a drug addict. We finally started a new life away from him, our main ways of income are my mom's paychecks (which arent even enough to pay for rent alone), and my brother's paychecks. Together they pay all the bills and rent. But recently my brother has been stressed with his work and quit his job, so now we're left on the remaining amount of money he has, and my mom's checks. He said he doesnt wanna work for the next 2 months, and doesnt care about our situation since he's moving out anyway. He's an honest piece of shit to be putting our mom under this stress, so i've decided i'll be getting a job on my own to help my mom. I have no idea of how to go about doing this myself. I'm very stressed and need some advice as to what i should do. FYI, i'm currently 15 y/o in highschool, so i cant get a job just anywhere.

240,"I am student in my final year of uni living with 4 others. We are all 22F. One of my housemates is basically refusing to pay her share of the monthly TV/internet bill that is under my name. We all have different bills under our names and agreed between us to split said bills equally and I have thought of just taking off what I will owe her at the end of the year but as a student I need the money to be paid back pretty regularly into my account. She knows this. Is there a way of kicking her off the wifi (therefore forcing her to pay up) without it kicking off my 2 other housemates as well? They have both paid up and so I don't want it to affect them. If I change the wifi password and give it to them I am pretty sure one of them will give it to the girl who hasn't paid. She now owes me for three months and my bank account wasn't in a good way to begin with! I have sent her several messages with varying tones (but all civil) asking her to please pay the money that she owes me. I asked her this morning to pay by the end of today but that is looking increasingly unlikely. 

A bit of background on the situation- this girl I am pretty sure (and I am about to gain a qualification in this field) has a narcissistic personality disorder. Fits the symptoms to a T. She is extremely manipulative and will lie and twist things to fit her goals. She terrorised one of the girls she lived with previously so much that the girl had to move out (I didn't know this before moving in as I had never met her and we were not in the same circles). She took against me from the beginning as I am a very easygoing but also 'take no shit' kind of person and it was clear that I wasn't going to entertain her controlling antics. Since then she has tried to make my life miserable (eg: trying to get the other housemates on 'her side', spreading lies about me to her friendship group who often come to the house, moving my things around, going into my room when I am out, etc. Pretty much the intimidation game). Members of her friendship group that I had not previously met warned me about how she can be and told me to try not to take it personally. This is just so you can get a picture of this girl. In short, she is a pretty nasty piece of work and unfortunately I am locked into a contract with her until June. 

TL:DR- I (22F) pay for internet/TV in our houseshare and my very difficult housemate (also 22F) is refusing to pay the portion that she owes me. She now owes me for 3 months. How can I cut her internet off but not affect my other housemates?

243,"I have always been one of those children who listened and highly valued their parents advice on what course of action I should take in life. As a child they highly encouraged me to become a doctor and here I am today, having had 3 medicine interviews (UK) I discussed with them about changing my university course choice. I've always known medicine wasn't for me as I am not much of a people person- sure I can communicate and work in a team but beyond that I'm not much of a comforting type of person. What led me to being ignorant to my own prosperity is that I am the middle child of my family and my older brother is very passionate about medicine however he was held back by his grades- a problem I didn't have. Consequently, I led myself into the trap of trying to do what he didn't manage in order to fulfill their wishes. My parents come from a very poor background so value extremely, the job security and salary of a doctor. 
So, now it's up to me to get myself to succeed. Computer science is competitive and hard to get a job in (as I've read online). Is it worth trying to do this, I am also interested in chemistry and physics so chemical engineering is also of interest. What advice do you have for me? Shall I try computer science? Shall I look into other courses? Is the job prospects, salary that unattractive in fields beyond medicine?

TLDR; did what parents wanted but not what I wanted. My choice is hard and competitive and perhaps less rewarding- what do I do?",08Feb2017,2

247,"As a young kid I was semi-autistic in several different ways and was diagnosed with ADD. I never did homework, I never paid attention to class and i'd do way more fucksups than I should have. When my teens came, i started to realize how absolutely awfully I had been using my life, and decided to try and do something about it. From then, i've been constantly working hard to improve up until today. Though the problem is, I still feel like a worthless piece of shit.
I have anger management problems, I quite literally use thrice the time on homework as my classmates for only a portion of their result, I have a way-to-normal tendency to suddenly forget everything that I was doing (like when talking about something I just spontaneusly stop and have to try and desperately recall what I was talking about), I need signifigantly more explanations from the teachers than everyone else and I haven't become good at anything whatsoever.

The only things i've been remotely close to being good at were all before my teens. I was a dumb little shit, but I was sometimes able to out-do others in certain areas. Right now the best I can do is score a few B's in math class, but considering how much I like math (and you'll generally be better at the things you like a lot), such a thing is far from an achievement.

I'm currently enrolled in a college related to my trade, which I love, but I'm really not feeling this school (I have depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem and my main prof does not create a learning environment in which I can thrive, nor does the school in my opinion.) This will have been my third attempt at a post-secondary education.

After discussing it with my therapist, they encouraged me to attempt to approach my parents with the idea of taking a year off to work (I currently am employed in my industry and work for a company with promotion potential) and deciding, after the year if I want to go back to school.

I understand that in this day and age I need some sort of university/college diploma, however I'm still in my 20s and I want to be able to enjoy myself, and I enjoy actually working in the industry right now more than being in school.

I failed 2 exams in my first semester, maths and accounting.

I was first thinking of dropping out and moving to England (from Ireland) and partaking in a higher apprenticeship in the area of IT/IS. But I'm not too sure of that...

A new possible option has arose. I was at a talk from a Proprietary trading firm in the Uni.
Afterwards I went up to talk to the speaker, I was asking what do they look for in potential candidates. He explained what they asked for. He assumed I was in my final year, I explained I was in my first year.
He was taken aback by this.. long story short he suggested I apply for their summer apprenticeship and then look into applying to them in September, for a full time position.

That would mean dropping out and moving to across country, for a 12,000 a year, for a trainee position as a trader.

I've been told by many people (both in, and out of the industry) that I'm very talented and have a bright future in film ahead of me. Seems pretty okay, right? 

Well, I have many issues, the biggest being depression, severe anxiety, and ADD. It seems like with every passing day I dislike life more and more. I've never wanted to die more in my life than I do now. I don't think I'll ever commit suicide though, I've always been really against that option. In the past month I've had more panic attacks than I have in the past several years. 

I feel like none of my closest friends really truly care about me. I mean, I always send good morning messages to them, asking how they're feeling, making sure they're okay. I help them through their problems, I always comfort them when they're down... But unless I post some ""edgy"" / ""depressed"" message on snapchat, or straight up go to one of them, none of my friends ever ask if I'm okay. They do comfort me if I do one of those, but that's really the only time they help me out... When I essentially throw myself at them. 

I make films all the time with my friends (both personal, and school projects), but always hate the outcome. Regardless of how good other people say it is.

Everybody praises me for my editing, and even my teacher is pushing me to apply for editing jobs because of how good I am... but I don't like editing. I'm good at it, sure. But I've been doing it for about 6 years. I would much rather be writing, or operating the camera. 

I'm pathetic. I can't find love. I'm 18, and have only had one real girlfriend... and that wasn't even real. It was 5th grade, the most we ever did was hug once, and talk. 

I'm worried that after high school, I won't really have an opportunity to meet somebody / find love because I don't plan on going to college. 

I've spent the past three months trying my hardest to get a girl to like me. Although we're close, It's seems very clear (to me at least) that she has absolutely no interest in me.

After high school, my best friend is moving in with my family, and we're going to start making films as often as we can... But I don't even like my home. I've really been reconsidering my decision not to go to college.
