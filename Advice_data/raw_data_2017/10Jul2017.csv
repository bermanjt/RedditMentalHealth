""Legacy Hardware Detected: The graphics card detected does not have 512MB of video memory. Crusader Kings II requires at least 512MB of video memory to work properly.""

I right clicked screen resolution, then I clicked ""Advanced Settings"" to view my specs. 

The results, as you can see, just make the error message make no sense at all, as it says I have 768 MB of dedicated video memory.

2,"Hi r/Advice!

I'm an 18 year old who has just completed college and am greatly struggling to narrow myself down to a single discipline, or two, to study at university.

I don't have any particular passions, I never have had, but am instead interested in a broad range of subjects from politics, architecture, teaching and marketing to graphic design, journalism, policing and a seemingly never ending list of areas. 

I am confident within myself and my abilities to the extent, perhaps in naivety or arrogance, that I believe I can succeed in any career or course I choose.

I have sought the advice of my college's careers service, who couldn't help me beyond suggesting following one of my current courses through, and the advice of peers around me but have yet to find an answer.

I have tackled it from different perspectives - the life style I wish to live and what careers would enable this, what careers have the most job security and global appeal and growth etc but none of this has helped.

I struggle to envision myself in a single position, studying a single course or, in all honesty, living a single life and am hoping that there's someone out there who has felt the same and has passed my current hurdles.

TD:LR -
18yo with no passions or singular interests struggling to decide upon a course and subsequent career as I want to do almost everything.

Note - I'm British and as a result of student loans course cost is not a concern.

4,"I'm a 24 y.o guy with a 1 y.o son. So much I want to say here but will keep it short as possible. 
Last weekend I took my son to my moms house to visit her like I did most weekends before that. When I had my back turned and she assumed I wasn't looking, she yanked my son up off the floor by his wrist which left marks and bruising on him and then grabbed him under his chin hard enough to leave nail indentations and shoved him face down into a cushion while muttering under her breath that he's a ""little bastard"" because he wasn't sitting still. (He's ill with teething at mo and unsettled). 
My wife has swore to me that she's heard my mom call him names under her breath a few times before but was never completely sure and thought maybe not. But now I'm sure of it. 
It sounds pathetic but I feel like my world has come crashing down and this idea of my mom has completely shattered in a single moment. It's a week on from this and I'm not sleeping or eating because I'm shocked and still in disbelief from what happened. Or has happened when she's been alone with him. (He's often come back to us with marks on him etc) long before this event which now has my mind reeling and put me and my wife in mass concern. How long has she been hitting and name calling him? How far has the abuse gone? Sexual even possibly???!!!

What do I do? Do I contact the police? Call the cops on my own mother? This has torn my family apart.",10Jul2017,1

I honestly have no clue what she thinks of me, but I on the other hand have...well, *possible* feelings for her? A downright crush, maybe. I'm civil and I know how to act and be professional but maybe my smile when I'm around her gives it away. Today when we were on lunch-break in a park, she was taking selfies and angled it at me so *I* was there too; I'm a shy person so I didn't know how to take it. Is this even the right sub?",10Jul2017,1
9,"Hey all, long time creeper of this sub, first time poster. This is going to be a long rant/cry for help and I apologize in advance. So pleas bear with me. 

So here's my situation. 35 yr old with a wife and 2 young kids (4 month and a 3 yr old) I am an assistant manager of a grocery store and I make pretty decent money. More than enough to provide for my family and I. I've been with the company for over 10 years. But I've only been management for just under 2. 

I've come to the realization that I hate it. I hate managing people, it's mostly younger kids who don't give 2 shits about the job and are just looking for a paycheck. I work 6 days a week,  work 10 hour days and only get paid for 8 (company reasoning behind that they say is because it's all built into my salary) plus my travel time is an hour each way, sometimes longer because of traffic. By the time I get home I'm wiped from work and just wanna chill, but my kids wanna play, and I sometimes I just don't have the energy and I feel so bad about it. On my only day off I usually have so much to do, but I only ever end up getting half of it done because again, it's my only day off and I just want to relax. I'm sick of working all weekend long and always missing out on family functions or the like because of work. Keep in mind that because it's retail I am required to work weekends. And it sucks. 

My wife and I rarely get alone time and again I feel so bad for it but I have to give her credit because she understands and supports me. My boss is an asshole, constantly talks down to me, never gives me any sorta credit for working my ass off. Keeps all the bonus money for himself at the end of the year, even though it's mostly me who gets our store to achieve the yearly goals. And the lost goes on. So I started looking for a new job and I could have one Potentially lined up. But I'm so scared to take the plunge and even go to the interview. 

About 2 years ago before I got promoted, I stepped down from my old position and went with another company. Turned out they made it out to be the best job in the world and it was all smoke and mirrors and was crap. I got back in with the company I'm with now and they promoted me. And this is why  I'm scared to look again. What if this job doesn't turn out, there's no going back to my company. And if that happens in screwed and I just screwed my family as well. They are my priority but at the same time shouldn't my happiness be as well? 

This new company is offering less money, but a company car, cell phone and iPad, 8 hour days and weekends off. Seems like a cool gig but again if I leave and don't like it, there's no going back. I'm losing sleep over this, I'm obsessing over what to do, I can't focus. Has anyone ever been in this situation and can offer some help. 

TL, DR
Sick of my current job but scared to leave/look for a new one.

21,"I have worked with my current employer for a couple of years. They are a rather large company with hundreds of locations, so there is both an in-store and a corporate hierarchy. 

Late last year, I transferred to a better department from a low level department. I have been there a little over seven months now. There is a problematic coworker, Coworker A, who has worked for the company for three decades. There was one other coworker, Coworker B, who was there for over a year at that point. 

At first, things were okay. I enjoyed the job more than my last one and was being paid a little more. It is rather easy and occasionally I get to work with my hands and repair stuff. Most of the time I am doing a repetitive task to pass time between equipment failures. I noticed right away that I worked at a faster pace than the other two and that I didn't cut corners while they did daily. I have been recognized all over the building for my work ethic and my efficiency. I know I am there to work and I don't mind that I am not recognized officially. I am used to that work environment, but recently I have started hating work a lot more. 

Coworker A quickly realized that I knew more than her about the equipment due to my education and left me be on that. However, she stopped training me on other aspects of the job. I don't fully know how to do my job as a result and have been circumventing her to learn it on my own. As soon as I took over more task, others noticed improvements in their departments immediately. 

Three months ago, Coworker B left for harder job, for the same amount of pay. They had warned him a couple week beforehand about his performance, he hadn't met the requirement in two weeks at that point. He was still working, but usually was forced to work on equipment more due to weather. I was outperforming him, but he was far from a bad employee. He just liked to socialize around the building too much. I didn't think anything else of it at the time.

I had to pick up all of his work once he left and things became rough for me until we could find a suitable replacement. During that time, I started noticing some serious manipulation from Coworker A. She didn't do anything to help pick up the slack at all and she started acting like she was in charge of me. She is not, in anyway. Same job title, just paid differently due to time with the company. We brought in another coworker, Coworker C, who has been with the company for almost twenty years to replace the one who left. She has helped a lot to relieve the work load I was facing, but Coworker A has taken the opportunity to throw even more work onto Coworker C. She has straight up lied to her and manipulated her. I am not comfortable working in that environment. So recently I spoke to Coworker C about my concerns. She was more concerned than I was. She almost left the department due to Coworker A's general hostility towards me within the first week. I have been struggling to convince Coworker C to hold in there. 

I've finally had enough. I have spent my breaks going through and looking at the records for the last six months for our two main responsibilities. 

1) Our repetitive task is heavily documented, which means I can get accurate numbers for it. This is the percentage that each of us has done of the total.

Coworker A: 11.2%
Me: 49.2% 
Coworker B: 20.5%
Coworker C: 19.1%

2) She has not repaired anything in months. She goes around saying her back hurts too much and then leaves them for me to repair. Three people can back up specific incidents of this occurring. Which, if true, she can go on medical leave instead of getting paid more than me to do 11.2 percent of one task. One day, I came in to three different equipment failures and she was in the office on the computer doing nothing. It was particularly noticeable due to the fact it occurred at the end of a window that I could get parts ordered before the holiday. It resulted in 5% of our machines being down for four days.

I plan to go to my boss for an open door meeting on Wednesday. I just don't know how I should explain them to my boss to get things changed. The only issue is that the local hierarchy may not want to put too much pressure on her. Meaning, they won't write her up when she doesn't meet the requirement. Which they are supposed to according to their own training documents. They warned Coworker B about his performance during a period that Coworker A had only done 13% compared to his 37%. I think that indicates that they are protecting her more than I can see. My boss is friendly with me and has gone out of her way to make sure I have an easier day. 

How should i phrase my concerns and what all should I bring up?

42,So I was involved in a hit and run collision this morning. I was stopped at a stop sign at an intersection and a Honda came around the corner too fast and too wide and smashed right into the left front of my car. As I was getting out they sped off and left me stranded. My left front wheel is bent and my steering arm is bent so I couldn't steer my vehicle. I managed to drive it back down the street to my aunts house house with the wheels pointing in opposite directions and the tires squeeling and park the car until a tow truck arrived. I called the police and they told me they wouldn't send an officer out for something like this and to make a police report online. I drove around the corner with my dad in his car and we found the vehicle that hit me. When he hit me his left front turn signal lens broke off and I picked it up. It matched exactly to the Honda we found around the corner. I wrote down the license plate number and took a lot of photos. I called the police a second time and told them I found the car who hit me and they still said they wouldnt send an officer out and to make a report at the station or online. I made a report online but when I did so it said that hit and run reports made online will not be investigated. When I got my car home I called my insurance company and made a claim. I only have basic liability and no uninsured motorist coverage so I don't think they can really do anything. They took all my information I had and told me I would receive a call back within two business days. I guess I'm going to be waiting on them to call me back but I almost feel cheated that my tax dollars are going to waste when the cops say they won't do anything. What kind of bs is that.

54,"Hello Friends.  I'm in a bind, or rather, a culmination of many binds from over the years.  
	- Where do I go from here? 
	- What would you do?
	- How do you battle your internal antagonist? 

I'm in my early thirties now.  When I was in High School, I was a capable student taking exclusively Advanced Placement courses, but didn't take my studies as seriously as I should have in retrospect.  I did alright with minimal effort invested, and was able to get into a University program fairly easily, based largely on standardized test scores and extracurricular activities.  As many have in that time of their life, I found myself utterly distracted by friends.

My initial year at University went well.  I roomed with my older brother, a Senior at the time, and found the motivation I'd been missing to try and establish a real life.  I did very well in all of my courses, notwithstanding a newfound problem with a creeping attention deficit issue.  I hugely missed my friends back home though; I'd gone to University where none of my friends had elected to attend, most staying at home, or going to other schools/programs in other places.

As my Freshman year came to an end, my brother joined the military rather abruptly, and had shipped out within the month.  I began to find myself isolated, away from family and friends, and depression (which I'd always dealt with, at somewhat of a remove) became much more pronounced.   My second year proved to be more precarious:  I found myself registering for higher level courses unnecessarily, barely attending classes and finishing lengthy papers in 48-hour psychosis-like episodes, barely getting them in on time.  I NEVER studied, and that is not an exaggeration.  Somehow I squeaked by and was able to pass my courses, albeit with a growing sense of isolation and deeper sense of depression.  Simultaneously, I took on a second night job to help pay for my non-Scholarship living expenses. 

My third year brought the inevitable.  With deep depression, a total lack of motivation and new friends encouraging with their own unhelpful habits, I entered the drain I'd so willingly been circling.  My first Semester, I registered for courses with no intention of completing them.  I did not attend a single  session, sign my name to a single examination, or attempt to do anything constructive.  I was swiftly academically dismissed from my undergraduate program after failing all of my courses that Semester, with essentially no recourse given for reinstatement/future redress (I certainly don't blame the State University system for my own issues, although in my experience they've been less than willing to go out on a limb for students, regardless of causality).

I tried two more schools, but was so disheartened at my initial failure that I left both in shame.  While making my final attempt, I met my future wife through a friend.  She was warm, breathtakingly beautiful, and like no one I'd ever even conceived could exist.  Relinquishing the last school, I immediately moved back home, my greatest fear having always been doing so under the auspices of having failed.  I started a counseling thread, during which I was diagnosed with major depression, and inattentive type-ADHD; I was told my right frontal lobe had never fully developed.

Very shortly after returning home, my wife and I began dating.  Things moved quickly, and within six months she'd moved two hours over, and we found a place together.  I was ecstatic - I'd thought my life was over, but she'd given me new life.  She truly cared for me so intensely and deeply from the start, and I for her.  I immediately took a full-time job once back home, and started to try and work my way up from the bottom in my new position once we'd moved in together.  She'd been battling Ovarian Cancer for six years at our introduction, and had recently started undergoing chemotherapy again; she was all of twenty-four, and the strongest person I'd ever known.

Over the next ten years, we shared a life that simply falls short of written expression.  During these years, we bought a house, went through too many Oncological appointments to count, several major surgeries, fared her Father's own bout with cancer, and shared everything.  I continued to work to try and support us, with her sometimes working and sometimes sick, the idea being I never wanted her to have to work.  She was able to go to school during some of her better health; she'd wanted me to take a turn and go back - she had known how much my past failure affected me - but I wanted her to accomplish the things she wanted to do.  She always saw a goodness and value in me, of which I was never convinced.

I was able to work my way up from the bottom of three different companies over this time.  I worked my way to low-level manager at the first (overseeing pharmaceutical repacking, narcotics and doing IV admixture), during which I began working as a self-taught de facto IT/app support person.  The second, I was able to follow that trend again from the bottom up, and at the third I'd worked over five years to become an analyst, as well as doing some low-level programming.  I'm still at this company.  My entire motivation of these years was to ensure that we had a stable future amongst all of the uncertainty, although even with this greater purpose I continued to struggle with my past failures and the paradox belying our love and circumstance.

I would never take back anything in my life earlier that brought her and I together, and it's certain that without those events we would have never crossed so fatefully.  She has left, May marked one year since she suddenly and unexpectedly passed, and I miss her every moment.  I'm now faced with compounding depression.  I'm still struggling with the depression that has been a motif throughout my adult life, as well the attention deficit issues and the cumulative affect both have on my working memory and self worth.  From a completely separate realm now, I feel completely lost without her.  Although I always knew the score, her passing was completely confounding, even for many of her doctors.  It's not my intention to liken the difficulty of losing her to my own trivial issues from before, but only to recognize that now these are all factors, albeit of completely different scope, acting on my current existence. 

I've relocated, moved West, closer to family and sold our house.  But I find myself hanging on; Trying to be alright, trying to 'work' through everything, and at the same time still feeling like a failure ('past is prologue') due to my past.  I have some opportunity now to try something new, to try and change, but I am so completely apathetic.  I fear that will never change, and in many ways I don't fear that at all (to be frankly honest, I don't want to succeed or even concern myself with my own well being in a world without her).  

I'd once thought that rationally,  I had potential of some sort.  Then I came apart at completely internal ruminations that I'd had none, or that previously it was falsely perceived at best...  A phantom limb.  Now I cannot abide any kind of willingness to seek potential, or success, or even persistence in living at a decent measure of traditional success.

What would you do?

58,"So let me start off by saying that I'm schizophrenic, and haven't been able to much in the way of work. I saw computer programming as a way to actually be a useful member of society. No coworkers, I make my own hours, and low stress. So there's nothing stopping my dysfunctional brain from getting in the way.

I had the big idea of an app that reminds you to take your medication. I was going to call it ""Med Minder"". It turns out that there are hundreds of apps that do this, and one that was already called ""Med Minder"". LOL

Then I had the idea of a bill splitting app for roommates. This has also been done a gazillion times.

I was told to ""build a better mousetrap"". That sounds good, but some of these guys have been making apps for 10 years. I'm not even completely done learning yet.

I wracked my brain for an idea worth doing and the best I can come up with is an app where you hit a button and it gives you a random wikipedia page about a religion and you can save the ones you find most interesting. I figured it would be a fun way for people to kill time that like to learn.

Other than that, I really feel kind of rudderless. With my credentials I won't be able to do online freelance work which was going to be my ""If all else fails"" way to make money with this.

I'm really not sure where to go from here.",10Jul2017,2
59,"I recently was promoted to supervisor at my job. I work as a Valet. I've been working towards this position for 5 months now. Im ecstatic that I got it. My boss told me tonight that he's pulling me back though, that I'm still going to be a supervisor but he needs me to not supervise just do the paperwork and run vehicles like everyone else because everyone is saying that I'm arrogant and talk down to them. I have come off like this my entire life and it fucks me up because I view everyone as my equal. Since I'm aware I come off like this I've done my best to not be this person in this position but people are saying that I am. I don't know where I'm messing up in how I talk to people. 

He's pulling me aside to let the other supervisor gain more experience in learning the ramp and once he's perfected that he's going to put me back in my old spot, watch me and try and understand where it is that I'm messing up in how I talk to people. He believes that I am not intentionally doing it and believes that I am capable of the position.

64,"Hi /r/advice!

So I'm busy finalizing my vows for my wedding that is coming up soon, and I wanted to ask your thoughts on a passage in my vows.

I have been with my fiance for over a decade (high school sweet hearts) and I've become very close with her family. On day at a thanksgiving dinner I made a joke about how I was going to start putting on weight and her aunt and her mom teased me that as part of the family I am allowed to be either bald or fat, but not both. Apparently they have both teased other men in the family with this joke.

My question is this: I was thinking about putting a line in my vows to add some comedy, something along the lines of ""I vow to never be bald and fat at the same time."" However, I don't want the vow to come off as conceited, or as offensive to anyone who may consider themselves bald/fat. As someone who is not in on the joke, what do you think about this?

73,"My best friend and I have a rocky history. We met in high school, almost 6 years ago, and dated on and off for a while. On the tail end of our relationship over a year ago, as a last ditch effort to save it, we decided to try to be together to see how it goes. He ended up cheating on me with a previous girlfriend, someone who had been a problem in our relationship since it started. She got pregnant and recently had the baby.

I managed to get a couple emails through to him at first and he kept promising me that once she calmed down and things blew over, everything would go back to normal and we'd be able to talk like we used to. but he's been totally silent for a couple weeks now.

1. If I want to study radiochemistry specifically, how do I go about doing so? All the courses just say science or chemistry, and Manchester is the only place I can find with resources for radiochemistry. What course would I have to take?

2. Many of the courses say BSc or MChem, which I'm guessing means Bachelors and Masters. If I want to get a Masters degree eventually (and maybe a PhD if I can, but not likely), do I apply for courses that say MChem, or do I need to complete a BSc course first and then take a MChem course for my postgraduate degree? How exactly does it work? Edit: Also, do I need to take a foundation year?

3. How do student loans work in this country, and am I able to apply for them? What requirements must I meet? Can I apply for them even with my visa? If I need to do 2 courses like a BSc and a MChem, do I get two loans?

4. If my grades aren't good enough to get into any of the universities, what do I do? Radiochemistry and nuclear chemistry are the only things I want to study.

Long story short, I was approached for an internal position that came available during my time as a temp which required me to be sponsored (457 visa) by said company. The visa grants me 18 months to live and work here doing my assigned role. 

Fast forward 3 months and the company announced there will be redundancies at the end of July. We've reached the end of an incredibly full-on campaign that didn't achieve its crazily ambitious budget and now I'm being tasked with something menial in lieu of having more important tasks which would be more in line with my role.

Needless to say, there is a horrible atmosphere relating to the unknowns surrounding people's jobs, underscored by a lack of appreciation for us delivering above-mentioned campaign. I'm concerned that as a foreigner I will be out first which will naturally jeopardise the life I have built for myself here as a consequence of accepting my job.

I'm frustrated because I was also lumped with a project at my commencement which is universally thought of as being poorly thought out, yet my superiors don't seem to have any direction for me. With little budgetary control, I'm left confused as to what I'm meant to be delivering as the feedback- which had been excellent during campaign time- is now that I'm trying to work above my level, and that I shouldn't be going out to market with the ideas I have.

So I'm being paid a manager's salary, yet doing the same type of tasks as people on a lower wage than me, and not being given direction on the projects that I'm heading up. My boss appears to have checked out, and I'm wondering whether this culture is worth me gritting my teeth for the interim, and delivering on more menial tasks, or whether I should cut my losses.

Any advice would be appreciated!",10Jul2017,6

105,"I am in high school (America) and I have low self esteem and self worth so this might give you the context in which this post is framed.

I have been bullied quite a bit and so I am wary about this. I found a note in my locker earlier this week and it was of all things asking me out on a date and was quite nice and complimentary. However, it was from a girl who was very attractive (she is a beautiful stunning African American woman who is very popular), whereas I am a pudgy awkward looking white (this is relevant because I have been bullied a few times at school for being white and it is a black majority school and some of her friends have taken part in this bullying as well) guy, so I was cautious to say the least. I imagine that it was just designed to get me to respond and then humiliate me. I know these sort of things happen and they are very cruel so I was pre-empting that.

I reported the note to the school authorities as sexual harassment. They have suspended her from school currently and it will be put on her education record. I was pleased at the time as at least it shows that they were dealing with a very insidious form of bullying.

I have received a lot of online harassment from her friends saying that she was being genuine which I have reported as well (if she was being genuine why can't she tell me her self it is very childish to use intermediaries like this).

Do you think it is possible that she might have been genuine in wanting a date? I think it is unlikely I am glad I reported her because the alternative is basically what has happened to many people which is they contact the alleged admirer who then shares and mocks their response and they are humiliated in a very despicable fashion. I could not let that happen to me.
I don't just go around reporting women for sexual harassment recreationally for fun, I assure you. However, throughout my high school experience I have been bullied consistently, and so I can't trust these people and so I have to assume the worst of them.
If the woman genuinely wasn't trying to set me up for bullying and was instead interested in a date, then I am very sorry about this. However, I have to assume the worst, do you see where I am coming from?

Please do you have any advice on what to do?

TL;DR I reported a girl for sexual harassment and she has been suspended and will have this put on her educational record (I imagine this might impact college application etc.) as I thought she was setting me up to be humiliated.",10Jul2017,4

I dont know what can be that much wrong with me! Yes, I dont have confidence and I am too shy but I guess I am not the only one with those problems but others eventually find their partner!

I am very thankful she did it and we are still good friends but  still nothing. Sometimes I am thinking to let it go I am destined  by heavens to be alone but my human nature just cant let it go! My whole being is crying to feel love to hear all those sweet words, whispering and giggling on the pillow, to see her smiling and that I know that smile is because of me! But when I start thinking I realize that will never happen and it breaks my soul. What possible can I do? I go out I meet people.

Okay to explain why I'm writing this is because today I turned 18 and I feel now is time to seek for help. Eversince I was 14 I've not had any friends and never in my life ive had a woman. I always dream about having friends and enjoying life but it never happens . I have no problem talking to people and I am not awkward at all , I just can't keep friends and I don't drink or do drugs so I can't really do much outside to have fun. I do isolate myself on Friday's and Saturday's but every other day I go to college and I am very much into sports and fitness . Other than that I just sit at home on Friday and Saturday and play games or just think about things . I can't talk to girls because I don't really have much to talk about and I don't share any traits if you know what I mean. And when people say to me find new friends, it's not that easy as people can be cunts nowadays , and yeah I have met loads of cunts. I'm not suicidal at all but 90% of the time I do think about suicide but I will not act on it. Honestly as I write this I am sheding a tear (no homo). No birth day wishes other than my mom , not that I care but it just goes to show. I don't tell anyone in my life but I am depressed alot . I don't do anything stupid and I don't sit around . My diet is pretty clean if that helps with anything . Just to clarify I have mental disabilities but I don't like using that as an excuse to this bullshit. I am highly active but honestly it doesnt help although I will never stop. It just really upsets me that I'm not normal and can't live life the proper way.

I got married three years ago, and a year ago my wife left me. We have been separated for over a year, and the divorce will be finalized soon. Right around the time of my separation, I joined the family business. I took a pretty substantial pay cut, but in a couple years down the road I'm told that I will be able to buy into the business. This job bores me to death, and I'm not doing software development. I don't like the hours, and it's much more stressful than my last job. I really want to go back to my software development job. I'm potentially leaving a lot of money on the table if I leave the family business.

I would really like to have a location independent job, and I have always wanted to travel, so I was thinking of quitting my current job and traveling for a year. I have enough money saved up that I could easily live without any income for a year or two if I had to. I have a side project that I have been working on, that I would really like to work on full time. Who knows if it will take off, but at least I will have something for my portfolio if it doesn't.

122,"Using a throwaway.

For the past year I've been in an relationship with a girl. I am also a (bisexual) girl. The relationship was extremely toxic and abusive. While I am not completely innocent (I have attachment issues and depression that I'm working on), my ex made my life absolute hell. Among other things: she was manipulative, she yelled, she threatened self harm and suicide and actually attempted it multiple times, she constantly gaslighted and guilttripped me, and refused to give me ANY personal space. Additionally, she made me feel guilty about being attracted to men and having past relationships with them. She threw tantrums any time I tried to meet up with my (male) friends, because surely I would cheat on her with them, because a) they're men and b) I used to have one night stands in the past. She was misogynistic, biphobic (the irony), and racist. It came to a point where she physically assaulted me, I hit her in self defense, and, of course, it was all MY fault and I'm the abusive one. So I broke it off. After that, she manipulated me into living with her for the next few months, and continued to be abusive as a ""friend"". I'm okay now.

The thing is, we have a lot of mutual friends - mostly my friends that she met through me. During the relationship, the break up and the aftermath I was telling them what was happening in my life and they were all very supportive, telling me how fucked up it is, how I need to get out, and sometimes even to call the police when she was getting violent. At the same time, however, they were friends with my ex as well, supporting her and giving her advice. They still are. I only have two great friends who were always 100% on my side.

Currently, I am just hurt and angry at her, and at our friends. I'm 100% sure if my ex was a man, she would get cut off and branded abusive. Being a girl though, she gets a pass, especially that it was a same sex relationship. The blame is either on the relationship itself, on both of us (girls being dramatic girls), or her mental illness. I don't completely blame my friends either, because society tends to see only men as abusers, and she was always nothing but sweet for them.

I'm not sure if I want specific advice or I just needed a place to vent and maybe some support. Should I confront my friends about it, though, or just let it go?",10Jul2017,13

125,"This is might be a long one and I'm not even really sure where to start, fair warning.
Let me start with some background for whomever reads this:
Grew up not poverty-stricken to the point of homelessness or anything, but to the point of almost-losing house for many years.  Family spoiled the shit out of my sibling and I for what they could. Joined the military at 20(navy) separated three years later for an early transition due to overmanning.  Still kept my benefits for school, etc. Had my heart broken before the military with cheating, during my fiancÃ© dumped me and got with my best man, and then another cheated on me, currently with someone who is head over heels for me after some grace period of confusion on her end.  Fast forward a year of me being out(since Q1 2016) and I'm here.  During my last year I've failed to see my money dumping from meal prep, but that's not my question.  I have about 12k in credit debt and 5k from a car. I've started budgeting (since my dumbass didn't do it a year ago) so that should be okay for now.

I've wanted to be an actor or a singer for a good number of my youth years, that became more realistic when I joined the service.  I then wanted to become an optometrist (Music and science are my favorite, healthcare I enjoy, or rather I think just optometry.). I'm questioning all of my past thoughts on careers now.

Father is alive, mother passed last year from pancreatic cancer, sister is alive and going to college (26).  My father and I live at home still, though I feel it's really just by a thread, payments for houses are late and all of these other bills, but he doesn't attempt to tell me which ones he needs help with until it's about almost too late. My girlfriend, though I do love her, failed to get a degree and is just now out of college, a semester left to redo but she plans on doing that at another time.  I haven't started school yet, planned on starting this fall.

My plan: get undergrad out of pocket, currently I work for a doctor who's willing to reimburse me basically the cost of school after every semester for each A or B I get in the class, pay is $14/hr.  After that I was going to use my GI Bill to get my optometry degree at like SUNY optometry school.
Or goto San Francisco etc.


Currently, I don't enjoy working for the provider I work under, and I'm stressed probably more often than not even on my days off with the debate to continue this path or just use my GI Bill in San Francisco to start college and not have to worry about anything but school.  I get the feeling it's one of those things I can't get out of my head until I jump into it, but both my father and girlfriend so far suggest not going.  Girlfriend of course just finally got a job that isn't amazing, but will help her get a management position eventually. I also am not entirely sure I want to be an optometrist compared to just getting a different degree, if this is what mid life crisis can be compared to I want nothing to do with it.

I think the stress of not having my shit together is really the biggest negative impact, I've gained weight, stopped going to the gym, irritable due to not having shit together, and honestly some feelings of hopelessness and worry some days.

I have no idea what I should do at this point and I'm turning to you Reddit because I've got not much elsewhere to turn for clear opinions.

I travel for work.  Met this girl, we developed a really strong relationship for 3 months.  I care a lot for her, maybe too much.  While I was on the road for an extended period of time (6wks), she cheated on me.  This was January of this year.

About a week ago, she texted me.  I was still trying to get over her and move on with my dating life, even though a part of me wished she would come back so we could talk things out.  It has been since February or so since we last were in contact - she changed numbers.  We talked through text; she hates phone calls.  She asked if I was married/had a girlfriend.  She said I was such a sweetheart even though I couldn't be there for her.  She said she had to build up the courage to contact me again because she felt so bad about what she did.  Said her mother gave her advice, and has been asking about me.  Said she's been single since, focusing on raising her daughter and family things.

Her town was on the way home for me, so I asked her to lunch.  She said she couldn't, it was her mother's birthday, and no one was there to watch her daughter.  Here is where I think I messed up, because typing this out seems like I'm desperate.  I decided anyway to get her and her mother a card.  I called her, asked to stop by shortly just to drop off the cards.

I had wrote in the card that I forgave her.  Even though it hurt, it made me stronger.  That no one has loved me like her, and I hope she finds what makes her happy.

It was just her and her daughter, and we talked for a couple hours.  Her daughter left with her family, and we talked some more alone.  She said she missed me.  She ended up locking herself out of her place.  I stayed a little longer, she insisted I got on the road (3 hour drive), that she would be fine.  I kissed her.  We left smiling.

She texted me later to thank me for the card, and that it was nice.  Her mother also said thanks.

And now nothing.  She won't respond.  I only texted once every couple days until I got the hint.  I debated whether I should call her, if her phone is out of service, but probably not.  So I still refrain from contact.

Did I come back too strong?  I know I should probably let it go, but I've never felt stronger about someone (despite a 5-year relationship prior).  I feel like she is the one for me, and at one point she did too.  We had marriage papers ready for when I got back from travel.  She wrote many letters before detailing her feelings, but I don't know what she feels anymore.  Probably overwhelmed?  Should I just give her time again, maybe she'll come back?  Is there anything I should do, or have I done enough damage already?

Thanks Reddit, I know this is pretty petty as far as things go.  But I loved this girl with all my heart, and never felt more alive than when I was with her.",10Jul2017,1
148,"I am 24 and I am really attracted to my next door neighbour who is in her 40's I think. Her name is Elaine and she does have a partner, but I am almost positive they are not married. I see her coming home from work sometimes and we exchange the casual ""Hello"".

However, just recently I was up my ladders painting my garage and could clearly see into her garden. It was a hot day (around 30 degrees Celsius) and she came out of her conservatory wearing a bright summer flowery dress, and she looked really hot. When she noticed my above her fence on my ladder she said ""Do you charge by the hour?"" as a joke and I just laughed in reply as I didn't really know what to say in response (maybe nerves).

Anyway, I really want to get to know her and just see if she likes me the way I like her, but it is hard as her partner is around a lot of the time. So I would appreciate any tips/advice you guys can offer so i can get to know her without her partner knowing!

Thanks!",10Jul2017,3

Hey everyone. Just needing some advice. Please bear with me. My ex boyfriend and I have been together 4 and a half years. I was 19 and he was 23. When we started dating i was jobless. Just gotten laid off so I was living in the home he owned. I cleaned while he was at work and watched over his dog. Anyways after about a few months he started saying I've been slacking off that he has to tell me to clean things when before I'll just do them myself. Now hear me out. Our house was clean. All the time. Laundry and dishes were always done. He felt that if he's working 8 hours, I should also be cleaning at home the equivalent. These arguments would go every two months or so. I will tell him I'll change and clean more and try to be productive. Which I did for a bit but I do get in a rut for a week and kinda slow down on these things. (Turns out im suffering from depression and anxiety which he didn't really believe was a real thing). I got called back to my job after almost a year of this. We worked at the same company so we'd carpool together. Anyways this was apparently one of the reasons he started to resent me was cause I spent too much time with him ( on top of me being ""lazy""). He didn't really like most of my friends at the time either so they slowly disappeared and I ended up just spending time with him and his friends. This cycle went on for 3 years. He's tell me I'm being lazy, I'd tell him I'd work on it, I'll get in my depression rut and well argue and it'll start over again. Anyways last year he broke it off with me and told me I have a few months to leave. This timing turned out bad cause my dad passed away in 4th of july. He decided then to give the relationship another try. I thought things were going fine but 4 months ago someone offered to buy his house and he jumped all over it. We moved all our stuff in a uhaul truck that he bought and he moved back to his parents and I moved back with mine ""temporarily' anyways tonight he broke it off again. Saying that he only took me back cause he felt bad that my dad passed away and that it's never gonna work out and I will never change. He said that he'd like to get married someday just not to me (ouch) and that he's too busy with his project cars and work and don't want to make the time for me anymore. Of course I was begging him. I love this man. And this was so hurtful only being days from my dad's death anniversary. He said I can keep the things I have at his place till I found my own place. He said he loves me and will always care about me but just not in a relationship anymore. He also said he'd like his space. I came to his parents everyday after work even if im tired and helped clean, do his laundry or helped with his homework. I was trying to show him even though we werent living together that i was still there to help. He said he jumped all over tje house deal because it was a good chance to pay off his debts and start the seperation from me as well. I just don't know what to do. I can't eat or sleep. All I do is think about him and beat myself up for not trying ""harder"". I don't have family here at the state's besides my mom and him and his family has kinda been the closest thing I've had to stability and a normal life. I feel so lost. Any advice would be appreciated. ",10Jul2017,1
151,"Right so I'm in High School and I really, really, really want to date someone but there are a few problems:

1. Most of the girls I want to date end of friendzoning me. This sucks so much, as most guys know, because you text these girls everyday but you'll probably never date them. And that drives me insane. 

2. My parents want to know the girl before I ask her out but I don't want to bother with 'approval'. At the same time, I don't want to go behind my parent's back, cause I've always told them, especially my mom, that I'd tell her if I dated. 

3. I don't really want a serious relationship (I think). I just want to know how it is to kiss someone, and make out etc.

157,"I know this might be a long read for something that probably isn't a big deal in the larger scheme of things, but it's kind of bugging me, so here goes...

My friends and I have a pretty tight circle, mostly guys in our mid 30's, some late 20's, etc. We go to this local watering hole a few times a week to play darts, listen to music, shoot the breeze, etc. It's a good time, and I'm really glad this is part of my life at the moment. Anyway, there's a really cute bartender that works there some nights. She's friendly with everyone (borderline flirty), myself included. She and I may seem a little closer than the others, but in my mind, it's completely innocent. She does tell me jokingly how she's in love with me/I'm a catch, gives me a pinch or a love tap when she passes by on her way out for a smoke, and I've driven her home a few nights after her shift (honestly, straight home), etc. I've never said or done anything inappropriate to her, but sometimes if she's showing me a video on her phone or something or vice versa, I can see how it looks that we're cozying up at the bar.

I have no intention of doing anything with her, as she has a boyfriend, otherwise, I certainly would try to hook up with her. I'm getting up there in years, so admittedly, while I do alright, I don't have many very attractive young women into me, or at least acting like it. It's hard to just disregard it entirely, especially after a few drinks. Anyway, her boyfriend is there some nights, and he's a really nice guy. I'm not the type to smile in a guy's face and try to sleep with his girlfriend behind his back. Anyway, after our usual Saturday, I got a message from a friend saying he noticed so and so's boyfriend was pissed at how she and I were being flirty, and that I should be more careful. I didn't even notice I was doing anything out of line. I'm told by a few people that everyone sees that we're exceptionally flirty, though.

Rewind back a couple of months to the same bar - the male bartender there started seeing a girl that would visit the bar. This was a girl that I used to hook up with and developed a pretty close friendship with. Nothing significant became of it, but we still would text a bunch and spoke about who we were currently seeing, things like that. So before I knew they were anything significant, I was still messaging her asking her to hang out, or how we should hook up...and she was receptive, though very little became of it. I drunkenly may have done this from the bar, one of the first nights she was there to see him. Apparently, she told him (or showed him) this sometime later, and while he has never confronted me, I overhead that he knew. I had already stopped doing anything of the sort once I realized they were serious, but I know he thinks of me as a jerk for doing that, although he's always been very nice to me.

Now, these two guys know each other and for all I know, they're sharing stories between them (and others) about how I have no respect for them, and have crossed a boundary - i.e. I'm a dickhead. Anyone who knows me for real knows that's not true. I have my flaws, but I'm not looking to screw anyone over, particularly guys I know and have no ill will towards.

This bothered me all day yesterday, as I'm trying to figure out how to make things right. I plan to make an effort to keep away from the cute bartender, that shouldn't be a problem, but I always feel like the thought of me as a shithead will be lingering in the air. Would it be a terrible idea to bring it up to her or her boyfriend and address it that way - i.e. manning up, or something like that? Any thoughts would be appreciated. ",10Jul2017,2
158,"i just need to vent, I'm sorry. i'm 18F btw, almost 19. if anybody's been through something similar I could really use some realistic advice or that it's okay to be alone or something

I know it will sound shallow and petty, but I'm so fucking lonely. I was sped in hs. I had no friends. I've never held somebody's hand or had somebody ask me out. I'm aware this is my last chance to form social circles (starting school in the fall) and I'm worried I'll just mess it up. I have to maintain a very high GPA to keep attending so god knows if I'll have time for anything but studying. I've been in therapy with different therapists for years, been on medicine, nothing helps. It just doesn't help if you don't have anybody who cares about you. I've lived for 2 years seeing only my dad and brother, and they don't really care about me. (graduated early, been at home since)

I've never had a close friend or somebody to trust and I feel like I'm too closed off to ever be good for somebody. I'd just frustrate them. I see a lot of men talk about feeling like they'll always be alone but not a lot of women, and never bi women. I'm exceptionally ugly and terrified of people looking at me. I always had myself removed from the yearbook and nobody's taken my picture in 10 years. How the fuck am I supposed to go from that to letting somebody see me without clothes on? Even then, I see people on facebook who are probably objectively uglier and unhealthier than me (not that looks personally matter to me) who have partners. They're not this jumbled up inside, I guess. They say confidence works but it just seems like you're luring somebody in and that's not what I want to do. I'll never be confident for real, so lying and pretending I am will just mean the person will stop being attracted to me if I ever get comfortable around them. 

I don't know how to use makeup and all my clothes are mens clothes from the flea market or thrift shops. I have no way of getting to a job to make money to change this yet, since I live in rural hell with no car or license. I'll have a work study job at school, but I don't know. It'd be irresponsible of me to have children because I have health problems they could inherit. I constantly feel like I don't even count as a woman and that I deserve to die alone for being like this. Nobody is like this unless they're a horrible person and I deserve it. I'd be lucky if somebody cared about me enough to hit me, let alone actually treat me like I'm a person, so I shouldn't even get to complain.

I just want to fucking be with somebody. Friend, partner, whatever. I just want somebody that's okay with me looking like this, that lets me exist near them without judgement. Just for somebody to see past that and understand me even a little bit but I don't think there's anybody out there like that. These days it's just swipe left or right based solely on somebody's face and people like me don't stand a chance in a world like that. I've been trying to get better for years but this kind of despair isn't part of the chemical imbalance, it's just shitty reality. I don't know what to do or why I should keep on living at this point. A lifetime of being this lonely hardly seems like something worth staying around for

161,"One of my friends and I have this cute thing going on where we stay up late with each other, go to sleep at the same time, hang out with each other almost every day, say cute things to each other, and match outfits on a frequent basis. We're not dating or anything but a lot of people think we are. I myself am not sure if I like him - I think I might, but I really am not the type of person who should be in a relationship, for many reasons. 

One thing about us is I never message him first, just as a general rule of mine (I never message anyone first.) He's on vacation right now, and before he left, he was telling me that I could always message him whenever I want, and we can still talk while he's away. I said I would, but it's been two days and I haven't messaged him. I'm waiting for him to say something, because I guess I don't want it to seem like I miss him, or that I'm interested. The more I think about it, if things keep heading in this direction, we'd probably end up dating. But I don't really think we'd suit each other if we dated, so it'd be best to stay away from that. 

Even so, I'm pretty sure I'd regret it and be really sad if things weren't the way they were now anymore.

162,"My BF can't go for a single day, or even hours, without looking at a specific type of fetish porn online. Every time I look at his computer screen he has a couple of tabs open showing it, and I know that he has an instagram profile that he checks multiple times a day to look at new content showing it.


I am happy to indulge his fetish privately, but recently he's been wanting me to take part in his fetish with other girls, which I'm not comfortable with. As a 'compromise' he said he would be ok with taking photos of the models without me present, but I'm still not ok with this. When I tell him, he becomes angry and surly for days. He has brought this up with me multiple times, and my answer remains unchanged. I feel like I am quite fair because I do all I can to indulge his fetish between the two of us, but even that doesn't satisfy him. 


He recently broke down and got super sad/angry because he said that I was 'holding him back' from the things he wanted to do in life, specifically regarding this fetish. I am so sad because I feel like whatever I do is not enough, and that he will constantly be pushing my boundaries further and further if I acquiesce to this request. Any advice?",10Jul2017,4
164,"Hey guys, thanks for the click. I'm looking for ""what to do"" with my life, as I can't really decide for myself. I lack passion for anything, at the moment. I start school on the 17th, so I'll be occupied then, but I don't want to waste this last week playing video games, a.k.a. wasting away my early 20's, which has been my whole life. I will also have free time probably for the rest of my life, which I can't decide what to do with. 

My interests are studying texts in psychology, philosophy, physics, religion (although not religious), and the English language. I don't see how to physically turn these into hobbies.

Also, although these are my favorite subjects, I did completely awful in school, being the last in my class out of 79 students. High-school was years ago and this still has a huge impact on how I see myself, and don't think it'll ever go away. I'm 21 years old now.

Being last in the class always made me feel really dumb, like on a whole other level. This is not me being humble, I feel genuinely dumber than the average human, like I'm not connected to some sort of intelligence that is on the back of everyone's mind. Always felt at the ""bottom"" of intelligence. If we had a competition for the dumbest human on the planet, I might take that crown. I feel it reflects in my work life through my clumsiness and forgetfulness, but I couldn't know because I'm not constantly watching if others are like me, can't get in their brains, and nor do I try.

So Bob is a ""friend"" from my school, so during the year i see him almost everyday. The backstory is that he once was my best friend, we would go out together etc., but as we grew older, he developed this attitude to sometimes try to bring me down, especially when others are around, tell me i'm useless etc. so i kinda ditched him one year when the school was over (during the summer holidays). We didn't talk even when the school started, so i've started noticing that my life was getting back up, i found new friends and i was being happy. The problem was that we had mutual friends, and i've already told them i did not want to go out if Bob came with them, so they kinda listened to me. So one day we were going to a bar in the city with my friend and we met Bob (my friend and he knew each other). Now, in my mind, i said fuck it, i'll give him another chance, let's talk to him a little and see where it goes. So from that point we kinda got back, he seemed nice, we would go out just two of us again, but as the time passed, i began to see that he was the same f*****g asshole as he was before. Fast forward to present, he became extremely toxic again. Is should mention that i'm a teenager, and i have a terrible acne, which was a really big deal to me, i've had deppresion because of it, i didn't talk to people, i didn't go out, ignored my friends etc. As time passed it almost cleared out, but it was still there, and I still wasn't comfortable around myself. And the problem is, Bob always jokes around my friends about it, not in a friendly way, but like he specifically tries to hurt me and my feelings, and i'm a very sensitive person. He always tries to point himself out, tries to be ""the coolest guy"" in our group because he just talks when he insults someone, vapes his idiotic e-cig, and just overall i see him trying to get everyone on his knees around him. The advice i'm asking for is how do i deal with him, i'm gonna go back to school after holidays are over, and i can't deal with him no more. Almost all my friends get along with him, they know he's an asshole but they just go with the flow, and i don't really understand it. And sorry for a long text, i had to let it all out.

EDIT : forgot to add that he acts like an asshole for some time, but then for a brief moment he acts like a best friend, offering you a hand in whatever you're doing, or like offers to buy you a can of coke, making you forget what kind of asshole he is. He is really like a manipulator.",10Jul2017,5

I loved an addict once and it got UGLY. Lying, cheating, stealing, relapsing, etc. In the end, I had to get out for my own sake (and for the sake of my bank account, which had been emptied by said boyfriend while I was asleep). 

Fast forward about 8 years - My roommate, who suffers from extremely low self esteem, depression and the like, who has a track record of taking the ""out of sight, out of mind"" approach to ANY confrontation, recently started dating an ex heroin addict. He seems like a nice guy and all, but he was an addict for 10+ years with an extensive criminal record (including violent threats and smashing in the roof of someone's car while ""yelling obscenities"") and debt out of the ass from all the charges. He has ONLY six months of (court mandated) sobriety under his belt and while I want to encourage his recovery, six months just does not seem like a long enough time to recover from such an intense addiction. 

I would love to be able to trust my roommate, but she was living with her last boyfriend and didn't notice (????) that he was on METH - How can I expect her to notice an opiate addiction? That whole situation ultimately put ME in a scary situation when he showed up at my house very obviously tweaked, throwing things, and ranting and raving that she poisoned his coffee. It was scary and I do not not wish to repeat.  

I've tried talking to her but she keeps taking the stance that it's her decision who she dates - Obviously, who she dates affects me also, but I can't make her break up with him. 

How do I deal with this?? He hasn't done anything wrong yet, so I feel like an asshole. But at the same time, I've been here before - with my ex, and with hers - and I just don't want to take any chances. What's the right thing to do?  Should I just move?

It gives me a weird mail-order-bride vibe, but I'm trying to keep an open mind about it.

177,"So if you read my last post on this sub, you'll see that I have a spoiled brat, possibly sociopathic middle sister. As a refresher, I have 3 older sisters. The one in question is sister 2. Sister 1 is my real, blood sister, and die to us being adopted by our aunt, we gained sister 2 and 3. 

Obviously, I'm closer to sister 1. My last post explained how sister 2 acts like a 30 year old child. I discovered that a lot of her problem is that she's frustrated with not being in her career field yet, and she tends to take that out on literally everyone around her. Well, this morning, sister 1 texts me telling me that they fought this morning. Half asleep, I asked how that happened, and what happened. She told me that sister 2 got into one of her little attitudes again, and started running off at the mouth at sister 1. Now sister 1 is very patient, and usually just tunes her bullshit out, and puts in headphones. I imagine that this time, she didn't have her headphones, because sister 2 started cursing at her and yelling at her, so sister 1 got mad and slammed the tray that she was holding, on the table. Apparently, that was enough for sister 2 to decide it was okay to walk into the dining room and punch sister 1, causing her nose to bleed everywhere. Sister 1 said that during the scuffle, she could only manage to bite sister 2 as hard as she could. (I think) that I mentioned in my last post that I had a cousin coming to my city in September, for college. Well, she spent the night there, and sister 2 acting like a jackass woke her up. She saw sister 1's bloody nose, and left to go find our aunt, who was at work. Sister 2 left to go the library l, apparently. 

I told sister 1 that she needed to call the police. Sister 2 had been a bully for far too long, and this is a new low for her. I told her that if I were to hit one of them that way, I would have the police called on me, so she should not be an exception. Sister 1 called sister 3, who lives in central Florida, and she also agreed that she needed to call the police, but also said that she wasn't sure if they'd be able to do much. The cousin also suggested she call the police. I told sister 1 that if she didn't call them, I would. I've absolutely had it with sister 2, and because we don't talk at all anymore, and frankly, I consider her dead to me, I don't really care what the hell happens to her. She needs to be arrested, her career ruined, and to just be knocked on her ass in general. 

I live 700 miles away, but I told sister 1 that if this happens again, I'm coming up there. I have zero problem knocking sister 2 on her ass, since she likes to pick on everyone, and bully them. I don't tolerate bullies. Sister 1 told me that the next time it happens, she'll call the police. She also said the at our aunt/mom would talk to sister 1, (not sure what that conversation is going to entail, but she's afraid that she will somehow get blamed for what happened). With that being said, I decided to send my aunt (sister 2's mom) a text, saying sorry I forgot to call last night, since I was working on my car, and that I'd call her tonight. I also added that sister 1 told me what happened, and that she needed to do something about sister 2. I told her that she either needed to be knocked on her butt, or to be put out of the house, because assaulting my sister like that is unacceptable. That's the first time I've ever told her that she needed to do something. 

What do you guys think? How are we to handle this? How do we put this idiot child in her place? I feel terrible for sister 1, because she already has the self confidence of a potato, considering she's had a rough time lately, and has been in between jobs, and she gets crap about still being home at her age. She's legitimately talked to me about killing herself because she feels stuck, and constantly ridiculed for the things I just mentioned. As for sister 2's foolishness, I'm honestly afraid to intervene, because I genuinely think that I would just choke her out and end up killing her. After all the crap she did and said to me, as mentioned in my last post, I honestly have zero regard for her life. I know that's harsh, but I'm being honest. ",10Jul2017,3
179,"I just finished my first day at my new job as a Summer Camp Tutor held at a school. 

The head of the Summer Camp gave me all of this Secretarial work, which I have never done before. The work consists of photo copying loads of paper work, as well as, keep attendance. The amount of paper work and secretarial duties totals about 3 days of work that needs to be completed in less than 3 hours. I feel frustrated and overwhelmed and I had an emotional breakdown in my car on the way home. I really need this job, even though it's just minimum wage but, I feel that I have such an insurmountable task. I'm only one person and I basically have zero help.
 
What do I do? Do I quit or do I try to stick it out? ",10Jul2017,1
181,"I will try to keep this is short as possible and I am using a throw away because my parents stalk me.  I want to be objective and reasonable because I know not all of the problems are their fault but things are getting way out of hand.  Here is some context:

I was adopted at 7 from a Russian orphanage where I spent the years from 2-7.  I was abused horribly in this place before my parents adopted me and took me to the United States.  My childhood was strange because my mother was the powerhouse.  She worked long hours and my dad stayed home with the kids. 

This led to me growing an extremely close bond with my father.  I did sports and hung out with family and had friends/family to rely on.  My mother forced the Russian language out of us and we were not allowed to use it (this was the first time I noted how controlling she really was).  Then she moved on to the jealousy because I had a better relationship with my father that maybe she did.  She started with the clothes I could wear or the people I could hang with and I had a really independent spirit so this began to strain our relationship.  Mind you many other things occurred that made me realize my mother was extremely controlling but for the purposes of this post please just take my word for it.  So that leads me to the issue at hand:


I was out of house at 19 due to normal parents/daughter nonsense.  I had some older bf's (not too old but def. late 20's early 30's) and was a little wild for my parents taste.  When I say wild I mean I wouldn't check in with them all the time, I didn't want to go to school for the things they wanted me to do and I generally wanted independence since I was 18.  I was never into drugs or alcohol before I left their house and was generally a good student and person.  But then the fights started between my mother and I.  They grew in intensity over the years to the point where she would say things like ""I didn't pay all that money to Russia for you for this type of behavior"" - There was the kicker, I was nothing but property to her.  She then accused me of being pregnant (I WAS NOT) because I put on about 15 lbs from the stress.  So I left and started staying with friends.  The relationship deteriorated more and more of the next couple of years with contact being few and far between yet I desperately missed my father.  He was not allowed to talk to me unless I fixed my relationship with my mother and that was seemingly impossible.  A few more years went by leaving our relationship to the crows.  

It's now been 8 years and I can count how many times I've seen my folks on one hand.  I miss them (really my dad) terribly but there is nothing I can do as far as I can see.  This leads me to the advice I need (hopefully my background is enough for you to get the picture).  

My little brother just got the good news that he and his girlfriend are pregnant with a boy.  I want to be in my brothers life and my nephews life so I began seeing him again about 2 months ago.  Things have been good between us but my mother keeps poking him to stop talking to me.  She is saying horrible things to him on a daily basis.  He doesn't buy it and knows mom is very disrespectful towards me.  On Friday of the past week my brother invited me out to dinner but asked if I could pick him up at the parents house.  They were out for the weekend.  He begged me to come in when I got there since its been almost 10 years since I've been to their house last.  Against my better judgement I decided to go into the house.  About an hour later we left for dinner, had a nice time.  I drove him home and then went home myself to my house with my husband.  We hung out all weekend no issues and then last night around 9pm (folks arrival time from their vacation) I got an email from my mom stating that they are ""downsizing their house in the next couple of years and where can I send your adoption records and all your other effects to?"" - there is no way this is on the level - my mom always has a motivation.  I'm not sure if this a ""here is your stuff don't ever contact us again"" or something else.  My husband and I have no idea how to respond to this type of message.  I do not want to get roped into an argument or anything like that.  Should we:

1.  respond at all?

2.  Inquire about their ""downsizing"" move - that I never heard about since last night

3.  Ignore the email and see what happens there

4.  try to go the ""come to Jesus"" route? (this won't work - my husband and I have tried many times to get the family back together)

None of this makes me feel good about myself.  I have a number of issues relating to this:

Major depressive disorder

Anxiety

PTSD

etc.

This is absolutely killing me (I cant function, barely work, constantly in emotional pain and sometimes I don't leave the bed) and I really need some real life advice, there is only so much therapists can help me with and I feel like the reddit community could really be a life saver.  My husband has begged me to post this because the community here is so wonderful.  I wouldn't mind suggestions on the whole situation or just on what I am asking about the paperwork.  Also, if anyone wants more detail feel free to PM me.  I am sorry about the length of this post but believe me I could be 10 pages longer with all of the psychological damage I've received from the bad hands I've been dealt throughout my life.  I assure you my mother has been torturing me for the better part of a decade and all I want is to end the war.  This has almost cost me my marriage, friendships, my life, jobs and just about any happiness that I could possibly ever achieve.

185,"I've been working for a certain company for some time now. Within the company, there are several flaws with the business organization and operation that several employees and customers have become dissatisfied with. 

A few months ago I came up with an idea that could essentially revolutionize the industry, and have several former and current employees onboard for this idea (unbeknownst to the rest of the company). On top of that, I already have several investors lined up to get the ball rolling. Aside from those who I absolutely trust in the company (who, for good measure have signed NDA's), nobody knows about the idea.  

I'm almost at D-day where I go public with my business. This would take several employees from the company I currently work for and move them over to mine. This, combined with my business model, resources and network would probably end up bankrupting the old company. (That projection is the result of great deal of number crunching, trend reviewing, and several proof-of-concept endeavours, not just overconfidence) 


The trouble is I'm very good friends with the owner of the business. He's actually a very nice guy who has always treated me well. This business is essentially his baby, and though it has its ups and downs I can tell that he really loves what he does. And even more so that he trusts me. Hell, he never even made me sign a Non-compete agreement, he trusts me so much.

I'm basically at the point of no return where I have no choice but to move forward, but I can't morally justify what I'm about to do to a man who has done nothing but good by me.

""I'm unimportant"" ""you'd be better off without me."" Etc. Now I'm 21 and I have done my own research about alcoholism and the biggest thing I've learnt is that it is a diesease and it's not something anyone else can fix but the person who's suffering. What I don't know is how to explain to my 10 year old highly emotional sister that what my mother is going through is rough and that even though she says those things and it makes us feel like shit it's not our fault and there's very little we can do besides give her support when she needs it as well as give each other support.

I'm asking for advice on this matter because I've just come out of a really bad depression and I don't know how I got better but I can see my 10 year old sister showing the same signs I had when I started to slip into it.

188,"Hello,

So the carbon monoxide alarm went off yesterday in my house. long story short, I called 911, and the fire department came over and sorted it all out (they took out all the gas). The problem was that we had been using a gas machine outside while the garage and house door were open, and since the machine had been running for hours, it seems that carbon monoxide eventually built up in the house. 

However, today ever since I woke up I've been feeling very weird. I can't really describe it, but it's almost as if I'm sleepy/tired and kind of dizzy. Perhaps, it's more akin to a mild headache, but it's a mixture of all these things. I know these are all symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, but the gas was 100% cleared out yesterday. The alarm didn't even go off again after the fire department left. I doubt it that the alarm magically stopped working after going off once, so it seems that there isn't any more carbon monoxide. Plus, no one even ran the gas machine ever since. However since I am feeling the symptoms, should I be cautious about this?

Thanks.",10Jul2017,1

Problem is, it's the number of calendar years, so my entire first year doesn't count.  Meanwhile my coworker who started in late December has their count of years worked starting more or less immediately.  Is this kind of policy normal?  It seems blatantly unfair to someone that starts early in the year.

194,"So last night, we had an argument. It wasn't really that big, it was about how showering isn't really that bad for your hair, here is how it basically went: 

Sister: Showering is actually very unhealthy for your hair. 
Me: No it isn't. It depends on the temperature of the water and the shampoo you are using. 
Sister: It doesn't depend no shit! I swear to god, you just always have to be right, don't you?!? You are wrong! 
Me: No, I am not. I even did a little research on it. Where did you hear that it was terrible for your hair? 
Sister: Everyone has always told me that! 
Me: So you are just going to listen to people without checking for yourself, okay. 
Sister: Oh my god! You listen to everyone on the internet so what difference does it make?!? 
Me: A lot actually. 

We then stopped arguing because she just wanted me to shut up and leave it at that. She later then killed a bug and she started another argument. 

Sister: Did you know that we all eat 8 spiders a year? 
Me: No, we don't. That is a myth. 
Sister: No, we really do. 
Me: No, we don't. 
Sister: Google it and you will see that I am right. 
Me: Okay. 

I then google it and I run into several sites that says it was a myth. I even showed her one of them and she still said that we do eat 8 spiders a year. She then throws a fit and begins to yell at me for always trying to be right. 

It left me wondering if I did always try to be right. Or if there was something up with either her or me. To be honest, I just want it to be civil and calm when we have an argument but for some reason, she always yells at me and just laughs at all the remarks I make.

198,"Objectively speaking my life is going great. I have a good job and a lot of freedom to work when and where I please. Most of my friends are jealous of that. 

I can get dates with decent enough women but always find something missing. I dislike myself for even phrasing it like that.

I work in IT and while clients and my employer think I'm doing a good job, to me it feels like I'm surrounded by dilettantes and I'm just marginally less ""bad"". When I apply to jobs that I think are worth doing I get rejected.

I've had a lot of injuries in the last 12 months. Usually sports is what gets me through everything and now I can't train the way I want to.

I've read a ton of psychology, anthropology etc. books but all the knowledge of why I feel like shit doesn't help me to get out of it. Usually it does, but now it feels like the end of a road. I'm not suicidal or even by definition properly depressed, just resigned.

I objectively think my life is pointless and don't know what to do with it. 

I'm shallow when it comes to dating and ungrateful about everything that's going well in my life. I always expect more which usually makes me good at what I do. Right now it makes me feel brutally alone in my world of books and the feeling that things are going to shits.

AIs will take a lot of jobs and eventually America won't be able to sustain itself on credit cards any longer and then the whole capitalist system is going to at least massively stumble. Too me it looks inevitable. It seems like impeding doom is around the corner.

I also feel like I have nothing to justifiably complain about so I get stuck in this infinite loop.

I've spoken to friends but I feel like they don't get me or I have stupid answers to what they suggest. I have interesting projects coming up at work for once but even that doesn't help.

I am not sure how I am going to handle being alone in a new and rural place with such few people around. Any advice on how to get over this fear?

I started doodling when I was a kid and have been going on and off my entire life with different mediums; pencil, paints, digital. I draw as way to relax and forget about my problems.

223,"TL;DR: I am being stalked and harassed by someone I knew in high school (15 years ago) and I don't know what I am supposed to do about it.

This guy I knew in high school who was ""normal"" then... the legend has it that he went to Burning Man and had a psychotic episode/breakdown and has since never been the same. He now lives with his mom in our hometown in Nevada. I have not talked to him or seen him in at least a decade as our paths have not crossed.
Okay so the first incident was a few years ago, he sent me a Facebook message that was random, unsolicited, but still innocent. Fast forward to about a year ago, he sent me another facebook message asking me out... despite the fact that I'm married and obviously so. I did not respond. Then I got a hand-written letter in the mail to my current address which I never gave him (I've moved 6 times since then and now live in a completely different state). The letter was non-sensical telling me that he had gone to the park and walked his dog. Literally that's all it said. And THEN he DMed me on Instagram that he wanted to marry me. I blocked him on all accounts. So then he DMs me from a new account that he wants to have sex with me.

What can I do? I have privatized all of my social media accounts. I have removed my address from those annoying creepy public websites that list your address.

225,"To start off, a brief introduction. I am 17. Turning 18 this Friday. 

I am really shy. Introvert by nature. I don't like talking much. I don't socialize much, it just feels like a waste of time. Don't have many friends, but I am more than happy with what I have.... Two friends who are more like brothers, and one really amazing girl best friend.

Last year was kinda tough on me. I won a major quiz contest, and was getting good grades. I was practically on top of the world. And then it all came crashing down. It was a month after that, I realised I had sunk into depression. Life wasn't feeling worth living. I had nothing to look forward to. I was just totally emotionless. Not sad, just, blank. Numb to everything. I had a brief period of hope, when my younger sister was here on her vacation. That little angel made me forget all my worries, and gave me some hope in life. But when she left, I was back to that numb me. And day by day, I was worsening. I was feeling suicidal at times, infact, all the time. My relationship with my parents was never good. I didn't trust them, they hated me... They still do. 

It was during that time, that she (my girl best friend) came into my life. I helped her out in a test, and soon after, we sat together in the library and had a few chats. I don't know what, but there was something different in her, which made me trust her. I liked talking to her, being around her. It was weird. We began getting along really well, and we texted each other daily. We became really good friends. One day, she asked me why I was so secluded and gloomy all the time. I opened up to her about my depression. She understood. She tried to make me smile, and just make me feel like there was someone who ai could talk to. She was ever so supportive. She would always listen to me, and cheer me up. It was mainly due to her, that I finally felt alive, and no longer depressed. 

It was the last week of school before our holidays, when I realised I had feelings for her. I fell in love with the really amazing person she was. But I didn't want to ruin our friendship, so I didn't let my feelings out. We grew closer during the vacations, and I finally felt that I should try confessing my feelings to her. Unfortunately, that very night, she told me, that she had a boyfriend. I was shattered. But once again, I valued my friendship more than anything else. 

Couple of days later, she texted me saying that they broke up, but she still has feelings for him. I supported her, and made her feel light. We had really become close friends. 

School started, and just seeing her face everyday made me feel so much better. Her beautiful smile, those bright eyes, they made my day. Hearing from her, talking to her, sitting with her during lunch.... All memories I will never forget.
There were times I felt that she too likes me. But I am not sure. Never will be, I guess. 

Now, I have come to the realisation, that things are just not gonna work out for me. She doesn't look at me, the way I look at her. I dont know. And she deserves someone a million times better than me. I am everything a girl would ""NOT"" look for in a guy, shy, anxious, nervous, way too emotional, and I care a bit too much. 

My problem is that I can't imagine my life without her now, she has become an integral part of my world. Not a single day goes by, without me thinking about her. It is hard for me to accept the fact that I won't be able to be with her forever. Especially considering the fact, that there was something between us. I need help trying to re-imagine my life.

Please, don't suggest me to just try to forget about her, because I can't. When I had feelings for her, I was filled with disgust and self contempt. I was angry for not controlling my emotions. I tried to cut off all contact with her, but I just couldnt.

Please help me",10Jul2017,1

228,"So my only best friend keeps complaining to me constantly about how she feels like she has no one and that her group of friends constantly expect more from her.(She has known these group of friends since middle school.) I would not be irritated and be more understanding if it was not for the fact that she has a ton of friends and a ton of people who love her and consider her their best friend(They have told me this straight up) and she also has a boyfriend who loves her unconditionally as well. We are both in college now but are long distance friends, yet in high-school, her group of friends would constantly leave me out, shun me, and talk crap about me behind my back, and would not even consider me part of the group, while they always consider her a part of their clique and always invited her to places. One of the people in the group is an artist and drew a picture of everyone in the group an did not include me, and near the end of senior year when we were all about to graduate, I stopped trying to be a part of their group and started doing things on my own, and heard nothing from them, not even her. So I feel pretty irritated how she talks about them not including her even though she has always been included in a ton of things compared to me who they completely dissed. She then proceeded to talk about how she is never invited anywhere but then was going to drive one of her best friends to the mall because they wanted her to go shopping with them....just what. Is it wrong for me to feel like this and am I a horrible person for feeling kinda annoyed? I keep reminding her about all of the people who she does have and how they told me they consider her ""part of the group"" and ""her best friend"", but she just does not see it. I don't want to tell her how they treated me in comparison to how they treated her ans how I wish I was part of a group as they never gave me a chance, but with you they always invited you to places and included you in things while I was always left out.

246,"Ever since I was in 3rd grade, people seemed to hate me and bullied me relentlessly. Even the teachers were in on it sometimes. This lasted for over a decade of my school life. I believe people treated me this way because I was very hideous (I still am, just to a much lesser degree) and kind of sensitive/shy. I eventually gave up on making friends. I decided that since everyone hated me so much, I should hate myself too. I stopped pursuing any interests/passions I had and lost a sense of who I was. I went to multiple therapists throughout the years, but I don't know if that helped at all. 


I am only just now rediscovering who I am and what I want to do for a living. There are so many things I should know how to do by now. I'm 22, but I don't feel like an adult at all. In fact, I feel like a scared 10 year old child trapped in an adult's body. I just barely know how to drive. I can't drive without my mom or dad there to tell me what to do and where to go. I can't go anywhere on my own without great difficulty. I am extremely socially anxious and I fear any people outside my family. I've forgotten how to make friends. I can't make appointments on my own. I'm afraid to answer phone calls. I can't initiate conversation with people I don't know very well. I'm uncomfortable making eye contact because I don't want to see people's harsh judgments of me. I have never had a real paid job before. I dread the inevitable job interviews. I think employers will think I'm dishonest or rude. I don't have many skills or talents. I never tried hard at anything because I hated failing. 


I did manage to go to college for 2 years, but I didn't know what I wanted to major and I lost motivation. My grades plummeted and I withdrew. I want to go back and be successful at something, but I have all these nagging fears in my head and I might just fail again. I have a better idea of what I want to study now and I think I would do better this time around. I think that I could become more confident if I started accomplishing more things.

247,"Hey guys I'm a 20F. I've been feeling pretty bad for 5 years now and it's been a roller coaster since then but it's started to get pretty bad last year. I've always had insecurity issues but then when I got my first boyfriend (on and off now for way too many years) I became so completely dependent on him that my mood would drop dangerously low or shoot up really high depending on what he did. Unfortunately for me he was a habitual liar and manipulator and knew how to use his words on girls. I would constantly be disappointed by him but I'd always end up back at his side. It got to the point though after all of his lying and cheating that I became paranoid all the time and unhealthy to the point where I'd feel sick and he would be all I would think about. I'd start being hateful and bitter to him and he'd complain I wasn't meeting his needs emotionally because I'm too cold. Our relationship had been very bad and it affected me mentally. There's more to our situation that made it even worse but that would take too long to explain. Point is, I completely lost myself in that relationship. 

I've been trying to pick up the pieces of myself since then, while slipping along the way a few times going back to him when I've felt most emotionally vulnerable. I've become an irritable person who doesn't go out and I've gained quite a bit of weight which has worsened my view of myself. I go out once in a blue moon because I'm so insecure I don't want to be out in public other than going to university. I'm a perfectionist with that mindset that if I can't do something perfectly it's better not to do it all. I want to talk to people and socialize I feel so lonely it makes me feel even sadder but I just CANT go out. 

I try to lose the weight I've gained but when I exercise I start to get deep into my thoughts and have to stop because I get so down I leave and go to my room to just think. I'm so frustrated with myself I've thought about self harm as punishment because I hate myself so much for being unable to do anything other than study and be in my room. I want to clean the house or cook to help my mother but I can't bring myself to do shit. I just think if I can at least make myself study at least I'm good at something and have somewhat of a future for myself. A decent job I can use to give my life meaning and pay my parents back with. This spring semester I don't know how I managed to pull myself together enough to get A's because most of the time my mind wasn't there. To make matters worse, both of my grandmothers died this year and for one of them I got to see her body when it happened and it was horrible. Now the dog I've had since I was 5 is sick, too. Can't even walk down the stairs anymore.

I crawled back to my ex, how typical. Got hurt again, became self aware about how much power he has over me, now I've blocked him on my phone because I have had enough (who knows how long that will last though). Seeing my grandmother gone made me think what is even the point of life, I start to look at myself and other people and realize how stupid everything is because in the end we will all just die. The only thing that keeps me hopeful is helping people in my career and raising kids because they're so adorable. When my nephew was born I realized how amazing children are and I wish I knew how to express myself better emotionally to show my family I love them but it's always been difficult for me. I haven't always been socially inept, but I HAVE always been emotionally inept and it's another thing that frustrates me about myself, these past few years is when I've finally started to have a growth in empathy.

I'm also running out of money I've saved up in highschool for college and my family's never had much money to begin with. I don't like to ask for money and I've made some mistakes with what I had saved. Just another thing that frustrates me about myself. I just feel useless and angry and depressed all the time...I fear i will never be able to move on from this. I get this horrible draining feeling in my body like my spirit is being sucked out. I had only gotten it when something really bad happened with my ex and I felt like my life was falling apart. But now I've been getting that feeling every week. 

If you've read this far thanks, I really just wanted to tell someone all this. I didn't want to tell the few friends that I have because I've already dumped a bit on them about my depression and I don't want to push it any further and become a huge downer.

254,"Hey Reddit,

I'm an eighteen year old guy living in socal and I am posting this in hopes of remedying a problem I have that I usually don't feel comfortable talking to people about. Here's the thing: I desperately want to lead the life of a socialite and be known as a charismatic guy, but it seems almost impossible to orient myself towards that goal. For context, I spend a lot of my free time when I'm not working or going to the gym playing video games or just generally on my computer browsing Reddit or whatever it may be. I know this is probably the crux of my problem because it's impossible to meet new people if you're never AROUND people to begin with, but it's difficult to break myself out of the cycle. I've never really needed to make too many friends throughout my life because I've always lived in the same place and I've had the same friends for essentially all my formative years. As such, I never developed the ability to initiate conversation with strangers or break the ice. Sometimes I'll think about starting small talk or a conversation with a stranger but my anxiety always gets the better of me. I start thinking, ""These people probably don't want to be disturbed,"" ""I wouldn't want to be intrusive,"" or ""What if I make some incredibly embarrassing social blunder?"" The weird thing is that most of my close friends would know me as a very openly social person, but that's primarily because I find it easy to socialize with people I already know.

Now that my friend group has more or less been broken apart after graduating from high school, I'm really unsure how to proceed with my social life. The step I struggle with is actually making contact with strangers and making myself known. Throughout my school life, I was the introverted quiet guy who stuck to his work and hardly said a word. I've always tried to make as little waves as possible, metaphorically speaking. This led to a lifestyle of introversion where my main form of social interaction was online voice chat with my buddies while playing video games. I'm well aware that I'm currently living what should be the best time of my life, and it makes me anxious to think about my youth ticking away while I sit at my computer doing nothing meaningful. I also struggle with finding people around my age to foster a friendship with now that school is over for me. To make things worse, I've never even had a girlfriend because of my terrible social anxiety, and that's something I want to change. I'm not a terrible looking guy, maybe a little overweight at 6'2"" 220lbs. but I lift weights five days a week so I'd like to imagine some of that is muscle. The issue is just that women never have really seemed to notice me. Again, I think that's because I'm incredibly uncomfortable with being in the spotlight. I've always wanted to fly beneath the radar and just sort of blend into the crowd, but since I became an adult my outlook on that has changed. I guess my main question would be how I can transition from being an introverted nerd to being an outgoing socialite, because I'm honestly clueless where to even begin. People suggest going to parties, but I get so nervous whenever I have a party lined up that I just end up not going at all. This only perpetuates the cycle of feeling like a socially awkward moron, which then makes me want to go to a party the next time even LESS. I've always admired charismatic people for their social acuity, and I suppose I'd just like to know how I can be that way too. Thanks for reading.",10Jul2017,1

For those that do not know a GP is basically a doctor. And I was going to book an appointment as my feelings of depression have worsened to the point where I feel I need medical attention.

I realise I made my comment kinda light hearted, because I didnât want to scare her but this was me opening up my feeling to her.

I think her reply was quite cold seeing as she didn't even reply with any words.

272,"So I'll try and make this long story as short as possible but go over the whole situation.
7 years ago when i was in sixth form I got to know an exchange student and we got on really well, she got on with my mate even better. The thing about my mate though was that he had a girlfriend, anyway basically ( lets call him dan) dan got on too well with (lets call foreign exchange girl lena) lena.
In the summer holiday we all went to visit lena, me, dan and a couple others. This is where is gets fucked up I know you will all judge me hard but hey this is why I need some serious anonymous advice! one night i borrowed lena's laptop because i needed to sort out some banking it turned into a couple hours of sorting out my banking and everyone went to bed. Lena's skype then flashed up and being far too nosey I looked and seen her and dan had been talking.. i copy and pasted their entire conversation and sent it to my email.
Fast forward 7 years after the holiday i forgot all about what i did and stumbled upon this email i sent myself all those years ago. And dan and lena had been cheating with each other, but dan is still dating his girlfriend today. my dilemma is do I tell dan's girlfriend he had been cheating and show her the conversation i stole? what do I do she doesn't know.. it is just so fucked up what if dan and his girlfriend get married and the only people who know he cheated on her is me and dan.. what if he has cheated again?
So.. do i tell Dans girlfriend or not?",10Jul2017,1

283,"I want to know if anyone else feels this way? I had a pretty rough childhood that made me learn you can only count on yourself. This made me take on the lone wolf lifestyle. Throughout high school I didn't have a whole lot of friends and the ones I did have I still know and are great people. 

The thing is I was the loser guy no one wanted to be friends with which only strengthened my hatred for people. I always wondered why wouldn't anyone be my friend when I never did anything to them.
The only person who kept me truly happy died this year and now I've graduated high school. 

Thing is now all I want to do is sit in my room, play video games, go fishing, workout, camp, and do it all alone. My friends text me all the time and ask if I want to hang out and why don't I want to hang anymore. Like I said I care about them it's just that I have some weird disconnect that makes me want to isolate myself 24/7. And them coming by my place to visit unannounced only pisses me off more. I just want to be alone like the lone wolf I am, that's when I'm happiest. 

All of this is giving me the urge to just save money, change my number, and move 2 or 3 states over and not tell anyone about it and just start clean. I'm even going as far as to get my phone cut off next week just so no one can contact me anymore. 

Is this odd? Does anyone feel the same way? What should I do? Any response will be greatly appreciated, thx.",10Jul2017,2
286,"So, here's my [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6lxgit/boss_totally_powerplayed_me_today_how_can_i_get/), but tl;dr my boss told me I had to come in on a day that I don't work although I have a recurring commitment that day &amp; time.

I decided to have a sit-down meeting with her as we were wrapping up that day, and I basically said ""look. I take my other commitments very seriously, and even though they don't pay me, they rely on me to do specific tasks that help them function. it's important for me to having fulfilling things in my life outside of work. can we reschedule - either I can come in the day before, or at noon on Sunday?""

Her response was along the lines of ""I can't believe you would prioritize volunteering and, to be honest, it makes me concerned about having you work under me."" Aaaand I ended up working Sunday morning.

288,"So a little bit of background. I am a 23 year old female who graduated in 2016 with a double major in both chemistry and biology. I spent a few months after graduation looking adamently for a job in a laboratory. Being that it is particularly difficult to find a job, I finally decided to work with a recruiter where they found me a position at a laboratory for $16/hour. I was sick of the job hunt and decided that I would take this position as they assured me that there was a possibility of being hired on permanently. So I stuck out my six months and they did end up hiring me on. Tomorrow marks my year with the company and I have excelled in my field. Due to a series of events, I have been essentially managing my department which comes with a lot of responsibility (i.e. training new employees, assigning workloads, ordering reagents and various chemical, amongst many other things). When they converted me to a direct hire they offered me a $0.50 raise and then they gave a 3% raise come review time. So that puts me at a grand total of $16.83/hour. Woop. Dee. Doo. My manager confronted me about a month ago saying that he would like to put me up for the senior analyst position (which I'd like to say isn't a small feat for only having been in the industry a year) and I obviously was very happy to hear this. He said he wanted to propose it to the division manager. So back to the present. I went to talk to him today about the status of said promotion and I got the distinct feeling that I would definitely get it. The catch is that I wouldn't see it until the annual reviews come around which isn't until next year. I'm a bit upset. I have taken on a large amount of responsibility with very little in compensation. I live in the Chicagoland area meaning it isn't cheap due to the ridiculous amount of taxes and the absurd cost of living. I worked my butt off in college, graduated with honors, belonged to two honor societies, so I feel as though my pay isn't quite where it should be. I have had other people confront me about positions at different companies where I could be making substantially more money. But, I have a big heart and know that company would really take a huge loss if I left (I make them roughly $80,000 a month). What should I do? Should I confront my manager and tell him that I thinks it's unfair that I have to wait that long? Should I look for a different job? I'd like to give them the opportunity to give me and incentive to stay before I leave them. Can corporations give raises at any time of the year?",10Jul2017,1
289,"Hello, I am studying engineering in Universidad de Chile. It is said that is one of (if not the) hardest place to study in Chile. The 1st year I failed 2 courses (1 each semester that is considered normal).
Then the 2nd semester of the 2nd year I had some kind of depression and i failed all of my courses. Now I am retaking the same courses and I am failing them, all of them... again. I tried to change to another university, and that was going extremly well untill yesterday when they told me they didn't accept me. I was diagnosed with phobic anxiety disorder which led me to stop going to classes and tests in some cases. Because this there is no way i can pass the exams and it is to late to put the career on hold.
I never really knew what i wanted to study, i just entered here because i was interested on Chemical Engineering. It's to late to chang university except for one, but it doesn't have a Chemical Engineering career, so i would have to study another kind of engineering (which i am not sure is what I want).
I feel like i just lost 3 years of my life and I don't know what to do, any advice appreciated.",10Jul2017,1

Thanking everyone in advance.

I work for a care home for people with developmental delays and have been there for about nine months. Although I enjoy the work, it doesn't pay well, and I am applying for new work.

The thing is, I am hoping to apply to PA school soon, and was also hoping to ask the RN who works at the home for a recommendation. Is it dishonest to ask for a recommendation, knowing that I'm hoping to quit soon?

292,"I get home from work today to find my mom with a livid yet distraught/angry look on her face asking me if I know where my dad is. Unfortunately, i don't know where he is, but I also want to speak to him as he scratched my car pretty bad when I lent it to him the other night.

At first, my mom wouldn't tell me what she wanted to speak to my dad about but i persisted. She told me she was at our local Wal-mart when she spotted my dad with another woman, possibly in her 30s (my dad is 66) and her baby child. He was pushing a cart filled with stuff and was even buying women's underwear with her while he was patting her on the butt and kissing her (according to my mom). 

My mom then sneaks up behind him and grabs his shirt asking what he thinks he's doing, and the women mysteriously disappears (again, according to my mom). 

He tells her ""you do the same"" and then he goes off and has not been home yet.

As you can imagine, I am caught in the middle not sure how I should proceed. I've been trying to call my dad but his phone is off, and the people he works with don't know where he is. 

My dad is a religious man, going to church every week, and is even head of their committee. For him to do this so blatantly has made be frankly quite distraught, and I don't know what to do. 

as you can imagine my mom is not in a great mood, and neither am I.

Has anyone gone through something similar, some advice would be appreciated

297,"Hi Reddit, 

Coming out of my high school soccer season I was about 175lbs. Due to post season I've gone up to 190lbs and just started to get into the swing of trimming most bodyfat to be lean for the upcoming season in college, I'm currently 6""0 and 190. If anyone has any collegiate sports experience or personal training experience I was wondering if I should stick to my cardio weight loss workout. ""5k every morning, followed by jumprope H.I.I.T and then swimming as an end to the workout. Along with already cutting everything but healthy foods from my diet. OR if I should start weight training. I'm fairly muscular and have large thighs and I'm quite large for my position allowing me to already body people off of the ball. Should I start weight training while alternating with the cardio or just stick to the cardio and begin weight training when college begins with a proper instructor and goals that are laid out?

TL;DR: Soccer season coming up, 15lbs overweight for optimum weight, should I keep cardio training or start weight training?

Any help would be a god send. I'm sitting in a European hostel and need advice from someone more knowledgeable than me. Thanks!!!",10Jul2017,1
