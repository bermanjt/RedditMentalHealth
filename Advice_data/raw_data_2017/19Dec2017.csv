0,"Hello. 

This is going to be long, so bear with me... I just read my post and it's a giant mess, I'm sorry for the many stupid details. 

I've already posted here, and after months now of reflecting on my relationship with my boyfriend, I've decided to stay with him.

I am a very anxious person. I don't have many friends, I'm kind of a lone wolf if you will. My boyfriend (I'll call him Matt) says he really loves me, he has told me on many occasions that I'm his true love, that he's never loved another like me before, that he thinks he's going to marry me, etc. I'd like to believe all of that, because I am so in love with him. We were considering living together earlier this year and were apartment hunting. I was really excited to live with him, but then another opportunity for me came along (we're not doing very well financially) so I took it and now I live alone. But we used to live together for two months during all of this. During these two months a lot of things changed. His behaviour towards me (he got angry very easily with me, he shut me down, when I said something he didn't like he often told me to: ""shut up and look back at the phone because it was better that way"" or that I'm ""annoying"" ; he didn't even touch me).

Now, I can get jealous easily and this is a problem. I have been cheated on in the past and was forced to listen to my ex having sex with his new girlfriend for a year (we all lived in the same building). That was a very traumatic experience and it kind of ruined me. It's hard to trust my boyfriend because now I have that mentality that everyone will cheat on me and break my heart. I'm scared. And Matt knows that. But lately he's been texting one of his friends Amanda and I got a little suspicious. And I went through their texts... I know this is a bad thing to do, but the curiosity was killing me (because every time I asked about her, he woul get angry and tell me I'm crazy ; even when he got messages from her and I asked him who it was, he didn't want to tell me). It's Amanda who initiates the conversations (mind you she has a boyfriend). I don't know if I'm reading too much into this, but I saw texts like: ""I'm alone in my apartment and I'm bored, do you want to come over?"" or ""Are you free tonight, do you want to meet me somewhere?"" and he'll be shutting her down with ""No, I'm with my girlfriend."". They've been friends for a long time, but she is always seeking his attention. I've never found anything flirty. But while I was checking their conversation, there was another one with another girl. I didn't look at them, I stopped reading and felt utterly embarrassed and awful that I had just done that. I know I shouldn't invade someone's privacy, but I had doubts. And I wouldn't have these doubts if he was still feeling attracted to me. He doesn't touch me like before, we barely have sex. When we're outside, he's walking two steps in front of me (before he always held my hand). I feel unloved and when I think about it, I start feeling selfish. And the doubts come in my head. Sometimes we have an amazing time together, I love being in his company. And sometimes he just isn't there. We've talked about this many times but I feel like we're going in circles. And he's afraid of losing me because when he sees that I'm pulling away, he starts being nice again and starts reassuring me (it only lasts for a couple of days and then everything is back to normal). And I'm tired. I'm aware that I sound like a teenager talking about their crush. And I'm a mess. But I don't know what to do or what to tell him. Or how to tell him. 

I'm so confused and I will be happy if someone gives me their opinion. ",19Dec2017,2
1,"I’m currently watching Broadchurch on Netflix and I noticed something that happens a lot in shows etc. People refusing or delaying telling information by saying something along the lines of “I don’t know if I feel comfortable telling you, blah blah blah” but then the cop will say “you can tell us or we will get a warrant” and then they cave in. So is it bad to have a warrant called upon you to search a business, car or whatever it may be? By bad do I mean does it effect you personally or do they just cave because they know they will be forced to anyways?

Thanks!",19Dec2017,2
2,"Recently I've struggling with the ultimate first culture problem: how to spend my freetime. This may sound like a juvenile problem, but it's genuinely getting annoying to the point where I waste all my day thinking about this and researching different aspects without being able to spend time with either of my hobbies.

The gist of it is that I have two major interests. On the one hand is otaku subculture, and on the other literature. Otaku stuff (i.e. anime, manga, porn games) is in many ways what I enjoy indulging in the most, but I feel like I'm ""wasting"" my time with it. It is not socially respectable, will not land me new friendships or even less a relationship as I know nobody else interested in the same stuff. Literature and reading in general (both fiction and non-fiction), on the other hand is much more respectable, in many ways traditionally seen as the most ""intellectual"" of interests even, but I have to admit that my passion for it is not as great as otaku shit. I still enjoy it, but it doesn't ""speak to my soul"" the same way a good eroge would.

Of course, I could and will do both. However, I'm going to study law at university soon and my free time will become very limited. What makes this worse is that I plan to pick up learning Japanese if I do decide to dedicate to otaku media (most of the stuff I'm interested in is not translated). This means one of my two main interests has to take the backseat.

So I don't really know what to do as a hobby, as vapid as that sounds. I kind of like otaku media more, but I feel like spending less time with it and more with literature and high art would make me a more interesting person to spend time with and talk to, as well as enlighten me more about the world in general. And just give a better first impression of me I guess. 

It's probably difficult to anyone to give exact answers as this is fundamentally something only I can answer, but it has been bugging me for quite a while already and hope that his place could give me some advice!",19Dec2017,2

5,"On saturday night I went on a date with a man (lets call him Jack) who've I've been seeing for a few weeks now. 

We decided we were going to go get dinner at a little italian place, then go check out a local band at a bar a couple blocks away. We knew we would get a couple drinks, but neither of us planned on drinking heavily. 

We parked his car by the restuarant, ate dinner, dropped off our leftovers in his car then walked to the bar. By the end of the night we had had way more drinks than we had planned, and I insisted we take a Lyft back to my place instead of driving because I believe he wasnt in a state to drive. Jack argued with me a little bit, but after i insisted and offered to pay for the trip there and his trip back in the morning he complied.

Next morning we learned Jack's car got towed. According to him its going to cost $375 to get it back. I am a broke full-time college student, i have very little money, but I feel obligated to pay his cost because it was my fault. 

Any advice? What should I do?

EDIT: It's not that Jack is expecting me to pay any part of it, Ive hinted at that multiple times and he hasnt asked for help or even entertained the conversation when i offer to help. He plans on paying for it himself, and were still talking so he cant be that mad at me haha. That doesnt change how I feel in that i feel an obligation to pay, but i absolutely cant afford it before when he needs to get his car back by. ",19Dec2017,1
6,"Ok so I moved to Virginia back in September 2016. I moved here because I wanted to be here with my best mate and he offered me to stay with him. So I took him up on that offer. I've had two jobs since I've been here, one at McDonald's and another at bojangles,bo time being most recent. Well, since then me and my friend have had a bit of falling out. My bro is sort of a manipulater, and all he likes to do is act like a cock and treat people like shit. The peak of our disconnection is when he insisted that the ps4 I BOUGHT FOR MY BIRTHDAY WITH MY OWN MONEY belonged in his room because he pitched in 20 to pay for it (total cost being 225) and he proceeds to push me against the wall telling me how I sleep in his bed and live in his house. Meanwhile his mother and get boyfriend live with us and they pay majority of rent. Anyway, he sits on his gf's laptop all day whileshe works 2 jobs supporting him (i don't know why). 

I was working at bojangles and I thought I needed a vehicle even tho I don't have my liscense. I find an old truck on craiglist for 500. I say fuck it, take my whole paycheck and buy it. Same day I buy the truck I lose my wallet. My wallet contained my gov issued id, ss card, and birth certificate. This was back in June, it is now December. I quit my bojangles job back in sept because I wanted something better and I would use it as motivation to get my shit together(not a good choice). Now I'm living on the sole love of my friends mother. Most of my family lives in TN. I asked my mother to buy me a copy of my birth certificate and send it to me, it should arrive in the next few days. She is currently living with her now husband who's in the military, this man kicked me out at 18 and decided to marry my mother. 

As of now I can barely feed myself with the money I make donating plasma and I have no vehicle (my truck was towed last week as an abandoned vehicle), no id, no ss card,  and only a birth certificate that is yet to be in my possesion. It's almost xmas and I would like to get a job by January. 

I've looked into the docs I need to get an id but it's a very frustrating situation because you need ss and two proof of residency and I have no bills in my name. 

I'm pretty confident I could get a job quickly but I don't have either id OR ss. 

I'm looking for any helpful responses because this is my first ever post on Reddit and I come here whenever I need a question answered. I love everyone. 

Im just frustrated to the point where idk id I should just give up and let myself die or I should keep fighting (I have a case of crippling depression ) 

I don't know what I should do even after I get my birth certificate.. 

ANY help is appreciated here and I'll keep anyone who want to know updated ",19Dec2017,1

I've never been in such a difficult situation. I don't know what the fuck i should do. Somebody help me.

About 6 months ago my best friend/roommate met a girl and they've been together ever since. I always kind of liked her but didn't do anything, because it's my friends girl and I value our friendship way too much. Still my feelings were always the same.

I slowly became more friends with her and she helped me out through a difficult time in my life. We started telling each other some of our secrets but I always thought she saw me as a good friend.

The day before leaving my college (i go to college in Italy and am visiting family in the US)  she asked me to go out with her friends  one last night before i left. When i got there it was just her and she was already a bit drunk. She basically told me that she loved me and could not stop thinking about me. That the reason she would come over to our house was just to see me. 
I told her that i liked her too and that i wish we could've met sooner but out of respect for my friend nothing could happen between us.

It's been two days since that happened and I can't stop thinking about it. We've been sending each other texts but I told her we needed to stop. I couldn't do it behind my bestfriend's back. The texts stopped until tonight when she started sending me drunk vocals saying that she couldn't stop thinking about me and that she couldn't imagine her life without me. She told me that she wanted to break up with my friend for some time now and it had nothing to do with me. Even though I really like this girl I difficultly told her that even if she broke up with him I could never be with her because I would lose my best friend.

I don't know what the fuck I should do. I really like this girl but my bestfriend is really important to me. I've accepted the fact that our friendship will never be the same but I don't want to lose both of them, or maybe that's impossible. I want to tell my friend about all of this but i'm afraid he'll just get angry and i'll lose his friendship.

She told me she would call me tommorrow so she could talk with me sober but i don't know what the fuck I should do.
Fuck this! I can't fucking sleep or do anything.

13,"First the context: 

1. **This year, I've worked a lot.** I've been on a lot of overtime at work and I taught a class this past summer in addition to this. I've had a few conferences to travel for at work and recently was stuck overnight at an airport. I get one week of break time at work for the holidays and was looking forward to resting. I get December 22nd to January 1st off from work.

2. **My boyfriend (of ~3 years) is sick** and also hurt his back last week and was in considerable pain (he's getting better though). I am taking care of him. I don't mind doing this. This gives him an excuse as to why he hasn't gone to visit his mother yet for Christmas. He attends school and has been on break as his semester ended two weeks ago. He has the rest of this week and two more weeks off until it starts back (so about a month in total). This is information for below.

3. **His father died recently** (last month). We both traveled for visitation and support. He stayed a week and I was there for a weekend (I did as much as I could, even with an extremely crucial time at work). 

4. **His mother asked for us to come visit for Christmas**, which would mean about 1 day or 2 days of traveling depending on if we drive or fly. Originally, he suggested we go the 22nd and come back on the 28th. Especially under the circumstances, that was alright with me. This was the plan until very recently, when he changed it. His intention is now to absorb my entire break from work in visiting his mother. To be fair, I have suggested multiple times that he go ahead (before he got sick and hurt his back) and go, since he was on break already and his answers were of the ""I'll see"" and ""I don't know what I would do there for that long"" variety, before he started to get angry that I was suggesting it. It definitely sounded like HE did not want to go, but he is the one pushing for US to go. 
While I understand that it's good to visit his family and especially considering the situation, I was still a bit upset that he wanted to absorb my entire break in another trip, including New Years, which he had promised would be us doing something fun (the night of) for the entire year...and I had been looking forward to it. It wasn't as much that he wanted to absorb only my break, apparently, and not his, but that he just went ahead and assumed, gave no regard for my being tired, but was noticeably angry when I asked why we weren't going with the original plan of 22nd to 28th. He accused me of not wanting to see his mother, then said that he did not want me to go. This was a huge fight. Now, he's sick, but back on ""we're going"". Obviously he / we can't go until he is well again, but it's likely that he'll be better by this weekend, which puts the trip back on.

Here are my questions:

1. I desperately want a break to rest. I do not want to go. Multiple people (coworkers and my family) have told me that I need to rest over the break. I have only this break and do not get another break from work until next year's holiday week. I support both of us. Am I being selfish? 

2. As he is sick, I've thought that if I could get sick at the right time....I could avoid going and send him instead. That way at least I could rest....does this make me a bad person? I really see this as the only way out aside from a breakup.

3. Considering his situation, should I just bite the bullet and go, take the consequences, and just deal with being miserable for a while? This would avoid another fight; I'm sure there would be another fight if I were to try to discuss it with him.

15,"So I went to college in 2009 but in 2014 before getting a bachelors degree I decided to quit college and commit suicide. I made the decision because I'm very ugly so I'll never meet a woman who likes me and get a family of my own. I didn't wanted to go to a job I was going to hate and return to an empty house until the day I'll die alone in a hospital.

16,"Hi r/Advice!
Asking for some advice using a throwaway.
I own a house with my girlfriend that I live in and also rent out to three other housemates. This has been the case for a couple years as a way to pay down the mortgage (I live in an area with a high cost of housing and a tight rental market). So far it has worked out great and all housemates have been good folks (several have come and gone through shorter term renting), but finally got to where I want to ask one to leave. 


She has lived here for about a year and is nice enough. She is pretty clean and not a total disaster, but it was also clear pretty quick that the chemistry wasn't great and we weren't going to hit if off and become friends. Minor annoyances are now adding up, such as:

- not quite pulling her weight any more on cleaning up kitchen, putting away dishes, etc.

- she works shifts and the early/late comings and goings are a bit disruptive with thin walls. She's not a jerk with loud music or anything, but if she has a shower and some breakfast at 5am it's definitely waking others up.

- She is a fan of Tinder and seems to have a new guy every 2 weeks. No issues with loud sex or anything, and some are nice guys, but some things really rub me the wrong way:

--- her choice in men leans to very hippy and some of them smell

--- A few have even brought over their laundry do to here (i.e. they live in a van or hostel with no laundry)

--- she has shared her door code with some to the point where strange guys who I've never met walk into the house and don't introduce themselves (this is definitely the biggest concern!)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Even if I could talk through a couple items with her, especially the most bothersome ones, I don't think it's repairable and I am set on asking her to leave. I have a few concerns about doing this and want it to go smoothly:

- I ask my tenants for two months notice when they leave so my inclination is to give her two months notice. If she reacts badly I could have to shorten it up. I'm willing to let her leave at any time in the two months with no rent penalty.

- I don't want to get personal, and I'm struggling with how to communicate it in a way that I don't come across as judgy or mean. I think given how long she's been here she's going to want more than ""it's not working out"".

- I want the other house mates to know that this was about her, and that I still like them as tenants and want them to stay and feel secure. I also want them to feel that it was handled fairly (and I would assume that she'll tell them whatever I tell her; so it has to be pretty transparent).


On the legal side my jurisdiction has very lax rules about renters who share a kitchen or bathroom with their landlords (kitchen in this case), so technically I could kick her out with almost no notice (i.e. days or hours) and the cops should back me up; her original agreement was for 6 months and it just went month to month after that. In this case I'd prefer to take the higher road and am willing to wait it out (and even possibly eat a month's rent) as long as she stays civil about it too.

27,"I first moved here in July. Within two weeks I had seen 2-3 roaches in various spots in my apartment. I contacted the apartment and they apparently came in and sprayed when I was not home. I also bought my own roach bait stations and they are placed around my apartment. I have not seen a roach, live or dead, inside until tonight.

I keep my apartment exceptionally clean, taking out trash once a day, and am fairly minimalist so there's actually not even much stuff or furniture, the one I saw tonight was literally in the corner of a completely empty 10x15' space of the living room, and so I do not believe any roaches are ""my fault"" regarding living conditions or cleanliness, but either a natural possibility or a side-effect from one of my neighbors or something.

If it's just a one-off roach that snuck in obviously I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but if it *isn't* just one, naturally something needs to be done and easier sooner than later. But I don't want to be the person who keeps reporting roaches in her apartment, either.

Should I report this, or wait to see if there's more? (Notably I'm leaving for Christmas for 10 days tomorrow so I'm also worried about coming back to find many roaches have moved in!)

- Wasn't sure what program to take in university after high-school and didn't want to inherit $60K worth of debt for something I was uncertain about.
- As a result got a job doing Technical Support for an Internet Service Provider.
- 6 months later I got a job at one of the largest tech companies in the world doing 1st tier Technical Support.
- 2.5 years later I got a job at an up-and-coming 65-person software company which was a more challenging and technical role.
- 3.5 years later I got promoted to an Account Executive position doing software sales and ended up breaking the 1st year sales record.
- I performed poorly the following 2 years and ended up getting let go as a result. 
- 7 months of deep depression later I ended up getting a job at my previous employers direct competitor and became the #1 sales rep out of 350 reps globally. 
- I was shown no respect; was unappreciated, and verbally belittled/devalued by my boss to the point where I stood up for myself. He took it as a sign that I am looking for another job and as a result was let go 3 days later. 
- I fell into a deeper depression than last time which has lasted over a year now (..I'm still here and battling super low self-esteem and self-worth issues..)

I recently began looking for SaaS/software sales jobs but am wondering if there is any value in getting a business or marketing degree. I read that Marketing degrees are pretty useless due to how rapidly marketing strategies evolve compared to how old the information in university marketing programs are.
Someone once told me if I wanted to learn business, I should get into Sales. With that said, does it make sense to get a business degree when I already have 5 years of Sales experience? If I get a business degree, it'll realistically enable me to get a slightly higher salary.. which I could gain eventually by just sticking with Sales and performing well. 

Also, from my experience having connections is significantly more valuable than having a degree, so does it even make sense to get a degree when I can leverage my connections to get a decent paying SaaS/software sales job? Will my salary hit a cap eventually without a degree? 

I have always felt inferior because I don't have a degree, so is that alone enough of a reason to get one? - just to prove to myself that I can do it, and be more confident in my answer whenever people ask me, ""where did you go to school?"", so I don't have to say, ""I didn't go to school...""

32,I am currently on winter break from college and I’m down staying with my parents. My parents only have one TV and I am wanting to play some Xbox. so where can I rent a tv for exactly one month? Does Aaron’s or any other rent a center allow just a one month rental? Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you!,19Dec2017,1

34,My girlfriend of several years is a very sensitive person.  It doesn't take much to make her cry.  If someone is too critical of her she lets things effect her much too easily in my opinion.  I often will be her shoulder to cry on but there are absolutely times that I try to nicely tell her not to let things impact her so easily.  I feel that in order to help her grow I can't coddle her all the time but if I tell her something like that it will make her significantly more upset and say she just wanted to vent to me and that she didnt want me to lecture her on how to handle a situation.  For example she was delivering food and the person she delivered food to wanted all thier change back and she had everything but the $1.30 to give back.  Instead of just being fine with that and tipping her that amount on a 28.70 order she made her take it back to go get proper change.  She then called the store to cancel.  My girlfriend called me balling about how the lady made her feel stupid and I told her that although that lady was a bitch just to let it go.  That in turn made her much more upset.   I just want to know from an outside perspective if I am being a dick or being reasonable.  It's hard to tell from my perspective because I believe she needs to start to grow up about somethings but I'm not sure if I'm not being sensitive enough.  ,19Dec2017,4
35,"I work in a small department of 20 people. We did a Secret Santa this year and...I never got a gift. I'm trying not to be petty about this, but I have to admit it I was surprised by how much I was hurt. It just feels like I was overlooked. So I'm wondering if it's worth it to go to the woman who organized the whole thing and ask her who my Secret Santa was, but I also feel embarrassed by the prospect of having to explain why I want to know. In the end I don't really want some random $20 gift, I'd just like some closure with my hurt feelings. Thoughts on how to approach this or just let it go?",19Dec2017,65

38,"Hello,

I'm a 27 yo man. Iwas on college for 8 years. Where I studied u need to finish a bs in science and technology, than u are able to study more 2 years to finish the main course (in my case it was engineering).

So, in the begining I failed lots of subjects, I was not on the level to do. But then I started have good grades and earned money for an exchange program in europe, where I lived for 14 months.

Coming back I was studying and started to work at the same time, but with months I just saw I didnt like at all what I was doing, and changed to a course I really like. It went well and I was one of the best students of my uni in this course.

So I finally conclude th bs science and technology and had 5 subjects and 2 stage (like and interniship) to conclude this main course yet.

But 2 months ago I had a hard hyperthyrodism and became very debilitated, so I returned to my parents house hundreds of miles away. I even had memory problems that now I'm recovering.

I dont want to go back again, because sadly my main course has 0 career market in my country, in other words, it has no future and no jobs.

I planned very precisely open an ecommerce for 2 months, but now I having constantly a feeling that it will not work out.
I sold my car and have now like USD 5k to invest in whatever I want.

And I feeling quite sad and desmotivated that almost all my friends are doing well and earning a good money. No, Im not comparing, what I want to say is that I want to be on that patamar too but now I cant see and cant feel I will reach it, and finally wasted my entire life and the time wont come back.

EDIT: I forgot to say my country is in recession for 2 years, jobs are very rare and also I dont now what kind o jobs would fit to me and I would be able to do.

45,"What should I do? I've lost focus lately.

I struggle with alcohol and substance abuse. In 2017 I've tried going to rehab to stop, but I keep relapsing every couple of months. I just relapsed again after 3 months sober and this is my third relapse in 2017. I've had close encounters with death and madness. 

I relapsed 2 weeks ago and 2 days ago had another close encounter with death and madness. I didn't die and the psychotic symptoms disappeared after lots of hours.

When I was convinced I was going to die or turning crazy, all I thought about was about wanting another chance or how I want to improve in live and stop suffering. I just don't know how to sustain that ""motivation"", after a month or two depression consumes me again and I'm back to being depressed and wanting to die, and when I'm convinced that I want to die I go back to using to live ""my last days to the fullest"", then I fuck up, get scared into sobriety, the cycle never ends.

I thought about stopping right now instead of waiting for me to fuck up even more, but I just feel confused, I know that staying sober is the good thing to do, but I feel like things won't improve, I'll keep having the same shitty job and the bad things I can't change will stay the same.

53,"I am currently a 23 y/o male residing in Alberta, Canada. Having recently graduated from college, I received an education that has allowed me to work in the oil and gas sector this past year. I thought I had everything planned out... 

As of late, I have never felt more lost and confused about the direction my life was heading in. My occupation consumes the majority of my time as I have been working every single day away from home for the last month and a half. This makes it very difficult to have any type of social life as I only have a couple days off and then I'm out again for a month or so and is starting to take a toll on me. 

My days are spent reflecting on my current situation and the endless thought just being another ""number"" working for the energy giants. I feel no fulfillment with the career I have dedicated my energy, time, and money into. I have thought about going back to school to become a teacher so that I can have a more rewarding and fulfilling career where I can impact and make a difference in someone's life. 

The only problem is that my parents are aging and have virtually worked for minimum wage their entire lives with absolutely no savings and barely making ends meet. They escaped a war-torn country to provide a future for me and I feel like I am ""stuck"". 

I would love nothing more than to go back to school and become a teacher, but doing so I would sacrifice my financial stability and with no job guaranteed when I graduate. I just feel hopeless and stuck in my current situation and as days go on I feel more and more depressed.

58,"Hopefully this doesn't sound arrogant, that's not how I intend it.

On one perspective, I'm very successful, as far as what people view success as, economically at least.

But, I have had almost no motivation for 3 years. I'm in my 40's. I get together once in a while with my friends. I have a life. But, most days are the same, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.

Once I've done something successfully, I tend to lose interest in it.

Here are some examples. 

When I was in my 20's I did fitness contests. But, after being sucessful at that, I lost interest in it and I don't take all that great care of myself anymore.

I've had relationships with wonderful and great woman, many of whom were, and still are, complete knockouts but also very intelligent and successful. 

In my professional life, I didn't care about it after being successful at it so I quit my career and somehow ended up an executive of a small firm.

I've grown the firm almost 1,000% in the past few years. But, I don't really work much. 

In November I mostly just sat in my office chair staring at nothing. I looked at my hours today and I worked a total of 30 hours in November, the rest of that time I did nothing and somehow I still managed to make $26k. That's 1/3rd of what I used to make in an entire year working my ass off.

So, I have not seriously dated in 3 years. I come home and don't do a lot. I sit and think about pointless stuff.

It's almost like I've been depressed for 3 years, except I'm not sad, I just don't do anything. Literally, 3 years have gone by and if I didn't know better, it's only been a day. I just go through the motions. I have rooms in my house I haven't touched in years, they are the same they were years ago. Of course, I clean and dust, but if one of my ex-girlfriends came back to visit and say hi, the room would look the same as the day she left. I'm a guy, maybe that part is normal.

I'm not lonely either. I think I've become aromantic. It's almost like things aren't even real. It's almost like anything I decide to do will happen, but the problem is, I just haven't cared that much to even desire something.

I'm well know where I live. I donate a fair amount of money, which gets me invited to events where people come up and kiss my @## all the time. It's just boring.

What is the explaination for this? Is it possible to be depressed but not feel sad or lonely? It's kind of like ""Well, I've done that, now what?"".

I definitely don't like doing things over and over again. The irony is, for 3 years every day has been the same to me.

The other thing is, nothing I have was ever something I really put value in. I'm almost a millionair, not on paper, back cash in the bank. I have no debt, everything is paid off. But, I've never had a desire to be rich. However, I've been poor and I definitely don't want to be poor again, comfortable is good enough.

I've never cared about materialistic things. But, I have nice things now, just because I can.

I don't understand why I'm doing so well without putting any effort into things and I also don't understand why every day is just a repeat of the last.

I used to go to the gym every day, look forward to going on a date, love Christmas shopping, buying thoughtful gifts, volunteering, etc.

When my last relationship ended a few years ago, I didn't do anything. I just said goodbye and wished her well. I didn't get upset, I just understood she wasn't getting anything out of our relationship and was looking for that Disney fairytale.

I'm like that old guy who says ""If you've seen one you've seen them all"".

Is this some type of depression that does not feel like depression?

60,"My grandfather died many years ago (approximately 17) and my grandmother was left with a sizable chunk of cash to see her through the years. With all of the traveling that she has done she has run out and now only has what she gets each month, about $2200. It is enough for her bills and such, but she has always been generous and she continues to be even though she no longer has the money to go on the way she has been. (Example is she took my aunt to a town several hours away for three days. She paid for the hotel/meals and one meal out with her other child/grandchildren that cost at least $200.)  


Several years ago I set up automatic bill payments for her. She now runs out of money before all her bills can be paid. For the last three months at least she has bounced at least one bill, usually her credit card payment. I no longer feel that it is a good idea to have automatic payment because each time something bounces she is charged a fee of $40. My plan is to have a copy of her bills emailed to me so that I can pay them out of her chequing account. In order to be able to do that I would need to be co-owner of that account. My fear is that if she goes overboard on her spending that I would be on the hook for those payments and I do not, in any way, have the money to cover that.  

I am supposed to meet up with her tomorrow and get a start on this. (She bounced her credit card payment this month and she has at least six cheques she wrote for Christmas that are likely to be cashed before her money is deposited.) After thinking on the issue for awhile I have decided to broach the issue of an allowance with her. ""Grandmother, I'm willing to have a copy of your bills emailed to me and to pay them monthly as they are due. If I am going to do this I need you to agree to only use your credit card for gas and to limit your monthly spending to $200.""  

I'm sure some of you are going to suggest that I have one of her children take over this but I just don't see that going over well. My uncle lives four hours away, my grandmother refuses to put this burden on my dad (the only child still working) and my aunt knows of my grandmothers financial issues and yet still thought a trip to another town was a good idea, so I feel that this is on me. However if she does not agree to an allowance then I am willing to step back and let things fall where they may.  However I am still looking for advice on this issue. I don't know if my way about this is the best and I'm sure other people have experience dealing with elderly care. Does anyone have any other ideas on how to go about paying her bills? Does anyone have an idea on how to broach the subject of an allowance? I'm about ready to pull my hair out.",19Dec2017,1

I've been accepted into each school, the tuition cost is roughly the same, but there are some minor/major difference, depending how you look at it, which is why I'm wondering if these even matter. 

Option 1- Elizabethtown College: offers an accelerated program where each class is five weeks long. Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) accreditation 

Option 2- Saint Joseph's university: traditional program, with the option to take courses that are 8 weeks long, for certain classes.  Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB) accreditation.

Options 3- Penn State- traditional program with Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB) accreditation 


So here is my dilemma. I want to finish my classes as soon as possible, but I also want to get a good education from a good school, with a good name/accreditation. These are all great schools, but are very different in what they offer. The accelerated program offered by ETOWN would enable me to complete more classes per year, while only taking one class at a time. However, it's not AACSB accredited, which is the bees knees of business school accreditations. SJU and PSU are traditional programs, so it would take longer to complete all my classes (20 left) but they both have AACSB accreditation.

So, does it really matter that ETOWN doesn't have the AACSB accreditation? Or, do employers actually care what college you received your degree from? Are they on top of what school has what accreditation?",19Dec2017,1

82,"I'm 17 and pretty down in the dumps. It just seems like everything ends up going wrong for me. I try to be positive and upbeat about life but I can't when stuff keeps going wrong. My family is pretty poor and I currently have a job but it pays pretty much nothing as I'm on-call and rarely get called in to work so I barely make any money. My mom doesn't make much. My brother makes a good amount but spends it on frivolous stuff. Dad is out of picture and doesn't pay child support much.

I have $500 saved that I plan on using towards a car when I get my driver's license in 2 months (IF I pass the test) and family keeps asking to borrow $20 here and there yet don't pay it back. I only make like $50 or so a week at my job and those $20s add up if they ask often. Then when I say no, they get all pissy and call me selfish for wanting to save MY hard earned money.

Money isn't the only thing I'm down about. It's body image too. I used to be a severely anorexic guy who was very conscious about his weight but now I'm trying my hardest to build up. I'm taking protein, eating more, working out daily, etc. but it just doesn't seem to be working. I'm still bony and since I'm eating more, it looks as though I'm getting skinny-fat which is terrifying so I'm thinking of going back to fasting. I've also been drinking a lot because it makes me feel good and gets my mind off stuff when I'm drunk.

What's good is I have a relationship of almost 2 years with someone who cares very deeply for me. However sometimes I feel like he is either not attracted to me or just wishes I had a better body cause he often comments on guys who have 6 pack abs or big muscles, even though he says he is happy with my body I feel that is just to make me feel good about myself.

Back to money issues, I still owe money for my high school because I attended a private high school and didn't pay off the tuition. If I don't pay that off then I cannot get my diploma which means I will be unable to attend college and follow my career dreams.

I look for a better job that pays more, go on interviews, and never hear back. It's so frustrating and discouraging because it makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. I guess I'm just losing sense of direction. I don't know what to do or where to go. I just feel lost and trapped in a poor household forever.

Little background - for as long as I can remember I’ve had a problem with lying. Mostly because I don’t like when people view me as below them or are angry or etc. I know dumb. My exe and I had a falling out about two months ago because he finally figured out and find out all the lies. We decided to make it work but I couldn’t lie to him anymore. I got this job and didn’t tell them about something on my background, I worked there for a month and they came across something on it so they gave me the option to quit. That was Thursday it’s now Monday. Friday I had an interview so told my boyfriend I just didn’t have to go to work. Then today I went into my old job and tried to talk to them and see if I could get my job back. They just sent me home. So I texted my boyfriend and said oh it was slow they just sent me home. I truly was anticipating when he got home from work to tell him, I was embarrassed, ashamed, and felt like a loser. I didn’t want him to be disappointed in me. I was looking for a job and hoping something would come up really fast.  He ended up calling my work for me and they told me I didn’t work there anymore. So he called me and then broke up with me and is now kicking me out because I lied. I apologized and admitted I was wrong. I really love him and idk what else I can do. I understand I’ll probably get people being harsh but I need advice. I really love this guy ",19Dec2017,1
84,"Hi!
This will probably be long, bare with me.
I’m a 21 F working about 25-35 hours a week making $9.50. I pay all of my bills myself, (health ins, phone, car ins, car payment, etc) so I have no help from my parents really. I made a ton of financial mistakes at the age of 18 which has led me into quiet a bit of debt with credit cards. I truly think I have a spending problem because I find myself buying things because it gives me a rush or self-satisfaction.

I’m moving in 8 months to transfer colleges in a city about 2.5 hours away, aka I need to save my money like no tomorrow. I’m extremely worried about this.
A list of expenses as follows-
Health insurance- $120 a month
Phone- $100 a month
Credit card payments- about $70 a month
Car payment- $220 a month
Car insurance- $150 a month
This does not include gas, food, etc.
I can’t get a second job because I’m currently enrolled full-time with school and my other work is spontaneous with hours.
If you have ANY money management advice at all, tips, tricks, etc. I would be super grateful.
I hate being young and dumb!!",19Dec2017,1
86,"Hi Reddit friends! I have a few questions. First, I consider myself to be pretty self-aware. I know what my issues and misgivings are, and I know how they affect me. I tend to use that awareness proactively, and take steps to better myself when these issues arise. For that reason, I’ve never thought I “needed” therapy if I already know what’s wrong with me. Most of my issues are abandonment/rejection related from my mom leaving when I was 10. Also, my ex boyfriend of 5 years passed away recently, and I think that rocked my world for a while, but I think I’m healing. 

So how do I figure out if I am managing my issues effectively or would benefit from therapy? Obviously therapy is expensive and I don’t want to waste money. Beyond that, if I do decide to go, how do I pick one!? Google hasn’t been super helpful, so i figured reddit would be the key. I’m also debating a counselor, therapist, or psychologist and what their differences are. 

TL;DR: I need help figuring out if I need therapy, and if I do, how do I pick one? ",19Dec2017,1
87,"I was having a going away party and had 4 friends over for some burgers, good times, and we had a few drinks (with adult supervision and guardian permission of course. Gotta stay legal). 

My family also just hired an Au Pair from Italy. She was pretty, young, funny, and fun to be around. So shit why not invite her too?

Throughout the night she kept eye balling me, taking pictures, and this made all the guys react with “bro you gotta smash”. Of course I don’t want to smash my Au Pair but of course I’m also hormonal as fuck. So I brushed the comments off and kept having fun. I was drunk but in no way shit faced. Meanwhile the Au Pair is used to throwing down drinks. She’s drunk, not shit faced. 

Around 2:30AM everyone is asleep. Except for me and Italian Au Pair. I gave her a pair of shorts and a shirt to sleep in from my room. She kept laughing and saying “I’m your nanny. I’m your nanny.” When in reality she isn’t paid for me at all, just my two younger siblings. I take care of myself, she just makes extra dinner for the few nights I’m home. 

I wasn’t really catching what she putting down, so I kept saying “what are you talking about no you’re not. Take the clothes and go to bed.” 

We get ready for bed and in passing I say “alright well goodnight! Thanks for coming!” And give a hug goodnight (we’re a touchy family). She kinda hangs on me, and kisses my cheek, neck, with little soft bites in between. 

Then my brain turns off and my penis rises to chain of command. 

I reciprocated back, we stumble into my bedroom, she closes the door, and we make out. Next thing I know, she’s taking her shirt off and mine too. It was pretty cool, I wasn’t exactly intending on going further. She gets up and pushes me back, kisses my chest and stomach, and pulls my boxers down with her teeth. I’m now going from “shit I shouldn’t be doing this” to “fuck yeah. I’m doing it for every teen that couldn’t do this with their hot Au Pair!”. 

A few minutes go by and I’m laying on top of her and she begins to pull my dick out. I hesitate and say “woah woah are you sure you’re okay with this?” At least 5 times and she says yes each time. Even shows me that she’s on birth control and everything. I then took one small stroke for myself, and one giant stroke for every Au-Pair fantasy that couldn’t be achieved.

We do a few positions, I relish my victory and stand proud for every lost fantasy and ultimately it felt like we both had a good time. She asks me for a glass of water, and we get dressed. During this time I probably said about 5 times “are you ok with this? This stays between you and me ok?” She agrees and says it’s all good.

The next morning I spoke to her briefly about what she was watching on the tv, she made a few jokes about me to my friends, and everything seemed pretty alright.

However, I now have a crazy amount of anxiety that she will crack and say something, or make some crazy accusation that I raped her. With all of this swirling around my head, I was so focused on what COULD happen, that I didn’t notice my flat tire and I am now sitting on the side of the highway, late to work, waiting for a tow truck to take my car, which now has a fucked up rim. 

TL;DR - Fucked my Au Pair, now have anxiety about hypotheticals. Fucked my car rims too. Now not sure what will happen.",19Dec2017,1

I know she thinks I’m good looking, because a friend told me a while back. I’ve Snapchatted her a few times, but never really anything very serious. We say hi when passing each other at school, but nothing past that. However, about a week ago, she posts an IG from a dance which was the day before she posted it, in which she and her friend are kissing me on the cheek. She deleted the post 3-4 days after. I just noticed, and a few hours ago I sent her a Snapchat photo saying “You deleted the picture 🤔?” Which she screenshotted.

92,"I realize my parents don't have any advice in this new country's culture to guide me somewhat to be a functioning adult. I've grown past their advice and am looking at the unknown with no guide.


A few things I have trouble with:

1. Being in a stalemate with new people.. unable to communicate with different people without offending their intellect,  touching on some jealousy. I always see a talk good about people, but I assume I actually end up patronizing/revealing their insecurities to them. And by not trying to ruin their day I distance myself from talking to them. Which makes me an asshole who doesn't talk. I always rush to finish conversations.

I think I lack interest in most people.. I find myself really trying to remedy this since if you talk to someone about something they into they tell you some genuinely interesting shit, most small talk is boring to me. From there I can get some common interest. In my culture people don't really do small talk. 

-----------------------

2. I also have trouble dealing with people that send vibes because they feel they are more foreign when compared to me.. a more western version of themselves.Which I think is bullshit to think.. 

 Also being able to grow up in a decent house and having been exposed to really strong beliefs in success.. I have a hard time for people to not judge me. I am trying to lessen that by being more open to people and giving them more white lies and support.. Again these things are not part of my culture.. it is almost seen as making them weak...

--------------

tldr: 1. I end up offending people because I talk too honestly and reveal peoples insecurities. Like I end up making them feel dumb..  I tend to rush conversations.


2. I have a hard time dealing with peoples jealous vibes and judging my will to want to be successful. Like I probably have to spin this in a way to not make it that I let give little advice/compliments here and there that makes them better. ",19Dec2017,2

My girlfriend of a few months I have recently found out she has been getting Collector calls from debt collectors who she has taken out money from, I have asked her personally how much money she owes. I willing know she has a car loan of about 45,000 as well as she told me she owes about 10,000 or more to the Money-marts/loan agencies I am very very concerned for her. She takes care of her parents her dad is a Quadriplegic and her Mother needs her own personal care and she helps out with bills because either of them work. I listened to the voice mails and I was extremely scared because they said verbally if she does not call them back they will have to make a decision on what she owes they were not nice about it either. What proper steps can she take in order to figure all of this out and get out of this rutt, I will also add she has been doing this the past 6 years because she works a seasonal job and then has to collect E.I, on a side note she has found a job but does not start untill December 27th where she can slowly start paying her way out of this.
Any advice help would be very appreciated.

97,"I have a friend from a young age who is becoming a bum. We’re both 19, he’s still in high school because he was held back a year when we were younger. He’s always been the stereotypical rebel kid growing up, chewing tabacco since he was 12, starting cigarettes probably at 14. Through the dumb shit he did growing up, he still seemed like he had his life on track. We have a factory near us that one can make a career out of with just a high school diploma and it was always known that that was where he’d end up. Now, my other friends and I worry he won’t graduate high school. 

We were probably 16 when he first started smoking weed. I had no problem with this, I’ve been a believer that weed isn’t bad for a person in moderation. I also felt that it was just a phase for him because he’s always gotta do the rebellious things. Turns out it wasn’t a phase and by the time we were 18, he was the stereotypical stoner. 

I first became concerned about his future when I was a senior in high school and he decided to move out of the country and in to town to go live with his sister and her boyfriend. The boyfriend was a big pothead, but he had his life on track. Because he had his life on track, he wasn’t home much, but still had his bongs, pipes, etc. laying around for my friend to use. This house was the hang out spot for all the weed smokers even if the owner wasn’t home, so it wasn’t a good environment for my friend to be in. To add on to this, his sister let’s him mooch off of her for some reason and he hasn’t had to have a job either. Eventually he made the decision to move back with his parents and things were good for the rest of the year.

Fast forward a bit, and he started experiment with some harder drugs. Even though he was back with his parents, it didn’t stop him from doing the things he used to do. From what I know, he’s done weed, acid, molly, and now his big thing is coke. He’s very easily influenced by music, movies, and tv where they talk about these drugs so he seems to think they’re ok. He screwed up and got pulled over and got a weed possession charge and a ticket for no drivers license (I have absolutely no idea why he thinks he doesn’t need one). He got off very easy, but I wish he wouldn’t have because he’s really screwing up now. He decided to move in with his sister and her new boyfriend. They let him mooch off of them and it’s the craziest thing, I’ve never seen a couple give so much money and food to someone who has the option to still live with his parents and get taken care of there. He gets way more freedom not living with his parents, even though he had an insane amount of freedom already with his parents. 

Now as I return home from my first semester of college, I’m told he decided to quit going to school one day. He hasn’t been to school in two weeks even though a bunch of us pressure him to go. He keeps saying he’s going back, but makes up a bullshit reason each day for why he didn’t go. I’ve hung out with him some lately and he’s not the same, he’s like a burnt out druggie and not the crazy redneck kid I grew up with. He needs to graduate high school or else he’ll be a bum the rest of his life. He’s so easily influenced by the stupid shit he sees on the internet or tv, that I’m scared he’s gonna think he needs to try meth or heroin someday. I’m not the only one concerned for him, others are too, but none of us are doing a thing about it other then sending him a Snapchat saying go to school. It doesn’t help either that people tell him “I think you need to get your act together and finish high school, but ultimately it’s your decision and I don’t need to tell you what to do.” As a friend, I truly hope he gets busted for doing something stupid so he can wake up and realize that he’s being a dumbass. I’m studying abroad next semester and will have no opportunity to keep my eye on him and need to do something quick to make sure he gets on track.

She's extremely short, she's a senior in High School, she doesn't have any ideas for a career or what she's going to do in life, she doesn't have a license and relies on her parents to drive her to and from work, and in general interacting with her just feels like I'm talking to a middle schooler.

111,"Hi there, 
I've worked in a retail store through university for 3.5 years and given it my all. I'm not a slacker and despite those around me being younger and not having developed a good work ethic I still do more than my share. In the last year I have had 7 managers as the company I work for notoriously treats staff poorly. I've just had enough of laws being broken and being told  to follow ""rules"" that are directly against fair work laws in Australia. Or ignore laws designed to protect employees. 

Anyway I've tried to just keep my head down and get on with the job but my most recent boss is a piece of work. He has harassed multiple people into quitting with made up things like ""you can't have a second casual job, you'll have to quit"" or ""due to you being a student and not wanting to become a manager I am going to stop giving you hours"". Despite me telling my young coworkers that this is not on they get too upset and quit. I have personally been on the receiving end of his lies but have just kept on with the job in the hope that he would leave soon. 

But in the last two weeks his behavior has become intolerable. He has asked about my personal lie incessantly despite my objections and going to HR. He has asked if I am ""a full lesbian or just bi"", he has asked if I have a boyfriend 6+ times in two days, how come I don't have a boyfriend, and what my relationship with my family is like.

His is also working me to death because I do more than the younger employees. He had me doing all the stock despite me repeatedly stating I have a back injury and just need a couple days to rest. 

So today I have decided that I want to leave. Now I could just quit but I have bills to pay and don't qualify for student assistance again until mid 2018. Therefore if I get fired I can go immediately onto unemployment payments. Which I would of course prefer. 

I am not willing to do anything illegal like steal, verbally abuse anyone etc but I just want to know if anyone has any suggestions about things I could do to get fired? 

TLDR: poor student with harassing boss who needs to know what to do to get fired rather than quit, so I can receive unemployment. ",19Dec2017,1

Possible trigger warning. 

For reference, we are both 21. 

So my boyfriend just revealed a really big secret to me. He said that at age 12, he molested 2 of his female cousins, who were 5 and 6. He said that he rubbed their legs and kissed one of them, as well as asking them to pull down their pants as part of a ‘game’, but it didn’t go farther than that. Later on he admitted that he touched the vagina of one of the girls, but she seemed so uncomfortable that he stopped. He told me he feels guilty and horrible and he’s never told anyone before me. He also said he was suicidal over it and hasn’t had a happy day in 9 years since. 

I’m in shock. I don’t know what to do. I told him he needs to see a therapist or I won’t stay with him, and he agreed. 

I know this kind of exploration isn’t normal because of the age gap. He said when he was 6-7, him and a cousin of the same age would make out and pretend to have sex. I think maybe that messed him up? I just don’t know. 

I found out a few years ago that when my Dad was a kid, his younger brothers accused him of molesting/raping them. Now I’m scared that there’s something wrong with me. It can’t be a coincidence that my boyfriend did the same thing. 

Please...any advice will help. 

**TL;DR** my boyfriend molested his younger cousins when he was a child. I don’t know if this makes him a horrible person or wht I should do. 

Eta: he swears up and down that he was never molested. He blamed it on selfishness and stress (an older cousin of his was suicidal, and my boyfriend was the only one who knew). ",19Dec2017,4

120,"Hey everyone, I’m coming to you all to ask if I’m a bad person. 
I’ve been friends with a girl for almost two years, and all in all, it’s been great.  She’s really nice, supportive as a friend,  and we have a lot in common. The two of us haves been talking/texting/Snapchatting for a long time and hang out at least once a week when we are at school. The problem is, I  am not sexually attracted to her and I don’t know why. She is not “ugly” by any means, but she also is not a 10/10(who is Lol).  More and more recently she has been dropping large hints that she is into me, but i just cant reciprocate the feeling. I really enjoy her friendship but i just do not see her in that way. 
Is it wrong for me to feel that way? Emotionally, i feel like she is my best friend and that i can talk to her about anything. But physically, there’s nothing there, on my side at least. 
I hate myself for thinking like this because i feel shallow, but in the end, if you’re  not physically attracted to someone do you think it could work? 
Will the attraction grow as the relationship progresses? Or will The attraction slowly fade because it wasn’t immediate? 
Am i being too judgmental ? 

TLDR: I’m emotionally attracted to my long time friend, however i do not find her physically attractive and i feel like a god damn shithead because of how judgmental i feel im being. But i just do not see her like that. ",19Dec2017,1
121,"So I applied to work seasonally for Yellowstone National Park, because the place is amazing, and I really do enjoy cleaning and making a place look nice.  
It seems like the perfect fit.

Except, now I have a similar job opportunity much closer to home. This makes it easier on me and my family (and my finances, regarding living/travel expenses).

I *literally* just set a date for a phone interview with Yellowstone this morning, before I got word of the work closer to home.

I told them I was still very interested.... and now this.

122,"So essentially my parents got a divorce early 2011, due to my mother having an affair with a co-worker. They split up mutually and my dad is doing fine. However my mother and the co-worker are have been dating since, and there are several issues. 

The first issue is the boyfriend can be incredibly volatile under certain conditions. Believe me, he really is a nice and sincere guy, however when he is drunk, he is mean and unreasonable. He is also stubborn and can get really defensive really fast if you either criticize him, or criticize his kids or how he raises them. (He had 3 children before he got together with my mum.)  There has zero physical abuse, and on very rare occasions he has insulted her. And on those occasions, as soon as he is sober, he tries to break up with her, claiming he isn't good enough for her. 

The second issue is my mum. She gets so lonely if she is by herself for more then a day. Every time the boyfriend has tried to break up, she always convinces him to stay. There was a point a while back where they said if they have one more big argument, then they would break up. One big argument later, they are still together. They have had several arguments since, and still no break up. She never mentioned it to me again and i've never confronted her about it.

The third issue is that the boyfriend recently moved in with my mum this year. He sold his house and everything, making a breakup difficult to happen. 

I'm ultimately just asking what i should do. The relationship is good most of the time, but the arguments are by no means rare, usually happening once a month or sometimes even bi-weekly. Should I confront my mother about the 'one more argument and we're done' situation? Should i just let them be? Maybe even talk to the boyfriend about it. 

Me and my mother have completely opposite personalities. She offered me a camping trip to the batch the boyfriend owns and when I refused, she got offended and angry. She later admittes she thought I would be lonely home alone. Me being an introvert, I was completely fine. The point I'm trying to make is that its hard for me and my mother to relate on an emotional level. So telling her how I feel about the relationship would be difficult.

124,"So my aunt has been living with my mom for the past month or so because after moving to a new city she lost her job as a result of her not showing up for shifts due to her drinking. Within the first few days or so of her living here she nearly drank herself to death (had a .51 BAC and had to be hospitalized for a few days). 


After that she was sober for while, but for the past week it has gotten very bad. It's gotten to the point where she cannot be left alone, because whenever she's left alone she will Uber to the liquor store to buy vodka. But with my mom's, her boyfriend's and my schedules it's hard to make sure that someone is watching her at all times. She often gets so drunk that she will pass out on the floor, and half of the time she can barely speak in full sentences. She works 2 jobs serving at restaurants, but if she continues missing shifts she will likely be fired. She also has 2 preteen kids who have been with their paternal grandmother as this has been happening. 


I grew up surrounded by alcoholics, but this is bar none the worst case I have ever seen. If this situation doesn't change I am very confident that she will end up killing herself eventually. Not only is this a terrible situation for her, but having to act as her babysitter puts a lot of strain on me and especially my mom. The problem is that I'm not exactly sure what route to take from here. She's already racked up bills from being hospitalized, she spends much of the money she makes on alcohol, and is in danger of losing her job. She is uninsured, and neither me nor my mom are financially secure enough at this point in time to foot the bill for rehab. Any advice at all would be awesome.

She is half navajo, divorced, and lives in Utah if that's relevant at all.

I'm in college. I go to parties decently often, I talk to girls, I have friends that I hang out with... But in the end, I still wake up and go to bed feeling kinda lonely. I feel like I don't have that one person or group that I can really rely on. Sometimes in the back of my head I feel like my friends don't really respect me as I am (I'm the guy who often makes jokes at his own expense, makes arrogant/ironic jokes like ""I'm super pretentious"" but in a self deprecation sorta way... if that makes sense) and I sometimes feel like that ""third guy"" in a group of two, the guy who tags along, even though I have been friends with these people for years. I haven't had a girlfriend since me and my ex broke up right before leaving for school, and though I have had many opportunities to start something (I'm kinda attractive, but awkward ish) it never really works out and fizzles out after a few weeks. I don't know if its me, how I act, or just life. I'm almost half way through college, and I already kinda feel the weeks slipping by. I know I have it great as it is, my parents are proud of me, I have friends, I don't have anything actively going wrong right now... yet I still don't feel complete and satisfied.

133,"This has been happening the past two days - never really happened before. No one outside of my parents have said that I'm ""too proud"". I don't think I'm a proud person, but maybe I'm wrong...I need some advice, reddit. :(

What has been happening the past two days is that, apparently my ""attitude"" is ""too proud"" and I ""don't show respect"" to my parents. I will admit that when they start yelling at me I start yelling back, or acting as if I don't care what they think. They've called me ""cold-hearted"" before, because of that. I know it's a problem I have, but it's really hard to stop myself from freezing my emotions up when arguments start getting heated. Maybe it's a defense mechanism, to prevent myself from getting hurt. Either way, by freezing my heart up, I tend to say or do hurtful things, but I don't know how to stop.  

I'm not sure that description helps, so I will add an example:

&gt; Parents are attempting to help me edit an essay. However, they are getting frustrated because (imo) they are not being very clear on what they want me to change. They tell me to change something, I say, ""Why?"" and they get mad or frustrated that I'm asking why ""in a oh-so-proud way, like I'm better than them"". Maybe I am doing this in my attitude, but that wasn't my intention. 

&gt; Parents: You act so high and mighty, it makes me not want to help you! 

&gt; Me: (by this time, I'm getting angry because they've been repeatedly telling me I'm too proud and my attitude is shit) Well then you don't need to help me. 

&gt; Parents: See! This is what you always do, you're too proud for your own good, if you had this kind of attitude to your professor he'd kick you out right away!

&gt; Me: (irritated because I've never talked back to anyone outside of my family) Yeah right, I'd never talk like that to my professor. No one outside of you two have called me proud before, that's just wrong. 

&gt; Parents: (screaming) Then why, when your parents are probably the people who love you the most, why do you treat us with such disrespect!! You DESPISE us!! 

So therein lies the question. Why do I treat my parents ""worse"" than people outside of family? How do I stop from doing this? At the time, I felt almost physically sick to even think about ""treating them the way I would treat people who are not my family"". I feel like I will lose something if I start treating them like I treat my professor. But if it's more respectful, why can't I do it? Am I really too prideful, like they said, and if so, how do I change? ",19Dec2017,5
134,"College has been miserable for me because I was extremely unhealthy for my first few years. I have very severe anxiety and depression that were not being treated, I was sexually assaulted my first semester of college, and I was actively abusing alcohol from fall 2015 (beginning of my sophomore year) until I got sober very recently.
I’ve been skating by with no real idea of what I want to do, withdrawing from tons of classes each semester, I have so many Ws on my transcript it’s almost hard to look at. If I take 21 (!!!) hours this spring (which I’m currently registered for) and 16 hours this summer, I can graduate in August with a degree in History. Here’s the thing - I don’t want to fucking do anything with History. I don’t care about this subject or this degree. It doesn’t matter to me.
I figured out that I really want to pursue a career in Social Work. I could do this and graduate in the fall of 2019, bringing my college career to five and a half years (or really five, if you consider the fact that I medically withdrew from my first semester after being sexually assaulted). I’m really fucking torn on what to do. I basically feel like if I apply now to grad schools, I won’t get in any way, so what’s the point?

136,"A little context, I worked a warehouse job and the manager never liked me from day one, it was painfully obvious he had a problem with me for no good reason. Fine, whatever these things happen.

I was always a hard worker and always followed the rules to the letter. I had a verbal disagreement with someone that turned a little physical. No punches were thrown, no one actually got hurt. I quickly realised that what I did was stupid, however, it got reported and I got suspended and ultimately fired. Literally every person I've spoken to about it has said that it was a bit harsh being fired for what amounted to a little pushing. (I get that that is a line that shouldn't be crossed but sometimes the verbal abuse is too much)

The person that made this decision was the aforementioned manager, who has since been sacked for bullying and favouritism (not surprised at all).

Ever since I can remember they always fought, my Dad used to come out of their room with bloody nose or face from her clawing him. My Mom is a very VERY violent bipolar sociopath. She lies constantly. I'm never really sure what's the truth and what's bullshit. I've never known her to keep her word, be responsible, be supportive, or to be selfless. She is a monster. I love her, but she is a monster. 

It's been about 12-13 years since my parents divorce and it was VERY messy. My Mom had spent a lot of time trying to use us as weapons against my Dad. I wasn't aware cause I was so young but it's clear to me now as an adult that she was always manipulative. (yeah so side note, I have only JUST started talking to my Mom again since my wedding day 2 years ago)

My sister has kids of her own now, and big brother has 2 kids and is flying from out of state for Christmas. It's a lot of work to transport all those kids back and forth from house A to B because my parents don't want each other at each others' homes and we kids have respected that. But now we all have homes and family's of our own and believe that we SHOULD be able to have a family get-together with everyone now. They've been in the same room several times in the last few years for birthday parties and everything has been fine. 

So my sister says ""okay lets have one big family christmas and be normal people for once"" and i'm like ""fuckn A. lets do this"".

My Dad says he's okay with it as long as it's at a neutral place, my sister volunteered to host, everyone was OKAY. Even my Dad's new wife (who is actually terrified of my mom &gt;_&gt;) was okay with it. 

So here we are a week from Christmas and my Mom tells my sister that my Dad raped her when they were married and she refuses to be in the same room as him. 

My Mother has a long history of bullshit. She has zero morals or ethics beyond if the ends justify the means, it's OK. She doesn't care that her lies have hurt her children, and are now putting a very serious accusation on the table. 

My Dad was an angry man when he was with her. He did punch walls. He did yell. I never saw him lay a finger on her. Not once. I've only seen him practice restraint. Kids pick up on that shit. We knew what was going on. He never hit her, he never raped her. She is full of shit. 

SO.


Now we're down to this. What do we do? I don't care that she's not coming to Christmas, it'll be less drama, and the kids deserve a happy Christmas away from our psychotic past. 

My Mom is a pathological liar. When you call her out on her bullshit she will manipulate the situation or she will shut down so she doesn't have to come clean, or she'll make up more bullshit. She refuses to take responsibility for herself. What should we do? This is a very very VERY serious accusation she's making and she can't keep getting away with hurting people like this. She's a snake with no remorse or empathy. What the fuck do we do?

149,"Hello people of Reddit,

I need advice regarding my sibling and his partner. I no longer know if I am giving correct advice and thought that I should seek help from unrelated people to get an non-bias point of view. 
  
My brother's partner has been arranged to be married off to someone else. Her adoptive parents are separated and she lives in the custody of her adoptive Dad. The Dad apparently can no longer afford to fund her studying so she's being sent from our country to her adoptive Mom abroad, who plans to get her married for a green card. (If you can't tell at this point, basically she's being married to an American to get citizenship.)   
  
Now my sibling wants to take her away from her home a few days before the flight and hide her until her ticket expires so she can't go. Then he plans to have her stay at a friend's house while both of them go look for jobs so they can sustain themselves. Move out and rent a place, So on and so forth.   
  
The process involves borrowing a small amount of money from me. He tells me all his plans but I can't just seem to see it work inside my head. I think it's too optimistic and just say that everything will go as planned.    
  
A few things to note:  
- Both of them are students and neither have finished college.    
- The friend said he'd allow her to stay but Friend's parents don't know about this.    
- Everyone is of legal age.

157,"Since my childhood, I’ve been obsessed with Film. I was inspired mainly by Jim Carrey back in the day and had a hobby of making short films in my home when I was around 12 years old.

After middle school, I kind of lost interest. After high school, the world of Comedy came creeping back to me. I was taking some college classes, I was 10 minutes into a 4 and a half hour Computer Science live video lecture, and decided, “This isn’t for me.”

Since then, I started checking out Filmmakers meetups, then to Open Mic Standups, and most recently, Second City Improv classes.

I’ve always wanted to work in Film and be a writer or something of that nature and I’ve researched a lot, but it seems the first steps to get anywhere are to move to NY or LA.

I live in Northwest Indiana and the opportunities for the Film Industry are next to nothing. Chicago is the next best place and the only thing I feel comfortable doing there is Second City.

But my parents came to me asking me what I wanted to do for the future.

I’m unsure. Never liked to think about the future. My reasoning is that I can’t predict the future so it’s hard for me to cope with it? There’s definitely something that needs working on there mentally for me as I’m aware other people can plan like normal people. I’ve just never been a good planner. Even day to day stuff. All I know is, go to bed at X pm and get up at Y am (not literally all I know, but my planning skills are awful).

I want to work in the world of comedy, or storytelling for Film. I’m always mesmerized by the way Film has the ability to portray stories and creating an emotional, and sometimes, a nostalgic connection with it’s audience.

I’ve been obsessed with Trey Parker, Seth McFarlane, Mel Brooks, Sacha Baron Cohen, Bo Burnham, etc. and I realize that what they do is not easy, but it’s the most interesting thing in this world to me and I want to explore it until I know for sure if it either is or isn’t me.

I’ve tried to do what I could to collaberate and write with other people, but most of the people I meet don’t take it as seriously which kind of infects me, too.

If LA or NY is where I need to start to find people that take this seriously, then first thing is, I’m unemployed at the moment, and I would have to make all my connections with little “resume”.

I want to give it a shot, but I want to make calculated risks. How should I do it?

158,"So as the title says, I have this one friend in our group who likes to dismiss me sometimes and shut me down for no reason. I honestly don't know why but it started in the last several months when his GF left him and from then on he had some other bad things happen to him. Heck, at one point I think he was envious of me for several things, I haven't really thought about all of this until today and it doesn't feel too good.  Still , I believe this isn't the reason for him to act like this towards me. I haven't called him out yet on this neither do I know how, should I do it infront of our circle of friends?

Do You Believe This Drawing Violates Copyright? Is It Too Similar? I was inspired by the above artist and wanted to achieve a similar style. The image below that is my version (not entirely finished).

Are the eyes and ears too similar? I actually drew the ears from a photograph of a cow and her calf I used as a reference, but I liked the big eye/eyelashes style of this artist and didn't want to make the work look too realistic.

I will try further to separate myself from any particular work in the future. I haven’t drawn in a while so sometimes I can have bad habits.

If I published the finished piece, do you think I would be violating copyright?

167,"So , there is this girl , we work at same place. We were good friends for about 7 months . I think we did grew closer as friends in this period . She was the only person I was able to open  my hearts out. Having her as a friend and talking to her day in day out made me so happy.But I did something stupid and she got mad with me . And is mad since last 2 months . Me being me , I kept nagging her. Did tell her mean things during this time .Back 1 months she started talking little , saying hi hello. But I kept nagging her , wanting her to be the same friend as she was before. I did so many stupid things . Like cut myself to say sorry etc etc.
I crossed the limit with things I said and did.

Last week she said she can't handle my madness. Told me to leave her alone and not to text her. Now she has blocked me from everyplaces , I could reach her. She is such a important person to me. I have lost her as a friend , I feel so numb and empty everyday. I feel like she hates me the most of all the people . I see her daily at work. The way she ignores me , when she sees me, it kinda hurts really bad. It bothers me that I lost a friend with my stupidity, and I hate myself for all the trouble I gave her for the last two months.

168,"So before I begin, I'd like to urge reading the title, I don't want responses telling me he's disgusting or the devil or ways to report him, only responses on how to help him.  
  

So I'm friends this guy from art club and started to get some feelings for him recently; we share a lot of interests, he's really serious about art, and  
I've really opened up to the guy. We got pretty close and he's helped me through some really hard times on his own free will so I know he's a kind guy on the inside  
Issue is, I'm pretty sure he's mentally in some way. You can't really tell right away but he has really flat emotional responses, remembers things that never happened, and doesn't let anyone get close. I remember he asked me to never dig stuff up about him, apparently some ""nasty"" stuff happened when he was in service and his name comes up, he never really explained past that but I respect his request and never questioned it  
  
Some months back I was browsing Reddit when I came up on some post that matches him to a tee; talked about his trust issues, devalue of others, with more than a few specifics that led me to believe it was him  
When I confronted him about it at his place he must have thought I was digging shit up about him and felt betrayed. He assaulted me (like did SM stuff like slap/spank/punch/choke, I assure you if he really wanted to hurt me I wouldn't have been able to stop him), he fingered me, so I know it's sexual, but he never used his penis so idk. It's also worth mentioning that all he did was like fetish stuff we've discussed before (he's a smut artist) and we know each other's kinks. Took a long shower after and left, he didn't say anything throughout the entire thing until I was about to leave when he said not to tell anyone about what happened.  
  
I don't know if what he did to me can even be called rape, I've asked on some anonymous forums who told me that as long as there isn't any emotional shock or if you came it's not. Not that it matters, I don't intend to report him or make it an issue in any way.  
It's been a bit more than a week since, we've been acting like nothing happened and hanging out and chatting as we normally normally do.  
  
I care about him, and he obviously cares about me, but he refuses to let me in. I've never dealt with something like this before, he's built such a massive wall around himself. Is there any way to break it down?  
  
tl;dr

171,"Hi, I’m a 20 year old male and I’m worried about my little sister’s marijuana use. 

She’s taking a year break between finishing sixth form and starting university and this year she’s basically developed a marijuana habit which has me a bit worried. On the days she doesn’t work (which is 5 out of 7 days) she’s getting high in the morning and sometimes high in the evening on the same day. She doesn’t really see any friends anymore and she’s become quite antisocial. She doesn’t drink which I’m glad she doesn’t as she can’t use that responsibly either too as she’s had 3 A&amp;E visits due to her getting too fucked up. I’m just worried that as her brain is still developing that she’s doing some damage to herself. 

I know it’s not my place to boss her around or tell her what to do as she’s an adult but I just don’t feel comfortable being in the house with her when she’s high as it makes me really anxious for some reason and now my littler sister who’s 17 gets high with her sometimes. My parents know she smokes weed but I don’t think they know that it’s this frequent. I wouldn’t have a problem with it if she was using it once or twice a week in the evenings socially but she’s not.

What should I do?",19Dec2017,5
172,"Hi this is going to be a long post but I really need advice. I have no idea what to do, and it's causing me a lot of angst. TL;DR at the bottom. I should also add that I've just finished 1st year, and this is about whether or not I should transfer. Just another addition I have good grades, I'm a B student and have never gotten anything lower than a C+ (literally a few percent off B's both times)

Some background stuff: I live in Australia, and here we have a university repayment system called HECS, which is how you pay back your uni fees. It's been uncapped since it started, so you could rack up as much debt as necessary for your degree, and only start paying it back once you made 50k+ a year. It's just been announced that a cap will be introduced at 100k.

I currently go to a  university which can be described as '...meh.' It used to be one of  the best in Australia, but budget cuts have hit it hard, and now it's not good. It's been stringing me around all year , because of mandatory subjects for all Arts students which are completely useless, vlog-style lectures because the uni can't afford to give them actual lecture time, compulsory course subjects which are completely unrelated to what I want to go in to, as well as a few other minor things. One of the compulsory subjects got moved to a different semester, and no one was contacted about it. I got in touch with the university about it, and they said that I could overload the subject into first semester by taking an online course. This was sort of a last straw thing for me, and I know that I'm an entitled piece of shit and that I should shut up and stop complaining, but I want to have an academic career, and this university doesn't seem like it's up for that. I've also heard of people at this uni who've had to do their third year at a different university because this university has terrible subject management, and this leads to people not being able to take enough subjects to pass

I thought  I was stuck at this university, that I'd just have to suck it up and deal with it, but I saw another user on Reddit who is in my course going through the exact same thing, and they're trying to transfer to this other, much more prestigious university. So I checked it out and oh boy, it's everything I ever wanted in higher education. The subjects are all interesting, the university is well structured and has way more funding than the one I currently go to. Not only are the subjects interesting, but they're suited exactly for what I want to do in my future.

Herein lies the problem, which is twofold. Firstly, I left this too late to be accepted into first semester at prestigious university (PU) and I'd have to go mid-semester if I wanted to. There's also no guarantee that I'd get in if I did apply. If I decide  to try and get in, I wouldn't be able to take this semester at my current university (CU), because taking an extra subject would likely drop my average mark, making it harder to get into PU. So I'd be spending a semester doing absolute fuck all, hoping to get accepted into PU. This would mean if I don't get accepted, I'd have to spend a year out of uni, and only go back in 2019, because of the really shitty structure that is CU, because if I went in mid semester I dunno if the structure would let me continue on (it's complicated and I'm too tired to explain - trust me on this one). Additionally, if what people are saying about CU is true and to pass I'd have to take third year overseas (no other place in Aus offers what I'm studying), I wouldn't be able to afford it, meaning no pass. 

Now back to the HECS thing I mentioned earlier. CU costs 3.5k per semester, and PU costs 11k per semester. It's more money than I can wrap my head around. If I could whack it all on HECS I'd deal with it once I graduated. I'd move back home for a while and pay off as much as I could. With the new lifetime cap of 100k, I wouldn't be able to do that, because after bachelors I'll be wanting to move on to honours then masters then a phd if possible. No way I can afford that without HECS, but I don't even know if I'll be able to finish university due to bad structuring at CU

TL;DR can't choose between two universities, my current one which is cheaper but has a lot of structural issues which might make it impossible to graduate, and it's not getting me where I need to be for a career. Prestigious university I want to transfer to is absolutely fantastic and has everything I could ever want, but it's really expensive and due to a new cap on HECS fees I don't know if I'll be able to afford it. Also it's a gamble of up to a year of my life to apply for it

TL;DR of the TL;DR do I stay at my current university where I mightn't be able to graduate because of structure problems or should I go to the uni of my dreams which I mightn't be able to afford?

INB4 whiney millennial posts, or posts that say poor people shouldn't attend uni and should instead get real jobs. I've seen everyone in this small town I live in regret not following their dreams. Everyone did the logical thing and got jobs, but they're sad and unfulfilled, and they live with a lot of regret. I don't know if I can do that. It'd be crushing",19Dec2017,2

178,"My boyfriend and I started dating a little over 4 years ago; the last three we have been heavy meth users (it was his drug of choice, he was clean when we met then he started using again and introduced me to it). After we started using things slowly got worse and worse between us. Arguments became more common and hostile, police have been called, and I am falling deeper and deeper into depression and have almost constant anxiety (self diagnosis, i have not talked to a professionalabout this so grain of salt).    

He consistently belittles me (calls me fat, ugly, lazy, basically anything ive confided in him as something im self conscious about), and I can not bring anything up to him without it turning into all the things I've done and what he has to put up with.   

This will go on all day where he is completely silent and unresponsive in between bouts of accusations and questioning of me. I just don't bring it up when he does things that offend me anymore.   

I try to not upset him, because he has multiple times broken my things and stolen money and drugs from me (claiming that i had done the same to him which justifies his actions now but I don't remember ever doing anything like that to him?)    

The first time I called the cops on him was after he trashed my room and he tried to take my dog saying he was going to have her put down. It was so scary. I live in the boonies with no one around, and he had stolen my phone so I was just screaming hoping someone would hear me while I fought him to keep him away from my dog. She was so scared and confused :( Eventually got her inside and called the cops on my landline.   

Sometimes he will get into a mood for what seems like no reason and will just antagonize me for days. At one point i was in hysterics from his mental abuse and began cutting my arm because I just wanted it to stop. He pulled the knife away from me and I ran into my room.  He followed me, threw a razor at me, and told me to use that instead as it would work better.  

Writing this all out now I feel like such a fucking idiot...   

Anyway we have broken up many times but he is my only access to meth and so I always end up calling him up. And, even more than that, i'm ashamed to say i still really do love him. After particularly bad outbursts he always has a period where he acts very sad and remorseful and I have to comfort him even though i know deep down im the one who needs comforting. I always fall for it. And i always let him back in. I cant help it.   

Part of me wants to break up with him but part of me loves him so much and is so lost without him and I hate myself for it. Idk if its the drugs or the fear of what hell do if he thinks im serious about breaking up but i cant do it.   

Ive tried so many times to quit using and i genuinely want to so much, even more than breaking up with him, but I cant function without it. Like literally cant get out of bed and my thoughts get so dark. I was just promoted to manager at my job (which i love so so so much) and I cant see a way to get clean without taking extended time off and probably being fired.   

I could go on and on with stories of his abuse, and tales from the things his mother has done (what up, justnomil) but sometimes it feels like im really the one causing everything and i just dont see it. Ive taken so many quizzes and read so many articles to tell if youre mentally abusive to your partner...i dont know. I just know I used to have so much life and so much optimism for the future.    

Now im a college drop out who's watching her friends succeed and get awesome jobs and move away and i am fiercely proud of them but i also feel jealous because i know that will never be me and i hate that im so selfish to think that. I feel like i let down my family who have done everything for me.    

My grandma who passed away almost a year ago without ever seeing me graduate college even though I should have been done 3 years ago. She could have been there to watch me walk. I used to love to travel and be so outgoing and now i cant go anywhere without major planning to make sure  i have enough drugs to last the trip. Flying is out of the question. Cant leave the country.   

I feel like such a failure yall and i know its all my fault but i had such a promising life and im never going to get the opportunity i had back and it hurts so much. I feel like a shell of who i used to be and am not at all the person i thought id become.

186,"When you're in a long distance relationship, it is always a good gesture to send gifts to your partner. Especially on important occasions like: Birthday, Valentine's day, Christmas day and Anniversary. Although, it's true that you can't put material things and love in one category. But giving gifts just because you want to, is always a great way to show appreciation.

However, we often find ourselves in a dilemma. The dilemma of what to give her-- what would be the best gift to give her? Will she like this gift? Here are some great gift suggestions to give your significant other.

Give Her a Book - Whether your girl loves to read or not, a good romantic novel or a collectible book is always a good option. You can also spice it up and make the book even more special by bookmarking and highlighting parts of the book. Let her know how you feel about her by allowing her to explore a good book.
Have Flowers delivered - Brighten up her day by sending her flowers. No girl can say no to flowers. A flower on its own speaks the language of love. There are a lot of delivery-websites that allows flower delivery to any destination. Even one of the reputable dating sites like A Foreign Affair offers this service, allowing their members to woo romantically.
Send a Handwritten Letter - Effort is always better than any diamond and gold. Let your girl know what you feel about her in writing. Handwritten letters are not so common nowadays that its value is almost as good as a bouquet of flowers. 
Give Her Something She can wear to Remind her of You - If you want to give her a gift where she can always bring around with her, an accessory is always a great way to go. A Necklace or a bracelet will allow her to be reminded of you which makes for a great gift. 
Send Her a Stuffed Toy - Send your partner a stuffed toy that she can cuddle with when sleeping at night. With long distance, feeling lonely is natural. Gifting her something that will allow her to feel your presence, makes stuffed toy a great gift. It will definitely help her feel at ease during bouts of lonely nights.
What is the Importance of Gifts in Long Distance Relationship?
While it is not easy to maintain a healthy relationship when distance exists, giving gifts occasionally becomes a great factor in keeping each sides happy. Honesty, communication and trust may be the most important part of maintaining your relationship, but every relationships could use some boost every now and then.

Your gift can signify all the things you think and want to say to your partner. And choosing the right gift becomes crucial.

191,"So as the title implies I like to smoke. Not only that but I also am fond of dabbling in a trip or two from time to time (LSD and shrooms, not often). Drugs aren't the only part of my life and they don't control it, but they have helped me along the journey into becoming who I am today. I've always considered the military as an option for the future as it seems sound economically, politically, and I do have the desire to serve my country. However, I'm afraid of giving up weed. It's personally helped me deal with my demons and positively impacted my life; I've been able to go from a point of using it several times daily out of necessity to only using at the end of a stressful day (maybe 3 times a week rather than losing count). So it would probably be safe to say I have a psychological dependence on it. Additionally, I'm afraid that to give this part of my life up for the military may mean I'm changing who I am for someone else. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Finally, I have a fear (maybe irrational?) of becoming an alcoholic. I love drinking but choose to smoke instead. I've had downward spirals in the past where I couldn't smoke and drank every day.

We talked about our separate lives and got along very well, bein honest(he just started a new relationship),laughed and loved each other like old times.

He also insisted on me finding someone new. We din t fight like last months when we decided to break up. He decided those days at my place to kill himself, i didn t knew and he faked it so good, but he sort of chose to spend his last days with me, being very intimate and funny. Hugged me tight and long last time i saw him. I was the last person to see him. Few days later after he left my place, found out he killed himself. Cops found him with the Exit Bag and some inert gas.I was devastated but i also thought he had some mental psychosis or some sort... Now it haunts me that he sort of said goodbye and wanted to leave me in a good place( when he dissapeared he only answered me by messages, saying he s ok and well in a vacation and to get back to my business, that i didn t do anything wrong). Why did he do it? How should i move on now? Maybe my love was too much for him, i always forgave him but he didn t manage to forgive himself for hurting me, or find a solution to be together without drama. Also he didn t have any sort of problems with money, work, family, he was an amazing beautiful and loving man....

194,"I say I'm unsure because I genuinely can't tell if he hates my guts and just never wants to hear from me again, or if he is hurt to an extent he doesn't want to admit to and is simply waiting for me to say/do the right thing to fix it. We've been friends for several years but we've always butted heads: We're both very stubborn and very opinionated, but we always agreed on the big stuff: politics, morality, etc. But we've been prone to a lot of misunderstanding and it was always small, stupid shit that we fought over, often because one of us felt disrespected. I feel like our big problem is that I am emotionally sensitive and I admit that, while he is emotionally sensitive and won't admit it, so I never know when I'm stepping on a sore spot because he doesn't bother to let me know until it is too late. By that point he has already ""returned fire"" over my initial blunder and then at that point, feelings are just getting hurt on purpose out of some sense of retaliation, like a ping pong match of passive aggressivity. I think he simply feels like I don't respect him at all but I don't feel like he respects me either, and I'm really at a crossroads because of it. I DO respect him - less so, recently - but I don't know how to convince him of that. Thoughts on how to proceed?

197,"Context: My aunt lives with my family but she isn’t financially supported by us. She’s in college (paying for it herself) and we’re kinda close because we’ve grown up together.

Her: She works a minimum wage job but she’s been financially unstable for a year or more. This is mostly because:
- she’s paying for college on her own (and loans)
- she’s a few thousand in credit card debt
- she tends to spend a lot of money that she doesn’t have to (such as going out to eat with her boyfriend _multiple times, almost everyday_ when we have a home cooked meal for them both at home for free)

Situation: Christmas is really important to her and she really likes giving really good gifts for all the cousins (there’s 7-8 of us). She doesn’t want to cheap out on any gifts. So she’s been selling a lot of her stuff to make ends meet. I mean things she really liked too like her favourite watch or her favourite brand name jacket that she’s worn for years, etc.
A few weeks ago she was complaining to me about being broke (as usual) and I told her this year she doesn’t have to get me anything and I made sure she knew I was being genuine. This is because she usually gets me two gifts this time of the year (my birthday too) and splurges on both of them. I told her I’d rather she keep the money or even use it towards the kids since their gifts must cost more than she can afford. 
Regardless to what I said, she still ended up getting me to open her gift a week later, so that she could see my reaction before I left on my business trip. She got me a 3DS and some accessories for it. It’s a thoughtful gift because I’m a huge pokémon fan but i’ve never had a 3DS so I always had to use her 3DS to play the new games after she finished. Of course, I acted surprised and happy (everyone hates ungrateful people) but really, I was kind of upset. Even if she bought a used one, y’all still cost her a few hundred.
She told me to turn it on to check it out so I did with her in front of me (she couldn’t see he screen). There was an account on it so, even though it looks new and pretty, it was used. I don’t mind because I’m relieved she didn’t splurge on a brand new one. However, I’m pretty sure it’s broken or something because it won’t let me exit the little fitness/pedometer thing that 3DSs have. I tried the on/off method several times to no avail.  Since she was in front of me, she didn’t see any of this and I didn’t say anything about it. 

Suggestions: I haven’t given her anything back yet so I’m thinking perhaps I should sell it (for as much as I can) and somehow give her the money (maybe in some form of Christmas gift)? In that case, there’s a possibility that she’ll notice that I never play it since we live together. I might be able to counter that by saying it’s at my SO’s place but she’ll still realize I never play it, ever. 
On the other hand, is it insensitive of me to throw away her thoughtfulness towards me if I sell it? Should I just repair it and keep it and find a way to pay her back when I have the money? Though I’m not sure if I’ll use it much after I play UltraMoon. 

Note: Before anyone says anything about this, her morals are a little out of loop and she’s stubborn so even if I sit down and talk to her about it, it’ll just upset her and anger her that I don’t seem grateful for the lengths she’s gone for me and then she might not accept any money I want to give her.
Another note: I can’t really afford to give her much financially and support her either",19Dec2017,2
199,"I'm 21F and never had sex.I'm attracted by men,I often masturbate,I fantasize etc.

Sometimes my sex drive is very high and I really wanna get close to someone sexually/emotionally.I would love to get so ""connected"" to someone I have intense feelings for.

But some other times I don't care about sex at all.In fact,sometimes I find it repulsive and intimidating.

It's something about the feelings you get during and especially after.This intimate ""bond"" that gets created scares me.I'm also repulsed by the more ""technical"" side of things:the smells,the sounds people make while fucking,the bodily fluids,all this physical closeness of kissing/licking/sucking each other's body parts.It's something I wanna experience but for some reason I find it repulsive at the same time.

I didn't have a strict or religious upbringing.I have never been abused.Though,2 things that could potentially matter:

1.When I was kid,a boy my age,felt up a body part of mine without my consent.

2.After me and my ex boyfriend(long distance relationship,both virgins) broke up,he had sex for the first time with someone else and told me about it which literally broke my heart.We were planning on having sex together for the first time and him giving it away to someone else instead broke me.I was devastated.Also,him dating random people and sleeping around after that,definitely didn't help to mend my heart.

Once I found out what he was doing,I was getting all these graphic visuals in my head of what he was doing to those people,what they were doing to him etc and for a long time after that,I had even stopped masturbating because anything sex related disgusted me.

Now I'm back on track with masturbating,watching porn etc but I find the intimate and technical sides of sex repulsive.

Let's just say I meet a great guy.I'd be happy and all ""school girl"" like all over again.But just the thought of us holding hands or kissing or him going down on me or him getting his dick inside of me or us looking in each others' eyes during sex repulses/scares me.This warm,happy,""butterflies in the stomach"" feeling that you get when you're in love scares me and I don't know what to do.",19Dec2017,2

208,"Hey there r/advice, 

&amp;nbsp;
This has been a hell of a week. I'm posting here because I am so overwhelmed that I feel paralyzed, which I can't afford to be right now. I'll try to sum this up as best as I can. If you have any advice about any of the subjects I bring up along the way, please feel free to share. 

&amp;nbsp;

A few days ago, I found out that my mom, age 53,  had an MRI performed in January (she had seen a neurologist with the concern of ""memory"" issues). Ever since then, she would call up members of the family and either tell them ""I had an MRI and was diagnosed with dementia"" and when word got around to other people, she'd call/answer and say ""What? I never said that. I don't have dementia."" 

&amp;nbsp;

And as much as I hate to say this, no one in my family took her seriously. She's always been pretty neurotic, ever since I was a kid. Her anxiety and depression is through the roof (runs in the family) and she would talk about her anxiety constantly. My mom was kinda crazy, always had been, and that's what we chalked it up to.

&amp;nbsp;

Last week I came out to visit her, something I hadn't done in 3 years. We went out to lunch to a place she's been to hundreds of times, just down the block from her house. I thought it was strange when she had to put the name of that restaurant into her phone's GPS. 

&amp;nbsp;
At the restaurant, I noticed some verbal issues going on:

&amp;nbsp;

1) She was speaking very vaguely, using words like ""it"" ""thing"" ""stuff"" to a degree where she was clearly talking about something I should understand, but had no idea what she was talking about. 

&amp;nbsp;

2) She was mixing up her boyfriend, my dad, and her brothers' names. She didn't remember my aunt's names. She forgot my wife's name. 

&amp;nbsp;

3) She made the waitress repeat the available sides for her burger 3 times, finally saying ""I guess onion rings I'll do. Um, but, do you guys have fries?"" Yikes. Fries were the first item the waitress was mentioning with every repeat. Something wasn't right. 

&amp;nbsp;

Back at her house, she started asking over and over ""You don't think I have dementia, do you?"" and I couldn't take it anymore. I said hey mom, do you have an online health account? Where you can renew your prescriptions and see test results and stuff? She did. She remembered the login information, which surprised me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I logged in and went to the tab for test results, and opened the Doctor's notes on her MRI results. My heart sank.

&amp;nbsp;

""Mild chronic microvascular ischemic change as well as development of generalized cortical atrophy with focal atrophy demonstrated involving the temporal lobes significantly more pronounced on the left. Findings are most compatible with Frontotemporal dementia.""

&amp;nbsp;

Frontaltemporal dementia. There it was. Written proof from a neurologist. It didn't matter who she was telling what anymore,  I had seen the proof and this was reality. 

&amp;nbsp;

Immediately I was angry with her neurologist. How do you diagnose someone with dementia and not do anything? ""You have dementia and it is progressive and fatal, see ya"". I couldn't wrap my head around it. Honestly, I still can't. There's no care plan after that? NO ONE else in her family or contacts was informed? I know I'm not a doctor and I shouldn't act like I could be one, but this all just seemed so highly irresponsible.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now my mom lives with her boyfriend of around 20 years. I can't stand the guy, he's emotionally abusive, highly critical, and obsessed with money. I've been trying to get her to leave him for most of my life. My sister has tried. Her family has tried. She's too wrapped up in him, despite how awful he is and how much he yells at her. And things are getting worse. 

&amp;nbsp;

My mom has been calling me more often now, crying or upset, telling me that her boyfriend has been screaming at her for her memory problems. Screams at her over dinner if she makes the same meal twice in two weeks. Screams that she's not finding good enough jobs. She's always on eggshells and is terrified of upsetting him. She's always been very insecure and her self-worth has been strongly influenced by how he's treating her at any given moment. 

&amp;nbsp;

He's threatening to throw her out of the house if she doesn't start bringing in income. She worked in a hospital for 20 years, and was amazing at what she did. She was let go about 3 years ago. Since then, she's been fired from 6 or 7 different jobs. She has been working at Costco type places making minimum wage, since she can't seem to be hired or keep a job in the medical field anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

We all just thought mom was being anxious and crazy, like always. We had no idea that she was slowly suffering from a brain disease, confused and scared all the time about what was happening. Apparently she walked into one hospital dressed for work and they told her that she no longer worked there. She'd called me very confused about this and I thought she was lying to mask something she'd done, like fucking up with a patient. I had no idea the reality was she'd forgotten she'd been fired.
She is still applying to jobs in the medical field, even after this diagnosis. She has no job and therefore 0 insurance. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's where the identity theft comes in. Last night my mom called me up, really worked up. Took a while to make sense of what she was trying to tell me, because she was skipping words and her grammar was all over the place. What I gathered though was, she was on the computer and saw her boyfriend's iMessages to his mother from his cellphone. He was apparently saying really bad things about her (presumably bitching about her bad memory), and what particularly upset her was the fact that he was texting his mother, telling her ""I think she's lying about having filed for unemployment"" and he texted her the front and back of my mom's social security cards and driver's license to his mom to get her to... do something with it. File for unemployment as my mom, I'm guessing. Like I said, he's been threatening to kick her out of the apartment if she doesn't contribute money. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm at a loss of what to do. I asked her if she was going to talk to him about it and she said ""no! he'll kick me out, he doesn't, i go on this and he doesn't know about it. he'll kick me out."" 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't even know where to begin as far as an action plan. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Convincing my family that she actually has dementia and needs help. Many of them think she's faking it or as my aunt said ""maybe she has dementia, but she's definitely milking it"" 

&amp;nbsp;

-Do I need to get power of attorney or something? A case worker? Can she get on disability and how the heck do you even do that or prove that? 

&amp;nbsp;

-Living with her asshole boyfriend is stressing her out. She's terrified of upsetting him so she's been trying to hide this dementia diagnosis from everyone (or she's in denial). Problem is that's her comfort place and she won't want to leave him, she loves him dearly. Thing is I don't want her around someone who is gonna be screaming at a dementia victim to ""get a job!"" or ""stop forgetting shit!"" all the time. 

&amp;nbsp;

-What do I do about the fact that asshole boyfriend is texting my mother's identity information to his MOTHER? This makes me sick, I dont know what he's doing with it. Maybe it's innocent, but he sure as shit didn't contact me or my sister about any concerns he has (and my sister lives less than 2 miles away from them). It's shady and I'm pretty sure its illegal, and if I bring it up to him all his wrath will come down on my sick mom for snooping. 

&amp;nbsp;

On top of all this, there's this crushing despair about losing her. I went No Contact with her several years ago in reaction to what I thought were increasingly insane, toxic, and inconsiderate behaviors. For years, not a single text. I had no idea that she wasn't being evil, she was SICK and I abandoned her. I know it's not my fault but I can't stop feeling like such an ignorant and selfish prick. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just don't even know where to start. I've spent the past few days hyperventilating and sobbing into pillows interspersed with full-on existential panic attacks. I can't seem to stop obsessing over this. She's the first thing on my mind when I wake up, she's all I think about all day, and I have trouble falling asleep because I can't stop thinking about her and the disease. I've been obsessing over how afraid, alone, confused, depressed, and terrified she must be. To find out you're slowly changing and will disappear before you're dead. Even with cancer there's a glimmer of hope. Frontaltemporal dementia has no cure, and no medication to slow its progression. And get this, its inherited about 20-40% of the time, and I am currently seeing psychologists about my own memory issues. So... yeah.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm about to go see my therapist and then take my mom to a movie. It's going to take everything in me to not break once she inevitably goes into her ""Do you think I have dementia? I don't think so. I'm not BAD bad. I can drive! And cook! People with dementia, you know, they go and they cant go or do that stuff. I'm not like, its okay, you know? I dont think I have dementia, do you? I can drive a car, I can cook, if I had it I couldn't do it all.""

209,"I am a 21 year old guy, and I have suffered depression and anxiety for now 4 years. I am college student, and we live in a low income family.

212,"This is my first and last post I'll ever write. I don't know who is going to read this nor understand it but I wanted to get it off my chest. I'm sorry to take your time with a long story.

I understand to some extent most of you will be thinking this is a petty story. But I'm just opening up what I experienced.

I know what is split personality disorder. But i didn't know that I was living close to it until I found out today. We were together for 2 years but it felt like a very long time. My partner is a very confident and intelligent man. He's a person with good words and you will instantly be captured by him. A while back he told me that when he was younger around 7 or 9 he used to be sexually abused by his cousin for a long period of time. He opened up and he felt vulnerable about it so I decided to share my dark past to him and felt that this could be a way to console him and relate to him. But i did not know to what extent his past affected him and how things like these can alter someone.

It happend when we started having simple small arguments when i realise his mood shifts in a split second from rage to a complete loving person. Or even when his temper goes out of control he later then sobs in sadness thinking he hurt me(not physically), like i said in a split second. We can go for days and weeks spending time together and days of self isolation(him). It sounds like nah I'm just exaggerating or this is what relationship is all about. But living with him is like living in 2 different worlds in a day.

I found out yesterday a girl contacted me telling me that she's been living with him for 8 months while i was still together with me. It really seems like it's just another common story of cheating and guys will be guys (vice versa). But his memory is severely bad that when he wakes up he forgets he's living with me or her.

It sounds like a very good excuse to get out of trouble and a whole lot of bullshit that's what I thought as well. But he's been seeking for help for a long time. I just didn't know well enough to see his disorder. I am willing to stay and be dragged with him with this but I have made the decision to move on because it will kill me to feel so much pain he will unconsciously do.

Whoever out there think it's a joke or he's really just good at keeping 2 relationships i don't blame you because that was what i felt and can't help to feel it up till now. Some people might feel that my decision to leave him is stupid or selfish but I wished him well and we ended in good terms.

I cannot tell for sure it's a lie or the truth. I might sound naive or dumb and I didn't see it coming. But all i ever wanted to do is love someone genuinely. Sometimes we do things because we love them or sometimes we're too blind to see it. I'm just here to love and care.

He told me he would get better and seek help. But he needs me to be there to help him be on track. I'm scared that he would fall back and find another person to live another double life again. I'm afraid to go through the pain again. Should I be there for him?",19Dec2017,1
213,"Hey everyone. I’m 19F and have been dating my 20M boyfriend for a little over a year. This is the first year that we’ll be spending Christmas together, and I’ll be with his family. 

He and I are getting each other gifts, but  he keeps insisting that I shouldn’t get anything for his parents besides a card. I’ve met them before and have stayed with them many times, so it’s not like we’re strangers. I wouldn’t say that we’re “close,” but we’re all very friendly with each other. 

While I can’t think of anything to get them, (wine is off the table due to my age, they don’t care for sweets, etc) I think that it’s rude not to get gifts for his parents - especially when they’ve bought me dinners/drinks numerous times and are very kind. 

On the other hand, I’m sure that my boyfriend would find it odd/silly if I showed up for Christmas with some sort of generic gift that he insisted I shouldn’t get. 

What do y’all think? Should i listen to him and just stick with a card? Or would it be more gracious to go ahead and get some sort of gift? Thanks!

Then I talked to my ex and found out she had already volunteered(when she has been depressed for a while too). My heart sank tbh. I feel like I'm just not a good person at heart and even if I feigh goodness for others by putting my actions into volunteering, I'll still have an interior whos heart isnt in it. 3 weeks of thought and I didn't do shit...just sat in and smoked weed and did nothing other than go to work. It's like...how could I be a good person and ever be with someone like her again if I can't even commit to doing good over the course of three weeks.

The problem is that my heart isn't in it, and my heart not being in it makes me feel like a bad person(because it shows that I naturally don't care enough to even go help even when I want to). Part of it is probably because I wanted to volunteer for my own sake, fixing depression(btw in your responses plz don't give me slack over depression...I dislike that alot), and not for the sake of others.

There is no internal drive for me though...for anything. I can go do volunteering...no doubt about it, but that won't fix the fact that my life history shows that at my core I'm not a good person. I'm not a person who would seek out and act on helping others in a personal way, I'm not even a person who can find the motivation to help do chores around the house for my family. I can hide it by helping others and softening mt heart, and I can put in tons of effort, but at my core that person that isn't good will still be there running the show.  The other thing though now is that I feel like I'm copying her now. Like I have to volunteer to prove to her, when we inevitably talk, that I'm as good a person as she is. I don't want to have that kind of motivation for helping others, I want it to be internally motivated. The problem is that I don't have enough internal drive for good things, so I must be simply a bad person at heart. I want to help people for out of my own desire to help others..but I don't care about others enough to do it.

Tl;dr I think I'm a bad person because I don't have much natural internal drive to help people. I will on politics somewhat.",19Dec2017,2
221,"Growing up my parents showed no affection to me. I was spoiled and berated for my shortcomings, which there were many of, although they were most likely my parents fault due to he extreme spoiling. When I bring this up, they point to my older sister who was very hard working and successful in school, although she was raised when my parents had far less money; they tell me it’s not their fault I act the way I do, it’s “different personalities” between my sister and myself. I was born the way I am and it’s somehow my fault. My parents are helpful financially; they bought me a lot, and if I needed money now they’d help me, but they were emotionally abusive. I was a fumbley child, I knocked over a lot of things and did a lot of things I didn’t mean to, and my dad would harass me for it. He’d give me looks of disgust and call me “handsy”. It wasn’t abnormal for him to call me a fucking retard or weak, as early as 9 years old or so. He made me feel like he hated me, outside of the times he or my mom was buying me something.  I was a problem child; I didn’t do my homework and talked a lot in class. I did well on tests though, which kept me afloat. By the time high school came around, I skipped school, smoked a lot of weed, etc. My parents obviously resented me for this.

My family is very abrasive and shows no affection. I’ve never been told I love you by my dad, and only a few times by my mom; they think it’s lame. They don’t say that but it’s obvious that’s what they think. We fight constantly, even during the one time a year we get to see each other, which is Christmas. When I say fight, I don’t mean a one time thing, either. It is a daily battle. It doesn’t seem out of place for me, but when I bring people outside my family around they can’t handle it and usually freak out, questioning me on why my family speaks to each other the way we do. I’ve talked to my parents about our situation and they go off the deep end, harassing me and telling me it’s my fault, they didn’t teach me to skip school and do drugs, etc. I don’t know what to do with my life. Everyone seems to like me. I was very popular in school, and I’m very popular in my job right now, but my underlying rage and insecurity is destroying my marriage, and any intimate relationship I’ve ever had for that matter. I’m fine with friends, but when I get too close to someone, my family comes out of me and I get really ugly. I seem to hate everything and everyone, not literally but just about. I am a mess. My life is in shambles. Please help me, or give me some advice. I’m at my breaking point.",19Dec2017,1

223,"I was(am?) a meth(well, stimulants in general) addict. I quit using every day about 10 months ago when my husband made the ultimatum to choose him or the drugs, and have not gone back to that severity of use since. 

However since then, I have had short(3 days tops) relapses, twice (I think?) with meth (after which I had my husband hide our stash from me, it's been like 7-8 months since then), twice more with benzedrex (another strong stimulant which is just sold at walgreens. constant temptation there) and occasionally have abused my Adderall prescription (also a constant temptation, but less so since if I run out of pills I can't get more until a certain day). The most recent one of these was maybe a month ago, so clearly resisting the temptation to use is still a problem for me. TBH if I knew where my husband hid the meth I would have relapsed on that more times. After this last time, husband said some hurtful things to me(which he later took back) that made me see he is getting to the end of his rope with me. I really want to be good, and believe I won't fuck up again, but that's how I've felt every time. Clearly something isn't working. I switched from a general therapist (I also have bipolar) to one specializing in addiction, and at our first appointment a week ago she suggested I might benefit from a group like NA. 

This concept kinda scares me. I am really reluctant to share my problem, only my husband and closest friends know. I also have never met another hard drug addict in person (I've also never met a dealer in person). I have a little bit of a fear that I might make friends with a person there, and if they relapse that I would too by being around them. I also kinda feel like most addicts have had a longer/more difficult journey than me--that my addiction isn't 'legit enough' to justify going to NA. I also feel like most people going to these meetings are probably in the early stages of quitting, or maybe haven't even quit yet, whereas I have been off of daily use for nearly a year and just need help preventing relapse. I feel like therapy (with the specialist) alone may be enough for that. But on the other hand, maybe I should be using ABSOLUTELY EVERY resource I can this time, since just therapy has failed in the past.

What do you think? I'd love to hear from someone who has been to one of these meetings before.",19Dec2017,2

My girlfriend hasn't seen my body yet and I was nervous because I have a shit body. What's worse is that my 12 year old brother has the body of a fucking Greek God compared to me, I'm not even exaggerating he does gymnastics and is really really good.

He's the first pic, I'm the second pic. It's so bad.

But this is the worst part. Us 3 were in the pool, my brother was at the edge of the pool facing the water with his legs extended. I swam over and my brother wrapped his legs around my waist, he squeezed insanely hard and I had to submit. My girlfriend afterwards was laughing when I was doubled over in pain. She seemed concerned but she was still laughing.

This was the worst day of my life. So what, is my girlfriend a pedo or am I being ridiculous and paranoid? There's not much to base it on, just a bad feeling. I know pedophilia isn't exactly the most comfortable topic to talk about, but I just need to know I'm being paranoid here.",19Dec2017,1
231,"I always had a strong passionate love for my house growing up. Parents were separated but remained close, I'd spend every other night with my dad at his house who just lived 10 minutes away. But it was always about my mom's house. My home base. It was always a matter of getting back there, where I could hide from the world, sort my thoughts, and just feel at one with the Universe again. I have so many memories from my childhood, but also even more memories of being a teenager and growing up in that place, becoming a man. My brother moved out to University when I was 14, so it was just me and my mom. Then I got home one night and she was unresponsive in the bathroom, paramedics came, took her to hospital where we were told she was braindead from a brain aneurysm and would not survive. 

So the shock set in, and I lived with my dad for the remainder of that summer, until the Fall when I stuck with my original plan of moving into my first apartment in the city with my friends, about a 25 minute drive from the house. My aunt has taken care of renting the place, and my dad helps maintain it because of his proximity to it. I've found it too hard, emotionally, to travel to my hometown for so long, until a year or two ago when I realized the pain was finally gone from that traumatic incident and I could feel normal in the town again. 

But, it's been almost seven years since, and a lot has happened in that time. I am pretty isolated these days after having a large friend group and a network of people to support me grow up and move on. I feel suffocated, stranded, depressed, and frustrated with life, and part of me feels like the answer is to go home and reclaim my castle again, and find a way to afford to live there again, taking care of property tax, maintenance, a vehicle to get to and from school, etc.

Is this an insane fantasy? Should I be selling this house? Or would anyone else probably try to salvage their roots to get back in touch with themselves? ",19Dec2017,2
232,"About 2 months ago my best friend and I broke off a 3 year friendship because our lives were headed in different directions and we had no more time for each other. He meant the world to me. He was family. But he needed to focus on personal things. And those personal things just didn’t involve me. Me, on the other hand, well I needed to focus on my mental health (borderline personality disorder) since it affected our friendship. I’ve been a recovered borderline for a few weeks now. My best friend happened to be my trigger, and now that the trigger is gone, I’m more emotionally stable.

Well a few weeks ago I decided I hadn’t gotten the closure I really wanted back in October, so a few weeks back I decided to get it. And well. I got it. He already replaced me (he said it himself) and he’s going abroad to Spain next year so there’s no point in rekindling our friendship (another thing he said). I’ve been pretty alright since then, like I wasn’t completely devastated.

But today I realized how much it really hurts to not have him there. To not be able to tell him the good things and the bad things. Just the fact that he’s not there anymore tears me up. What I’m asking here is: what can I do to cope? This was a brotherly bond that I’ve lost and he already let someone take my place. I just don’t know what to really do.",19Dec2017,2

236,"i spent last summer as a pro cheerleader for a major league sports team.

It was miserable. I was bullied at every turn. The veterans welcomed all the rookies except for me. I was left out, excluded from social plans, made fun of behind my back (was told about this by others), ridiculed to my face, and wanted to escape that little locker room we were trapped in all summer. I was scared of being scheduled with a couple of them because of the constant cold shoulder and mean texting. 

Added to that, we aren't paid much, it's hot outside, and our boss has a tendency to yell at whoever's in front of him when things go wrong regardless of who's at fault.

Everything inside of me is telling me to quit and not return next year. And yet...

I'm a loser, redditor, basement-dwelling rebound 29-year-old living with mom and dad with nothing else going for her except an online job. This job gave me an identity. I'm a pro cheerleader. That's all I have. It gives me a little pride, despite how miserable it made me. I went to the ballpark all summer. That made me a little happy. Going back to watching twitch all day and working on my PC and never going outside sounds....depressing. And typical. 

Right at the end of the season, some of the other rookies texted me and invited me to join their group costume for the end of year party and encouraged me to return next year. I cried. It was the only time all year I felt wanted. But the one veteran involved in the costume group was picked on last year, and she is using me as a shield. If I leave, they'll go back to picking on her. That's why she wants me. The others too- they're afraid once I leave they'll be a target. They're all just as catty, it's not genuine.

- got the management job.
- signed the papers for both jobs because ""sometimes people make a better one/the other and switch.""

- started the job, not quite what I expected and it's pretty stressful (I'm sure there are a lot of people who would be into this job but for me personally, it hits everything I went back to school to avoid doing.)

So I applied for a job which had a due date of 1st November. This is a job in the same company of which I'm currently employed (big international company) and it's basically a ""you work everywhere in the world"" job. For external appliers the due date was the 12th November. I didn’t have all my documentation available, so I sent them an email a couple of days later explaining this. They replied and told me I could just email them that then, which was within the 12th November.

Fast forward to last week. I was away from work for two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) and when I got back on Thursday I saw that they had sent me an email on tuesday calling me into an interview on Thursday. So I sorted time off with my boss and accepted.
During the interview I felt really nervous and I didn’t really feel that I answered the questions very well and overall didn’t really feel that I presented myself or my qualifications the way I wanted or could, if I had been a bit better prepared.

There are two out of three branches they are focusing the first round of interviews, because those two have a certain type of department. I also know that there is a certain education they are looking for. 
I work in that certain type of department in one of those two branches and I have that certain education.
Rumors say they are looking for four (4) candidates to hire.
I also know that they have interviewed/will interview

* Me

* A coworker of mine (different department in my branch though but not that exact education)

* Person X (that specific department in the other branch with that specific education)

* Person Y (that specific department in the other branch but not that exact education)

Person X has a bit more experience, some more education and has done work for them before. He has gotten a offer, but has not yet replied.

Person Y has an interview tomorrow.

This is basically my dream job and I can’t let this slip away. Is there anything I can do that would increase my chances? And if I do get a call where they tell me the position is filled, is there nothing I can do?

247,"I have no idea how old exactly she is, I can't remember the month we got her. She must be around 1.5/2 years. She's my second hamster, my first was put down at 1.5 years for a lung problem (she would have died anyway, just more slowly and painfully)  She was really friendly and chilled out, adventurous and about as affectionate as a hamster can be. I got her tame as a rescue. My current hamster, charley, also a rescue. She, however, was not tame. Now, she'll let herself be stroked and get on my hand, but she doesn't seem to *enjoy* it. She'll jump off after 10 seconds or rush off to put her food somewhere. I still love her, though. She's adorable. 



However, recently she's been getting bald patches. The skin is hard underneath. Shes been less active, I never hear her climbing her cage and doing pretty impressive gymnastics like she used to (she did get quite strong and skillful at swinging around on her roof). I've done my research, and I am 90% sure it's because she's getting old. It's seven days until Christmas, my aunt and uncle are coming over, I know I'm getting some awesome presents and my hamster is probably dying. Life has decided to give me the worst Christmas present I have ever had. 



I'm going to be honest with myself here. I never really gave her the attention a hamster needs. It was probably because she wasn't the most friendly, but also a cause of her unfriendliness. Some days I actually forgot to feed her and change her water. Some days I couldn't be bothered, and I hate myself. About 2 weeks ago I realised that I was basically abusing a small bundle of fur that could do nothing about it. I started writing up a timetable, to feed her and put her in a playpen or ball. Now she has become a much bigger part of my life, I love her loads, but it's much too late. I ignored her for her whole life up until *2 fucking weeks ago*. I wish I could wind back time and give her the love she deserves. After she's gone, I am *not* going to get another hamster until I am completely sure I will be a good owner. Maybe I'll decide I like not having the responsibility. Who knows.


I never saw my last hamster dead. My mum took her too the vet and she was put down. (I agreed with this). I am so scared I'll notice the lack of noise from her cage one evening and lift up her house and find her fucking dead body all limp and cold just lying there. 



I'm going to give her the best fucking life a hamster has ever had from now on, however long it may be. If she doesn't want to play, I'll just give her food, keep her warm and comfy.

But the thing is he gives me so much mixed stuff, some days he’s calling me cute and other days replying with one worded responses. We’ve hung out once and he said he had a way better time hanging with my rather than anything else that day though, since he’s grounded.

252,"To cut a long story short, my girlfriend and I didn’t see eye to eye on something, so to prevent an argument I told her I didn’t want to talk until I cleared my head. She gave me an ultimatum: talk or break up.

I said I didn’t want either but she proceeded to break up with me which isn’t the killer as I knew she (immaturely) did it out of frustration. What she did next thoigh has really hurt me and left me feeling worthless.

I was trying to sort it and telling her how much she means to me and how I would do anything for her and most importantly how much I love her. And she told me she has no emotions  for me whatsoever.

I get people say things in the heat of the moment but I really care about her and I don’t think someone has ever said something so hurtful to me when I have been trying to sort things, hadn’t really been in the wrong and told her I loved them moments before.

She said she wants to sort things now. I want her but I feel like she’s just walking all over me if I go straight back and there doesn’t seem to be any remorse. 

How do I get past this, or make her see how severe her words cut into me, and how nasty it is?

Or should I take the advice of my friends and simply not go back to her?

255,"Hi r/advice,   
I'm going to be absolutely candid with you here.
I'm ruining my life. I'm extremely fat, lazy and most of all I have zero self control.  
Everyday, after school I go for a 5k walk, but this does nothing because of how much I eat, it's not 'BED' but while I know it's bad for me I still have the two spoons of nutella, after that I don't study at all. Like 0 hours devoted now. I know it's bad, and that I'm wasting my days away, but I always chose momentary pleasure over longtime happiness...  
How do I gain some/any self control?

256,"To start off, I met this girl online. We are both 16 and spoke for a couple months over snapchat. We'll call her Louise for security sake. Louise told me a lot of her past in the 4 months before we even met. She had a very abusive childhood, both mentally and physically; this had led to a number of mental health issues which became more apparent over the time I spoke to her. Eventually we decided to meet up and hit it off immediately. We had a seemingly normal day and her parents seemed friendly enough, definitely not abusive on the surface. We had decided then to keep a long distance relationship because we had built feelings for each other.

 However, a couple weeks after this, she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. What followed can only be described as a breakdown. She grew distant and not a week afterwards she broke up with me because ""She wanted to be alone"". Of course I tried my best to keep her in my life but there was only so much I could do as replies got longer and longer, she eventually started to become aggressive and harsh towards me. It finally hit me that Louise was very ill and with our distance it had become impossible for me to help her without me letting her and I tried to move on with no contact with her for months...

Flash forward to last Friday and I'm very happy, I have a new girlfriend who I'm in a healthy relationship with and see regularly. Things seem to be going well. On Friday night, however, I had been on my way home from a party at about half 2 in the morning when I saw a barrage of suicidal and depressive messages from Louise. I of course panicked at first, the messages told of how she left me as she was in a bad place and didn't want to drag me into it, she felt completely alone and for whatever reason chose to message me. I still care for the girl, not in a romantic sense but more as someone who played quite a big part in my life, I spent the night on the phone with her calming her down and talking her out of her suicide which luckily went successfully. I also found out why her situation had became worse.

Basically her entire situation at home had imploded, she had been kicked out of her house, lost all ties with her older sister and gained a pretty significant addiction to alcohol and pills which eventually led to her being in hospital. She told me she has also been raped but refused to expand on what happened. She is currently staying in a practical stranger's house and is even going on a trip with him next week to a location far away for reasons she is completely ignorant to. I took everything she said seriously but also am not sure on how much to grant her due to her apparent mental issues.

I have kept in contact with her the last few days in a hope days as I fear for her life if I'm not checking up on her. My girlfriend knows the whole situation and is luckily very supportive about it all. I'm trying my best to help her out of her current living situation and at all costs am trying to prevent her from going on the road trip. My sister and other family members suggest calling the police for her but I'm unsure if that's a good idea as I don't know if that'll just cause a bigger rabbit hole for her to fall down.

Feel free to ask any questions that could help. I'm posting this for advice on what to do and also to get all of this off my chest. I'm still 16 and this is a sort of pressure I don't want at all around Christmas time, it's stressing me beyond belief but I can't just abandon Louise at a time like this.

Thank you again for any feedback or support

258,"My very oldest friend (pre-k) is in a shitty spot. While the details are long and confusing, suffice to say he is a teacher who just bought a house and had his first child and within months he was put on tenure charges. In addition, he decided to counter-sue the district for an incredible sum of money. 

He has not been paid since October, which is when he started drinking and gambling heavily. Although he's a teacher now, he went through some rough points in his life with inconsequential but consistent run-ins with the law. So, he has what I know to be a dark side. His days now consist of watching his child, but his nights are his own and from our texts and occasional nights out, I can tell he is trending towards the darkness. Last night he told me how much money he has had to borrow from family and friends in order to pay his lawyer. I'm afraid he is trying to gamble his way through this--and I mean that on a variety of levels. 

More specifically, my concerns are multiple: 
First, that there is some conversation I can have with him to help him see how destructive he's being right now (he's drinking more than usual and gambling a lot, and is also generally miserable about his lot in life) but I don't know how or whether to approach this. 
Second, that he'd made the wrong decision to fight the tenure charges (he was offered the chance to resign and settle, but decided to go to trial) and is gambling with his livelihood with no plans other than to win a huge lawsuit (that sounds like a long shot, tbh) or get his job back but be saddled in debt.
Third, that my fears are founded and he will lose in court and will end up ruining his life either literally (he's been on anti-depressants for at least 5 years and, in the distant past, has expressed suicidal thoughts), or criminally (by going back to those very bad habits he'd overcome). 

I'm torn because I have my own family and our lives are in many ways connected and have been for a long time. But any of my attempts at positivity or what I see as a more pragmatic way of looking at the situation have been listened to but not heard. I don't know whether I can or should do anything because I'm not sure it will be effective. 

Does anyone have any experience with a good but toxic friend who is at a critical point in their [adult] lives? What did you do to help? Or did you just let their lives play out while you supported them to the extent you could, however minimally?",19Dec2017,2

I'm 22 and currently in the first job that I actually enjoy. I've spent two years in a very intense job with an ""impossible"" boss, I quit and joined a company with a lot more pleasant managers.

I think as an overhang from the previous job where I was forced to be on top of my game way beyond reasonable expectation, I am now finding that as stress rides up in the new job, I am constantly thinking of work when I get home which can also lend itself to difficulty sleeping.

I'm under no pressure about losing my job and am in fact being encouraged greatly. Often co-workers react strangely when I say I think about work when I have the time to myself.

In my experience, when I have used substances to take my mind off, my work has suffered greatly. I had to train myself into keeping the working mindset the whole week to keep my professional standards up to where they should be. I fear this will be very damaging in the long-term.

270," I would currently be finishing my first semester of my 3rd year but i stopped going to college exactly one year ago, but i couldn't tell my parents. They still think i'm going.

I'm hoping to get into a college degree i'm more interested in but it's really hard to get in without really high entry test grades so that sucks too( college is free in my country so the best slots get taken by the best kids which is fair i guess)...

271,"Full story below the TL;DR

TL;DR; So, here’s my question and my need for advice: how does anyone start setting goals? 

I want to have goals set up. Long term and short term. I want to make the steps needed to succeed and complete goals I have set for myself. 


Can I ask for everyone’s personal experience? How were you able to sit down and think up what you wanted your future and goals to look like? How have you been able to stay focused? How did you know that the goals you have set are what you want to do?   How do you stay motivated, especially if they are really hard goals? And lastly, did you meet your goals? 

All in all, I’d like to hear other people stories and how they found a direction in life. I feel very alone right now.

___________________________________________

BACKGROUND:

Hi everyone. I’m 23 years old and I feel very very lost. When I was young, at different times in my life, I wanted to be a detective, an author, a photographer, a stunt double, an archeologist, a physical therapist, a truck driver and even a race car driver!! (No kidding.)  Growing up, i didn’t really have much support from the people around me (my parents were preoccupied with work and my older brothers—i did poorly in school because i would act out and had other attention issues—also wasn’t popular, nor a favorite of teachers.) so i jumped around with all of these ideas of what i wanted to be and never pinpointed a specific career, because i truthfully was not sure how to pursue that. 

Fast forward, i graduated from college with a degree in Hospitality Management(even then, i changed my major about four times), and although I love working in restaurants and hotels, the work is tiring and extremely stressful. And I know I yearn for something more.


I met my boyfriend, who is absolutely amazing and so sweet and caring. However, he will ask me what my goals are and what my future is and my mind goes blank.  All I can think of at the top of my head is that I want to be happy (I have depression/anxiety, etc. and I don’t want that to identify me) but that’s such a vague goal, and I don’t really have much direction.  I hate that I can’t give a better answer, because I can tell that it worries him that I don’t know what I’m doing with my life either. I want to take responsibility but I feel so, so lost.

THE QUESTION:

So, here’s my question and my need for advice: how does anyone start setting goals? 

I want to have goals set up. Long term and short term. I want to make the steps needed to succeed and complete goals I have set for myself. 


Can I ask for everyone’s personal experience? How were you able to sit down and think up what you wanted your future and goals to look like? How have you been able to stay focused? How did you know that the goals you have set are what you want to do?   How do you stay motivated, especially if they are really hard goals? And lastly, did you meet your goals? 

All in all, I’d like to hear other people stories and how they found a direction in life. I feel very alone right now.

276,"I'm sorry that this is going to be so long, but I need to get my feelings out there.

I think a good place to start would be with my parents. Ever since I was a child, my mom in particular would be very very controlling and my dad would sometimes be what I consider now verbally abusive (he had an alcohol problem and this makes it a lot worse if he drinks) though now he has calmed down a lot and I have opened up a lot more to him.

 I feel as the only way to really convey my eperience is through specific things I went though that stand out to me now that I'm older. My mom would always be very harsh on me, focusing on school school school, my whole life. I am currently a junior in college and when I am home I still have a 10/11 pm curfew (though I have freedom in college which I will get into later). My mom would make me sit at the kitchen table and study and do homework with her constantly checking in on me every single day of highschool. I seldom went out on weekdays, especially in the beginning of high school. I remember senior year crying to just go over to my boyfriend's house one night and my parents just mocking me asking me why I was making such a fuss. When my mom thought I gained too much weight after one year of college, she mentioned it to me almost every day that summer. In highschool I probably cried myself to sleep multiple times a month at least if not a week depending what was going on in my life. 

I remember always being very scared of my parents, they used to hit me as a kid (a remember my mom cornering me into the bathroom many times). I even remember I used to write her notes asking if I could go outside and play with my friends because I was too scared to go up to her. She is a very blunt type person, says what she thinks and doesn't understand me which I think has come from me being distant as I don't feel comfortable telling her about anxiety or issues in my life even now. I think this is associated with her having me at an older age and her own mom being very harsh on her. My parents also came from a foreign country to the United States when I was three so there is a difference in culture between us. My parents were also a lot more successful in where before coming to the US and I don't think my dad has ever actually been happy on American culture. My parents also since I can remember have never sleeped in the same bed, probably adding to unhappiness. 

I'm sure I missed some stuff, but I think that's enough of my family situation. Now I am a junior in college, since my freshman year I got really into partying and more recently into harder drugs. Now I don't drink as much or go out as much, but I smoke weed almost everyday in college and have had a few, 2-3 Xanax binges (taking up to 3 bars a day). I also tried vyvance and Adderall tho I felt those made me more productive. I think I chose to do this because my parents protected me so much growing up, I NEEDED freedom and stress relief. 

This leads me into my next topic, grades, activities, and internships. So my grades since the beginning of college haven't been the best. I currently barely have above a 3.0 (I know that doesn't seem that bad, but I feel as everyone around me is doing better). I have good extracurriculars and have had an small office job (I guess you say internship) the past two summers which I got though a family connection and is that great in my opinion. This year tho I havent been participating in any extracurriculars I because I jumped into a relationship right when school started and being with that person and the people bthey  hung out bwith increased my drug use a lot and I became unmotivated. I have been applying for internships and have been consistently rejected when looking for last summer and this summer. It doesn't help that being put down by my parents my whole life for any type of mistak e has caused my to have a lot of anxiety over interviews or even just generally talking to anyone with authority (teachers, recruiters, etc).

Now one of my family friends has connected me with a recruiter and I have a second interview this week with them for an internship, and it is looking like the only option that might work out. This would be great, except for the problem with the drug test. This company is likely to do a hair follicle test, which will potentially see weed, Xanax, and Adderall/vyvance (alcohol? I'm under 21 still) in my system. I know there are ways to get around this, special shampoo (which is very expensive) or repeatedly bleaching my hair (very damaging). If I do recieve an offer and have to take a drug test before going back to college, I would most likely have to tell them (tho I would probably only mention weed) to help me either buy the shampoo (my mom gets notifications very time I use my debit or credit card or take out cash) and would don't feel as I could go though that alone (I'm an only child). My dad knows I smoke (though he thinks only rarely), but I think my mom would be very mad and disappointed. 

Anyways, that's like everything. Any advice?",19Dec2017,1

I'm 21 and have recently graduated university. My s/o is doing a 4th year of study so I've moved back home with my mum and we're planning on moving into our own place next year. We're wanting to live in our uni city as we love the area.

While I'm excited, I can't shake the guilt of leaving my mum, whom I feel is emotionally dependent on me, but I love her more than anything. She suffers from depression (as do I), has recently split from a shitty partner, and over the course of me being at university both of her parents passed away, meaning its mainly just me and her now.

She's always used emotions to make me feel guilty, something which I'm only recently beginning to overcome. When I first mentioned moving away she was really upset and keeps suggesting alternative things that I could do and saying what we'll miss out on when I move, just making me feel more and more guilty. The only time she'll speak about it is when saying things like this, whenever I try and include her in my ideas and plans she says something that makes me feel even more guilty.

I love her a lot and when we do get along our relationship is great. She put everything she had into bringing me up, and when I think about her being alone I feel so guilty and like the worst daughter in the world.

The lady living directly under me used to be the president of the board and I asked her about dogs the other day and she immediately said oh god no.

284,"Here is goes...

I started a division for a major company. I was brought in to remove outsourcing work to a 3rd party company. The first deal was for me to write all the procedures, order all equipment, after we were ready I was going to work the projects also. I understood that they did not know who I was and they were taking a chance on me, so I accepted a lower salary than I desired. I wanted the opportunity. 
So now 2 years later I have been given 1 raise, but I am still paid as field worker. When a field worker works in the office we get a lower rate and we get no office benefits. Our field works make big bucks, and I love the field. I can not go out in the field, because keeping the group running requires office personnel. The whole company and all our clients acknowledged that I am the Manager, but I am not getting the benefits or pay as a manager, so last week I built a spread sheet of total saving my group has saved in 2017, which is over 2 million and next year I will double that number. I took that spread sheet and a letter to my Manager, asking for the Manager Position for my group and he told me to bring it to the GM. Which I did, he was very pleased with the savings and after he was please I approached him for the benefits and pay that a Manager gets. He took it very seriously and told me he would get back to me in a couple days, so now I am sitting her on day 7, but day 5 for office employees and waiting for a response.
I was wondering how long I should wait if he does not get back to me? I understand he is a very busy man and to move me to a salary position would most likely require ownership approval. I do not want to come off as a greedy, but my family and I can not live with current deal I have. ",19Dec2017,1

Second, I should've mentioned that she's my ex, and obviously we broke up pretty recently. 

Third, another symptom she's experiencing is pain on her abdomen (lower left belly if I recall correctly). So far she hasn't mentioned anything else. As far as I know she felt perfectly alright on the 15th and the days before.

Me and my girlfriend are together for 3 years and 4 months at the moment, we've been really close friends for 2 years before we started dating, I ""chased"" her a long time and didn't give up on her... until I did! On that time she realized how she felt about me and we started dating, we share a lot of interests even though we're quite different, she's the woman for me I recon.

Now, she unfortunatelly took a master degree in arts and that never got her a stable job for over 7-8 years (we're in our early 30's), now, she got a proposal to work abroad. I don't know if it's ok, but i will say the countries, she got a proposal for Ireland and we're from Portugal, she, never being able to get a stable job before accepted it. 

I always saw this as the end of the relationship, she will have a 6 months ""trial"" period, and she asked me if i wanted to try to keep the relation, trips are not that expensive or long, so, that wouldn't be the problem, neither would time since i can take off days from work fairly easily. 

Now, should i invest 6 more months on this relation and at the end she will just decide to stay and in that case i will feel even more ""left behind"" than now. Or should I take this step and not end something that may actually continue if she doesn't adapt to Ireland?

288,"So I made this friend, let's call him Mick. Mick is a nice guy and we have a lot in common (we are both nerds) but he is ignorant as fuck all because of his best friend who ''turned straight''. They have been best friends for ages so obviously, he believed that little lie but now he won't listen to me or anyone else.

I met his friend who ''turned straight'' (let's call him Jake) and surprisingly I have a small crush on him (I'm 20 and I only ever had 1 crush before) but I don't know what to do. Jake only ever told Mick this secret and Mick wasn't supposed to tell anyone. Nobody else knows that Jake was ''temporarily'' gay.

In one sense I want to expose the lie so Mick can learn that people can't change but then that'll hurt things between me + Mick and Jake + Mick. Another part of me wants to try it on with Jake in a very subtle manner and see what happens. Another part of me wants to just ignore it as Mick told me in confidence.

What would you do? Any advice?

290,"Since may I’ve been more active on discord. Chatting with new people and eventually doing some role play in PJ servers. The people that I met there were all nice, and I even met my ex-LDR girlfriend there. But she, and a handful of others that I met on those servers, had depression or anxiety. 

I never letdown a cry for help, so when they were sad, I did my best to calm them down and help them get through the days. The reason my ex is alive right now is because of that. 

But while talking to those depressed people, I kinda developed a fear of getting depressed myself.

Now, I’m healthy. Fit enough to be at least somewhat confident with my body (except my hair), I have a family that supports me, is proud of me and generally care for me, my school is doing great, with good plans for the future and of course: I’ve got friends. So Its very unlikely that I’ll be exposed to a long period of depression or hopeless feelings. 

But yet, my fear for depression keeps growing. Every step I take into improving my hobbies, every moment I’m a tinyyy bit lazy; it keeps adding up. I keep getting scared of getting depressed and losing my motivation to do the things I love, or to feel anything.

It’s not that I don’t feel anything. I feel healthy. It’s just the probably non-existent threat of that scary mental disease that has made some of my online friends’ lives miserable.

Today i asked on my class's whatsapp group if there will be an X kind of tasks in our math exam. Someone said no and one girl got annoyed and told me ""fuck's sake, you got your homework and teacher said that everything in the homework will be in the exam""


I answered with ""gee okay""


And i got pretty angry. I didn't try to put up a fight or anything but i am way more angry than a normal person would be a bout this, a normal person would probably just let it go.


The thing is, i asked her why she reacted that way and she told me she got annoyed because i asked the same thing 3 times for 3 small math exams already.


And it was true, it probably was annoying. I wouldn't be rude as her but yeah, i understand her.


I apologized (i'm trying to be as nice as possible) and went on my way. She didn't answer.


If I understand her and i don't want to be pissed about such a little thing, then why the fuck am I?


Dumb shit like this is getting in my way on a weekly basis.


I would stop being mad if she apologized, and the thing is, she really doesn't have to. I understand her side completely and in her perspective it was okay to be rude.


I just want to stop being so pissed at every little thing. I just want to get rid of that destructive personality.

Now she denies that she ever did anything and tries to claim that the window was already broken when I and another person saw her do it. Jen also emptied all of the water AND MARBLES out of a fish tank down the kitchen sink. One of the marbles obviously clogged the drain and the landlord came to fix it and  said she has to pay 100$ for the damages. Jen is refusing to pay for my window and the marble. She insists that everyone in the house pay equal amounts for her damages. I am trying to move out and into an apartment but my landlord said that the damages need to be paid before anyone moves out (understandable). I am not sure what to do and landlord's opinion is ""I don't care whose fault it is I just want it done"". What can I do?

I attend a small high school (~150 students total) and I am a senior, freshman year I dated about five girls, the last one being the woman I stayed with up until junior year about a year back. During our 2 year relationship I sort of left all my friends for her, it was just her and I and no one else. Well, I gave her everything, and she was my everything.. our breakup crushed me, she had moved on with someone else almost immediately after our break up. She’s been with that guy for a year now, and while she’s happy I’m still over here missing her. This want for her has led me to make some bad decisions, I’ve become a lustful guy who messes around with women and I am not proud of it, and because of that, it’s hard to find anyone to really talk to. Like I said before, it is a small school, everyone sees me as a bad guy and so when I try making friends no one  wants to talk to me.

308,"Greetings and salutations, fellow humans. Hope you are all having great days and your lives are going well.

First, some info about me: I am a 21 years old, african descent, homosexual man. I live in Panama and I currently attend the Technological University of Panama (The best one in the country) and I'm majoring in Food Engineering (Basically, Chemical Engineering, but focused on foods). Being suffering from Major Depression (Severe level of gravity, according to the psychological tests) for 7 years since diagnose.

As the title says, I am going to start my senior year in March and, as you could probably guess, I am quite freaked out about this.

I want to ask for a loan to continue my studies abroad (whether it be a master's or another undergrad, remains to be determined). Besides studying, I would also like to stay in whatever country I go to. This is because, as I mentioned, I am gay and would one day like to get married, have a family, etc. and, sadly, Panama is very... conservative, to put it gently.

With all of that said, I have the following questions:

1) What countries would you recommend to study at? Preferibly, if you know of any countries with Co-Op careers (That means, study and work at the same time as part of the whole program).

2) In what countries would it be easier to get a job and a permanent residence? I know in any country that would be hard, but you get my point.

3) In order to graduate my current university, I have to make a ""graduation test"". This can be a scientific research thesis, an internship in a food industry or taking two post-grad classes for a semester either here or in another country. Which one would you recommend if I aspire to get a scholarship anywhere?

I think that's all. Any other advice, experiences or anything related, is truly welcomed. Also, if you have any further questions or clarification, I would gladly answer any doubts. 

So for now, thank you beforehand and hope you all keep having beautiful days. Bye",19Dec2017,1

310,"So I moved into a house with some friends about 5 months ago. Two of the people in the house I am very close with, the third not so much. We will call him Bradley. Bradley first started to make me uncomfortable in small ways. His music was way to loud, he smoked a weed in the house, and he would often corner me to talk about politics. We disagree heavily in politics, which is fine, but I don’t want to be cornered into a conversation about it all of the time. I want to feel safe and comfortable in my own house. 

Now since I know most of the people in the house, I felt comfortable unlocking my old computer and leaving it on the main floor by the TV for people to use. They could watch sports, YouTube, or Netflix there. This worked fine until recently. Bradley started using my computer to sell bitcoin. I wasn’t entirely comfortable with him downloading the encryption software, but I let him do it. 

A few days later Bradley alluded to the fact that he had placed an additional password on an encrypted software that he wouldn’t tell me. Since this is the internet, I’ll leave it at that. Needless to say I became very uncomfortable with this. 

Then last night I found something that really ticked me off. I discovered that he had been using my personal email as a login for one of the encryption programs. I don’t know which program, nor do I care. I am going to confront him about it tonight. He is using my personal email that I have had for 8 years for something I never agreed to. This email is connected to everything. 

The advice I need is two fold:

How should I approach this conversation?

Should I be concerned about my computer and email address and do anything to protect myself?

TL;DR Roommate is using my old computer for encrypted things, used my email address to login. What should I do?

311,"So I'm not really sure why I'm posting this other than I felt like I wanted to say this. So here we go.

I just broke up with my fiancee. We had been dating for six years, we actually had our anniversary. We met each other when she was still in high school, and I had just graduated. She had her own charm and personality that I really enjoyed. But quickly she began a gradual shift, resulting her interests resulting largely in her loving all the things I love. It was almost her personal identity began to mimic mine. I know people say that when your in a relationship that you begin to share the interests, but this was completely one sided. My interests didn't revert but she just went head first right into mine. Back then I was a bit more immature and I was psyched and didn't see this was even occurring. So first question here, is it a bad  thing this happened? Should I make an effort to never have this occur again?

So we spent alot of time together, it was great but after about three years she got, for lack of a better description mean. She just got really pessimistic, and insulting. It was to the point that my friends and family started to say stuff to me about it. I don't want to give off the wrong impression, I didn't just knuckle under and accept it, it was the subject of many fights between us. This aggressive behavior continued up until the end. Also it wasn't aggressive all the time, some times she was sweet, and funny, and I loved being around her at this time. But as time went on the amount of time she was like this diminished to the point it was a rarity. 

For the actual breakup, we at this point have both graduated from college, had long term plans for moving to another part of the country/world. But this just kept causing fights, and at this time I think I was more or less conditioned to it and didn't really even know how much we were fighting. Finally it got to the point we both realized we were not happy here. She kept saying that we love each other but don't like each other, I kept asserting that I did like her but not when she was more or less cruel. We mutually decided that we should split up but she couldn't move out yet so we began alternating sleeping on the couch. We were civil here, I told her I would help her any way I can, and I really do/did want her to just be happy. 

But during this week we were living together but broken up, she absolutely changed. It was she was the best of what anybody possibly could ever be. It made me feel inspired, courageous, and like I couldn't be troubled by anything. On day three we started to sleep together again. By day 6 I had to let her know, the person she was, what she I can see she could be, it was absolutely worth fighting for. And I meant it. I wanted this, I wanted her. So I told her exactly how I feel, and voiced my concerns about her descending back into the same behavior. We then decided to give ourselves a three month trial to see if we really could be the best for each other.

It lasted four days before she went back into the same behavior. I just couldn't believe the situation. I felt cheated by life, that someone could be so good but then just fucking suck so hard at other times. I wasn't fair that I couldn't be with her, the best of her. We talked again... 

This time around I was mad. I made it clear this was what was going on, and voiced my dissatisfaction. She said we grew up, and realized we didn't like the same things, that she wanted to be a different person. (She met some new friends through work that 'alcohol enthusiasts' and like going to bars all the time, and staying out until 3am). She wanted to party like a kid who was a freshman in college, and I've grown beyond that. I'm an adult, I don't want to an immature kid again, I worked very hard through college so I could have a good life, and not have to struggle. I worked hard for the both of us, supporting her through school so she could put her best foot forward, and then she wanted to tear it all down because she liked to go drinking, and partying with her new friends.    

I couldn't stand it, I told her I was leaving her. She moved into her friends how that night. She is still coming around, and moving the remainder of her stuff, plus she had some pets she can't take and I don't have the heart to force them out so she is coming over and taking care of them until a good home can be found. Do you think this is a good idea? Us being in such good contact, being civil, and trying to do things like this to make each others lives easier even though we broke up? 

As well do you think breaking up was even the right call? I love her I really fucking do. But how can I be happy with that kind of toxicity? 

Another thing I need to confess here. After we broke up I started talking to another girl I know. Shes cute, and funny. I'm pretty sure she is interested, but when weighing my options for my relationship, when I visualized her there. Not because I feel anything for her, but it was almost like I was planning my contingency. Is that a fucked up thing to do? 

Lastly I can't objectively define my own behavior and I'm sure she would paint a different story for this reason as well, but am I toxic here too? Or did I make her like that and not even realize it? Is this my fault?",19Dec2017,5
