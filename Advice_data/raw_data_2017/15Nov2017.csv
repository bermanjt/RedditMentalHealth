0,"Today we found out that our cat (her cat really. She bottled fed it as a rescue kitten when she was 16.), has a mandibular osteosarcoma. In layman’s terms he has a cancerous tumor in his jawbone. It spreads fast and aggressively. He has less than a year at best. He’s her baby. He climbs up on her shoulder and buries his nose in her hair when we sit down on the couch to watch our shows or when we lay down to read. He’s the biggest love bug. She knows he has to pass away at some point, but she will be a wreck when it happens. Aside from the useless platitudes I’m afraid i won’t know want to say when that time comes. Any sincere suggestions or advice is appreciated.",15Nov2017,4

2,"Ok, so I don’t even know how to start. I got a nice, fluffy persian cat. We (me and my wife) usually let her play outside in our backyard where we have this huge cactus, So one day I noticed couple of neighbors kids chasing after poor Sparkles. Thought they only playing, but after catching her they started to throw her to that cactus... Neighbour is kinda muscle guy and I don’t really want to get into argument with him by shouting on his kids... so i wanted to ask should I replant my cactus into a bigger pot so it would not fell off and break in half???",15Nov2017,1
3,"This is sort of a big dilemma of living in the US as an immigrant. I moved here in early teens and and now as an adult, I don't know a single person who went through the same experience. My biggest fear is losing my native language and I want to find people who are in the same situation of having lived here king enough to be ""americanized"" and have their lives figured out, while also not losing touch with their native cultures.

4,"I'm in a law class in a highschool that I attend.  We have a trip coming up to the Supreme Court in my country to sit in court for a day.  

I was fairly excited for this at the start of the course, now not so much.  I've learned that law isn't something I'm interested in, and it's just one of those 'please let this be over' kind of classes.  

  I've become disinterested in the trip and I actually have no friends in that class (we have to walk around in groups/pairs for the trip).  I haven't told my mother this, and she seems intent on me going.  

The obivious thing should be to tell her, but I'm nervous to.  I'm afriad she'll pull the 'this is a once in a lifetime opportunity' thing.  

I just need advice on what to do in a situation like this.

6,"Shaking as I write this. 

I have a neighbor (lives 20 feet from where I sleep) who screams constantly, paints in red blood “killer” “sos” and has painted his car and walls red, put 100’s of pounds of garbage in our back street, and lastly personally calls out me and my neighbors saying things like “white people need to die” and “I’m gonna burn those places down”. I have pictures and audio of this all. 

I have literally called the police 10+ times and called multiple mental health organizations but literally NOTHING is getting done. I am 100% positive that he is undiagnosed and he has barred his entire property. Whenever the cops DO come, he says get off my property and they just leave, no questions asked. 

I have no idea what to do anymore. I spend all day terrified and no one seems to be doing anything to help this poor guy. I just got off the phone with the police who said “if we DO take him in and he’s not crazy, then we get charged for kid napping.”  They told me to record his yelling and take pictures, but now they don’t want them. 

My family and I are terrified and feel we have run out of options. Does anyone know ANYTHING I can do? Sadly I don’t think it’s goinf to end well, and I have tried all I can to help this person.

10,"Hi guys. As the title describes I’ve had a case of mono it’s this past week has given me thoughts of ending the make it easier, although not as serious because I realized it would pass. The pain was excruciating and I went to the UC twice and ER once.

Now I’ve come back from home to college. The one day I feel slightly well enough to take the make up exam for the math exam I missed, I failed it. I mean 0. I couldn’t do one. And I review stuff from the unit but all of it was the most recent stuff we learned and nothing else between this exam and the previous midterm. 

It’s genuinely all my fault and I fucked use bad. And if I had a chance to mitigate my fuck up, it was swallowed up by mono. I mean ffs I’m not even a ladies man, I’m a fucking virgin who’s kissed two girls in this semester. 

If I fail I will lose my scholarship. I will lose my work study. My family will look at me as a giant failure and piece of shit. Granted they’ll still love me and treat me well enough for someone who’s done what I’ve done. But I won’t be able to look at them the same.

I might have to go to community college after this. My whole plan of at least making it decently at this rather nice university is all fucked. And I want to do anything to make up for it but standing in my way will be mono symptoms that will still last for month. 

I’m so fucked and for the first time I don’t see how I can realistically crawl out of this shit hole. I’m lost. I’m truly terrified. Within the span of two weeks, everything I’ve worked for and loved has slipped through my buttery fingers.

I hate myself and I hate life. And I’m scared and terrified. And I don’t know who to talk to. I know I deserve an ass whooping but I feel so shitted in already I can’t possibly face my mom right now. And my sister will just look down on me with no sympathy. She acts like she’s a compassionate older sibling but she could give two shits, it’s all only familial obligation and expectations. 

TL;DR how do I unfuck myself when I have fucked myself over and been fucked by life at the same time and will continue to be fucked for the foreseeable future?",15Nov2017,10
12,"Long story short, divorce because crazy dad, still crazy dad has the support of most of his family, crazy dad sends us texts about how my mother is fucking our cousin (she is not.)

Anyway, crazy dad stalks her when he can and has broke into the house twice(divorce is not done yet), once to get in and the other to install a nest camera in the basement. After catching him steal and hide some of her possessions (money from coin bank, laptop, coat) he denied all of it I said i'd kick his teeth in and he calls the cops and tells them I was going to kill him. He has popped my mothers tires all 4 of them and poured sugar in her gas tank.

FF to now he has been living with his parents (and his girlfriend) coming to the house to scare us and creep us out, we do not trust him and we are going to do everything we can to have his guns/his ability to own guns taken away, he has tried to get into the gun safe twice in the past(while this was happening and he still lived in the house) we are scared and everything he sends gives me crazy anxiety. We do not talk to him and we try not to reply to his insane texts (he has literally accused my mother of walking through a wall to hide her fathers stuff) he is fucking crazy.

I am his son of 21 and I am terrified for my life my mothers life and my sisters life, I've had enough, I want to beat the crap out of him but it wont do much for me (he tells his family he's the victim) so he will just win if I do, my mother has tried to get a PPO (Personal Protection Orders) but because she's in the divorce process she cant.

**I may have missed a few things but what can we do about our situation?**

EDIT: My mother has been sending everything to her lawyer.

15,"So my Gf has some problems, as do I, and we try to work through them, but recently it's been seeming more and more hopeless. Shes normally an amazing person, but when these problems come up, I feel like she's manipulating me by threatening to leave, and I have to beg for her to stay.  We can talk for hours about this, but when the problems come up, nothing I've said in the past changes. 
I feel horrible for having to leave her because of emotional problems she can't control (because of childhood trauma), but I'm beginning to feel I'm at the point where I cannot take it anymore.  Despite how amazing of a person she normally is, I feel I can't just sit here and wait for the next time she gets set off. 
So my question - I know it's coming, I know I'll have to do it, but how do I get through it? I know when it happens it'll kill me, I'll constantly worry about what could've been, and obsess over our past.  I've been through this before and it was awful.  I actually met my current Gf shortly thereafter so that's kind of how I got through it.  I'm worried i might not even be able to go to work and school, and get through day to day life.  Any suggestions? 
For the time being, I'm going to try to make it work, but ultimately in the end I know the odds are against us. 
Also if you haven't inferred by now, yes I'm gay and I'm from an area where that's looked down upon, so I feel like my chances of getting someone else are very slim. ",15Nov2017,2

But then last week on Thursday she just stopped responding to me with out any reason the last response I got from her was on Friday night and to be frank I was high and I don't remember much from that night other than the snap saying something about ghosting because one of my previous snaps had asked her not to do that. So here we are its been a few days I don't contact her every day because I feel it would be rude and I'm still not sure what to do I have a message that I worked on to ask if we were still a thing but I'm hesitant on sending it. Btw I'm only 19 and this is my second relationship that has gone to dates and us spending time together. Any help would be welcome I'm just not sure what I'm doing here.,15Nov2017,2

I think of this situation when I have sex with her. I had an argument with her today because of this reason. Both of us are broken hearted now. And now she tells me that she is not going to talk about her past - ever. She is being honest with me everytime but when she talks about her past sexual relationships, this problem occurs. I know I am wrong. I know it is not my business. She didn't even tell me it was not my business when she had right to say this because she knows that this would hurt my pride. What is wrong with me?

27,"My 12 year old fraternal twins (boy &amp; girl) have presented me with an unusual gift request for Christmas. But first, a bit of background.

They've been watching Fuller House on Netflix, which led to them watching the dvds for the original series, Full House, as well. Recently, they saw that episode where Stephanie and DJ are accidentally handcuffed together and don't have a key. My kids say they're curious about what it would be like to be stuck together like that and how challenging it would be. They've asked me to buy a pair of real handcuffs (not the toy kind with the safety release). Once they're up and dressed on Christmas Eve morning, they want me to handcuff them together and leave them like that until Christmas morning, a full 24 hours later. I'm to give them the key then, so getting free will be one of their presents.

I have to say I think it's cute that they want to spend that much time together, even if it's in such a weird way. They've figured out a way to handle the bathroom issue, so that's not a concern.

Hello,

i am 8 months pregnant and i am living in hell, i have also been diagnosed with. depression which does not make things easier. My biggest dillemma is naming my baby boy. He is my first child, i am not married and my current relationship is ok considering the name issue and my depression. My partner and i love each other very much, are very attractive to one another and have maintained our physical contact to 4-5 times a week.

Please read carefully and help me decide how i should proceed. My boyfriends father had a very difficult life, his parents and borther were killed by the communist in our country, his father was tortured as well and was put to prison for many years. Despite his struggles he managed to move here to the states, create a family and have 3 children who he named after his father, mother and grandmother. Now they want to name my son after his brother. My boyfriend does too. My boyfriend and i had an agreement to name our son Dorian but after he visited his family he has come with an ultimatum to either name our son sokol or he wont be in his life.

i have the following reasons why i am against the name: 1) i want to name my son somethimg that doesnt represnt pain and suffering since the name belongs to the brother who was tortured and murdered on his 24 birthday. I also was sexually assulted at young age by a neighbor named sokol so my personal experience with the name is not plesant. 2) the name is also very old, does not have a meaning and i feel my son deserves better 3) my uncle has the same name as well and my side of the family is not happy as well due to having believes  that if you name a newborn after a living person is like cutting their life short. 4) we also have beliefs that if naming a newborn after someone that had an early death the child will have the same luck..
i have explained the reasons to him, his father and his mother, but the ultimatum continues, last night he told me i Better move to va with my mother to give birth. I moved to fl for him and his work under the impression we will get married , build a family.

Besides all my reasons, i wanted to make him happy and involved i offered to use sokol as a middle name or just name  the baby  after my boyfriend father. His dad has had a hard life but long and he managed to overcome a lot of hard obstacles and for me he is a true Hero. My boyfriend refused both options..

please tell me what to do. I am a product of a failed marriage and my dad wasnt around, i dont want that for my son but i also dont want to name my kid a name that will only bring me sadness and worry.  I feel guilty i am not able to please his family and him but the expense on doing so is tremendous to me. Please help me, do i move as he requested to VA now or after birth and hope once he meets his child he grows up, matures and is more understanding.  If i move and he doesnt want  to be on my childs life do i give my kid his fathers last name ? 
All i ever wanted was to have a family for my son but now i just dont know at what expense?

32,"Hey Guys,

I'm a little confused on what I should do in this situation, to set some context I've been friends with this girl for about 9/10 months now and met her through a mutual friend at a party. We talk quite often but recently she's been a bit hot and cold with me, she goes from ignoring my messages to spamming me and tagging me in stuff in facebook etc. She even calls me when she has problems going on such as anxiety and invites me to go and visit and stay the weekend with her at her uni.

But this last week she called me at about 2:30 but i couldnt answer since it would wake up everyone in the house since we have thin walls, i messaged her the next day asking what was up and if she was alright to which i got no reply, even a few says later when I tried to start a conversation I just got the cold shoulder

35,"Making this choice is really hard, I would do both things if I could. I know I still have time to think about it and the future ""me"" might be able solve this easily, but I really want to have a goal in mind since now, so I can start to work towards it.


A little about me: I am a 20 years old dude from Brazil that works as an Junior Developer, in the next semester I will be graduating in Digital Games but I don't know exactly what I will be doing after that. My main goal in life is to immigrate to Canada, so I am always studying ways to get more points in the Express Entry (their immigration program).


I have two options to increase my chances in the immigration program:


  1 - Saving money for 1 or 2 years and paying an Canadian College to graduate and work there;

  2 - Getting an Master's Degree in Computer Science (or other related field) here in Brazil.
    

The first option would take me to an industrial path... I would program more (my passion in life) and make more money, but I wouldn't do researches (my second passion in life, maybe).
If I went with the second option, I would have do quit my job and stop to program. I would make no money too. But I would be able to meet new interesting people and spend a lot of time doing researches.


I am strugling because the things that I want to do are splitted in both paths. In my head, the perfect scenery would be me with an Master's degree that would help me to build better software, that would allow me to make researches and also facilitate my entry in development companies.


I don't know if this is possible, though... I have so many questions...


Do researchers program? A master's degree will make me a better programmer?
Would I be able to make researches while working as a developer?
There are developers who program while researching and also get paid?

40,"This probably sounds stupid as fuck and I do realize that but I wasn’t sure how to word it. 

So I bought 3 hamburgers from Whataburger, one for each of my friends and me. I paid the full price for all 3 at the first window. Rolled up to the second window, waited a bit because it was busy and got my hamburgers and drove off. None of us checked the bag before we got home because we just assumed it would be fine. It wasn’t. One one of the hamburgers wasn’t there. Like seriously, there were only 2 in the bag. I checked double checked and triple checked.

41,"I apologize now, but this will be a sort of long post since it's been going on for some time and there is a lot to it. 

The Problem:

So I am 26 years old. I have started my third college degree now to become a paramedic. I have only two semesters left and I will test out. My grades are good and I study all the time. I have a job as AEMT-CC in NYS currently and am working to finish my clearance to work as one on my own on an ambulance. The only problem I am having is the person who is in charge of me in the ambulance hasn't been the most... helpful or friendly towards the transition. This includes my being informed by multiple resources that they have been calling my many names and telling other providers, physicians, and nurses that I am terrible, all the while not feeling it necessary to discuss any issues with my care.

To make matters worse, they are partaking in my education side of things as both a preceptor and instructor. They are considered a well-liked and competent medic in the community and they hold a wide variety connections throughout that I fear will actively harm my reputation in this field. 

What I need help with:

So I don't know what to do. My first degree is in communications and I really liked it, but it seems I don't have many options where I live and I earned it back in 2013 and haven't done anything with it. After I completed it I went into the Army to be a journalist and ended up a combat medic, which then after leaving I decide to pursue, which is where I am now. 

My work history hasn't been the greatest since there. I worked at one job for over 2 years and left for one ambulance service and then jumped to the one I'm at now after only a few months, because of the distance and work environment. Now I'm not sure I want to stay here because I can already see how people are treating me differently. 

I've considered restarting in public relations or I have tried to do work online as a freelancer, but my resume hasn't gotten any bites. I've even branched out to other possible job opportunities to no avail. 

I keep just telling myself to finish this degree and go from there. I tell myself that I can just make it a few more weeks and then I'll have a break from it and refocus myself. I tell myself to listen to all the positive remarks I've gotten from my other preceptors and keep trying to improve myself. I just can't seem to take much more though.

Each day I get further and further into a dark hole. I keep growing more anxious, depressed, angry. I consider seeking help but remember that I don't have insurance to do so since I've only been at this agency for 5 months. And I worry every day I may be fired and lose my health insurance even if I do get it. (My boss has a tendency to fire people for no reason.)

I have no friends right now to talk to and I find it increasingly difficult to make any. I'm kind of secluded. When I talk with family, they either tell me to suck it up or tell me that I'm the issue and I need to figure out how to do better. They think I'm being a bum and not settling one career. 

I seriously am lost at what I should do professionally, personally, and emotionally right now and any advice I can get will help.

It took us over 9 months to find and hire this employee and if they are fired then we will be back to where we were before, which means no possibility of me taking vacation time in the next year, no possibility of me taking sick days in the next year, and no possibility of me keeping the shift that I waited two years to get. It would mean returning to hell working overnight one day to come back 8 hours later and work through the evening the next. If we get audited this won't look good for our management, but I'm not in management. ",15Nov2017,2

And I asked her Sunday night and about going to one Monday and she said yeah. Well Monday came and she supposedly slept too late. So we were going to go to one today at the same time as the one yesterday and the same thing happened although she didn't say anything she just read my message and didn't reply unlike Monday when she said that she slept too late. I honestly can't tell if she's trying to get me to just stop, or seeing if I continue to ask to see if I'm persistent, or if she just didn't know what to say and just read it? Also I'm not sure if it has anything to do with anything but the day me and her went to eat that same day one of her friends followed me on instagram, and I posted a selfie for the first time and they both liked it just about simultaneously and she didn't follow me at the time but she liked the pic before you followed me.

65,"Greetings. I'm not sure if I should continue college or work for Norfolk Southern. I'll give some info on both.

College:
Currently in community college with 3.8 GPA. I have one semester left until I finish. 
Will study finance if I continue college and transfer. My goal would be to become an investment analyst. Probably wouldn't get this job out of undergrad and would have to continue for MBA plus tons of debt.

Norfolk Southern:
Start as conductor, about 42k in low cost of living area (housing 23% cheaper than national average, overall 13% cheaper). Moves up to 55k in 5 years.  After about 7 years from start, become Engineer and make 80k+. I did the math - could retire after 10-12 years of working here. 

So... Work hard and take a large risk for the possibility of obtaining my dream job (investment analyst) or take my offer at Norfolk Southern and retire early?

67,"So I won't bore you with all the details as to how my mom came to live us, all that doesn't really matter. What does matter is that me and my Husband love her very much, and want her to be happy and comfortable in our home.

That being said, we're having a little bit of a problem.

When my mom came to stay with us we set up our entire upstairs for her. She has a bedroom to herself, and an entire living room equipped with TV, Roku, couches, recliners and all that stuff. We set this up so that she could have her own space upstairs, while we could maintain the downstairs for ourselves.

Things were going really well for a few months, but now lately she has been spending more and more time downstairs, and is kind of crowding our space.

Again its not that we don't want to spend time with her, its that we are a fairly young married couple, and we need our space to live. I can't really think of a good way of talking to her about our need for space without sounding like an asshole.

I often feel brain dead, that I literally have nothing to say and it makes me so self conscious and upset with myself. I have a bachelors and was in debate club, and have done a tremendous amount of research while in school, do a lot of reading, however I feel like if you asked me to talk about anything right now I wouldnt know a thing. I dont think I absorb information, I dont feel motivated or passionate about things. I really am struggling here.

 I often just feel a lot of anxiety and dread all the time. I was given a warning today by my manager that I'm not hitting my goals and in a week she needs to see improvement or I think she will fire me. I have been working in this industry for 3 years, (technical recruiting)  but I just can't really talk about it intelligently, or understand the big picture (systems level) or be innovative in how I do my job. Is this some kind of mental deficiency? 

I feel like every piece of information and idea is just a fleeting light that passes through my head, and I never even have much to talk about with my close friends/boyfriend. In meetings I just sit there thinking most of the time how I need to SAY something or ask a question, and instead of being present in the meeting I waste time worrying about that.

Im very sorry for this long and boring stream of consciousness. I have never put this into writing or talked about this with anyone and I've felt this way for a long time.

78,"I don't really know how to classify this problem, but I feel pretty guilty even asking about it. On paper I **should **be really happy.

**What's good:**

- I have an amazing job. Really. I work at one of the top companies in the world and I make around 200k a year. I live pretty frugally, so I can probably retire in 15 years (I'm 32). Work stress isn't even that high and I can get up in the middle of the day and go to the gym. It's rad.  
  

- My family is great. They live far away, but I am really close to my parents and brother. I had a good upbringing.

- I'm healthy. I run marathons, power lift, and do a few exercise classes a week.  
  

- Mentally, I'm pretty sound. I meditate daily, read stoic books, and don't let the day to day stuff affect me.

**What's bad:**

  
- I've had about half a dozen relationships ranging from 4 months to 4 years. They've all ended for one reason or another and I generally haven't let any of them hang on to me except one, we'll call her Diane. Diane was two girlfriends back and I can't seem to shake it. We broke up during a tumultuous time and I rejected her when she tried to reconcile. I can't forgive myself. She was a beautiful person and the one I felt closest to. I haven't seen her for over 3 years, but for some reason I can't get over her. I'll go on dates, even see someone for awhile, but she's in the back of my head.  She reached out one time, but when I tried to rekindle things I got shut down hard. She lives across the country and I know I need to let go of this.
  

- I'm lonely. Point blank. I've always been someone with friends, but now I'm 32 but I feel like I'm living the life of a 45 year old with kids...but I don't have anyone. No kids, no wife, no girlfriend...My friends are all far along in relationships or living across the country. I live in the suburbs of a major city, but I can't seem to meet anyone at a similar life stage as me.

Fast forward a few months, i still don't know what the hell i want to do but i heard about computer science and thought maybe i would like it. I'm into technology, not sure if i'm THAT into it but i thought hey it's better than just doing whatever. I found out that to become a computer science major you have to transfer schools within the university. I had to take two classes that require a minimum of a B- in one and a B in the other. I had alot of personal issues going on and now it seems that this quota might not be reachable for me. What i'm worried about is the fact that i might not be able to transfer. I have to pick classes and i dont know what to pick since what i pick might become completely useless to my degree and i might not graduate in time. When i ask my advisor for help all he says is that he doesnt know a thing about the other school at all and i should get help from them. When i try to get help from them, they're either unresponsive or just plain out unhelpful. I have to pick classes yet i dont know what to pick, i dont know if i can even transfer and i'm so stressed. I am so unhappy at the college i am at but i have to stay here because i pay chump change for the education i get here. I just hate everything about my life right now and i seriously don't know what i want to do. It's so hard just going through college not knowing what i want to do. People tell me oh you will find out by trying out different classes and switching majors.

In that time, he manipulated me, was emotionally abusive, lied compulsively, and (the part that is most relevant to this question) sexually assaulted me on more than one occasion. Because we were dating and I was 16, I did not have the guts to come forward about it to any authority figures and have been dealing with the trauma since. On all three occasions that this happened, he started by asking, then proceeded after I said no and tried to get away.

Fast forward to 2017, and I am seeing the #MeToo campaign trending on social media. While I personally did not out myself (I'm not proud to say that I was afraid people would not believe me), many of my friends on social media did. On a number of these posts from friends, James* posted impassioned speeches about the need for men to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their actions. I saw his comments, as well as an [article](https://johnpavlovitz.com/2017/10/16/men-side-metoo/) he shared to a mutual friend's facebook page regarding the responsibility of men in all this political turmoil. A few of my friends who saw this and know about what happened with James* texted me to ask if all of this keyboard activism was an indicator that he had admitted his wrongdoing and apologized to me, which he had not done at any point. My question has two parts: 1) in your opinion, does this behavior suggest that James* knows what he has done but has not been able to bring himself to speak with me about it, or does it suggest that he is unaware of what he has done and truly believes he is helping? 2) Do you think it would be constructive to me, to him, or to both of us for me to confront him on facebook about the issue? I no longer have any of his other contact info so FB is my only choice here.  

Edit: I would be messaging him directly, not for everyone to see. ",15Nov2017,6
99,"Hi I am a 13 year old female and I am currently in 8th grade. So I have this one English period that makes me anxious and here is why. There is this guy that is always flirting with me. Ever since the teacher made a new seating chart, he started with calling me pretty being he was nice, and I guess he saw that I didn't really know many people so he started to talk to me ( he sits across from me by the way..). I am pretty much a loner at school, cliche, but true. To be honest I kind of liked him complimenting me until he called me hot, says he tries to look good for me etc. . He has also been stacking my chair for a while, since the class is suppose to stack chairs at the end of the period. I don't know if I am getting dramatic here, but today he started to get really close to me and then all of a sudden he smacked my backpack. This kind of made me a bit uncomfortable and scared that he might try to smack my bottom next time. I don't even know if it's the teenage hormones or if he actually likes me because I am not skinny and don't think I am very attractive either. I know this middle school drama can kind of get annoying, but I need some advice as soon as possible.",15Nov2017,1

So far, I have only been to one of them and it only included a friendly game of poker and watching some movies. The ones where I wasn't there, I was informed that a lot of drinking and vaping was involved. This is not something that I am interested in at all. I do not want to waste my life at such a young age especially considering that I have already been suicidal several times and am one of only a few people on the team that actually tries in school.

106,"This is my first post on Reddit so sorry if I do something wrong. 

I am an 18 y/o f and a freshman at my community college. My dream job is to become a visual effects artist (possibly working for a higher up studio one day), but I am struggling with where I am supposed to begin. 

I came to community college and am currently working on basics for an associates of art degree, but I am becoming frustrated and restless (basically stuck like every teenager thinks they are), so I am looking to apply to the Savannah College of Art and Design for the 2018 Fall semester. I am planning to major in Animation there. I understand it is fairly expensive but I guess what I am asking is; is it worth it? I know what want and I am not afraid of pursuing this career so should I go for it and take on the debt or should I look for a cheaper option? 

I feel like I would receive a higher and more quality education if I attend SCAD due to my plans for my career. I also always hear so much praise for this school and feel that it would help my chances by receiving a degree from such a credited school. I also see such a potential for networking by attending an art school instead of a regular university considering I will need connections to be successful. Am I wrong by thinking all of this?

118,"2017 has been one of the hardest years of my life because I’ve been suffering with depression and anxiety. I’ve never dealt with this before this year and it’s taken a lot out of me. My parents have been my rock alongside my best friend since high school. But then there’s my other best friend who is so close to me that she’s like a sister. When we first became friends, she was the best friend I had always wanted. I had just gotten out of a very toxic friendship so it was nice to finally have someone that I can actually do things with without feeling bad about or had to pay for it later. My best friend since high school is amazing but it’s harder and different since she is now married and doing her own thing. This best friend made me feel like I could do, say, and laugh at anything. Then this year happened and depression kicked in and suddenly she thinks I’ve changed. But in reality I believe she has, when we became friends she was dealing with panic attacks and loneliness. Then I came along and helped her through it. Now that I’m going through one of the darkest times in my life, she has no interest in helping me. She’s told that “I’m finally happy with my life, I don’t need you negative energy around my happiness!” So I would go through anxiety attacks because she pushed me away but suddenly care back saying “I’m your best friend and you need me!”
She would literally do this to me multiple times throughout this year alone. Each time worse than the other. Then we had a heart to heart and things were looking up and she was helping me. Then came along her boyfriend and now she has no interest. She ignores my messages but only wants to hangout when her boyfriend is working. She’ll tell me “you really have nothing to be depressed about...” and “my boyfriend suffers through anxiety worse than you so you don’t know”

132,"TL;DR I'm afraid of going outside that something bad might happen. I've no need to go outside, and I stay inside all day (mostly sleeping now, often taking care of my little bro or working on homework from online classes). I'm scared of going outside sometimes (murder that happened on a lady near park where I lived 2-3 years ago. Read about serial killers in class, known 2 people that have gotten raped near where I would have to walk), scared of that.  

Have had anxiety that some people even thought I was mute, and don't really know how to socialize since I've always had my sister there at school). I get scared of talking and don't have a way to drive or socialize. 

This semester I've basically stayed home all day (mostly taking care of my little bro), but lately I've been feeling tired and between either motivated for a while (where I feel I'm more active and talkative, but also more anxious), or either feeling fatigued and down. Sometimes it even spikes up to a very fear-point. Other times I feel 'dull,' or sometimes I just sleep all day (sometimes don't even feel like eating. 

I haven't really had a 'need' to go outside; so far, I haven't had a job yet, even though I've tried applying to a couple in the past. They wanted someone with a flexible schedule, but having no driver's license and no car really limits my options. I still live with my parents (traditional Mexicans, where a daughter stays with their parents until they get married). I help out with the house and my little brother (he's awesome). I'm taking online classes atm, so I don't really have to go outside.

I'm actually really anxious of going outside, especially if I have to do anything alone (since I can't drive yet, I go to wherever someone else goes somewhere). I don't feel safe when I'm outside. I'm especially scared of going outside and walking by myself (short, built like a twig). I've known of 2 people that have gotten raped (1 someone my age when I was ~17), and I remember having read 2-3 years ago that a lady was murdered in the park right across from where I lived.

Since I had really bad anxiety that I didn't speak much when I was younger (to the point of people thinking I was mute, even after years of having me in one of their classes), I never really socialized. The only people I have talked to occasionally once in 
a while is in the Internet.
 
Anyone else have also felt this way? How can I convince myself that I'm not going to get raped, or even murdered, or that something bad is going to happen? Some days are okay, but others are too much. I'm not even sure how to socialize anymore...like what to talk about, how to keep a conversation going. Sometimes I feel as if I have alot of energy, or it is easier to talk, but then I talk or message tooo much, I feel. And I'm not sure if that may drive people away or not.

140,"I am a 22 year old male and my girlfriend is 19.  I have a job lined up straight out of college that will pay close to 100k.  The nature of the job means that I don't know exactly where I will be placed, but it will be in any one state capitol and I will end up staying there for about 2 years before moving again.  I have very limited say in where I go.

My girlfriend is taking college classes, but doesn't have a plan for which major she wants to have.  She is at the point now where she can't take any more general education classes, so she would need to choose a path to keep taking classes.  She doesn't know what she wants to do, besides nursing, which she was unable to get accepted into due to the cutthroat competition here.

We have dated for about a year and a half, and she came to live with me this past summer when I had an internship on the other side of the US.  Since then we have lived together at college.  We work really well together, and I want nothing more than to keep living together and moving forward with our relationship.

I want to have her come with me to my job and either take classes there, or put off the degree for a while and find a job where she can learn things, but she is terrified of the idea.  She says that she doesn't want to be reliant on me and that she wants to finish her degree as soon as she can.  She says that it's easy for me to go because I have something waiting for me, while she has nothing.  She is terrified of the total lack of stability if she comes with, and I can understand that.

The thing is that she doesn't even know what she wants to pursue as a major, and if she doesn't come with me she still doesn't want to stay where we are currently because the college isn't offering her any opportunities that appeal to her.

The alternative is that she finish her degree over the next two years and we go long distance.  This just seems like a non-option because we both feel like living together is doing us both so well,  our relationship is always growing stronger when we are together, and being long distance for two years is a nightmare.

I believe that since she doesn't have any direction in college anyway that she should take to opportunity to live in a new place with me and continue our adventure.  She is digging her feet in at the idea, but I don't see a better option.  Worst case scenario she doesn't find a perfect path there either and she only delayed her college path by a couple years.

151,"Hey fellow Redditors, throwaway account because the people involved know my username. Need some advice about how to manage this situation and, if nothing else, to vent a bit. Brace yourselves for a long post! 

Just to be upfront, I’m looking for advice about how to help my siblings who I love dearly and NOT financial advice (although the whole backdrop of going downhill financially and my parents not exactly having the health of fit young adults probably adds a little bit of stress to the whole situation). I know and am sorry that there are families out there who are in worse situations than us, but I hope this doesn’t undercut the perceived severity of our situation. Also, I tend to worry a lot so let me know if I need to chill out about certain things :)

**Background on our family of 5:**
Dad owns family business that did well once upon a time but has been struggling for the past two decades (will probably only last max 5 years tbh) and Mum started working in retail a few years ago to supplement our household income but together currently still only bring in &lt;$50k after tax. Both have some health problems. 
Older sister (23) is about to graduate from uni after studying something she doesn’t like - she doesn’t know what she likes - and I don’t think she’ll be finding a solid job anytime soon, although she currently has a casual job in retail. 
Then there’s me (21), who’s approaching my uni graduation too, and am pretty much guaranteed work (earning &gt;$60k pre-tax) in two years’ time. 
And, finally, my younger brother (19) who is pretty much working full-time at a local fast food restaurant after giving up on tertiary education.

**Older sister (23):**
She hopped around different uni courses, failed some units but is on track to graduate at the end of this year with a passing grade (partly the result of studying max 1hr a day, with the exception of pre-deadline all-nighters). 
The course she’s graduating from is all about networking and making connections, getting work experience, all the ‘typical’ business sector stuff. BUT she didn’t do any of that – went to a couple of expos halfway through her degree and decided she wasn’t interested so hasn’t gone to another networking event since. 
She doesn’t know where/when she can/should apply to for graduate work but that doesn’t bother her because she’s set on trying to get a Head Office position at the retail company she’s working part time in. She thinks the main barrier to getting that Head Office position on graduating is getting her manager to like her – the problem to me is that she’s been working with the manager for half a year now but hasn’t made much of an impression at work (she admits that the manager probably sees her as ‘just another casual worker’). 
I’ve tried tactfully asking about any potential back-up plans but she just explodes at me and answers “I DON’T KNOW” then doesn’t talk to me for days… 

**Younger brother (19):**
Finished high school last year and didn’t get marks high enough to get into uni. To be fair, he was working part-time for the last 3 years of high school (~30hrs a week) but even then he studied 0.5hrs/day on average in his final year (*cough* online gaming *cough*). 
He applied for a college nursing course but failed his first semester since he studied even less than when he was in high school. 
Earlier this year, Dad became fed up after telling my brother to stop playing and to study several times so he turned off the WiFi modem when my brother was in the middle of a raid (online gaming mission). That made him rage and move out of the house abruptly that same day. He didn’t come home for a few months until my heartbroken mother’s begging finally convinced him to come home (I’m angry at him for doing this to my parents – Dad really regretted turning off that modem). 
Now, he pretty much just works full-time at a fast food restaurant and does nothing at home except sleep, eat, game and Facebook. We’re obviously a lot more wary about even bringing up his bad habits now… 

This situation has been going on for a long time now but has been particularly tense over this past year with my sister about to graduate and my brother’s acts of defiance. I love my family very much but my siblings don’t listen to be because they think I’m a “genius who can’t understand their stupid minds” (even though they’ve witnessed me studying hard throughout high school and uni – generally 2-5hrs a day, often at the local library – while maintaining only a minimal social life. I even quit working part-time to focus on my uni studies as they got harder, and have constantly reminded my siblings to study). Dad’s very hesitant to bring up the issues properly anymore after what my brother did and Mum’s just scared of losing any of us.

Thanks, keen to hear what you guys have to say!

TL;DR: Sibling woes that I and my parents have no fucking clue how to manage from here on. Feels like we’re falling down a hole. Please help.",15Nov2017,2
152,"Let me clarify, I have seen doctors in the past but never like this. For example, the last time I saw a doctor was when I got into a car accident and they just checked if my arm was broken (5 years ago). I had a family doctor when I was little but never got regular check ups. I am now 22 and I'm scheduled to see a new doctor who is supposed to become my regular doctor. I have a few little things I want to mention, like strange moles or bumps I've developed over the years, but mainly I'd like to talk to her about my worsening anxiety and depression (which I have never been diagnosed with). 
I've never done this before and with my anxiety I'm freaking out. What can I expect? Should I tell her everything I've worried about health-related over the years? What do I do",15Nov2017,2

I have an essential role in the company as it existed yesterday, have been there for a year and a half with a good salary and options, and have some faith in new leadership. I'd like advice in a couple of areas, honestly:

1. Should I go to work today (first day of missed pay) if I think the company has a shot at life after this transition? 

2. In the event that I really don't get a paycheck but the company doesn't cease to exist, can I collect unemployment? What documents should I ask for/try to access? ",15Nov2017,1

How can I meet girls, because let's be honest, moving from a small town of about 3,000 to an English city of 40,000 is going to be a big change.

160,"Some context about me before I begin male 24 and I'm extreme lonely and have no self worth and possible aspergers.
I have a life time of trying to make friends or any form of relationship that always end in me being or feeling like the most injured party. this has lead to many ocassions where I've had some kind of..derogatory selflessness such as not eating because there is people who need it more even or sleeping on the floor so I'm thankful I have a bed. The most recent attempt of starting a relationship  was the catalyst of taking counciling at the university which made me realise just how much of a burden I am/think I am. I currently feel I have no redeeming quality except from ironically my problem is that thought days where I thought about some doing pretty grim shit and haven't done it for even weirder reason such as my decaying body would be unpleasant for others as I live alone currently and that is how people will find me. is that in order to stop from getting worse to all out apathy and possibly self harm it means I can't can't get better as all my emotional energy is on not getting worse. So which bring me to my reason to posting how do I balance  my energy between keeping myself alive and trying to give myself self worth.

161,"I moved overseas back in May. I was able to get a job-seeker visa in order to live in the overseas country while applying for work. However, after 5 months of applying, I have yet to land a job. *(...a little bit tricky; whatever position I apply for has to be 'skilled labor' so I can't just snag a retail job, or work at a restaurant for instance...and although I am confident in my resume, there are some cultural difference, and I am not a native speaker or super-fluent speaker of the language there)*. So with the cash-flow running low, and not wanting to take an under-the-table job, I decided to come back to my hometown in the States to do the following. Get a seasonal retail job to get some money going; enough to cover my bills for a few months while I keep applying, and then head back overseas.

However, I got a job offer from my previous employer; teaching at a college in another city and state. I am considering the position because I would be able to pay off my car with the money I make from the school....and it would give me some more time to improve my foreign language skills - these are the pros. *(On my most recent stint overseas I had a car that I was paying for while it just sat in my parents driveway...didn't love that feeling.)* Some cons though: I did just leave this other city, sold all my belongings, etc.... and so I have no place to stay there, and would need some kind of furnished apartment or guest room to stay in. The job is not full-time, no benefits, and I would need a second job because the cost of living in this city is particularly high. So it isn't exactly a cake-walk to say yes to the offer.

Another big factor:

I am in a relationship, and my boyfriend is currently living and going to school in this overseas country *(he is a national there)*. Agreeing to the teaching position would have us doing the long-distance thing until May.....which really doesn't feel good for us.

Anyway, the end goal is always to return overseas-- just a question of when. Should I get back there sooner as I had originally planned, and keep on applying....or do I hold off until the end of May after teaching in the Spring semester?",15Nov2017,1

164,"Hello I am a 23 year old man and I have been in quite a rut for the past year and half. Cut back 2 years ago I use to be incredibly ambitious and hard working, it was to the point where many of my friends and those close to me would call me a workaholic. All my focus was on my education and job I had at the time which was pretty good. I had a very stable relationship and we had just moved in together but it didn't last very long and we ended up breaking up, leaving me with the embarrassing moment of having to move back home as I was pretty upset and didn't have anyone else to be a roommate to split expenses. Right after that breakup I completely drowned myself into my work, it was literally all I did. Personal projects, staying late at my actual job you name it. I was on break still from University and was about to transfer to a new school for my Major. I later lost the job I had simply because my contract had ended and while I was hoping I'd be kept on longer it simply didn't happen. After that I spiraled and became very disinterested in everything, my insomnia had come back so I fell even deeper into a hole since all I'd want do was sleep but barely could. After I started at my new school I had no friends there and I found that the friends I had made at my last school barely communicated with me. I've never been the type to be shy or have a hard time making friends but for some reason I just couldn't bring myself to be social. I'm unsure how but my grades weren't all that hurt by my mental state but I was (still am) by no means doing the best of my ability. I finally decided to pick myself up and get back to where I was, It has been an extremely slow and steady process. I am working again and am now in a relationship once more. However I have habits from my sob story that simply will not go away. I still find myself not wanting to socialize much at all, I'm finding it hard to fall in love with someone who at times feels far more into me than I am into them even though I feel there is nothing wrong with the relationship or her. I want to be back to where I was, I want to be able to feel excited and ambitious again. While my life is under control at the very least right now I don't feel as though I'm really living, It's almost like I was just sort of forced myself back in line to keep going, just getting by as they say. My insomnia is still here and I suffer greatly from Racing Thoughts every night mostly awful ideas that my life is fleeting and I have no time to waste. Self deprecation about how awful I am to myself when I know what I am capable of. So what do I do? Is this something I simply need to wait out? Have I just become jaded?",15Nov2017,3

I can never talk to them because they either lecture me or don't listen to me.  If I have something due or I need to be somewhere early and it will be extremely difficult without a set of wheels, they don't care, they won't let me take the car if they don't think I deserve it.  Same with my cell phone and a lot of other things they've gotten me which they convince me I own, and that are mine, but suddenly they can take them away.  In fact, things I ACTUALLY own they still take.

168,"I've been a consistent A student my whole life. When I was in 6th grade, I was bullied and I developed panic disorder and acquired depression from the experience. I've moved schools since then, and I'm a senior in high school now. I think I'm getting a relapse, though, and things are looking bleak for me. 

So, throughout this semester, I did absolutely no schoolwork whatsoever. I know it's my fault, but I couldn't help it - I tried to work, really, but I couldn't find it in me to concentrate or do anything. I've lost my sense of purpose and I think I'm slowly detaching from everything. Deadlines don't faze me. I don't see the importance in a lot of things anymore; I've been neglecting my relationships, my health, and my responsibilities. 

I'm afraid of everything. Everyday, I hop on the car to get to school. As my dad drops me off, though, I freeze, or I get hysterical. I cry hard, or I just feel like I can't move my body. 

I dropped out of school two years ago, too. I moved to this new school nine months after that, and I've already adjusted well to it. Please help me. I don't want to give up on all this.

171,"I'm a shemale and my supposed friend who I hung out with knew about it. The thing is she was always flirty so I assumed she was bisexual. I did enjoy it, being able to act like that with someone felt good but she was really using me just to try and... well...

She kept begging me to go clubbing with her and I finally agreed, while there, guys that would approach me would be pushed away by her claiming I'm her date tonight. I didn't really care much and we basically got wasted. So since I was pretty bad, she had our friend take us to her house and I stayed the night there. So when I wake up I'm tied up to a pole in her closet for clothes/hangars. It's actually pretty high so I was on my tippy toes. 

She came over happy as can be and I couldn't say anything because she had tape over my mouth but she acted as though I actually asked for this. She started stripping me till I was in my panties, then when she pulls out my dick she says I'm so huge... then when she pulled my panties off said I smelled down there. And as if she was being sexy when she peels my skin back she says, I'll clean it for you. 

And she gave me my first blowjob. Midway I even started whimpering like a dog because I was enjoying it. Then when she finished I was literally like a corpse because I felt so weak after all the cum that came out... more than I ever seen in my life. After that she didn't instantly let me go, but she did when she wanted to know if I wanted to fuck her. I left of course and I haven't answered any of her calls or text since.

This was supposed to be my friend but tbh, I feel like I was raped. Despite if I was in the moment or gave the wrong signs I'm really upset. What exactly should I do though? My sister thinks I should just tell the girl what she did was wrong, that it hurt me, and we can't be friends. But I'm shaken on what I should do exactly... honestly I don't have many friends so I'd maybe forgive her eventually.

172,"No real idea on how best to phrase this so I'll just dive in here.

I'm fairly good at reading other people's emotions, and in general I'm well liked,
I have a terrible habit of sleeping with random guys that I know are interested in me - not looking for sex, not out of any particular attraction for them - but when I can tell someone is flirting with me I'll play along, and when I can tell things are starting to take a different turn, it feels like I'm just - floating? along with things. There's a voice in my head that says well, its just my body, its not me.

And when we have slept together I have no actual attachment to them and I'll turn them doqn, which also wreaks havoc on my life because I live in a country where casual sex is not very common, and the majority of these guys are friends with a bit of a crush who are so hurt by all of this in the end.

Why do I feel so completely disattached from everything about my body when it comes to sex?? I regret it afterwards, its hurting people that I care about, and twisted and awful. What is this?? I'm never looking for sex before hand, not going out to party and met people, there's just a switch that flips in my head when I can tell someone is trying to sleep with me like a detached sense of 'eh, why not?'

(i ocassionally watch gurren lagan and naruto) they make fun of me for watching anime (even though a bunch of other kids watch anime) all the girls think im creepy. now ppl are starting to make fun of my friend for talking to me. my friend even said that last year, he even avoided me because of what other ppl were saying about me. the only reason he started talking to me was because his brother got him into anime over the summer and he needed someone to talk about anime with. although anime has made ppl hate me a lot more, it is the only reason why i have those 2 friends. even a lot of the anime fans at my school hate me. everyone started hating me since middle school. to prevent this from getting long, im just goign to quickly explain middle school. i had not gotten into anime yet. i had no friends. everyone made fun of me for not having any friends. i might have been a little creepy but i have learned from my mistakes. in middle school, all the guys would say ""shutup nobody likes you and you have no friends"" and all the girls would say ""ewwwww get away from me"" (i waset even doing anything) some would even joke around and sarcastically say ""woah, can i be u?"" i spent the entire lunch period sitting alone. if i tried to sit at another table which had a kid that i was psudo friendly with, the other kids would ask me to leave or just get up and move to another table. that kid who i was psudo friendly with wouldnt say anything to help me out or say it was ok for me to sit there. i was just sitting there alone. engulphed in lonliness. kids new that how shitty things were and even joked that i would become a school shooter. despite the fact that i wasent the kind of person who collected weapons. all of that continued in to high school. it only changed a little. i dont have lunch with any of my friends, so i just stay in the libary. all the girls still think im creepy. so toady, i was with a large croud trying to squeze through a doorway to get to the next class like everyone else. then there was this girl and her friend. since it was crouded her friend was about to bump into me. before she did the girl grebbed he friends backpack and yanked it with yer away from me. when the friend asked why, the girl said, ""because of him"" it was me though. later in a club, there was a bag of candy on the table where ppl were taking from it (the club has snacks) i had gotten there before the girl had. i took out some candy like everyone else was doing while i was doing that i heard a different frined of hers asked why she wasent getting any. she said ""because hes already went in it"" i dont get why this girl hates me so mcuh. we kind of disliked each other in middle school, but last year when i found out she also liked anime (she even approached me) i was nothing but friendly to her. but then she started hating me a little bit after. that girl is kind of ugly so it upsets me that someone who is kind of ugly would try to avoid me even though i wasent even interested in her. this is just one of many examples of how everyone hates me. whenver im not in school, i seem to make friends. whenever i go on a cruize, i always make a lot of friends. the only problem is that i never end up seeing them again. i get their numbers but the conversation dies quickly. every time i made a friend, they end up not lviing anywhere near me and i will never see them again. so basically everyone hates me. they think im a creep and a weaboo. my friends are being made fun of for talking with me. all the girls are disgusted and creeped out. how do i get i girlfriend? i need a shoulder to cry on. a person to huggle with. what should i do?

please dont give one of there answers:

just join a sport team or club, youll meet a lof of ppl there. i already tried that

hang out with ppl online. i talk with my guild on discord sometimes. ppl online dont give a shit about others irl

high school can be hard, just wait and things will get better. that isnt helping my situtation

get a job. i have already applied, didnt get a call back

hang out with your friends and you might meet their friends. one of my friends is antisocial and has no friends, the other's friends would hate me

hang out in public places and you might find someone. i dont have a car and nothing is within walking distance

90 percent of teens arent dating. that just a fake stastic

anything else that involves things ""getting better"" out of nowhere or some other shitty answer

183,"Hey everyone,

I'm 18 and I have came to a point in my life where I feel as if I've dug myself a hole so deep that I won't ever be able to get out. I have no motivation to even attempt to repair myself anymore because every single other time I've tried I have just failed and made my situation worse.

The problems started in the 9th grade when I started doing drugs and hanging out with ""bad kids"". I was kicked out of school but eventually was able to get my HISET, which is pretty much the same as a GED. That's pretty much the only positive thing I have done since 9th grade. 

Now I'm going to list my problems and issues and I really do hope someone can relate or has some good advice. I'm literally disgusted that this is what my life has turned into.

- I'm currently couch surfing because I can't stand to see how much I have disappointed my dad. He's always done everything he can to help me and has been there every time I needed him, but I have fucked him over and let him down too many times to count. I'm done letting him waste time and money on me for no reason.

- I don't have a job. The last time I worked was probably over 6 months ago at a gas station. I have applied to 10-15 places since then and have only heard back from one, and I ended up failing the drug test. I live in rural Iowa about 40 miles from the nearest city, so there aren't many jobs in my area for an 18 year old with no experience. 

- I recently defaulted on my car loan because I don't have a job. I still owe more than the car is worth so I can't sell it. This leaves me with very limited transportation options and is honestly the biggest obstacle with finding a job.

- I have a drug problem. I use to do a ton of psychedelics and pills and weed, but about a year ago I started doing crystal meth. I stopped doing pills and very rarely smoke weed anymore but I use meth on almost a daily basis. It's not that I fiend for it and spend all my money on it, it's just that I have a hard time turning it down if it is offered to me. Not to mention I don't have any money to spend on it anyways.

Any advice will help. Thank you.

193,"I bought a loft bed a while back from IKEA. I thought it was really cool because I could walk under it so I ended up setting up a TV and couch underneath it. The only problem is that my ceiling isn't high enough so its really awkward to move around when I'm on top of the bed. I finally got around to cutting it down a couple days ago (and stabilizing it more as well). I absolutely love it because I can now comfortably move on the bed. The only problem now is that I keep hitting my head when I'm under the bed (almost twice a day). My head hurts a lot and I'm feeling dizzy even as I'm typing this. 

Any advice on what I should do to? Throwing the bed out is not an option (I'm too far invested). ",15Nov2017,2
194,"I find my self talking at no one after remembering random parts in time when I wished I could've changed what I've said and I just start thinking out loud not caring if the people outside my window or my aunt with her friends right next the other room is even hearing me or those living with me, I also do find myself doing this when again I'm in my room and see something that I have a strong opinion on IDK if this has any correlation. I found also that I'm a paradox I find myself hating the world, having no care what happens to it even thinking about smiling in the thought of watching people killing themselves or me killing them but the next day I feel hope and optimism well up from me but return again the next day. I've lost sight of who I am after trying to imprint characters in certain medias being as they are the only role models I have in my possesion and because I feel so distant from my parents - The other one literally and metaphorically the other just metaphorically. Now I really just don't know if I should be optimistic or cynic. I'm alone at school and at home well not literally but its not like nobody there isn't fucked up like me but I just don't feel like I can connect to people- I can't even look them straight in the eyes and talk properly. I wanna get better but I always return to my distractions ( eating,browsing the net, hating everything and eventually liking them again then returning, and some other stuff I'd like not to mention)I do think its just a lack of care and reason because if I'm building up to something I think ""What's the point of building when you know nothing matters and its just a means to an end."" -which I also think is a distraction and a poor excuse but I also thought that because I thought working hard at school,getting a diploma,then a job, possibly a family so that I could have a kid to do the same shit over and over again up until we just meet some end I've also once when I was at a moment in my life where I found one of my family member crying and hurt I cried but in amidst of my crying I thought ""Why am I crying, I'm not sad nor hurt nor do I feel anything right now"". This always happens when I cry, I shed a couple of tears experiencing a tiny bit of emotion then I revert to stopping completely. I've thought of killing myself a couple of times and I don't know if I'm afraid or hollow I just feel a sort of nothing and it doesn't help when I think of nothing and no one when reviewing it in my head if there is any reason I shouldn't kill myself.

197,"Ok. Weird question I know, so hear me out. The other night about 12pm walking home through the inner city, I was staring at my phone and I suddenly heard what sounded like a spray paint hiss on my head, along with a can rattling and a gust of I *think* air. I swung around and sort of growled ""WHAT?"" and some young dude , maybe mid 20s, leapt off and ran away. Before I could think to take a photo or anything, he was half way down the road and then gone.  I slinked back home thinking I was covered in spray paint, but I had no stains or any sort of marking, just a slight itchyness to my face. I'm figuring he ran when he saw the guy he sprayed was a hairy bearded 40yo (Friends tell me I like like a hells angel on bad acid when I'm tired), and not.... whatever he was expecting. I decided I couldnt have been arsed calling the police.

But so many questions..... Was the guy trying to spray paint me? Was he trying to pepper spray me? Was I being bug sprayed by one of the local schizophrenics? But whats driving me nuts , for some reason , is was this an assault, or attempted assault?

I'm baffled as to what to make of it, or what to do about it.",15Nov2017,2
198,"This story is going to be tough to summarize but.....

I'm a 37 year old man. There are two women involved, S and R. I've known R for about twenty years. I recently find out R has been in love with me for this entire time. R is married with three children.

I got out of a five year relationship with another woman in December of last year. I met S on a dating website a few months after that and we hit it off hard and fast. It was around that time that R came back into my life after not seeing her for many years.

S was very bad for me. She was very careless with her actions and I struggled very hard about it. R helped me through that extremely dark time. At one point I told S we had to be done, but 24 hours later she was messaging me and begging to come back. I'm still seeing S though I've reframed the situation and I feel much healthier about it now.

For my birthday a couple weeks ago, R took me on a trip. We got a hotel. We ended up getting drunk and fucking. 

R wants to have a conversation soon about where we stand. She expects that I want her to divorce her husband and start a life with me. That's not what I want. I'm not particularly physically attracted to R and very much enjoy my time with S right now though I do see both of them very regularly.

If R finds out S is back in my life, I'm afraid things will go very, very badly indeed. I believe R has the potential to go off the deep end in a dangerous way. She is infatuated with me and believes S is long since out of the picture. There have already been a couple of close calls where S was spending the night at my place and R almost came to visit in the middle of the night. 

I am anxious and feeling suffocated. I know I fucked up badly. I need to figure out how to let R down as gently as possible without causing more damage than I already have.

200,"Quick summary: I'm 21, I moved halfway across the world for uni and when I started, I was extremely excited; I was doing Computer Science. I never had a huge passion for it but both my parents are work in Silicon Valley. 

Fast forward, I have failed my CS courses and changed majors to Logic and Computation &amp; Statistics (double major). I have no idea what I'm doing now. My major feels obscure and half-assed. I'm enjoying what I'm learning more than CS, but for some reason I still cannot get good grades no matter how hard I seem to try, and it's extremely frustrating.

When asked I'll do after uni, I have no idea and this terrifies me about my future. The only interesting thing I've found relevant to my major is AI, but it's incredibly specialized and I feel my interest in it is very superficial.

Additionally, I've had a hard time making friends both in my major and also in general. I have an SO but I miss my friends at home most of all. I hate it because my parents have supported me (financially and emotionally) through so much failure and I feel so bad for wasting their time and money. How can I reinvigorate my love for learning and motivate myself again?",15Nov2017,2
201,"My girlfriend of 6 years recently drunkenly cheated on me, we're breaking up because of it as it's not the first issue like this we've been through and we can't make our relationship work. But I don't know how to live without her. She was my best friend, one of my only friends, and I'm hurting so bad. We had so many plans for the future. 

She has a lot of mental issues that lead her to behaviour that harms our relationship. She insists I didn't do anything wrong and I'm not to blame but I can't help but feel like I failed at being a good boyfriend and maintaining a relationship. 

I've dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression before but over the last year managed to work out of it, it's only now I'm afraid I'll fall back to how I used to feel. I'm terrified of what might happen now I don't have someone to support me like she did.

I'm especially struggling with imagining her and this guy (who was a semi close friend of mine) together and all the things they did, she told me everything that happened to give me some closure, and although it could have been worse and more intimate, it's still driving me down thinking about it every other minute.

I'm also struggling with not texting and messaging her daily, I just want to talk and see how her day is going, despite what has happened. I'm totally addicted to talking to her but she says we shouldn't talk or it'll make it harder, I can't imagine it harder than it is right now.

I'm incredibly embarrassed of myself wanting attention and help, but I just don't know what to do and I don't know how long I can live with this physical and mental pain.",15Nov2017,151
202,"So i have been with my girlfriend for roughly 4 and a half years. She is smart, loves school, anime, video games, and is gorgeous. I consider my self a lucky one. However her sister is a complete mess. I look after her sister as if she were my sister, and everything she does infuriates me. Not like the normal things, her bothering me, messing with my stuff, not any of that, thats fine with me.
But before i get into the details of the things she is doing, keep in mind that this has been happening, at least to my knowledge for 2-3 years. She is currently 18 (i know she is an adult now technically but im afraid she is going to ruin her life if she keeps going down this path.)

Instead of telling a story thats about the length of a harry potter book, im going to just make bullet points. 

- 2 years ago, age 16 she was literally asking guys for sex straight up. she was just way to immature for that, and i feel was heavily influenced by what she sees on tv and music she listens to. I never actually thought that worked on people.
- Maybe just a little under 2 years ago she dated a dbag, that did drugs and all that other garbage, but thankfully he broke up with her. found a used condom in her room. (at least they used protection?)
-  1 year ago she started dating this guy named (name change for the sake of privacy) Sterling. He very seldom went to their house, was quite when he was there and was overall pretty mysterious to me, her sister and her parents.
- through out these 2 years, my girlfriends sister would constantly lie about where she is, who she is with, and what she is doing. LIKE A LOT. 
- Sterling isnt going to school, doesnt have a job, and more recently found out he is now selling drugs. He doesnt hide it either, he post on snapchat asking in easily encrypted code if people want to buy it, also showing the drugs on video and pictures. 
- Even more recently, yesterday in fact, i found out that my girlfriends sister got pregnant by sterling, and also got an abortion in secret. The girl just turned 18 like 3 months ago.

I dont know what to do with her. She goes to therapy, which doesnt seem like it helps at all because she has been going to therapy for as long as ive known her. Ive told my girlfriend to talk to her, but she says she wont listen. She has an obsessive personality to those that give her attention, making her blind to the situation at hand, and apparently sterling is just as obsessive if not more.
I personally think, this relationship needs to end for the betterment of their health and life. They are both sad people (i believe they are depressed from what ive been told, but thats been the case since before they have been together). How do i show her whats actually happening and how her life can plummet so fast if she keeps on going? she is really just starting life and has so much potential but she is throwing it away. any real suggestions would be a great help.

205,"I’ve had the same job for 10 years. It’s a horribly depressing job that makes me cry. I get picked on, yelled at, abused but the pay is good and the hours and conditions are easy. I was run over a few years ago so my hips don’t work to well... the sort of clack/pop and I walk funny if you look close. Problem is - I took out a house loan... the mortgage is 30-40% of my income. I want to sell and live somewhere small and have a stress free job but can’t save enough to feed a wife and kids for 3 months in advance. I contemplate running away... just walking away. I’m happy just doing nothing in my life but you can’t own a house or car without money. I cry on the way into work. I cry out. Today I started at 4:45am... it’s the worst. I won’t get home until 8:30 pm. I’m old - 33 so it’s too late to retrain and I’m shy so I get yelled at a lot. 

I just need to know... does it ever stop? When you finish your home loan does it stop? When your kids move out? When you change jobs? 

I just want to end it all none of it matters anyway and even with a wife and children, friends and family I always feel alone. Always. I only sleep 3 hours a night because I just don’t sleep.

He also saw that she was camming with older guys which broke his heart and even sold vids and pics, easy to set up  with Amazon, PayPal etc to fuel her own sex cam addiction cause in life as in online sex you get what you pay for. He approached the situation badly and told her mum and granddad even the cops who didn't investigate cause the mum wouldn't let them as he hadn't convinced her enough just rushed in emotionally.

After trying to do the right thing he realised he left it to late, she started after just turning 11. she was enjoying it now and more in control after making mistakes as we all do in life.

208,"My mom has been in the hospital since October 17, briefly was in a medical rehab where she was almost back to normal, then crashed and went back to the hospital. We live in a small area between a few states. They had to transfer her to a hospital in another state, less than 2 hrs away. She needs a new heart valve. Surgery should be today. I haven't been to see her yet because she's been sedated the whole time, but as soon as she's aware, I'll be there. I have to keep working as long as I can. 

I've been living with her and her bf in a tiny one bedroom apartment, I have the living room to myself, sleeping on the pull-out couch. They have to walk by me to get to the bathroom and kitchen. I don't drive, her bf is the only one with a vehicle. I give him gas money out of every paycheck and he takes me to and from work and anywhere else I need to go. 

Last Sunday I was sitting at the computer (his computer, in the bedroom) and he came up behind me and put his hands all over my butt and sides and said creepy things. I got up and went to the living room and immediately texted my bf (he lives with his parents) and he came and got me immediately. I've spent the last few days here in the guest bedroom, his parents don't want us in the same room (we're in our 30s, but whatever, their house their rules). 

This was only a temporary solution. Me and my bf can't get our own place until he can get his own car, he uses his mom's car, she doesn't want to give it or sell it to him, so the only way he has a car right now is to live at home. 

I've had the last couple days off, I called off Monday because I couldn't sleep at all. Monday is my Friday. It's the second day I've called off this pay period, I can't afford to keep doing that. 

I have to go back home tonight. I'm creeped out and scared. The only thing I can think of to do is lay down the law of how things are going to be. I will be locking the bathroom door every time I'm in there. I will not let him cook for me any more (just in case, drugs). The only way I'm not telling mom immediately is if the Dr says she can't handle the stress. He's going to know how fucking lucky he is that I haven't pressed charges YET. 

I've been getting creepy vibes from him for long time, at least since she's been in the hospital, maybe longer. And a few months ago I had a dream that the exact same thing happened. Then later I had another similar but worse dream. My bf really doesn't want to take me back there. 

Creepy texted me and said it won't happen again. He said ""sometimes I just need a hug and to be forgiven."" I said ""never touch me again, not even to give me CPR."" He said ""got it"" and hasn't contacted me again. A friend of mine (who is disabled and living in another country and can't physically help me) said he doesn't sound sorry at all. I think he's right. If he was that bold once, what's to say he won't do it again or worse? I think the only reason he even tried to apologize is because he realized he can't afford to live alone. 

I take a bunch of medications, now that I'm thinking about it, what if he drugged my main supply I left there? 

He always seemed so mild mannered and always acted nice. He's been a heavy pot user for most of his life, it seems to have affected his brain quite a bit. How scared do I need to be? How dangerous is this situation?

210,"I’m 18, graduated from high school in January of this year. I moved twice since then, and have been working low-paying jobs since around March to pay my bills. 

I’m depressed &amp; suicidal (have been for probably 4 years now), have general &amp; social anxiety, and ADHD. This causes me to have so little energy, motivation, and focus that I barely function at work, let alone be able to learn things and go to college. I can’t remember a damn thing to save my life, and did poorly in high school because of it.

I don’t have any friends irl, and very few online. The loneliness is really starting to affect me. I prefer to date online because it’s easier to meet people that way (and I have social anxiety so it’s hard to meet people, let alone talk to them.) I basically date anyone that will give me affection and attention even if I’m actually pining for someone else. This has caused pain to the people I date, and one of my only friends has told me this is a real problem of mine.

I also don’t know what to do with my life. I’m not in college, partially because of money problems (can’t afford tuition, and I can’t afford to not work at least 40 hours a week) and also because I just have no path. I don’t have any special skills, or even basic skills for salary-type jobs. All I can really do is work in retail as a cashier and restaurants serving food and cashiering. 

Yet I don’t want to work at Target my whole life making $10/hour. I need a job that is able to pay the bills *and* let me have at least some money to spend. Right now I can’t even afford food because my account is 100% drained after monthly bills.

How can I gain the skills I need to find a higher paying job, or work with what I have to do that? I can’t be a cashier until I’m 80. I want an office job or something that’s secure and maybe at least somewhat enjoyable.

211,"Please excuse me for being a little scatterbrained in my explanation here, but clearly articulating a mission statement is, after all, one of the challenges I'm facing here.

I believe that there are certain environments under which people are more likely to thrive in developing a certain skillset. If you want to be a writer, for instance, knowing that you have a userbase eager to read anything you've written is a great motivator for writing more frequently. I believe there's an inherent challenge in this, however, where people who want to become better writers are not necessarily motivated to actively engage in and read other people's work, people in the same boat, since it is not a very effective use of their time.

Now, I know, communities like r/writingprompts have a good setup for this, but I feel like this community has it's own trappings in terms of encouraging really quirky ideas over, maybe, developing writing skills that will move people in a direction that extends beyond the  universe.

What I like about their structure is that it has an element of collaboration embedded into it, which I feel is hugely important. They also bypass a potential issue surrounding collaboration by... how would I put it... not creating scenarios where one person may be forced to work with someone they are not really enthusiastic about working with. Ideally, you want a lot of people to kind of lightly mingle with collaborations, and then create an environment where people who find that they work well together can gradually ease into more time-intensive collaborations.

A lot of these ideas come from when I was young and got kind of hooked on rpg'ing. I feel like there is an inherently addictive structure embedded in a community where people's work becomes increasingly dependent on engaging, in some way, with other people's work. I want to take this property and run with it, with the express purpose of providing an environment where people can constantly talk about their works in progress, and contribute to other people's conceptualizing of a project with their own concepts that they feel may compliment said project.

I feel as though this is potentially a structure that is not specific to any one field, but is rather a method of kind of applying the social rewards principles of gamifying education. If, say, a person is trying to become an artist, and is working on a painting, if they had a forum for which they could just spill out all their musings on what they're trying to accomplish, or even just abstract thoughts in their head associated with this painting, and other people engaged with it by posting their own concepts that they are working on, which they feel may or may not be related to the original poster's ideas, you could end up with a collaborative atmosphere for a solo endeavor.

One of the ideas I'm experimenting with for this is a re-structuring of what s are for. I feel like there are some trappings to s that are either positively or negatively critical. Mind you, this whole idea is to create a space for works in progress, or collections of works in progress, so you're going to stumble across ideas in their infancy, still in their incubation period, and not really polished in a way that the person might feel they can release it to the public. I am not opposed to the idea of criticism shaping someone's work at all, but I feel like it might be more productive to have a dynamic where post contributions are more collaborative than critical. This, I feel, is particularly important before you find people whose ideas and motivations really mesh with your own. Ideally, you would want to create an environment where you're not really trimming your vision down to what other people think, but finding people who have ideas that may compliment and build on your own. I have considered the prospect of having a single rule for the subreddit that dictates that s to threads which are either positively or negatively critical will be removed, and also by finding some way to explain that responses to posts that are kind of non-sequiturs are encouraged.

That said, then you have the complication of possibly forcing a community to do something it might not initially buy into. On one hand, you don't want to be a tyrant in an area that's growing beyond your initial vision. At the same time though, and I don't mean to spend my time here bashing r/writingprompts, but I do want to create an area that specifically stays on the task of being a good place for cultivating skill, and not just creating an area that people just like spending time in.

This would be an area for amateur painters, writers, podcasters, youtubers, filmmakers, and other groups, as the community grew, to explore their own ideas and the ideas of the people around them. A place where collaborating, both abstractly and concretely, was built into the structure of the system and would ramp people up to working on more ambitious projects and allow them to collaboratively mingle with a wide variety of people until they found a couple that they really connected with, kind of like dating for artists (not, like, romantically, but dabbling until you found people who you have good collaborative energy with).

Anyway, any thoughts you have on this whatsoever are welcome. I'm here to listen to your ideas, and if you are a creator of some sort, what do you think you would value in such a community?.",15Nov2017,2
212,"My fiance cane forward to me yesterday that she slept with her co-worker and now i honestly dont know what to do. We live together with her parents as they're old and originally i moved out of my own place so I can help the family. She's been great most of the time besides her being very wasteful financially. Lately we've had a lot of arguments over her habits and its caused a rift between us. On top of that, she is a very expressional person. Im not one to always express myself but I always do my best to take care of her needs whether its take her to work, or get her something she wants. The downfall is I havent been very expressive about how i feel for her because we've been having such a stressful time. She works two jobs and i have a full time job + school &amp; i like gaming, a habit she feels i should drop to spend more time with her. 

Anyway her history is pretty bad, she's a rape victim, her ex bfs have all either cheated on her or emotionally abused her, her parents never supported her... especially her dad which often considers her a failure and she doesnt have much friends because they either moved away or talked bad about her behind her back. 

This leaves me as her only emotional support crutch and lately I guess I havent fulfilled that roll so she started getting friendly with her coworker and eventually that led to sex.

Now shes a crying mess, telling me she does this because she hates herself and she jus wants to die. Part of me doesnt want to leave cause Im truly afraid it'll kill her but part of me says I cant stick by this after what happened. This is really my only 2nd long relationship and despite knowing her for 10+ yrs (dated almost 3 so far) this really sucks.

I got tired of this and got irritated, saying how she never bothered to make time to attend. Cue insults at my person, instead of logical arguments. We stop talking for awhile. A beings dating D. 
M, J, A, and D have a bunch of classes together, so they hang out in them. 


September 

M, J, and I talk about D. I say I could fight him (Kidding around, not serious) . On a different occasion I see him in the halls, and I notice his legs looked weird. I asked A what’s up with D’s legs and she says nothing and seems offended, so I apologize and that’s that. 

Apparently, M and J told him I said I could take him in a fight, and A showed them all the texts where I asked what was wrong with his legs. D takes offense and begins to insult me, saying many things, such as how irritating I am and how much of a fa*got I am. I had never actually talked to him, and when he said these things it was to M, J, and A. They admitted to letting him say these things and not telling him to stop. I learned about these things in November. 

October

I texted A saying I saw D staring at me so I lifted my eyebrows up and down, in the way you would with a friend, and winked.
Here is the reply from A’s phone which D was using (I know it makes no sense first, I was confused too. He pretended to be A to trick/confuse me). 

Me: I saw D staring at me so I lifted my eyebrows and winked (laugh emoji)

D: At lest I don’t drive to school with my mom 

Me: What? 

Me: (as I realize he must have her phone) Well your mom bought you your car, that makes no sense

D: Haha nice try buddy, my dad bought me that car

Me: Whatever

D: Hey sorry D took my phone! 

Me: Yeah I figured. Why was he acting like that? 

D: He was mad cause you keep insulting him (I had talked about his legs, and said I could fight him at this point, neither aimed at insulting him, neither meant to reach his ears either) 

Me: What?! I was trying to be friendly!

D: (No response) 

A: (Many hours later) Hey he took my phone and was really mad at you. (Insert lame conversation)

Me and A pretty much stop talking after this incident, not because either were mad we just didn’t really have a reason to as we never hung out, and had no classes together. She later got mad at me for no longer inviting her to events with M and J, but said herself that she enjoyed being offered even though she knew she wasn’t going to able to make it (She was referring to future events, how did she know she would never be able to make it...? Whatever I guess) 

November

A and I talk one final time about how she thinks I would die in a fight with D, I joke around saying no way, he would die. She takes offense. Somehow this escalates to her saying that I have a huge ego and she knows people who hate me. Cue me deciding to stop talking to her at all, as all we do is argue.

A week or so later, In talking to J. J tells me two of the insults in September that D was spewing. I get mad when I hear he called me a fa*got, as I cannot stand that insult in general. I react much more strongly than she expected, as she was about to list more that he said but refused as she didn’t want me to get even angrier at D. 

I was mad at three things: 
1. He was insulting me behind my back, to my friends. 
2. Said friends did not defend me and let him say these things, but defended him and said he was joking/laughing while he said it. 
3. The most I ever insulted him was “dirtbag” which isn’t exactly an insult in my book, more of an expression of irritation. The fact that I never actually insulted him, yet he insulted me, was not cool. 

So I asked J what else he said, and she refused to answer. I then decided my best course of action was to report him to the school, and have M and J testify that he did say these things. J laughed in my face, called me insane, and then launched into a rant about how D calls everyone fa*got, that he was kidding, and about how it’s so hard to talk about anything to me as it’s like walking on eggshells with what she can say. 

My feelings were seriously hurt when I heard he was saying these things. It got even worse after I asked J if she and M told him to stop, and she said no. I then transitioned to anger, and then to switched from “I’m going to fight this guy” to “I’m going to report him for bullying and leave it alone” but after such a foul reaction from J I have hesitated.

I don’t know if this is bullying, M said he was kidding and that it’s all a big misunderstanding. In my eyes, you can’t jokingly call anyone a fa*got if you’ve never talked to them or even know them. Not to mention the insults that she refused to tell me about, as I was already going crazy in her eyes. 

So that’s my question. Is this bullying? Should I report him or confront him? And a side question, should my friends have stopped him from saying these things?

218,"I'm currently 2 months into my first year at university studying mathematics. I generally enjoy all the maintenance tasks that come with living independently such as washing up, shopping, etc. I've also made quite a few close friends.

However, I'm really not enjoying the course and struggling to keep up with it in terms of both work load and understanding the content of the course. Because of the amount of work it means i haven't been able to join any clubs (i know if i really sorted myself out i'd probably have some time but I'm still young and learning how to manage everything). On top of all the work i have, we've now been set coursework to do over the next month. I'm really not living a balanced life and the time spent not in lectures/tutorials is spent very stressed out with work to do outside of contact hours.

It's all just a bit too much for me and recently i've been considering dropping out. I only ever saw uni as the only option but after my first couple months the idea of getting a job, starting my career and earning money looks a lot more inviting. I'd consider swapping course but i can't really think of anything else I'd want to do. The only reason I chose Maths is because i was good at it at school and found it easy.

I don't have bad grades either (A*'s in maths and further maths and an A in biology at A level), so maybe i could get a job at a good company?

I would appreciate any advice and happy to answer any additional questions. Thanks :)",15Nov2017,3

224,"Hey Reddit. Weird personal problem here..: I'm a F (25) and I live in a shared apartment with two other people. One is a F (23) and the other a M (23). The girl and I are clean, not clean freaks, just your average girls who clean up after themselves, don't live in filth, like things tidy and try to maintain a basic standard of cleanliness always. Our male roommate, however, is a plain disgusting. Let me paint the scene... He's very nice and keeps to himself and is holed up in his room most of the day... but the smells that emerge from that bedroom are just gross. Then, when he walks by you in the hallway or you're in the kitchen together, he reeks of sweat. When he leaves the bathroom after taking a shower, I don't detect a drop of soap, just a pungent smell of sweat mixed with steam (from the shower). When he leaves his clothes to dry in the hall (we live in Europe, so electric dryers aren't a thing) they also reek! I've never walked past a rack of CLEAN clothes drying and thought ""God, these clothes smell bad!""...until I met him. When someone takes a shower and washes their clothes, they are supposed to smell clean, no? Not with him...

Whenever I encounter him in a room or enter one as he is leaving, I immediately open the window to propel fresh air and provide some ventilation, and spray a cheap-o air freshener if it's handy. He has the only exterior bedroom (me and the other girl have the two interiors with two small windows to the courtyard) and yet he NEVER opens his big window to provide ventilation. He also cooks foul smelling things in the kitchen and never opens that window either, so they just circulate around our tiny apartment!

I've only been living here for 2 months, and the other girl 1 month. The boy has been living here for 1+ year(s). The state of the apartment when we moved in wasn't the best but me and the girl have worked hard to scrub it clean and make it as pleasant as we can. All that's left that I and she really can't stand is the smell. And it's EFFING GROSS. I've dealt with it for two months but I'm reaching my tipping point, and I'm supposed to be here until June. Whenever I enter the front door I have to take one last gasp of fresh, clean, good smelling air before I enter the house and get immediately hit in the face with a mix of warm, dirty, smelly, sweaty air trailing from his room, flowing through the whole apartment (and even worse if he's been cooking). I hold my breath until I can duck into my room, where I leave the window open and an air freshener running. My girl roommate has bought three hallway fans since she's moved in and were almost certain he heard us talking about how it smelled bad, yet he CAN'T TAKE A HINT.

I feel really uncomfortable sitting down and relaying all this to him. I know everyone here is probably just going to tell me to be direct, but can you imagine the awkwardness of that conversation? I don't know what to say or do. I really don't want to move apartments, because aside from the smell he is causing, I love the location (5 mins walking from my work, school, bank, ALL the best grocery stores, etc) for an amazing price. There are a lot of perks about living here but this smell and this boy are really getting the best of me.

Aside from what I can say..... anyone else been in a smelly roomie situation and can offer some advice? Do you have any amazing remedies or things I can put in place for combating smells? Any homemade or store bought air freshener which you just love? Any disinfecting sprays or air fresheners you swear by?

Please help! Any and all comments on this welcome 🙂

TL;DR...F 25 Living in a great apartment with another F 23 and M 23. F &amp; I are clean and decent roommies but M is disgusting and causing whole apartment to smell bad. Can't deal with the smell and feel super uncomfortable to approach this topic, as it's very awkward and sensitive for everyone involved.

My bank account is empty and I'm living with my parents right now.  I have no friends to hang out with and absolutely nothing going for me right now.  I'm contemplating going back to school, but still have no idea what to major in.  My parents fortunately have agreed to help me financially should I choose to go back to school, but I am worried that even with a degree I will still have no direction to go and that I would be wasting their money, or worse yet, not be able to finish school.

235,"Everyone says ""quit your miserable job, do something you love.""  It's really not that easy as an adult with bills.  I did not get an offer on this new job but they seem interested as they have contacted me back for more info.

**The Cons:** I have a job now that I dislike a LOT, my coworkers are very passive aggressive &amp; most days it is painfully awkward/tense in the office, seems like they are always making jabs at each other. I have a 60 mile round trip commute, all of it is under construction or traffic which has slowly driven me mad the past 2 years.  Sometimes after my crap job it can take an additional hour and a half to get home.  I find the actual day to day tasks extremely boring, mostly copy and pasting and I work at a complaint center so I just take complaints all day. There is no room for advancement. I do take my stress/depression from work home often.

**The Pros:** I have worked 2 years, I do get a small raise every year (about 3%), about 1k bonus, I get 2 weeks vacation, 5 sick days, and I only pay about $20 pay for insurance though the deductible goes up every year and went from 1500 last year to 2k this year.

**The New Job:**  Working front desk at a vet's office.  I LOVE animals and do not ask me why I've always wanted to work front desk at a vet/dr office.  I had an observational interview where I did the job for 1 hour with a manger.  I was petting dogs, filling out charts, scheduling appointments and filling prescriptions.  I was loving every second of it and told everyone on earth about how great it seemed.  40 hours but hourly not salary so room for OT.  I mentioned previously wanting to be a vet tech they said if I put a few years in they can train me to work with the vet &amp; have done so for others.

**The New Job Cons:** Starting on the bottom of the totem pole people.  No vacation for the first year, no paid holidays the 1st 6 months.  And the biggest, possibly no insurance the 1st year this being because you have to enroll in Dec for open enrollment but pay full out of pocket the 1st 6 months at $400/month, then they will pay half.  I can not afford the 1st 6 months so may have to go a year without.

I think I sold myself short by telling them my min pay was my current 13.50 which makes me unable to afford the insurance.  I am so scared I will make the wrong decision and screw myself over but in my heart I want this job badly.",15Nov2017,2

243,"Backstory: About 12 years ago I worked with someone will call Rodger. Now Rodger was on the opposite Coast but was hired at a very high job title something that took me many years to attain. It quickly became apparent that Rodger was in way over his head as he wasn't close to being confident enough to do a job of this caliber. Unfortunately for me, I was one of the people tasked with ""helping"" him which basically meant doing the work for him because he had no idea how to even begin. About nine months later during our first layoff he was the first to go. Rodger never really registered on my mind again until about a year later when he would randomly email me and my other co-workers for help at his next job. Essentially he needed the answers so we can pass them off as his own and continued employment. Now I can understand this on many levels and a person's right to earn. However he never really took a hint and would just keep ignoring everybody day after day after day with no shame whatsoever. He didn't seem to care that people would ignore him or block him he would just keep coming at them with various new screen names and what not. Anyways he's been bugging me on and off for years and this escalated up until this past spring when I was on vacation for 3 weeks and he literally ping me everyday none of which I responded to. His pattern seems to be he's a fantastic during an interview and speaks very well so he's able to get jobs that are way over his head. But I have my own jobs and I don't really have time nor do I get paid to do his work for him. Apparently he was desperate to the answer to some project he was working on so we felt the urge to Bug me relentlessly. Recently, he contacted me and i responded and asked him to please stop. He apologized but also always plays stupid about his behavior, saying things like ""any reason why bro?"" Finally, i got fed up and blocked him on everything. You gotta understand that as soon as i would come online he would ping me right away, and it would be dissapointing to me that it was him, and not someone i'd actually want to talk to.  Yesterday, he created another new profile just so he could reach out to me. I blocked him there too. I am starting to wonder if this guy is ill because he seems to take pleasure in annoying me. He acts all innocent but always reverts back to asking me questions about ""what i am working on"" or ""my experience working with _____ and what issues I encountered.""

245,"Ok, so basically, one of my best friends moms is a legit conspiracy nut, i am fine with her believing what she wants to believe as she is entitled to that, so there is no problem there. However, the problem is that she will try to put down anything i or someone else says with some kind of conspiracy.

For example, if me and my friend are talking about celebrity deaths, she will tell us it is a result of the Illuminati and they were actually murdered because they "" knew too much "".. The recent celebrity sex scandals? it's actually a satanic paedophile cult.

She believes that there are actually reptilian people walking around, that people in power are actually aliens and that the moon is a space base. She also argues that weed cures cancer and big pharma is holding it back, and won't allow her grandson to be vaccinated as she thinks its a ploy by the government to kill off the population.

I am fine with her believing this i guess, i mean it's not healthy but she is entitled to believe what she wants. I am just curious of how i can sit there and kind of defuse what she is saying without causing an argument, i have told her i don't believe what she says politely a few times, and she seems to take offence to that.

but sometimes i get the impression that she wants more. she told me once she only comes online for me. she sent me lots of hearts. or she was very upset when i had no time for her today.
these phases came by and went. still nothing special from my side.

one day she was busy texting with someone else. i asked her whats up and she replied: ""texting with another guy but dont worry i only love you""

this was a big wtf moment for me. could she really? i started to think about it a little bit.

the following weeks went by and she dropped some more hints (a website for people who are in love with 2 others at once, polyarmory or something like that.)

she tried to date the other guy but he declined. the whole time i was hesitant about it and i tried not to ask too much about it cause it was not my business.

as it happens i started to develop feelings for her after that.

i waited a few weeks and told her about my feelings. she told me she loved me like a brother which was cool for me. but she started to change.

she started ignoring me. she never did that before. she does not respond to simple 'how are you today?' questions. or anything like that.
since i got some mixed signals from before i wanted to make sure and clear all fronts. i asked her about the past hints she dropped me and if she just needed time.

she responded very angrily. i should pick up the hint that she has nothing to say to me right now and everything she said was platonic and if i dont leave her alone for the time being she will just delete me.

i am just puzzled right now. i cant make any sense out of it. i want to move on but on the other hand i dont.

253,"Hi Reddit here's a bit of a backstory.


I transferred from Community College to a standard 4 year university after I got my associates for CS. I was planning on minoring in Math because I found math just came to me naturally. Once I got started, I realized that I was way behind in knowledge that other students in my classes seemed to have acquired in CS even though I excelled in Community College and had to drop my minor. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to stick through it. I am now a senior and realized that I no longer have the passion or desire to continue in CS, as I feel I am too far behind and stand no chance in the competitiveness of CS. I realize I probably should have majored in Math because I enjoy it more and I was pretty good at it whereas I am barely passing any CS class and spending waaay to much time on projects that others are solving rather quickly. 

Does any Redditor have any advice, or was anyone in the same position?",15Nov2017,2

255,"Hello Reddit.

This is my very first post. It's kinda personal. I don't really know if what I am doing is right, but I fell like it's my responsibility to do this.

So, back in 2016, I got into high school. At that time, I was very gloomy. I had bad experience back in secondary school. I got bullied. My feeling was refused and so on. Basically, I don't want to make friends. At that time, I got trust issues. I intended not to make friends. But, things changed. A girl stepped into my life. She was very weird to me at that time. She smiled like a child. She was extremely positive. I thought that she was somewhat naive. She approached and talked to me first. At first I felt weird.  I always had a feeling that no one really needed me and no one would bother to talk to me. Not so long later, we became friends, sort of. I secretly had a crush on her. It didn't take long for me to realize that I had already felt in love with her. I realized that she had helped me a lot. For someone who had lost hope, what she did was somewhat a miracle. Maybe that was why. I felt that I had understood her, at some points. She even asked me to join a club in the school. During that time, I made friends there. And my feeling for her got bigger. I thought that I could someday won her feeling. I mean, like, she always comes to talk to me first, right? She also asked me to join in a club. For a lonely person, it is beyond my expectation. I think that she really trust me.

Not really. I just realized that recently. So, my mother just told me that during her meeting with the teacher and other parents, she heard a story about her life. The girl I like actually has a not-so-good life. Her family is having problems. And her father is threatening that she will have to stop her study. This is really bad. And you know what, none of her friends knows that. Even her BFF. I am very worried about her. She seems to trust no one. And now, she is suffering alone. I know she is very optimistic, but I don't think she is doing well. I don't know what I can do to help her. She is very independent. Maybe that's why she won't tell anyone. I fell like I have to do something for her.

The problem is: I don't know how to open her heart. I hope that she can share more to me. After what she had done, I'm very grateful. And now I want to help back. So, can anyone tell me how can I open her feelings?",15Nov2017,2

I was not expecting that at all, but this is my first apartment, is this acceptable or normal? I honestly don't know if I will be able to afford that much money by next week, and the note said they would add late fees to it if I don't pay it by the specified time.

260,"I've had quite a rough ride the last few years as per some alcohol abuse, many codependent relationships, and dealing with depression/anxiety. Earlier this year I started seeing a therapist as things were pretty much at rock bottom and couldn't handle anything anymore. 

Fast forward to now and I am in a way better place; while being there, I notice that I am still going back to some past tendencies and looking to move. Right now I am struggling with moving out of my parents place (24) and either move into the city of Chicago or move out to the west Coast/Bay area as that is were a lot of work is for a developer as myself. Moving closer to Chicago feels like a good idea as I love it down there; however, I have always wanted to live on the west coast and I think that's where my heart pulls me too. Again, that's just assuming as I have not been there as an adult. 

Financially, I am an OK place to get a mortgage (i will buy, not rent). I do have a car loan as well, but slowly working on that. 

I guess, my biggest thing is, if I move to Chicago, I feel as it is the safer route since I am still close to home/close to my current work. However, if I move out west, I think I will feel the complete release of everything but lose the comfort of having a job.

265,"For background, I am a 22 year old guy who has been with my girlfriend for four and a half years and never really dated much prior. I always wanted to date around when I was younger but was never confident enough to put myself out there.  Over the past few years, I have developed severe anxiety and depression.  A few months ago a began taking antidepressants and they made my depression far worse. I began viewing every aspect of my life, including my relationship, from a very negative perspective. We have had issues in the past that caused us to almost break up, but we've always resolved them. However, while on antidepressants, I was in such a bad place that I wanted nothing to do with my girlfriend, so we decided to take a break for a week and then decide what we wanted to do. The break only lasted a day and a half before we decided to stay together.

I fucked up in that day and a half. In my head, I had decided that we were broken up and we would revisit our status in a week and decide it was over. Since I previously wanted to date around, I thought the best way to get over my relationship would be to get laid or meet someone new (nothing serious, just single early twenties stuff). My best friend had been on and off of tinder over the years and always showed it to me so I was naturally curious. I decided that with my newly found freedom I would download the app and get swiping. I didn't do anything with any girls I talked to on tinder. The problem is that I kept the app on my phone even after my girlfriend and I decided to continue our relationship. It became a weird kind of addiction, in part, I believe, because I was receiving attention like I was never used to before. I continued to secretly and privately talk to girls from tinder and even snapchatted some of them. 

After a couple of weeks, a friend of a friend of my girlfriend saw me on the app.  Of course, because word gets around, my girlfriend was made aware of my infidelity.  With all that being said, I take full responsibility for being unfaithful and recognize that it was completely wrong of me to do. 

Now, for the reason I'm writing this in the first place. After all of his happened and I convinced my girlfriend to stay with me (even though I likely didn't deserve another chance), she told me that she would have a hard time trusting me, which is completely understandable given the circumstances. Her solution to all of this was to make me give her all of my social media passwords and full access to my phone.  She even linked our Instagram accounts and currently receives all of my notifications. I have always been against this kind of intrusiveness, but I thought given my giant fuck up, it was reasonable. However, being someone who already deals with immense anxiety issues, I can't help but feel like I'm being watched. It feels like someone is sitting there waiting for me to mess up again at all times. I feel myself growing to resent her for it. I know that if I talk to her and express my concerns she will tell me she can't trust me, because she makes small remarks about it quite often. But, if I don't give her my thoughts, I predict I will continue to feel more and more trapped in my own life. 

I don't know whether to accept my punishment and deal with the consequences or to recognize that I messed things up beyond repair and move on with my life in a new direction so that I can start fresh. 

TL;DR: my girlfriend found out I had a tinder and now keeps a very close eye on my social media, so I feel trapped and anxious.",15Nov2017,2
267,"My school board has already voted, and has decided to implement a hybrid schedule starting next year. (Maine South: district 207) The schedule, works to give each class and teacher more time with the students, with monday having only even periods and tuesday having only odds. Wendsday will be a full day with all classes, and I dont really know how thursday and friday work, because of poor explanation and lack of general knowledge throughout the school. I personaly do not know any students or teachers that are pro this change, or even know much about what it entails, because it was decided by the school board with no input from the school itself. Most people hate this change, and I am with them. There are a large selection of problems, involving time and things this schedule assumes students will do. (I will write a list of things underneath the basic information) Overall I would like to know from anyone with experience or anyone with an idea for something I can do to take action, It is likely that in this matter the students and their parents hold more power than the teachers, but it would be difficult to create a petition, if that is even a valid option that the school board would listen to. All ideas and advice are welcome and thank you to anyone who helps!

(Points):
-Most teachers (except science teachers) are not used to this amount of time to teach, and will end up assigning busywork to fill the gap
-The program assumes that students will use the almost two hours (at least) of free time to visit with teachers for one on one time
-Most schools who have implemented this schedule across america have reverted within a year, some down to a block schedule, some down back to a traditional (the one I have now)
-I have also heard, (from teachers) they think a main factor the school board likes this plan, is because if each teacher fills more time in a day, and only works some days, they will need fewer teachers and therefore pay less to teacher salary",15Nov2017,2

269,"I'm 21M and still do the stupidest, most childish things. Even when I try not to do anything, it still ends up bad! Like, what the hell?

270,"So this is about my ex. We've been off for about a year now and I've just started wondering about a certain behavior she had when we were still dating. Here it is.

She's very prone to befriend guys. I didn't see it as anything bad except for the fact that some of the guys tend to be closet horny assholes who liked her in some ways that would be inappropriate for her or anyone who was dating her. She was responsible with this however, because once she sees anyone of her friends advancing towards her, she backs off. Anyways, her group of peers have always been those that were in the ""cool dudes"" group who played sports, smoked, partied, etc. all that typical frat boy shit. Meanwhile, I've always been an introvert but I could handle my own and everyone knows my deal when it comes to meeting new people. Once I get along with someone, I'm cool. I didn't have any form of social anxiety, just didn't find crowds pleasing. Whenever I had the chance to see one of her guy friends with her, she **DID NOT** have any interest of introducing me to them. She would introduce me to her gay/female friends but almost never to the guys, the ones that seemed ""toughest"" at least. This was one of our first misunderstandings that soon led to our break up but we never brought it up when we talked seriously, I guess I just didn't feel like it was a big deal back then. There were even instances when she would intentionally tell me she would be unavailable for a while because one of her guy friends are going to an event with her (large friend gatherings). 


Now, she undoubtedly liked me and wanted to be in a long term relationship. Also, I'm pretty certain she wasn't cheating because she would bring up all advancements that guys would do towards her and what she's done to avoid them. I verified these claims because one of her closest friends would tell me how she would willingly reject some of the coolest/most popular guys in campus, while mentioning her relationship with me.

I never hid her from anyone of my friends. She introduced me to her siblings, but it just bothered me why she didn't want me to get along with her ""cool"" guy friends. I have a feeling that she was ashamed of me, thinking that the guys would disapprove of me and would make fun of her for being with someone that wasn't as tall, muscular, and sporty as them. Everyone knew about us, though. Half of the college campus knew we were dating (as she was popular, but not the typical bitchy way. She was popular because of her looks and nice attitude) She just... didn't want to introduce me to some of her guy friends for some damn reason. Insecurity, fear that I wouldn't get along well with them, idk.

**QUESTION:** So... Is it a sure sign of lack of commitment/interest if the girl you're dating intentionally refuses to introduce you to some of her friends?

EDIT: BTW, not asking for tips on how we could be back together. I'm well past our relationship and it was good while it lasted but I realised she wasn't for me for another reason. I just want to make this thought clear because it crossed my mind recently and found it weird why I didn't bring it up with her.",15Nov2017,2

286,"I've been in a relationship for almost 3 years now.My gf and I love each other (or at least, I think she used to) and always seemed strong until a few months ago. About 6 months ago, she was diagnosed with a chronic illness. She started getting treatment for it, but it made her really weak and she was both physically and mentally exhausted. I tried to be supportive of her but then there were times when she just didn't want my help and just wanted to be alone. She was supposed to recover but things got worse and her condition has worsened. Her weight even dropped down to 33kgs. I've had times where I've been extremely low and had depressive and suicidal thoughts. There were times when I almost ended up giving into those thoughts but thankfully, I didn't. But a few months ago, I was going through a very low point in my life. This led to me and my gf having a lot of arguments, to a point where we were arguing almost every single day. It got worse to the point where she told me one day that we needed to break up. I was so upset, because I already had a lot of other things in my mind that I was struggling with that I cut my arms (which I admit was an extremely dumb and stupid thing to do). She met me the next day and we made up, and she told me she loved me and to never do that again. Things went well for a week, and we were back to normal. But then, we just started to argue again, and again and again, to the point where she said she wanted some space. She said she needed to heal, and that I wasn't allowing her to. And she also told me that it wasn't just me but that she was struggling with a lot of other issues and just wanted to be left alone so she could recover. I tried to convince her that we would somehow works things out the way we used to, but she wouldn't listen. So I thought that it would be best if I left her alone for a while, so she could heal, and I could get my shit together. It was tough for me initially to distance myself from her, there were times I left her a text, and tried to call her. But she wouldn't respond to my texts or answer my calls. I sent her a wish on her birthday, on our 3rd year anniversary of dating, even tried to contact her, but she didn't reply or answer my calls. It's been two months since she last spoke to me, and I stopped calling her or texting her cause I felt like I needed to leave her alone and stop bothering her. It's just that I've never had this connection with anyone before, and she always told me that she believed that we were meant for each other and that she felt the same way about me. I would never have imagined things getting this ugly between us. I'm confused now, about what to do. I sometimes have trouble sleeping at night, or I just break down sometimes, cause I miss her a lot. But I'm not as mentally weak as I was during the initial week of us not talking to each other. But I'm confused as to what to do....and is this just having some space or have we broken up? Would like your help regarding this. I'm 22 years old, and have just graduated from college and am 2 months into my first job. It helps distract me from feeling sad about the way things are between both of us, but there are times when I can't stop thinking about her and get upset. What should I do? ",15Nov2017,1
288,"So I'm going to make this brief. Me and my girlfriend went on a trip to Montréal this weekend and on the first night there, we went to a party with our other friends. Now this one friend (we'll call her Jane) was at the party and travelled with us to the city. 

So while at the party this one person brings out cocaine and my friends and Jane all start doing lines. Me and my girlfriend refrain from doing it because that's a little hardcore for us so we just sit back and relax. At one point Jane comes back and sits next to my girlfriend and here's where stuff starts to go down. 

She starts hugging and grabbing my girlfriend all of sudden and saying ""I want to fuck you"", ""I want to eat out your pussy"". Now at first I thought maybe she was just joking but she kept saying it and grabbing her and my girlfriend was visibly uncomfortable. She went on to say how I was a shitty person and how I didn't deserve to be with her, not to mention that she's going to fuck my girlfriend as soon as we break up. Just generally nasty things like that, as well saying I'm out of her league. She began outing all this personal private information about our relationship to everyone in the room like my girlfriends sexual orientation and the fact we broke up once. She started kissing her back, cheek, and neck and kept at the whole ""let me fuck you"", ""I think I'm a lesbian"". I was visibly mad and upset but I felt so powerless and hurt and it was infront of our friends and total strangers. 

This went on for 10 minutes straight and I kept trying to say something but I just sat there. 

Now I get she snorted a bit of cocaine but fuck so did everyone else and they didn't act like that and both of us was pretty hurt and uncomfortable by the end of it. 

Now I'm wondering what do I do now because I'm pretty sure if the genders were reversed it'd be considered some form of sexual assault of harrasment.",15Nov2017,1

A quick information about myself. I am a Turkish citizen living in Istanbul and I am about to graduate from my uni within these two months ahead. I study English Language and Literature and would like to take part in a MA program outside my country (preferably Europe, USA or Canada) following my graduation. I am thinking about Cultural and Critical Studies or Comperative Literature as for my field. I have been looking for various MA sites as to see what sort of opportunities I have in this regard and for what price these programs come. Since the approximate amount of money required is like 15k euros to indulge in a MA program concerning these two fields I have mentioned, it is really hard for me to compensate this financial-wise. I would be very pleased to know about the scholarship opportunities for international, non-eu students in Europe, USA or Canada in general and I am open for  any recommendation in this sense.

Thanks.

294,"I'm 19, and I'm at a loss of how to reconnect with my parents.

After the age of 12, I haven't had much bonding with them. They are both kind and great parents who do everything they can to support me, but after I turned 12 they didn't interact much with me due to various reasons out of their control. All our conversations since then are formal and awkward, and we only seem to be able to talk about shallow topics. We both really don't know much about each other.

After seeing the great relationships my friends have with their own parents, I've been trying to connect with them more with little success.

296,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I need advice before I continue filing maintenance requests with the landlord.  

I moved into this apartment in June. It is an apartment that is inside a house (so the house has been broken up into apartments). The layout is open such that when you walk in there is an open stairwell leading to the second floor with no doors. There is a door in the kitchen to the basement which has the furnace, an unused shower (??) and the washer / drier and water heater. The basement has always had a weird smell, but I assumed that's just how basements smell and that it shouldn't really matter.  

I never had any real odor issues over the summer, but I started to notice that as the temperature dropped outside, a very weird smell would appear in the apartment right when I walk in (on the main / second floor). It smells like sewer gas or something like that. It would come and go, and I just overlooked it until now. It's permanently cold outside, so I need to have the heat running. Problem is, every time the heat comes on the apartment is filled with this wretched smell. It overwhelms me when I walk in from being gone all day long. It smells similar to the sewer gas smell that I've occasionally noticed as it continued to get colder outside.  

I submitted one maintenance request complaining about the problem which was ignored and marked as completed even though they did nothing. So I submitted a second request where I pointed out that the first request was ignored, and they sent someone over who left a note for me saying that the furnace looked fine and he sprayed deoderizer in the furance. That took care of the problem for maybe two days. I can now smell the obnoxious smell when I first walk in again.  

So, I need advice as far as what the possible issue could be, and what to write in my THIRD maintenance request now. I need to write something that will get their attention and make them fix this annoying problem, whatever it may be.

I didn’t buy her tickets but said I could do that on the spot so she could come. She said no and kept on yelling. I tried to walk out, she blocked the door. I got to my car, she blocked that door. I got in my car, she blocked it from closing. I eventually drove off and got a long text from her later that day telling me how she feels hurt and that she loved me but didn’t feel very loved back.

Rewind about half a year.

Things were great and the beginning, but leading up to this time her anger began to show and I pulled away. I ended up throwing a spur of the moment party that she found out about during the day before it happened, but I planned on telling her and I did invite her. She declined because she was going out drinking with her friends that night.
2:00am rolls around and I have to go to the store for some stuff. Party is still going strong and, according to my friends, my drunk gf shows up. She charges through the house looking for me and making a scene. Trashed my bedroom and bathroom and heads to my parents room where my friends corner her and kick her out.

I get back and hear what happened. One friend (who I don’t know if he’s telling the truth or not) said she threatened to accuse one friend of assault and him of rape. The other friend didn’t recall but believed it. I was talking about it recently though, and neither really remember that stuff. So I’m not sure if it was true or not.

Anyways, there was an overwhelming fear of mine since then. It built up as I distanced myself and eventually left.

Now I miss her like hell. I’ve dated other great girls and all, but I just don’t feel that connection and passion like I did for this one.

312,"So I have 3 younger siblings, let's call them X, Y, and Z. 

X is 11 and I am almost certain he is special needs. My parents and grandparents both agree, but they refuse to get him help because they are convinced that it will give him an excuse and do more harm then good. He is incredibly immature for his age. He gets along best with kids a few years younger than him. He isn't mean spritited and is generally a nice kid, but he is incredibly annoying. He doesn't know how to interact socially and makes constant sound effects. He is 11 and in third grade and struggling greatly. When he gets really upset he shuts down for a few minutes and just cries, refusing to talk or make eye contact. After that he goes into a fit of rage, screaming and trying to hit people. Then he goes and hides in his room for 15 minutes to 3 hours or so. This happens a few times a month on average. 

Y is 9 and he is quite frankly just a jerk. He is mean, he loves taking people's words and twisting their meaning, acting like a victim to the point of claiming people bullied him when they didn't, and just doing anything he can to anger people. I end up getting in physical fights with him often.  For example, he promised X that he would do the dishes in exchange for candy.   X gave Y the candy then Y refused to do the dishes. My dad got mad at X and Y saying that they shouldn't make deals because Y always backs out and it causes a fight. Y twisted this to mean that he shouldn't have to do the dishes because dad doesn't like it when they make deals. So Y was trying to run upstairs and lock himself in his room, and X was trying to stop him. I stopped Y with him trying to shove past me. I happened to be holding my dog who began barking and growling at my brother because he was trying to shove me. I stopped him and told him he was being a brat and had to do the dishes. He got angry, rolled his eyes, and kicked me in the crotch. My dog reacted my bitting him. He then stomped off to do the dishes complaining about me needing to control my ""rat"". This kind of thing happens often and my parents don't do much to stop it. Occasionally they get mad and yell, but that's about it. Everyone involved gets yelled at the same amount and blamed equally even if they didn't actually do anything wrong. 

Then there is Z, she is 7. She is constantly stealing, destroying, and lying. She does stuff like steal my shampoo and conditioner and use the entire bottle to wash her dolls hair. Then my mom bought me more and she did it again 3 days later. She stole all of the food coloring and dumped it on the white carpet in the family room. She steals my candy all of the time. Last night I convinced her to give me a couple candy bars to make up for everything she stole just a little. I ate one and when I wasn't looking she stole the other. When she was trying to run upstairs to hide it my mom let her go then held me back so I couldn't chase her down and take it back. She physically kept me from going up the stairs until Z came back grinning saying if never find it. I got mad and I was told I need to have a sense of humor. Then today I was in my parents room talking to them and I noticed my sister came running up the stairs wearing a necklace I had kept in my desk drawer. It is a cheap but pretty necklace I like to fidget with them I'm bored in class (I do online school). I told her to give it back and she hid the pendant in her hand saying that she didn't have it. I wrestled it away from her and showed her it was mine and my mom said it wasn't nessesarily mine because she had a matching one. I told them she lost hers months ago and I caught her trying to steal mine several times before. I went downstairs and sure enough my necklace wasn't in my desk drawer. My parents got mad at me acting like I was the problem and said I never let my sister have anything and I need to calm down and share with her and how I am so mean. She steals and destroys everything I own. I don't share because if I do she breaks and looses everything. But they got mad at me. Not her, me. They didn't say a word to her. 

My dog is an 8 month old Pomeranian who is protective of me against my siblings. Whenever they start getting physical he starts growling at them and tries to bite them sometimes. He wants to protect me. He won't do it when anyone else, to test it I have pretended to get in fights with my parents and he doesn't react, it's only with my siblings because they have tried to hurt me so many times.  What do I do?  

TL;DR My siblings are violent brats, my parents don't care and get mad at me if I try to intervene, and my dog is becoming aggressive towards them if they do so much as lightly push me or I do the same as them. ",15Nov2017,1

314,"Last few weeks have been hell. Hell infused with heaven. My life isn't balanced at this point and I need to start finding solutions before I start regretting my actions.

The story in general is this: I have a girlfriend. It's my first relationship. I've never had a relationship before. I only see her for 2 days every couple of weeks.

In the time I'm with her (3 months), I have somehow conditioned my mind to see her as the center of my universe. If she tells me she misses me, or she thinks about me, the world glows, I see beauty everywhere, I go outside with pride and my day is great.

However, if we don't speak much, or she even talked(!!!) To some other guy, I crumble. I start getting frustrated. I assume she likes him more than me. He's more macho. He's more interesting. Whatever. It gets my mood down and sometimes talking rationally to myself doesn't work, I still kinda believe those stories. And suddenly I see everything as bad, I feel like our relationship is over at any moment, and I'm negative the whole day . This could happen from her just talking to some other dude!

Yesterday it reached a climax. Some guy asked her out as a joke, in the middle of the class, while singing. I mean, it was a joke. They all laughed it out. She told it to me, and she really just thought it was funny and wanted to share. Me? My mind exploded. I was out with a friend when suddenly my face fell down and I felt horrible . The moment it happened I became silent and refused to talk. It was horrible.


Then today, I just lost feelings. Like, didn't feel anything. Happiness, sadness, regret, shame, hatred, anger, love... Nothing. I felt literally nothing. I was sure I'm going crazy. I threw some baskets late at night out of boredom and some random dude joined me so it lifted my spirit again, but I still feel very weird . As if I lost my interest in anything. Nothing matters anymore. I don't feel anything for my girlfriend which is super weird and scares the hell out of me.

I'm going to a life coach regularly . But since going I only found that those things got worse. I've signed up to meet a therapist soon but I'm trying to understand what to do in the meantime. I really feel like I'm going nuts. I realized I might not love myself enough so I seem validation from her. But, I also can't see how to truly love myself. In my imagination it looks selfish, and also quite impossible. And also, why did I lose feelings today? Why did I feel like there's no point to life, and went on complete auto pilot? I seriously didn't feel like myself, I still don't completely. And it's scary . I need a solution here.


Tl;Dr : first relationship, somehow conditioned my mind to seek validation from girlfriend. Every time things don't go great between us (or even if they're just normal, but she talks to a guy and it makes me jealous) I get anxious, sad and negative. Today I completely lost feelings and a sense of ""self"". Which was amazingly weird. I do love her and I want to stay with her but this isn't normal and I want to find solutions to this.

Gf and I had a wonderful long distance relationship for 1 year. We talked for a bit, I bailed on her and then came back and she had a bf. She never even let me call her babe. She l leaves her bf and we get together. Fast forward a year and we got into university together. She invited me to move in with her since it would save money. Our relationship was shit ever since. Her school gives her 9 courses instead of usual 5 and she is so stressed and suffering from anxiety and depression. She's in her own personal hell and I followed because I wanted to help her and I love her. Recently She said she fell out of love with me and we decide to try to make it work.

She came home from her parents last weekend and I find out her parents invited her ex to live with them cause he's on hard times. They asked if she was ok with it and she said yes. And she told me she's been texting him. She says she still has feelings for him, then says she might, now she says she doesn't but who knows. I asked to see the messages and they're what our conversations used to be like. Enthusiastic, more than the 1-3 word answers she gave me. We have a fight and break up. She texts and calls me an hour later saying she made a big mistake and loves me and wants to make it work. So we talk and I feel the same but want her to drop him completely and tell her parents she's no longer cool with him living there. After muuuch resistance she agrees but rather than say ""it's not appropriate because I want to make it work with him"" she says I'm making her say it. Which is fair I'm a man and stand by my decisions. He says ok and offered to move out but she says no you're welcome to stay. Parents are pissed at me etc etc but I was happy. Distraught. Trust broken, severely doubting, but I was happy because I needed her to pick me over him.

Next day we talk and she's been texting him again because he texted her... And it made her happy to be in contact with everyone. I am happy she is happy but she went back on her word. She clearly still wants him. We have another fight and break up. 

I'm befuddled the whole situation even happened, in what world is it ok to move your daughter's ex in and to text him behind my back. And how I'm the bad guy in this I have no idea. 

As it seems to be, it feels like she cheated, though idk if I should consider that cheating, but it feels like it (have been cheated on before), and she wants to continue because it makes her happy, and I'm the one who doesn't want her to be happy or love her or care because I won't allow myself to be cucked.

332,"Hello Reddit, 

I am graduating in May 2018 with my degree in Computer Engineering. I have had a Software Engineering offer for a large tech company in CITY A, and have had a fantastic experience working there as an intern. The salary/benefits are great, I love the city, and all of my family is close by.

I was going to accept, but applied for an Engineering Firm in CITY B. The role is completely different, and instead focuses on developing Engineering Leadership skills, with options to pursue skills in Technical Sales, Marketing, Product Support, Systems Engineering, etc. I had a great interview visit to CITY B, and was impressed with the Company. I just received an offer. I would be taking about an $4,000 pay cut, no real sign on bonus, and the higher cost of living in CITY B. 

I have always been hesitant about making a career in Software, even though I really do enjoy doing it, mainly because the future of automation, the sheer competition for tech jobs, etc. I am largely a people person, and can't stand the idea of wasting my life away at a desk, no matter how much I like it. I wan't to be interacting with clients, and my long term career goal is to move into management for a technical company; this job in CITY B appears to provide opportunities much more in line with my goals, and a lot of flexibility in being able to explore my interests. 

The slight pay cut isn't too concerning, but I feel tied back to CITY A. I am my mother's only child, and although she isn't elderly, I am the only person she really has. She doesn't take care of herself at all, has health problems (being managed fine), and can't even emotionally handle me being away at school. Also, my girlfriend of 2 years will be starting a 3 year doctorate program in CITY A. My plan was to marry her after she finished school, but I honestly have doubts that our relationship could survive the distance. She says she would be okay with me leaving, but we have had distance issues and communication mismatches (different expectation levels) when we were 2 hours apart over a summer, let alone 2 states away. If I was moving back, the story would be different, but if I was starting an entire new life in a young city, I think I would be interested in dating other people. I love her, but that is just what I feel, as bad as it is. I love my relationship, life in CITY A, and would be happy at my CITY A software job as far as I can tell, but the idea of being able to move away from home, pursue this job that REALLY interests me, and start my own life is hard to give up. I have done long distance before with an ex, but that was for a year, we were able to visit occasionally and power through it, and the relationship fell apart a year later we were back together; I'd be open to try it though. 

The last thing I want to do is live with the regret of missing an opportunity, and I can't tell if a year from now my S.O and I will still be together anyways. Please give me some ideas, perspectives, and stories to think about!!!",15Nov2017,3
333,"I got some really strange circumstances for asking this question, so I ask that you fully read my post before commenting. I really like history, I want to be a history major. I am infatuated with history, I even spend time on a daily basis just googling random facts about history. So I go to college, and after a few semesters there so far, I've been abysmal at best. Seems I pass a couple fail a couple. I am gifted intellectually, so I have no excuse to not pass in that sense. But I do have bipolar and that has given me difficulties during my college work. I went down and got together with the disability center, and they're set to give me some accommodations for next semester if I come back. I am also getting myself a therapist and even willing to put myself on medications to treat my mental illness, something I have been refusing to do up to this point. I wonder will these adjustments be enough to get me to stop failing courses and pass all of them? OR do I just need to accept that college isn't for me?",15Nov2017,1
334,"I am 22 and have never been in a relationship. I get asked out every now and then, but rarely go on dates.  

I am in my last year of university and even feel embarrassed to tell my closest friends who I am 'crushing' on unless it's something stupid like a celebrity. I recently realized that I really like this guy at work and when I told her about it, I felt really stupid. I overthink it and put myself down- after I told her that I liked him, I followed it with 'oh but it's stupid and weird, he looks like one of our good friends.' And she guessed and I was like
'Yeah him.' They don't really but they're from the same ethnic background so I only said what I think she would say if she saw him. I would never be attracted to my guy friend but I hate how I said that to put myself down. 

I always do this in different ways when I like someone and I let it become a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to not pursuing them. 


I should note that she's in a serious relationship and living with her boyfriend while I'm 22 and haven't lost my virginity yet (I'm not the stereotypical socially awkward though!) because I'm not okay with losing it to a one night stand/FWB.

337,"Hi! I was banned from the FFxiv subreddit because I was asking what the odds are of me getting banned on FF if I bought gil with real money since I see loads of people saying they did it without any permanent bans or such and I was then banned from the sub -reddit because of the fact that I was apparently promoting buying in game currency (even though I googled the definition of promotion and it said ""support or actively encourage (a cause, venture, etc.); further the progress of."" and I wasn't doing that (in my opinion) I was asking a question, the moderator said it was me asking what excuses people used if caught which doesn't seem like I am supporting it or encouraging it? It seems like I was just curious what people did 

I only really use reddit, and whenever I have a question I ask it (hence my numerious posts) and Imo , that's all I did, it's not like I was saying everyone should do it 

I've seen numerious people asking about gil buying and what are the odds off being banned in game on reddit as well as people admitting to doing it here and yet still posting in the reddit? so I didn't know it would break the rules (I did read the rules but I honestly thought it was promoting like guild seller sites and such)

and after I sent links to those reddits and such as well as a message explaining why I was contemplating doing it I got a 72 hour ban from messaging them and it's really infuriating me :( he only sent me a short line , didn't explain in detail just said ""The difference is so minimal as to be nonexistent, particularly since you were asking what kind of excuses people give (which implies that you would then use those excuses if caught)."" 

It's also the fact I didn't get a warning, most sites give the ""3 strikes and your out"" but I ask one question and I get banned ?

I don't want to make a new account in case I get suspended, but I am new to ffxiv and have a lot of questions and I always ask them here :( can I not send screenshots to reddit and see if they can get me unbanned?

EDIT see the annoying thing is , asking the question actually helped my doubts so I decided not to anyway , then after it was solved and I decided against it, I got banned",15Nov2017,1

341,"So hey, I've done something stupid today and need to get myself out of the current situation. Normally, cancelling an appointment should be easy, but I can't come up with anything right now, possibly because I'm a little stressed.

First a little background information:
I'm a male, 20 years old, and started living on my own since August this year, in order to decrease travelling time from my parent's place to university every day. I still go back to my parents place every weekend, since I have a job there. These places are about 40km apart, so pretty doable using public transport. 

Ever since I moved, multiple people (including people older than 40) showed interest in my new place, which I deem normal, since I have been knowing these people for ages. I invited them to come visit my place every now and then, because I never had weird feelings with these guys.

However, there is another guy that I know ever since I was 12. He used to be my coach in sports when I was playing youth competition. Ever since I turned 18, I had to quit this competition, and started playing the regular competition. It turns out this guy was participating in this same competition as a competitor. 

To be able to participate in this competition, I have to travel like 30-40 minutes from my own place to the sports hall by public transport weekly. We were talking about how my university was going and stuff, pretty basic things, and at some point he asked whether I preferred sleeping at his place. I told him that I would rather sleep at my own place, as I wanted to avoid travelling in the morning. He has repeatedly been asking this question, it almost felt like was forcing me to sleep at his place at some point. Being around this guy started feeling weird to me. By the way, he's single and hasn't a relationship since 15 years ago or something.

I never really felt safe, or, I don't know, I'm not a native English-speaker so I can't find the right word for it, but you might be able to understand what kind of feeling I'm talking about here.

And this is where I became a stupid piece of shit:
Today after competition (Wednesday), he said he was working in the city where I lived this Friday, and was curious on what my place looked like. He asked whether he could come by. My stupidshithead said that was fine. 
When I was travelling home, he send me a message saying: ""I'll pack my showering and sleeping stuff for Friday!"" And yea, this freaked me out. I did manage to find a way to express that he can't sleep at my place this Friday (""I need to go back to my parents friday-evening""), but I honestly don't feel comfortable with him coming at all, because I (rightfully?) think he wants sex. I don't really feel comfortable with him coming at all like this..

So yeah, long story short, I need advice on how to cancel this appointment specifically. The hard aspects about this are that I will still be seeing this guy every week. Also, a usually good trait of mine is that I am, and want to be nice towards everyone, so I can't just be a dickhead. 

And an even shorted TLDR, since I have been rambling a lot to express my situation really clearly, which can be fine and shit at the same moment:
A guy that I have been knowing for 8 years is coming over this Friday, I'm pretty sure his main goal is sex. I don't feel comfortable and need to cancel this appointment, but can't come up with any good reasons.

EDIT: So yes, the answer to my problem was indeed pretty easy and straightforward: Just tell him that he can't come over, and avoid him during sports. ",15Nov2017,10
344,"Hi. I'm 13 years old and about 6 weeks ago, my dad died. My mother is a complete mess. She drinks a lot, is really annoying and degrading, and makes me want to leave. I have that opportunity. I can go live with my aunt, and I said I would if she didn't pull herself together, get a job (Even though she doesn't need it, she has millions) and can give me a normal childhood. The problem is that she has congestive heart failure and told me that If I left she would die. She's not suicidal whatsoever, but she told me her heart would give out. I'm fairly confident it wouldn't but that's not a risk I would want to take. But I really want to leave. She can't pick me up from clubs, take me anywhere, be a good mother.

He was in charge of fake pulling the alarm, and when reaching for it, he accidentally slapped the box, somehow setting it off. 

There's witnesses saying it was in fact an accident, but the school won't take that for an answer, and I've been told he's going to be charged with a felony for a false 9-1-1 call...

348,"I care about this guy a lot, and we haven't been dating a long time, although we have known one another for a year or so. We are both two people who genuinely value our alone time and have not ever wanted to have a partner who is clingy or who we have to constantly text. When I get home, I like to enjoy my alone time, and I am comfortable knowing my partner is at home thinking about me. I don't feel the need to call him if we don't have anything to talk about. We are independent and enjoy the time we spend apart and together. We live separate lives together.

On the other hand he doesn't need as much intimacy as I do. I know he really likes me, but I feel like our relationship will never go anywhere if we practically only talk during our weekly date. If I mention that I feel like we should talk more, he says ""okay, what do you want to talk about?"" 

I don't know how to answer that question directly, aside from saying that we just need to spend more quality time getting to know each other if we plan on having a serious relationship (which we both consider this to be.) Communicating with him is not ordinarily an issue. 

 We have been seeing each other for three months, but I feel like talking around once a week on our date is not going to take the relationship further. I don't want to be texting every hour of the day, or have an hour long phone call every night. But I want to spend enough time that I feel as though we are growing in comfort with one another. As far as goals, I hope that we eventually spend enough time together to decide whether or not we want to be together for life within a reasonable frame of time (I don't consider 3-5 years to be reasonable.) From what I have spoken to him about, that is his goal too: to find a life partner, get married and have kids within a few years of dating. 

TDLR: How can I talk to him about something that he doesn't see as an issue without making him feel like I either a) have a problem with the dynamic of the relationship or b) don't appreciate the time we spend together or feel like it is ""enough"" for me. Or in general, what is the best way to talk to your partner about something that they do not see as an issue, but you do?

I admire him and care about him very much, I want to communicate in the best way possible, but so far what I have tried has not gotten my point across, because he doesn't feel the same need I do.",15Nov2017,1

356,"My mom, with bipolar disorder texted me (she was in her room) this after I told her it was none of her business knowing what I told my therapist, I was also very curt with her when she tried to ask me questions.

""All the YEARS I was in therapy, we were told to point our finger at ourselves and focus there to better us so we could function more productively with those around us. Seems to me that you all do the opposite and that not much is getting done.

You obviously don't want to talk to me and I will not make you. Just note it can go both ways - I don't need a negative relationship either.
So, you will go to school, day and night, until Christmas and you will need to catch the bus.""

I had told my therapist that the reason I'm so anxious all the time now is because I feel trapped in my home and in school. My family doesn't let me learn how to drive (even though I'm graduating this year) and they also ignore me when I start criticizing their actions towards me. I'm always the but of a joke and any shortcoming I have they always like to make fun of me for it. They also treat me like I'm incompetent and can't do anything right.

Literally one of the reasons that I'm so anxious and depressed is because I have no control over anything and I feel like I trapped and unable to do anything, she's the one that caused this 'negative relationship' because she never listens to me. She's always doubting my ability and is constantly suspicious of me and thinks that I'm doing bad shit behind her back.

358,"Hello everyone. I'll get right to it. I hope you all can forgive the formatting since I am on mobile. 

Background: I'm in my last semester of college out of state in the same state as my sister and her family (husband/2 young kids). 

My mother got cancer which led to my sister INSISTING a few months later that she move back to the state we are from. And to live with my parents. My parents objected, because mom was doing fine with her treatments and didn't need any extra help. They didn't like that she didn't really have anything lined up as far as replacement jobs for her or her husband. Nor would their house be sold. Not  to mention my parents felt like the addition of children into their quiet lifestyle would be a burden during this time of healing. But she did it anyway and since she is their daughter, my parents didn't stop her.

Her husband stayed behind to keep his job and sell the house. She finally found a job after awhile. Months of family stress go by, mostly arguments about the kids.

Que to the present. I am weeks from graduating and they plan on closing on the house at the end of November. My sister calls me up a few days ago and asks me if her husband can live with me in my apartment after they close. He won't be joining his family since he still doesn't have a job lined up. They had ASSUMED that he could stay with a friend, but they never asked until recently. That's not working out. So here we are.

My lease is up two weeks into December.  Literally the day I finish my final exam. I have plans to go elsewhere after (job lined up).

I don't want him to stay with me. I have stress living with roommates, which is why I keep my own apartment. He is also on a different schedule than me. He goes to bed early, I am a night owl who stays up studying with the TV on. And I can't really get away from him if I need to since my apartment is so small. Normally I would tolerate it for two weeks...but  I have move of my own to plan during all these exams and projects. I am beyond stressed. And I don't want to jeopardize my semester.

I feel like an jerk though because they are my family and I like my brother-in-law. I just can't help but feel like this could have been avoided if they hadn't made assumptions about friend and planned ahead more. Plus he has nowhere to go after my lease is up.
