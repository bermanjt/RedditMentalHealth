I have no money saved up that she doesn't know about. I have no idea what to do or where to start. I have to start moving on and stop running from reality. I'm in my late 20's and ready to have children so the sooner the better.....",14Oct2017,1
1,"Basically I used to be a huge party animal last year but I've been clean from substances for a while and been doing really good in school, and my parents are going away for their anniversary for a weekend and I feel like I would be wasting a great opportunity for something if I don't do anything while they are gone, but at the same time I kind of don't want to do anything and get caught because I'm in a good spot with them now, and also I don't want to fall back into the same routine as before. Looking for some advice, I guess.",14Oct2017,1
4,"(I feel more comfortable with starting with a list... Sorry.)

Ways she hurts me:
-never listens to what I have to say. She'll stay quiet but then completely ignore my message and turn it around onto how I acted to warrant her behavior.
-tries to dictate my emotions. She doesn't let me get frustrated at what shes making me do. She expects me to have a smile plastered on my face, and it has to be genuine. But she doesn't understand she can't force me to feel anything— when I submit to her and do as she wishes she gets upset because it isn't genuine.
-threatens me. She threatens to fight me a lot. Some of her exact words from one of our very recent fights were ""I will skull drag you"". I'm fifteen, by the way. And I don't know how to protect myself.
-changes stories up and then says I'm the one doing it. I remember word for word a lot of what she says to me and when I talk to her about it she ALWAYS down plays it and says ""no, I said (something a lot less mean than what was originally said)
-uses the ""I'm older than you"" excuse for EVERY hypocritical rule she has for me. If she can yell when she gets frustrated but I can't, it's because she's older. If she can call me a bitch but I can't do it to her, it's because she's older. The list goes on. Oh, did I mention she called me a bitch? Yeah. Again, I'm fifteen. And I'm a girl. You know, the teenage kind.
-she forces me to stop crying. If she hurts my feelings she calls me a crybaby but if I say something like ""I didn't put that there"" when she accuses me of doing it, she starts to cry. But I can't cry.
-if I tell her she's doing something that hurts me, she always undermines it by explaining why she did nothing wrong.
-she says she apologizes all the time but never actually does. When she does apologize it isn't an apology. It's guilt tripping. ""I'm sorry I'm such a bad parent... I'm sorry I failed you...""  Blah blah blah.

I could probably list a whole lot more, but I'm just trying to get a point across. She hurts me alot and I can't do anything to make her stop. She doesn't care about my feelings at all (but says she does because she let me paint my room blue. *Eye roll*) I don't take it personally because I'm far enough in my understanding of the world to know it isn't my fault, but it's difficult to deal with and I can't call dhs out of fear of my siblings or her hating me for it... Even though she tells me to leave all the time. I just don't know what to do and she's pushing me towards my only escape of this mess— suicide. How do I make it all stop or at least how do I deal with it? I need help.",14Oct2017,1

6,"Alright so me and my crush last period together, it’s wrestling so we are there for like an Hour and a Half. I’ve had a crush on her for like 3 weeks now, it’s been weird I’ve haven’t tried to talk or Text her because I’m a Shy over thinker
These are somethings that happened in the past 2 days....
• yesterday I caught her looking at me
•today I turned to look at her and she was looking at me, we made eye contact but like **i know** it wasn’t one of those..”oh shit I accidently looked at him and we made eye contact” and I’ve been noticing her look at me. So how do I just be a man and text her whilst I’m scared of rejection?",14Oct2017,3
7,"My online friend who is 14 years old is currently trapped in a house with an 18 year old 'family friend' who has got his genitals out and is talking very inappropriately to her, she can't get access to her phone and she is watching her like a hawk on her and has had himself exposed for over an hour now. He has asked her sister who is slightly older than her for a B.J in the past and he has started suggesting playing games like 'Spin The Bottle.'
She is stuck alone with him, she is staying with her mother's property but doesn't know the address and her mother won't be home for five hours.

I am really worried about my friend and what this man will do to her, is there anything I can do to help from the U.K? I have the Cerulean Police Departments Facebook page but I don't know if they will respond to a message.",14Oct2017,3
9,"I (20F) have a crush on this server at a restaurant I visit ~weekly. He seems really cool and I want to get to know him more, but I have only ever seen him while he's working.
I don't want to make him uncomfortable by asking him out at work because he's obligated to be polite.
I also don't have any way of knowing if he already has a girlfriend.
But he's really friendly to me and we have small conversations and joke around when he's taking order/refilling water whatever but that could easily just be how he is to people/customers. 
I have no dating experience whatsoever so I don't really know how to tell when someone's flirting or just being nice.
I'm cool with rejection, but it's this ""what could be"" thing that's bugging me. 

Should I take the plunge and just leave my number on the check next time? That way since he won't see it until I've left and it doesn't put him on the spot and he can decide what to do with it?

12,"Hello Reddit, I would like some resources wisdom from you guys. Last night I read thr famous ""6 Harsh Truths"" article (http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/)
And man did it f*** me up. I haven't cried in ten years but sitting by myself on homecoming reading that article restarted the waterworks. I seem to be the exact person the author goes off on here , I'm a loser nice guy in college with no friends, a worthless major, no network, and no skills that would draw anyone to me. I'm halfway through college and I've had less life experience than am average 16 year old. Never been kissed or had a girlfriend; went to one house party but had a panic attack and had to leave; never was good enough to join a sports team (the few I tried kicked me out after a few weeks) and never did anything to deserve all the comforts I currently have. My parents are paying for me to go to college, but they don't know how much I hate my major or how I spend every weekend alone in my room. They probably think I'm secretly having the time of my life like they did in school. I dont want them to know how scared and alone I feel.

Of course being a straight guy at a university renowned for having gorgeous women everywhere its hard to get my mind off of romance. I've been browsing through askwomen and dating_advice and noticed a phrase repeated a lot to virgin guys: why would anyone want to date you? Do you offer any value?

This is the same sentiment that the cracked article expressed. I can fairly confidently say I don't. At least not enough to be competitive with all of the other guys on campus. They all seem to be so funny and outgoing, and most of them are jacked as well. Even the nerdier ones at least probably have a good internship or career ahead of them; I have nothing. My hobbies are pretty much limited to music (saxophone, but I wasnt able to pass any auditions for music groups near me) and video making. I used to want to be a YouTube star but never had the money for equipment. Ive studied filmmaking, animation and sound design but have no way to apply them. 

  All of my skills are theoretical, academic stuff that teachers tell you are really important in school but apparently dont mean jack s*** in the real world. I'm skinny with a puffy face so most women turn their nose up at me if even try to talk to them, the acne makes it worse. I've tried accutane and it helped but it also gave me horrible suicidal thoughts. I'm also shy and stumble on my words when I'm around others. My voice is unnaturally deep and I hate how it sounds. 

I've transferred schools so I don't know anyone or have any groups to fall back on. I'm more alone than I've ever been and I'm starting to see its all my fault. I chose to play video games and daydream instead of work out or go to parties. I chose to spend hours reading music books and studying music theory only to still be unable to write my own music. I chose to be a lazy, low-value individual because I thought that things would eventually just get better. 

Turns out that my horrible high school years were actually the best part of my life. At least I had a few friends there. I'm 20 and havent got anything to show for it. If you asked me who I am or what I like to do I would stare at you blankly because I do not know anymore. Everything in my life just feels empty so that must mean that I'm empty on the inside. Sometimes I try to walk through walls because I swear I'm a ghost to most people. All ive ever wanted in life was a group of friends to banter with and a cute girlfriend to hold me at night. I clung to this stupid fantasy all while avoiding the pain necessary to make it real. 

I am the most worthless person I know. Ive taken my privilege and squandered it. I'm socially awkward, out of shape, depressed, cast out from normal society. I cant watch tv or listen to modern music anymore since its all about love and partying and whatnot, stuff that I will never experience. When I'm not angry and hitting myself for being such a f***up I just lie in my bed bored. Nothing seems worth doing if I have to do it alone. I want to have something of worth to provide to people, to friends, to women, but at the end of the day I'm just a ""nice guy"" and boring f***s like me are a dime a dozen.

I don't want to give up but I don't see a way forward that doesnt end in misery. I wish I could kill my personality and take on someone else's. How do I start over when I have no foundation? I've realized that I am the problem in my life but the only way to fix that problem seems to be to destroy myself completely. Help me please.

14,"hi, im a junior in high school and long story short theres a girl that i thought liked me because she would always ""punch"" and poke me and like run her finger down my back and we talked a lot.

I asked her to go to lunch with me during school but shes ducked twice and she always brings up her other guy friends so i get the idea that she doesn't wanna be anything more then friends.

im extremely in love with this girl and i dont wanna break her heart but im not gonna torment myself all year being friends with a girl who ive been rejected by. I tried to not text her as much but she got worried and like kept texting me trying to start a convo and asked me whats wrong in class and i just said nothing but i dont know what else to do.

17,"so for some context I’m a 15 year old girl and (obviously) still in high school

when people meet me they generally think I’m pretty chill or whatever but as soon as it come to making plans or group work I just get really full on and take over, I am very much a believer in “If you want a job done right, do it yourself” even though I know I just need to get over it and let others take the lead I just can’t. For the most part, my friends appreciate not having to do work and let me go and deal with everything but I know that this wont always be the case. I also become a total bossy asshole in these situations and they probably don’t appreciate that part very much

With the perfectionist thing I literally freak out when people (almost just my parents) look at stuff I’ve made before I’ve had the chance to make sure it’s perfect and then give them permission to look at it. My mum used make me go through my school books with her every night to make sure I’m doing the right thing and every night I’d end up locking myself in my room and crying. What the fuck. Thats not acceptable, like thats not how a rational human being should be reacting to their mother trying to help them. I’d say this trait isn’t too bad if it actually resulted in me doing better work, but it doesn’t, I’m very “go hard or go home” with this sorta stuff (this isn’t from a fear of failure though) 

I feel like I could maybe use the control freak thing to my advantage and go into politics or whatever but I still do need to chill the fuck out and let other people take control, so how can I do that? With the perfectionist thing, that just needs to be irradiated completely because it’s fucking awful and I hate that part of myself, Its hurting my relationship with my mum, I just don’t know where to start",14Oct2017,2
18,"This is stupid. On going for months now. I tend to dream very vividly, and at times feel like some dream scenarios lasts days, weeks or months. After I wake up it feels like I have to get into my 'old' routine, which is my everyday life currently until the funny feeling that comes attached to the dream goes away.

It's just silly things, like in a dream a week or so ago, I had a dream where I got caught on barbed wire and got cut pretty bad, and had to tend to it. Still catching myself going to 'check' on it or try to itch the scab that isn't there.

In another dream I had an indoor cat at home, and I found myself, in real life, asking my mum where the cat was. She was confused, and she doesn't seem to recall. I ended up getting a bit upset, cause, well it felt like I lost a pet. 

Easy enough to tell that I didn't really drown or die, cause I'm still alive. 

It's getting really difficult to just wake up and say 'well, odd dream, on with my day' and get on with it. 

If I get hit or injured I can feel the pain the next day.

I don't even know if I've explained this clearly, but I dunno if it happens to people or not. Is it normal to have this much continuity happen so regularly after dreams? 

This probably sounds really stupid but does this happen?",14Oct2017,7
19,"A few months back I started, very casually, talking to this girl I have a couple classes with. She’s super sweet and easy to talk to and, of course, I end up developing feelings for her. 

So one day I decide to ask her to hang out sometime. So I message her that in question form and she responded with “as friends, or…”. and this is where I screwed up. I said “I hadn’t really thought of it in any other way” because I panicked and was afraid of scaring her off (our interactions had been pretty casual up to this point). But she did end up saying yes and we hung out and everything went really well, but she did say at the time she didn’t really have any interest in that sense. 

Fast forward to the present. We actually text quite a bit with each other, and we talk a lot more when we see each other in classes and things like that. I even told her some really personal stuff while we were talking once and she went out of her way to be supportive and non judge-mental and all of that. 

The problem is that, if anything my feelings toward her have become stronger and I keep feeling like I should just tell her and be done with it. But at the same time I don’t want to sacrifice what we have in case that all goes awry. 

I feel like it could go either way at this point. Because on the one hand she did say the last time we talked about it that she didn’t think of it that way, but that was also several months ago, and we’ve become a lot closer since then. For instance there’s a play being put on in my town soon, and I asked her if she’d like to go. She actually said she’d already planned on going with one of her friends, but that she’d be “more than happy” to go with me another day. 

Obviously I know that being friendly doesn’t equate to reciprocated interest, but I say all that to make the point that I’m not totally sure about how she feels now

Is it worth telling her how I feel?",14Oct2017,1

22,"I am a forester for an electricity company, and basically what I need to know is to be able to look at trees that might cause damage to the power lines and prescribe them for tree work to make sure that it does not happen. 

I got trained very poorly and the job position that I have isn't really supposed to go to new hires, it is meant for people after they have been in a different department for two years. The company was expanding when I got hired on, so I got the position. I got poorly trained, and my supervisor never really talks to me through emails. It's a pretty solo job meaning that we go to projects on our own do the work, and get our boss to audit them. 

My boss didn't make sure that I was ready to be my own, and never really told me that I was messing up. He took forever to set up a meeting for me or give me a new project and my numbers at the end of the year were poor for those reasons. I spent about 5-6 solid weeks of the year waiting for work. I did nothing. He never told me what I needed to know for this job and sprung new material a few days ago after telling me that I might be fired. 

Long story short, with no communication and improper training, I got my yearly review back and got a notice that I have to go through re-training and they are going to quiz me with a mock project to make sure that I know what I am doing. 

Currently, I am studying my ass off after being properly told a week ago what my job entails and the true nature of our job. I was never explained about how to do my job with that much detail. I am a hard worker and would have done that from the get-go. How do I make sure that I don't get fired by the end of the two weeks after the quiz? 

I have already talked to my boss's boss, the operation manager, and asked him how I can keep my job and told him some of my concerns about the lack of communication I get from my job, but I also making sure all the material that the guy who is now training me is going to stick with me. 

Am I doing enough? According to the ops manager he said that I shouldn't have this job because I was supposed to be working in a different department. There was an outline for what I needed to do which is the quiz. So, am I going to lose my job? Or should I just keep my head down and study my ass off to be ""sufficient"" enough to pass the quiz?

25,"Well, where to begin.
I am an Asian Male, 17, living in the Midwest. I've always been the odd kid; in Elementary school I had maybe 2 friends, but we never ""played after school."" I feel like this lack of social interaction was the foundation from which many of my current un-sociability traits derive. 

In Middle School, I was the target of bullying and had *zero* friends through the entire enrollment, aside from one very brief friendship with another male in my grade for half a year or so.

In all four years of High School, I had one friend, a female, for three of the four years. This friendship is my lengthiest yet. 

These circumstances, whence the following question derives; am I incapable of maintaining, finding, or starting friendships?

I'm moving to a large city across the nation alone in approximately 10 months, how will I initiate friendships in a foreign environment?

27,"So I have one really good friend, Carl. Carl has helped me out a lot, moving, money,  or even just being there. We've been friends for about 5 years, but now I feel as if that's coming to an end.

A couple months ago, Carl asked if I would mind if he dated my ex from 3 years ago (it didn't end well and I hate her guts). I said I didn't care, but strongly advised against it, and said I wouldn't want to be around her. He took it for consideration and about a week later, he decided to give it a shot. Whatever, it's his life.

Here recently, his grandfather passed away. Carl was really close to his grandfather. I felt terrible for him. He told me this 4 days after it happened. *That's a little strange* That seemed to be a long time to tell me.

I immediately call him and he doesn't pick up. I text him 3 different times that night, but he doesn't respond to any of them. *He's still mourning, he probably doesn't want to talk*

I don't contact him at all the next day. The following day, I call him again, still no answer. I text him and even hours later, he doesn't respond.

After work I decide to head over to his house to see if there's anything I can do for him and see if he's okay. He's neither at home not his grandma's house. *That's weird*

That night I see that he was hanging out with his girlfriend all day. The next day I call him, and still, no answer.

Now my problem isnt that he was hanging out with his girl. I understand that. My problem is, the entire time he was talking to her, he was straight up ignoring me. I understand if he wanted her counseling instead of mine, but I still don't feel that's a good reason to ignore me when Im trying to help him. And this shit hurts.

And under the circumstances, Im not completely positive that I'm in the right to be offended, because his grandfather died. And after he's helped me so much, I feel as if I'm indebted to him, as if I should just let this go. And maybe I should.

But it hurts like hell that I went from ""best friend that I could rely on for anything"" to put at the very bottom.

This happened three weeks ago and he hasn't said shit to me. Yeah, I've had friends that put me second to their girlfriends, but it has never been this guy. And I don't even feel like second place. We've never fought or even got in an argument before, so this is all new ground for me",14Oct2017,1
28,"I have this friend who is 16 and I am 17 and we are both close to each other. We have been friends since she came to our school which was 1 year ago and a few months, not long but we got very close to each other in the time being. Recently, she started dating this asshole about 4 months ago. At the beginning, I saw that they were both so cute together, they loved each other and that they were happy. But then I started seeing that he was controlling her. He would make her sit with him. She has this bestfriend who she grew up with since 7th grade and now, he (her boyfriend) would always force her to sit away from her bestfriend. She is also pansexual but he always says that pansexuality isn't real. She used to be so open about her sexuality, yell out that she is gay but now she says that ""she made a mistake on her sexuality"". 2 months ago, I started seeing her cut us off (me, her bestfriend, another friend, and her ex who she dated when she was 13) and started ignoring our texts and calls. She has almost no energy to do anything. The first few weeks of when they started dating, he would only let her hang out with us if he was there. By that, I mean if he was following her everywhere she went. She used to dress in any clothing that would hide her arms or legs or anything. She did that because she had scars from self harming, and she is very self-conscious. But after like 2 months, I think, she started putting on short skirts, tank tops, and jewelry and even make up, which wasn't her. She had cuts that were from the top of her thighs to her knee. When I tried to look for her scars the first time I saw her, I saw that they were covered in make up. No one else knew but us (her friends) and we were shocked. When we talked to her about it, she said that she wanted to try out some new outfits which was unlike her. She used to be such an internet nerd and we all are. We would talk on every social media there is but then she just suddenly left and stopped using the internet. When we asked about that, she said that she hated the internet now. I looked up signs to see if she was in an abusive relationship and she matched most of them. I don't know what to do. I talked to her about it before and she said that I was just paranoid. When I told her that he was controlling her, she said that he was just protecting her from getting hurt. I then asked her what he was protecting her from and she said that if she did something really wrong that he would show tough love and give her a ""punishment"".



I told her dad but he decided to ignore me because supposedly, they loved each other a lot and that she was just growing up. To me, it is unbelievable that she was growing up. Suddenly hating something that you grew up with, changed your life for the better that you just loved and were on yesterday was no growing up, at least to me. When I told the teachers, they started investigating into it and my friend's boyfriend and her were putting on an act the whole time. They lied and lied and I just wanted to punch him and just fucking get him out of her life already. It hurts so much that she is letting the asshole take over her life and just control her like she was some sort of guinea pig or dog. I want her to be safe and not get hurt from him. In the past, he was framed to be abusive but she looked past that because everyone said that her bestfriend is abusive because of how he is an asshole and people make up rumors about, which is not true and she thought that if people saying her bestfriend was abusive and it was a lie than it must be a lie that her boyfriend was abusive. I don't know what do anymore. ",14Oct2017,3
29,"I was in an accident last Sunday. Another driver was merging into my lane, I was in his blind spot. Our cars were stuck together, and we swerved off the road and into a parked car. Police filed a report and i called my insurance company. Heres the messy part. My car is in my ex fiances name. When i was with him, i had bad credit and no car. He agreed to put a car in his name (the loan, the title, etc.) And let me use it. We ended up breaking up and he let me keep it as long as i was paying everything. Which i did for 6+ months until the wreck last week. Any way, the insurance called me and told me my car was getting totalled and I have no car now. I have no way to get to work so I had to call off until further notice. I have $200 to my name. Not even enough to pay rent. So I'm dealing with going through all that (the accident wasn't even my fault) and the insurance company told me today that they aren't covering the full amount of the loan I had left on the car. They also told me that my ex was offered gap insurance  (insurance to cover the rest of the loan in this type of situation) when he bought the car, and he didn't want it. The gap insurance would've paid off the car. But he said no. I was not with him when he made this decision. So my ex messaged me today and informed me that I needed to finish paying off the car. I told him that I have 200 bucks to my name and can't afford to pay it off until further notice, and that he should have gotten the gap insurance because the car and insurance were both in his name and it was his responsibility. So he tells his mom and his mom called and left a 2 minute voicemail making me feel guilty because my ex has to pay for car repairs (which he should've gotten checked out a year ago when it first happened but now it's worse and his engine is blown) and that I need to be an adult and pay off my debt. She said it's not fair to make him pay for MY car even though it's in his name. She said if I wanted gap insurance I should have asked for it but I wasn't even there when it was explained to him and offered to him. I literally have no means to do pay this loan right now. This is the same ex that cheated on me, and when I left him, he was shitty to me about anything and everything and I was nice to him because my of the car. He would talk to me through messenger and I would respond and then he would get upset that I was talking to him.  I told one of my best friends about it and she took my exes side and made me feel even worse thay I was trying to make him pay the loan back. So in the end, I have no car, had to leave both my jobs until further notice, and have no income. My credit is bad. I have 27 items in collections that I can't afford to pay. I can't get a loan because of my bad credit and I can't afford to buy another car with no job. What is something I can do in this situation? There is $1,500 still owed on the car loan.

30,"It's been a year since I left my parent's house on their farm in Minas, Brazil to study Computer Science in a city not too far from there.

The problem is that instead of just calling me to know how I'm doing every day, which is cool, my mother wants a complete log about every second of my life. I have to keep texting her all the time where I'm going and who I am with. She calls me repeatedly in the morning to make sure I don't oversleep. She asked me for the password to my page of the university system so she can keep track of my grades and my schedules to know exactly when I leave home and when go back to it (and she never expects anything beyond that) and if I don't keep updating her she freaks out and throws her usual emotional blackmail.

Did she ever even think that I may want to hang out with friends? Did she ever remotely imagine that I want so much more than just study and get a degree and be an exact copy of who she and my father are?

My dad is not like this.

When I tried to talk to her about how I felt about this situation she overreacted and threatened to cut the money and force me to abandon my studies and go back to Minas. The thing is I don't have time to work, even part-time and I need their help. But I also need freedom.

My parents love their life in the countryside and they are in the place they belong to and find peace in. But I never felt the same way. I am finally getting to live and be someone other then just my parent's kid, but I feel suffocatad. My life has completely changed and I'm having troubles do adapt and all my mother cares about is if I'm following the narrow line she traced for me. I'm really done with this!",14Oct2017,3
31,"For starters, this will probably end up being long, so if you don't like reading long posts, you don't have to read this one. And if you're okay with it and you end up reading all of this, thank you for all your kind patience and interest.
 
To begin, I'm a 19 year old female attending university with a pretty good gpa and very few close friends, since I have a lot of trouble with both emotional and sexual intimacy. I've only had two relationships, all which were very brief and with younger and less experienced guys. since these were  both innocent and romantic, we never hooked up or got into intense making out or heavy petting, especially since I am a very traditional christian and choose not to partake in sexual stuff before marriage. Yeah, I know it's old fashioned.

 So, during the second week of my fall semester at university, I started really putting effort into my looks and makeup and became more feminine since I wanted to build some confidence, and this guy in one of my college classes, let's just call him chad, noticed me right after I started dressing more nicely and applying makeup on, and he added me on Facebook. He started chatting with me about the class project and since he knows I'm top of the class, he asked for thoughts and advice on his project and I sent him my in progress project as well. He asked if we could meet up and work on our projects as a group. I thought, what's the harm? Since I've done this many times before with both male and female classmates and thought it was just platonic and something to help each other out. 

But when we met up, I found that I was wasting my time since he wasn't working on his project at all, and said ""it's finished"", while I'm stuck there being stared at and working on mine. He said we should go grab lunch since it's that time of day, and we did, but he began talking about his interests and trying to connect them with mine, although I'm really polite so I just agreed with him. Then he asked me out then and there and I say ""sure why not"", since I've been on dates and thought it could be some fun, plus he said he lived a very clean lifestyle and morals, and seemed like a geeky, harmless type. I said I really wanted to watch a movie that was showing at the theaters but chad insisted we go over to his place to watch something, to which I curtly said ""no thanks"" to, since I know what that means. He compromised and said we'll just go to the nearby theaters THAT NIGHT. I did not agree on going on a date within merely 1 and 1/2 hours of meeting him and thought that was too fast. So I said I was really busy tonight and would be available on the weekend. We talked a little more and I dropped hints about me being very Christian in values and liking clean dating. When I finished up my project and was about to go home, he asked me to drive him back to his apartment since he didn't want to take the bus and it would be faster with me. I agreed and drove him there since it's close by. As soon as I drop him off, he asks me if I want to ""check out his apartment"", to which I said ""no thanks"" to again. At this point, I was already regretting saying yes to the date since I was figuring out how much of a manwhore he probably was, especially since he would constantly talk about knowing a lot of famous people And showed me photo proof, which he probably might use to get girls to sleep with him. 

So the weekend rolled by and I showed up at the theater, ready to get this over with and tell him I won't be up for a second date since he might want to just ""show me around his apartment"" again and I was just looking for something light hearted, fun, and non sexual (due to my religious beliefs). The date was absolutely atrocious. As soon as we settled in our seats, chad wrapped his arm around me and forcefully started snogging my face (btw he is a horrible kisser, I'd prefer making out with a dying octopus) and its at this moment that I thought this guy isn't normal.
 
I know sex culture is a thing around college, but this guy informed me he didn't smoke, drink, or do drugs and wasn't part of the party crew around campus, but here he goes throwing out all dating etiquette and slobbering all over my lips and pushing his tongue down my throat, when usually that is something you wait until the end of a date to do, let alone begin with small pecks. Also, he never asked for permission, so I felt very violated. I had to take 4 bathroom breaks to spit out all the filth into the bathroom sink and irrigate my mouth, even gulping down the drink I ordered after he would forcefully piledrive kiss me every 10 minutes just so I could get the bad taste of his breathe and spit out of my mouth (did I mention that on this date, he had the B.O. of 10 million shreks lounging around in a sauna full of wet dogs?) 

Now me being polite and avoidant of hurting others' feelings, I had trouble telling him I couldn't do this, especially since there were people around and he would do this at random and unpredictable times. He pushed me closer to him as the movie went along, and started leaning his head on me, kissing my cheek and forehead, caressing my hair, and holding my hands, something I surprisingly also felt uncomfortable with since I normally like this kind of PG romantic bodily contact, although I had good reason for feeling uncomfortable, since this was literally THE FIRST DATE. After the hell was over, I booked it out of there quickly and begrudgingly agreed to drive him home, to which he asked if I would ""check out his apartment"" again. I replied ""no"" several times, but gave up since he wouldn't quit it and I decided in my mind that if he tried anything funny, I would push him away and leave the place immediately, telling him that I don't want to do that kind of stuff (since when duty calls, I can actually say no and stand up for myself surprisingly). I went inside with him, he told me his roommates were out (my second red flag so far), and starts randomly kissing me and grabbed my butt, to which I push him away and say ""it's literally the first date and I don't sleep around okay"". He meekly said ""okay"", and pushed me onto his bed thinking I just want to start things slow with him, petting me heavily and trying to kiss me again. I pushed him away again with more force and abruptly got up. He asked me what was wrong and I told him I felt very uncormfortable, in a cold voice. I left him room awkwardly and went downstairs, while he apologized behind me. I left his apartment fuming and berating myself for letting myself get taken advantage of by this guy. As soon as I got back home, I noticed I received a bunch of texts of apology from him saying ""I'm sorry if I came on to you too strong"". I was feeling rather sick to the stomach from the experience at this point, so I didn't reply to his texts as went straight to bed after  scrubbing myself in the shower for a good hour and thoroughly brushing my teeth for 28 minutes. 

The next morning, he face timed me and I couldn't avoid it as I accidentally clicked it thinking it was a text from my brother (bad mistake). He started apologizing and telling me he would try to be a little slower next time and respect my space. I would have cut him off and told him I didn't want to give him another chance at this point, since I didn't have a good time, but he really seemed to be reflective on his actions and seemed to really like me more than just a hookup. So I weakened under pressure and agreed to a second date, although the small crush I had of him during our initial texting days were gone at this point since those actions he took were a major turnoff for me and started getting me thinking and noticing how I hated all this intimacy and didn't feel sexual towards this guy, nor anyone else. Everything was strictly romantic but since I am religious, it was difficult to distinguish the line between religious abstinence and not feeling sexual towards anyone at all. 

Over the next week at school, I found out that he would be patrolling the building of our class and looking for me everywhere for a while before class started, since I would catch him circling around the hallways looking for something, only to notice me and quickly follow me to class. Although I found this pattern to be a bit creepy after it happened 3 times, I was still not that great at communication, very polite, an empath at heart, and thought that since he was still really nice, I should give him a second and last chance at a date. He blew it. The first thing he asked in the car when I picked him up was, ""can I kiss you?"", to which I said ""uuuum, no I'm driving right now"" or find any other excuse that didn't seem too odd every single time he would ask me. At the theater, He did the same forceful making out thing every 10 minutes, holding hands, leaning on me, kissing my cheek and forehead, kissing my neck, and by the end of the date he boldly said he reaaaallly liked me and asked if we could be exclusive. ON THE SECOND DATE! I had already come to terms with the fact that I am most definitely not having this semi-sexual intimacy especially so early, not only with this guy, but with everyone, since although I had been seeing the prudish behavior signs before, I never fully acknowledged my asexuality until getting slapped in the face with it now from this guy and noticing that I felt the same towards everyone one else I dated before this as well. 

Although he luckily got the memo on the sex part and didn't invite me to his place that night, that was the second date and he already is talking about a possible third date, which I want to break to him will never be happening due to his intensely sexual nature and its incompatibility with my sexuality and religious values. I wish I could've told him this earlier after the first date, but he face timed me before I could process what happened and send him a text, and I am horrible with confrontation and communicating clearly face to face. He probably thinks I've never been in a serious relationship before and attributes that to why I'm being standoffish and more casual and non-touchy with him. But I've already told him my values and how I don't deal well with touching or intimacy (haven't told him it's partially because I was sexually abused by a close relative as a young child, although that's too much information to reveal on the first few dates) and he doesn't seem to listen well because he keeps mentioning things he's already told me several times and asking me questions I've already answered about myself several times. I feel that whenever he talks to me he's just ogling at me and fantasizing about kissing me or waiting for a chance to slip the tongue in without paying much attention to what I'm saying or who I am, which is why I feel it is quite shallow and mostly sexual when he continuously told me he really liked me, he felt like we really connected, that I am so beautiful, I look like a female k-pop star, etc when he barely even got to know who I really was and wanted to dive into this deep relationship I wasn't prepared for. 

Sorry for taking so long, but long story short, I don't know what's the best way to go about telling him I can't go on another date with him without seeming like I led him on and knew what I was buying into on the second date since what happened on our crazy first date, since our communication didn't seem to work that well together. I feel kinda guilty about not being clearer and giving him a second chance and I don't think I like him even slightly romantically anymore (that ended on the first date) and think that maybe just being friends for now would be a better idea? Since we do have similar taste in films at least, and it's not like we could get along platonically. If I tell him I can't see him anymore, he'd definitely be confused because I am so polite about it and barely showed signs to him that I wasn't exactly having the time of my life, although that's probably just what he saw from his perspective.

I do understand that I need to stand up for myself more often and that I'm being too nice and polite and not very good at communication and that I made a mistake from the first move since now I realize I should've told him I didn't know him well and we should start from friends and get to know each other better before anything gets serious, but at this point that isn't even an option.

What do you guys think? You don't have to be an expert on this or anything, just any thoughts, personal experiences, or recommendations would help greatly. Also please excuse my constant run-on sentences, I'm just writing this down as it comes to mind.
Thank you so much, every comment is much appreciated.",14Oct2017,3

Here’s my situation.

I’m a female software engineering student that is soon to be graduated. Looking for jobs obviously and most jobs pay $75K+ for entry level positions. I’m very excited about it after these 5 years of college.

I’m also married to a film director. My husband does music videos, wedding videos, all that jaz. His work is decent. It’s not exactly “amazing work!” but he has improved day after day. Mostly he loves what he does which is great.

The kicker of it all is: he makes below minimum wage on average doing it. He doesn’t work 40 hours a week and when I suggest that he fill the spare time with a part time job, he scoffs and says he doesn’t have time. I have called his work a paid hobby which hurts his feelings because he sees it as a job. But realistically, if I became pregnant it’s not like we could be supported on his income while I was on leave. And it’s not like he really treats it like a job (I.e keeping organized with simple receipts for tax purposes). Plus, he’s gone all the time for it or to go to clubs with his “business partner” to go see artists to make videos for.

I’m starting to just feel over it. We got married young. I don’t want to call it a mistake, but I feel like I’m outgrowing him. I care about finding some stability and settling down a little. He can’t even get me a damn insurance paper to me for three weeks when our insurance gets canceled because of missing paperwork.

I want him to grow up some. Not abandon his dream but just be realistic on if he can really see that supporting us. I feel like when I do get a software job I’m going to be paying for everything when before we got married he kinda gave me the impression that he would take care of us. 

Currently we’re separated and I know if I talked to him about this he would turn it around to make me feel like a gold digger. I’m just asking for practicality. Advice welcome.

33,"Hi! I'm a 22 year old girl and honestly I have zero friends. It's kind of laughable. I wouldn't say I'm weird or even weird looking, I'm pretty normal. I'm in college but I only attend class once a week and do the rest online. I have a job but I work by myself at a hospital. How do I go about making friends? It's weird because most people expect you to have friends so it's hard to make new friends without having any. For example, I used to work retail and I was invited out by my coworker but she asked me to bring some of my friends. I ended up not going because I didn't want to admit I actually didn't have any friends. Any advice helps. Thanks. ",14Oct2017,2

I turned in a paper I had written for the class the first time I took it because it was the exact same assignment. I didn't think it was a big deal, but TurnItIn said it was a 100% match for plagiarism. I'm so embarrassed and stressed out;  I don't know what will happen.

My brother was a CS major, and now my parents want me to be CS major. I didn't really know what I want to do, so I gave it a shot.

College life crumbling, don't want social interaction, no motivation for anything, missing classes because of going to bed late, not eating at all on some days.

38,I lost my job last week. I am still very much reeling and not sure what to do with myself. I'm 31 and I expected to stay at that job for my foreseeable future. What can I do to start putting my life back together? I'm sort of paralyzed right now.,14Oct2017,3
41,"I started at my current company in February. I was interviewed by Jack and Cruella, Jack being my direct supervisor and Cruella is his. It was a great job in my career field with good benefits and an amazing salary. I was so excited to jump on board. I show up on my first day and my trainer called off. For the rest of the week he shows me a few things on the computer between trying to do work himself, not spending much time with me. Week 2 I am in the role and already working reports on my own with very little training. I started to notice Cruella hasn't spoken to me even though her office is next to my cubicle and she chats up the men no problem. We are the only two women in the department and I'm not the most outgoing person so I don't say anything and continue figuring out my role. I get along and have a good working relationship with my other co-workers. 

Fast forward 4 months. Jack gets moved to a different department and I get a new boss, Joe. Cruella still hasn't talked to me. It’s starting to come to light that certain responsibilities of mine weren't being addressed. Joe then showed me that I was running reports incorrectly and realize I had very little training. I worked night and day for weeks to try to catch up on this newly found work. The first time Cruella talks to me is in a meeting to chew me out in front of the whole department for something I had missed due to me not running reports correctly. I ask for additional training and help multiple times and didn't receive anything. At this point no one has sat down with me to check in, give feedback, ask me if I have questions. Things are very awkward with Cruella as she refuses to even acknowledge me. I have started talking to HR about how I'm feeling and how I've asked for training on multiple occasions to no avail.

September begins and I feel like I can finally catch my breath. I have department heads coming to me telling me I weathered the storm well and I'm doing a good job.

Today both Joe and Jack pull me aside. Cruella wrote up a scathing mid-year review for me and both of them are completely confused. Neither one of them agree with what she had to say and wanted to forewarn me about this review I'm going to get on Monday. Supposedly this thing is so mean that they broke the rules by even telling me because they believe she isn't being fair. She didn't even provide constructive criticism or a plan on how to improve my performance. I told them how I don't think she has liked me from day 1 and I'm not sure why and they agreed this sounded personal.

I don't even know what to do, confronting Cruella sounds terrifying. Joe and Jack told me to take the review with a grain of salt but reviews affect raises. I've been looking at other jobs in the meantime but I feel conflicted. I would love my job if she wasn't there but her presence is giving me panic attacks. I cry in the bathrooms at work. Sunday night I break out in hives thinking about seeing Cruella. 

I feel lost and heartbroken. I don't feel like I was set up for success and no matter what I do, Cruella will not give me a chance.



TL;DR - My boss's boss hates me and it might be because we are both women. She has never talked to me or worked with me but wrote a horrible review that my boss doesn't agree with.

42,"There is nothing unique about something claiming to love chocolate or loving sweets. But I feel like my situation goes a step further. I do love chocolate and I love sweets but I also think about them constantly, dream about eating treats, and am drawn to them. I think about chocolate and sugar throughout the entire day, where to find it, what food its in, what desserts are nearby,  how much of it I can eat without my friends noticing, how much I could get with the money I have with me, etc. Its so annoying. No matter what grocery store I am in, I have to look at the bakery. I have to go in every dessert store. I have to see all of the cakes, donuts, pies, cookies, etc to decide which one is the best and then proceed to talk myself out of buying any of them. If I am with friends, I find excuses to go and look at the pastries or I try and hide the fact that I am in the bakery or in the sweets isle and if they are next to me I try to make it look like I'm not looking. It brings me shame for some reason to think that anyone would know how much I want to look at the treats and eat every single one of them. I even look uo pictures of sweets and pastries online to try and curb cravings. I am a thin person, work out regularly, and eat very healthily. If I gave into my cravings, I am certain I would have health problems because I would only ever eat sugar. I have tried to cut sugar out and limit sweets and I have also tried to give into the cravings just a little and even give in completely. I have eaten an entire chocolate cake in one sitting and gone without sugar for more than a week. It really doesn't matter either way because I am still constantly thinking about where to find it. Its frustrating and I know it must have some deeper roots. Maybe a control issue? Something mental? I have tried supplements to curb some cravings (magnesium for chocolate cravings) which made a little difference but obviously the mental aspect is stronger.

They refuse to believe my problem has nothing to do with light or noise - I just can't sleep. This is a persistent problem that I think MUST have a medical solution. I'm doing a demanding job on an average of 4 hours sleep a night and I can't get any medical professional to take me seriously.

The assignment was minuscule, so I'm surprised she suggested we exchange numbers and put her number in my phone and told me to text her. We literally had to send like 2-3 texts to each other over it and then she started talking to me about my personal things about my job, asking me more questions to extend the conversation.

Should I just take this as a sign that she is physically attracted to me? I know when girls are being friendly, but honestly she doesn't seem that friendly towards other people in general but she seems to treat me differently.

It was funny, during texting she was like ""I love where your work it's amazing lmfao"" I work at a grocery store, I said haha I don't like it that much. She was like ""Aww I'm sorry, I only like it because it's better than (this other store).

As far as body language, all I've noticed is that she looks at me as we talk and asks questions, sometimes smiles and laughs, and one time I asked the teacher a ques, went back to my seat and she was looking at me looked away when I looked in her direction.

I find out later that it was outside of work when this happened. Allison's older sister also works with us and is a friend of mine and I felt like she needed to know, especially due to her family's drug history, so I tell her what's going on. Allison is confronted by her sister and is now livid because she feels like Carla betrayed her trust by telling me.

59,"Hi all, it's my 21st in a few weeks and I've invited a friend I used to be really close with, but she has this boyfriend (9 years older than her and everyone else) who is a nightmare. He drinks heaps, leaves mess everywhere (he came to a concert with us once in our friend's car and left his alcohol and food mess all over the backseat, pretty disrespectful), is a rumoured drug dealer (crack head = confirmed) and my 21st is a 3 hour afternoon tea event with my grandparents and little cousins in attendance. I really don't want him around, I don't trust him to not be drunk of under the influence of drugs. This is particularly important because my mum recently left my Dad, who used to abuse her under the influence - I can't have that kind of thing in her house, it isn't fair to her. Additionally, when we see my friend and her bf together, they cuddle and makeout and stuff right next to us and it's disgusting. 
I invited her and she RSVP'd yes, but I don't know whether she assumes she can bring him? Normally when we ask her to come to an event, she always messages to see if she can bring him along - but she hasn't done that this time. 
How do I tell her she can't bring him? I'm just worried she's assuming yes and will drag him along, and I really don't want him around.

I may have pushed her too far, as it's gotten to the point that she's blocked me and won't speak to me face to face. Do I just need to give her time and space to try and forgive me for how annoying I was to her or should I get to moving on? For context, the silence has lasted for about two weeks now, with her only talking to me periodically to tell me to leave her alone when I try to apologize. 

She means a lot to me, even though we have a (currently) platonic relationship. The thought of just dropping it and moving on from this person who has been my closest friend for six years now is a little heart-wrenching, but is that the best course of action?

I went to a regular high school, two actually and left my first high school for irrelevant reasons then went to the other high school from late January this year all the way to October 8-9th and inevitably started the education institute im currently going to. Before I left I had this one teacher that stuck out to me, she was a gorgeous women in her late 30s with blond curly hair. I know what you're thinking, one of those curvy/voluptuous teachers praying on younger high school boys. Nope... unfortunately not lol She wasn't like super hot or anything but She always complemented on my looks and how I have a nice build on my shoulders. She even asked me if I am gonna be a male model after high school and I just sat there with a big grin on my face not knowing what to say. I have to admit though her compliments or how I see it (flirtatious comments) sure as hell built my confidence. I found it kind flattering that an older women was saying that to me, the day I went back over there to let the school know that I moved to this school and have my teachers sign a paper she told me she'll check up on how I'm doing at the school I am now going to.

I have a group of friends. They are a trio and they have grown up together. The trio consists of 2 girls and a guy. Now while they are all best friends, the 2 girls are like sisters.

A little while ago, the dude tells me he finds one of the girls interesting (we'll call her Girl A), so he starts talking her up alot and they start flirting. It went unnoticed by Girl B until tonight. Tonight was our school's homecoming game and even though I was supposed to be there to occupy Girl B, I couldn't make it (he was okay with it). Well reality smacked Girl B in the face as she realized that she was the third wheel. This upset her because the girls were supposed to be ""sisters"" but Girl B felt like she got replaced by ""some guy"". I had to remind her that Girl A and the guy were both her best friends but she quickly denounced them as her best friends and titled them ""fake hoes"" (I wish I could make this up).

According to her though, the moment that really upset her was when they went to the store without her even though she denied the invitation to go. I tried to calm her down by telling her to be happy for the two but then she turned on me and said I was ""taking their side.""

I'm really mad right now. Why, you ask? Because my (18F) little brother (15M) is a theiving cunt. Let me give you some details. 

I gave this fucker the combination to my stash lockbox in case he needed it. Occasionally I share my weed with him. I'm generous, as long as he is nice. My dad has been instituting drug tests on him because he's currently been failing all of his classes due to smoking. Not only that, he allowed his friends to *break into our home and steal things from my family*. (Long story.) CBD doesn't show up on tests, so I gave him a little of mine because I'm just such a *great* sister. 

I take CBD to help relieve extreme period cramps. I buy them with my own money and I am currently on an *extremely* tight budget. 

Yesterday I went to get some of my CBD gummy bears and guess what? They were gone. *The fucker stole them.* After I open my arms to him, he steals $50 worth of edibles that I use for pain from *me*. I am seeing red, because when I text him about it, this is what I get.

91,"So I am an ESL teacher in China. First the good.

I work, with class planning, about 30 hours a week spread out over 6 days a week (some days are 7 teaching hours, some are only 1 or 2). I make more than enough, I go out drinking and partying 2 or 3 times a week, I eat out with my wife or friends a lot and save about $1,000 USD a month in the bank. I work at a college and I am off 4 months a year with pay, 2 in the Summer 2 in the Winter. I run a lot of private classes and every one, parents and school owners, love the shit out of me and I love 90% of my students.

And the bad.

It is China. It is pretty dirty all around, people spitting, little kids pissing in the streets, crowded as fuck, I ride my ebike everywhere and its just wall to wall people, cars in the bike lanes, bikes not looking, buses hugging corners against the light, etc. The Chinese are incredibly pushy, they don't queue, you'll wait in line for something for 20 minutes only to get to the front and have people elbowing you or shoving their documents over your shoulder. Most every one's breath stinks like dog shit and they want to talk real close to you. Anything not Chinese is expensive so a foreign beer is about $5+ or an Indian meal for 1 is $18 whereas a bowl of noodles is $1. The internet is jacked and getting worse. I can watch Youtube and do my email fine but every now and then it just flakes out and videos won't load beyond 360p, I can't stream anything, talking or calling friends on Skype or Facebook is a coin flip, its totally useable but the little moments make me want to pull my hair out. The Chinese are not Western at all, they don't care about sports, they don't like to drink until 1 AM, having lunch or dinner is always this very formal engagement where you have to exchange presents and do nonstop toasts and, the worst ever, on the spot singing and if you don't your seen as rude. The city I'm in only has about 150 foreigners, I'm friends with 40 or so and we do once a week big foreigner events but people come and go constantly, its hard to plan anything long term because you know this is all temporary and after 3 years I'm one of the last of my initial circle of friends.

My friend has really put me over the edge with pointing out everything I've tried to ignore. Most of it is just fatigue after 3 years. I have it VERY comfortable as far as work and money and my vacations are amazing but I can't help but shake the feeling I've peaked as a person.

I don't care about being a billionaire, I avoid stress at all costs, I'm 100% confident of my skills as an ESL teacher, my CV is beyond badass to move anywhere and I've had offers in every country I've applied but I've settled on Prague, czech Republic. Japan is too much stress for not enough money, Thailand and other Asian countries are not enough money, same for S. America, Korea or Vietnam is a middle ground but I'm Asia'd out at this point, I want to go to Europe.

The problem is the money is going to be half, if not less, than what I make now. The hours will be similar, the work will be a tad more stringent, I won't have vacations, I won't have company fallbacks like housing (I currently have 2 apartments in China because of what schools provide you), where I live because of the lack of foreigners your really treated like royalty and that'll be gone, I can't just sing on my ebike at the top of my lungs, I can't swear at drivers who cut me off (but will I need to in Prague?).

But in theory I'll be gaining a country with Western mindsets, they celebrate Christmas, good beer is $1 instead of $5+, I won't be eating noodles 10 times a week, the roads are taken care of, there's 1/50th the density of people, ideally the bathrooms won't have big piles of shit outside the squat toilet just on the floor, I'll have a million Western people to have a drink, watch a football game and talk about the real world, drug laws are laxed so if I want to smoke a joint on the weekend I can, I guess I've said enough.

Jay confronts Aly just to say that she's aware of her bad talking, and she knows this info because Em and Vi tell me. And I have no reason to lie. Just passing along what was said to a close friend to help her resolve issues and find truth into these ""rumors.""

I'm hoping it'll get better - I'm sure it's just a time thing, and this has been her territory for the last two months so she might just be a bit annoyed with me for that.

Is there anything I can do to make her transition to me being around a little bit easier for her? At the moment I'm just kind of keeping a distance (by me staying upstairs) because I don't want to stress her out (nor do I really want to be in a situation with a dog I don't trust).",14Oct2017,1
96,"Throwaway account here and some details may be changed on the off chance this is seen by the person in question.   

I (male) recently got a Tinder account out of boredom with very limited success.  Few matches and the few I got didn't go anywhere with conversations.   Except for one person in particular, a woman a couple years older than me.   

After chatting for a few days, I decided to look them up online.   They had an Instagram attached to their profile, so I had the full name.  That name brought up accounts under it and another name (with a different last name), including two different Facebook accounts (using the same photos as their Tinder.)

Other accounts for this person show a different age, 3 or 4 years older than what they have listed on Tinder.   Them being that age isn't an issue for me, but them lying is.   

Further digging led me to a LinkedIn account which had their claimed profession, but listed...oddly.    Instead of having it say (Position) at (Company name), it says (Position) at (Field).   Which seems sketchy.  

Then further searching led me to a site with the biggest red flag, a listing for an arrest for one of those names.   The mugshot I found, while I'm not 100% sure, looks like the person in question.   And the arrest came within the last year, includes ""failing to pay child support"" (they claimed not to have kids) and a few more severe felonies.

I haven't responded in a few days to their latest message, although I haven't completely blocked them yet.   They don't have my phone or address, but know my profession and could fairly easily track me down if they wanted to.  

Suggestions on what to do next?   I've considered ghosting, but I'm not sure if that would prompt harassment.   At the moment, I'm thinking slowly message less and less because I'm ""preoccupied with work, no free time,"" and hope they lose interest in me. ",14Oct2017,0
97,"Well I have a relatively big friend group but I only have a few close friends who I really trust. Sometimes I feel as if i’m coming off needy because they have a lot more close friends than I do. But thats not really the point, I decided to do a sarahah on snapchat where people can leave anonymous feedback. My friends have done it and got good responses so I gave it a go. I got responses like “a bit of a c*nt” or “I dont really like you” and even “ur a poo”. Where did I go wrong? They are all pretty rich and have fancy clothes whereas I dress in sweatpants and a shirt from target so is it that? I try to be approachable, I listen and I’m not selfish (or at least I don’t think I am). I don’t see why they might think this. The worst part is I can’t ask them or see if it’s the people that I know dont like because it’s anonymous. What might make me seem like less of a “poo” to everyone.

99,"About two weeks ago I lost my virginity to a girl that had some experience with other guys. Out of the 5 guys that she's engaged with, 2 of them she had no idea about because they were random hook ups. Now I'm horrified because I have flu like symptoms and 3-4 small white patches on my tongue. Now I have been tutoring about 3 or 4 students that have all been extremely sick but I've never had this type of symptom(white patches). I did some research and most websites recommended to get tested 3-6 months after you have Intercourse but I'll go crazy if I wait that long. She has never been tested and she can't confirm to me that she doesn't have anything but she didn't mention this until after the fact that I had sex. What do yall recommend, I know I sound like I'm rambling on but I've been having extreme panic attacks about this and I don't know what to do. 


Edit: first of all, thank you for all the replies I really appreciate them. Some things I didn't mention were I had a sore throat for about 4 days and It just got better two days ago, so maybe I have strep and the white patches on my tongue are a symptom of it? Also, the reason I didn't use a condom is because A) she's on birth control and my only fear was getting her pregnant B) I didn't even think about STIs or STDs which was extremely immature because I trusted her to tell me.

105,"We've been friends for a year now and she said I'm like a brother to her ( I don't have romantic feelings for her so I don't mind that at all ) and that she always wanted us to be in eachothers lives. 


I've had moments where I would question the friendship, not because she's a bad friend (  quite the opposite ) I have relationship anxiety with everyone not just her, but she'd always told me that she'd always be there and I told her the same.


Lately I kinda got the impression that we weren't as close as before, but I kept it to myself. Nothing significant made me think that because we still communicated and joked around like always. Last week, I had a bad week.  I called her on last Friday but kept the part of me having a bad week to myself. I didn't want to vent it towards her, so we talked and everything as usual. The conversation was short that kinda triggered me, and let me explain. It was the reason why I thought it was cut short. I know people have other things to do, so no I don't expect anyone to talk to me for super long on the phone, but because I was already in a negative state I jumped to the worst conclusion. 





I kinda took it as a distancing thing and it reinforced my thoughts of our bond not being as close, and I started thinking to myself "" What is the point in this, lets just stop talking "" So I know, to her it came kinda random. After we hung up is when my anger stewed up, and I texted her "" Hey I don't think we should stay in touch anymore, love you, wish you well, and take care of yourself. I wont contact you please don't contact me. It wasn't really her, I kinda wanted to be just done with everyone. I keep this stuff to myself, but if I think one person doesn't like me I think no one does, but I was close to texting everyone to lose my number and I was ready to block and delete everyone. I called my mother before that and I told her everything, and she talked me back to my senses. I felt like "" god why did I do that? "" I later got a text from my friend saying "" ok "". This was a very impulsive mistake I made.


So I waited an hour and called her, didn't get anything. I then left a text saying "" I'm sorry about earlier I had issues during the week and let my emotions get the best of me, it had nothing to do with you, hopefully we can talk again at some point. "" Didn't hear back. 

Sunday I called left a voicemail saying "" Hey, I wanted to apologize again for the other day, I had other issues going on and I shouldn't have brought that on. I guess whenever you get this if you're up for it, if you want to call back. I guess I'll talk to you whenever I hear from you. Still nothing. 


So Tuesday I texted "" Hey hope you're doing well, I just wanted to ask, if you don't want to talk anymore, could you let me know so I can just put this behind me? I didn't mean what I said, it was impulsive and I didn't think before I sent it. Have a safe evening. ""



I can't reachout anymore. Two mistakes I noticed. I should have waited until I was in a better emotional state before I called her, or anyone really and I should have really thought about what I was doing before I did it.


She's always gotten back to me. I don't think she's overreacting because I don't know how it looked from her perspective. I hope she didn't think I was internationally trying to hurt her or manipulate, or say that with ill internations, I wasn't thinking clearly and that was my error. I have know clue how she received it. She doesn't owe me an explanation, but I'm trying to speculate as to why she's not responding at all, I can understand if I said something vile to her.





Apart of me thinks that if she was going to respond she wouldve done it, but the other part of me thinks if she wanted to end the friendship she wouldve said it. Its up to her now. I know its only been a week, but I don't know. Did what I say seem like something that would end a friendship? Any opinions on how she may have tooken it?

Yes again I made a few mistakes but I don't think I've done anything to be completely ignored. Can this be fixed? When I talked to my mother she  told me to give it time and that I made a simple mistake nothing unforgivable, but I don't know.",14Oct2017,2

Last night we had some kinda sleepover camping in an old house and we were just chilling. She was under the blanket with me and like everyone else were like sitting on the other beds and we were playing some kinda game. Anyway we were holding hands finger crossed (nothing new) and suddenly she took my hand to her breast and she was wearing like a Calvin Klein Sports Bra with a regular bra under. So yeah, she took it so that I was touching her breast and after a while i removed my hand just to like pull up the blanket and she did it again. I slowly ajusted my grip like around it and squeezed it gently and she didn't react negatively so just to be sure I just sat up and pulled her up against me and she twisted so that she was lying on top of me facing upwards and she moved my hand between her breasts so I dragged my finger down into the bra and I felt her boob with my hand under the bra. And she didn't act weird afterwards like she regretted it or something. So I just wonder, does she like me and if that's the case, how should I take the next step and what would that be?

111,"So I moved to my flat recently with a couple of cool people. They make a friend and introduce us. Off the bat she seems nice and friendly. Cut to our third time meeting where she wants to come with me shopping as I was going to buy some much needed clothes. She immediately starts getting too physical, wrapping her arm around mine (I make an excuse of checking my phone to free my arm) then after that she holds my hand. I make the same excuse and afterwards she still wraps her arm around mine. I put it down to her just being super friendly even though we've known each other like three days.

We get back to my flat because she wants to watch a movie, I think ""okay no biggie I don't think I've given any indication of feelings towards her"". During the movie she gets up and then lies next to me when she comes back, then saying she likes me. I don't reciprocate the feelings. She doesn't leave and just stays there, starts smelling me and telling me how nice I smell. I'm beginning to feel a wee bit uncomfortable. 

She then starts asking me invasive as heck questions like how many girls have I dated/ had sex with? What happened in your last relationship? Did you love her? Would you get with anyone now? Do you only date white women ( I date any girl from any race, skin colour doesn't cross my mind). Why aren't you dating right now? 

I felt like my firm ""no"" wasn't good enough and she was asking all these weird questions so I asked her to leave.

She's been calling and messaging me since, I've only responded once and she started using the 😍 and talking about me which I thought was strange.

One of my friends said she was asking questions about me like does he like anyone? Has he brought anyone over to the flat?

She then starts coming over to our flat uninvited (our front door sometimes doesn't automatically lock) and knocking on my door.  She then messages me asking to show how the laundry machines work in out apartment complex, I don't respond but she takes that as a yes and comes over. The other day she comes over and leaves a note underneath my door with writings and illustrations of us.

I'm too scared to tell my flat mates because they all really like her but don't know about this. I'm not saying she's a bad person but needs to understand boundaries and to understand that I really don't like her in that way. 

Edit: also forgot to mention she said to me ""you seem like one of those people who say no but really mean yes"" which I think is her viewpoint of this situation.",14Oct2017,46
113,"I have been with my boyfriend for a month and we're both very serious about this relationship. I told him about my plan to go to Iceland, we then got the idea to go together in April. 

Today he told me he found a cheap holiday for november this year. It would be afforable for both of us at this moment and we have a bigger chance at seeing the Northern lights. 

Going to Iceland has been my dream for a few years now and I still don't know why it attracts me so much. But I follow my heart and doing that has also given me the study of my dreams and my boyfriend. 

The thing is, my parents do not approve of him (yet). They are sceptical and are afraid I will settle down too quick (which I won't, I have talked about it with him). I understand their concerns, also because he is quite older than I am, but I am an adult and it's time for me to grow and to experience life.

I really want to go on this trip, I almost cried when he told me about this because it means so much to me. But I do not know how to ask my parents. 

I will have to book this holiday within a week to prevent prices from rising. How should I approach this situation?

114,"I was with a group of friends having lunch and I had my bag open. I was distracted talking and said friend decided to take a hat I had in there and hide it. The thing about the hat is that I needed it for an activity later that day and if I didn't bring it I'd have some penalties for absence of material. It wouldn't be the first time, either. So when I looked into the bag and didn't see it there I freaked out a bit. He then gave me back my hat and still in the panicked mode I was rude and told him ""I didn't like it. I didn't like that you took my hat and hid it. What I keep in my bag is mine and I don't like people touching that, okay?"". He then said it was meant as a joke and that I took it too seriously. I didn't say anything else. 

The following day I asked if he was mad but he brushed me off. When I tried sitting next to him he ignored me completely. It was as if he didn't want me around, so I decided to not say anything for a couple days and let things cool off so we could talk about it later.

This morning I tried to talk to him about it but he said he was deeply hurt that I had that attitude with him, that he was disappointed and never expected such an attitude from me. I tried to tell him I wasn't mad at him, rather at his attitude. He kept insisting I shouldn't have spoken to him like that and that none of his friends ever spoke to him like that or that he would never do that to someone. I apologised and said that I had had a bad day until that point and that the hat was important to me because if I didn't have it I'd get in trouble with my superiors. He insisted I shouldn't have spoken to him the way I did and we've been texting about this for the last 2 hours.

Well, I didn't want to shut him down immediately so I did go to a date with him after which I told him I only wanted to be his friend. After a while discussing this, he accepted or so I thought.

Truth is for the last 2 years we've been in an ""on and off relationship"". We're always having big fights and most of them spawn from the fact that he still hasn't accepted we're only friends, throughout these years he keeps bringing that out and I need to reject him every time and I have to constantly remind him that he is not my bf because he's jealous of everyone that comes near me.

A few days ago I decided that it was enough, that no matter how much I liked being his friend I couldn't keep doing this forever and I even thought that it would be beneficial for him, to get over me.

At first he was mad, then he started to apologize and then begging and now... he started to threaten to kill himself. He's saying how it's not worth living anymore without me and that he's talking to other girls so there's no reason for me to stop this relationship and that no matter what they'll never replace me.

As much as I like him and want him to be okay, I don't want to cave in. It will be just a few more months until I break it off again.

121,"I've recently graduated university and moved to the other end of the country for a graduate scheme. It's an extremely selective and well-respected scheme, and can absolutely get you places. The area is one everybody constantly says is lovely. It should be a dream come true, really. 

Thing is, I'm miserable as fuck. 

The cost of living in this new area is eye watering, so I'm constantly worried about money. I'm living alone, with no friends nearby. I had to rehome my pets because of this move, and due to living in a second-floor flat I can no longer keep up my hobby of gardening. There's no affordable gym nearby, so I can't get back into lifting, either. The area is *extremely* elderly, and there's not much going on by way of social life for anybody under 50. I'm a 21yo male. 

The job itself is awful and makes me want to cry with boredom. My line manager is rarely there, and when he is I never feel like I can ask for work because he's so busy and seems to dislike me. When I do, nobody ever wants to take the time to teach me how to actually do anything, despite it supposedly being a training placement. Consequently I spend all my time just signing forms to authorise annual leave or clinic amendments; there's nothing challenging or even vaguely interesting. Everybody is constantly stressed and bitching about other people, and I hate the environment. I dread going into work each day. This wouldn't be so bad, except that to get this graduate scheme I left two jobs I loved and felt fulfilled and challenged in, with great colleagues and bosses - so this feels like a real slap in the face. 

I've tried raising my concerns but I feel guilty for being such a baby about this when everybody has far more important things to be dealing with. I constantly get told how lucky I am to be on this grad scheme and/or in this location, and that I should be extremely grateful for this opportunity. I mean, I understand where they're coming from and I am technically grateful, but it doesn't make me any less miserable. I can't help but feel I've made a horrible mistake.

I feel like I have to stick it out because I'd regret it if I didn't - plus I've signed contracts and whatnot that mean I have to be here for at least one of the two years on the scheme. How can I be less miserable about it? What can I do to try to make it more tolerable?

123,"Long story short, I went to a small small school in the city I live near. Freshman year I had a group of 5 best friends and one included my girlfriend. We all hung out together and had a great time. Freshman year was the most memorable year of my life so far.

Sophomore year, all my friends left the school because it was too small and felt like high school and me and my girlfriend broke up and she moved back home across the country. Sophomore year was the worst year so far and with everything going on in my life I failed out.

That school had cliques so I wanted to transfer anyway due to how small it was and me thinking I wouldn't be able to make any more friends there.

""no biggie"" i though as i could talk to a manager and try to get it resolved anyways. however, the real kicker was i'd still be charged the following month as well because i didnt give a 30 day notice... basically saying i was supposed to give a notice the day i joined the gym...? i am going in to see a manager monday since there arent any available on weekends. any advice on how i should approach this would be appreciated.

135,"I (20F) am in university and one of the groups I’m a part of had a party last night. I of course drank a lot, enough to brown out - I remember parts of the night but not a lot of specifics. I remember making some disparaging comments about another member’s (19M) girlfriend - basically along the lines of that the two of them are mismatched together, with him being out of her league (I.e. he is more attractive, etc.).

I don’t even know this girl! I just looked her up one Facebook once. Even more, is I don’t even have feelings for the guy. He’s just a friend and I respect him a lot. I have no idea why I said it, and I don’t remember who I said it to, which worries me that it will get back to him. I would rather be upfront about my shitty behavior, but since we all were wasted last night, nothing may come of it at all. Reddit, what are your thoughts?",14Oct2017,0
136,"This is not my first time posting in this subreddit, but I just feel so lost right now in my life and I was hoping someone could chime in with some motivational words, or just help me find some direction. I'll try and make this as short as possible. 

I recently graduated from a decent school with a degree in Biology, with minors and Chemistry and Japanese, with a decent GPA (3.59). I enjoyed the subject matter of biology, but I cannot possibly see myself working in a lab environment, and medical school is out of the question. Let me be clear: I only continued with my biology degree because I didn't want to change majors and set myself back another year or two. 

I'm 24, and most of my close friends are moving on with their lives: my closest friends are all working in amazing companies with short term and long term plans, but I am currently job hunting with almost no formal job experience - I apply for jobs, interview, and receive rejection e-mails so much that I'm essentially numb to rejection. I have almost no passions and no idea where to go. 

I have on occasion spent whole afternoons beating myself up for studying biology instead of something more applicable such as business or computer science. I have a little bit of marketing experience from some internships I did, but apparently not enough to warrant me an entry level marketing position in a nice company. I'm broke, desperate, and just want to get on with my life. 

I do have some passions though, and I am trying to keep them in the limelight so I don't fall too far into a cyclone of depression. I studied Japanese for six months at a university and Tokyo and it completely changed my life. I feel strongly that I would excell in a business environment, especially if I was able to do work with and/or in Japan. Therefore, I have been strongly looking into MBA programs in Japanese universities, but I don't have nearly enough money to pay for one of these programs. 

I try stay constructive, I go to the gym regularly to work off my stress, and I try to spend my free time studying business, computer science, or Japanese, but I just have so little self-confidence right now in my plans or my future. 

Sorry, I know this all just sounds like me whining about my life, but I'm just trying to find some direction, and any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if I should just give up trying to find a full time job wear I can get business experience and work some part-time jobs until I can try and apply to a graduate program, or if I'm just going about this all the wrong way and there's a lot of opportunities that I'm just not seeing. 

Regardless, thanks for taking the time to read this. 

TL;DR: I am a relatively recent graduate with dreams, but no direction, surrounded by people who are successful, and I can't help but beat myself up for studying something I don't care about. ",14Oct2017,1
137,"Only know them online and will never meet. I am inexperienced and therefore malleable. I'd kind of fetishized love so I guess I fell too easy. I kind of take pride in my lack of concern about the outcome of my actions I accept the responsibilities so when people say they try not to love people it never made sense to me before. There was a conversation about how they have to try to not love me and that makes a lot of sense now and I guess I'm just wondering how I manage this.


It seems like every time we argue it is about how much we both care about each other, but it still makes us both miserable even though we both know there is no malice. 

I hate how I get sad when she doesn't reply. Like if I check my phone and there is no response that makes me sad and it should not be that way it's not on her to entertain me, it never has before any of this and it never will at some point yet it still consumes my thoughts.

I struggle to converse as easily too now. Usually I could reply instantly but now its work. You know those video games with three options of what to say? Well it's either ""I WUVV YOUU &lt;333"", ""Spread like an eagle for me bby"" or ""loading..."" and I hate that. I feel like what she saying no longer matters to me given all I can think to respond, and I didn't think things would be that way. It makes me feel less compassionate and I thought it would be the opposite.

Also the more into someone the more complacent I get. No matter how good a person is I shouldn't be talking to them all day every day and It's hard enough planning shit around sleep schedules anyway.

Mindfulness helps sure but the thoughts return and I guess I just thought this would be a plateau that would greatly enhance my life but it seems the moments before I went and labeled things were more carefree.

I went to the orthodontist for my regular check up and he made a mold of my teeth to replace my damaged retainer. After leaving the place, I quickly realised that one of my teeth had slightly relapsed after not wearing it during the day (I only wear them at night), so I called the receptionist asking to speak to my orthodontist and they said he wasn't in for the day (I just saw him 15 minutes ago?) so they said they would give him my number to call me back (which he didn't, they said he didn't call back because I could just ask him questions the next appointment, which was with another orthodontist, another bad lie). I told them to relay my message to him (which they didn't). I called back 2 days later after not hearing from my orthodontist and they said the retainer has already been made and I have to pay the $300. 

Can they do this?

141,"
So first some background: at the time that this event happened, my friend (18 M) (we’ll call him Frank) had just started to smoke weed. I (18M) didn’t smoke weed at all at the time (I’ve tried it once with him since, but I didn’t like it and I don’t think I’d try it again). 

So Frank had just begun to smoke weed, and he was applying for summer jobs. He was paranoid about his smoking habits being found out, so Frank would look up if every job he was interested in drug tested their applicants. His mistake, however, was that he searched this on his mom’s computer, and left the tab open. His mom saw what he searched and confronted him about it.

Thinking on his feet, Frank lied and told his mom that he was looking it up for me, which made her think that I’m the one that smokes weed, and not him. She bought it, and ever since then, his mom has had this picture in her head that I’m some sort of stoner. She’s very against weed, so this has negatively affected the way she sees me and the way she sees Frank’s and my friendship.

This happened about 6 months ago, but Frank recently brought it up again as a funny kind of “remember this?” story, and the more I think about it the more upset it makes me.

I haven’t brought up to Frank the way that this makes me feel. It definitely makes me mad that Frank threw my reputation with someone under the bus to save his own. Is it a big deal though? Is it something I should just let it go?

What made me the most mad was how quick my friend was to lie, and how he never thought it was a big deal. Frank and I have a pretty complicated friendship, I’ve never thought he was a very considerate or empathetic person, but I feel chained to him because we’ve been friends almost our entire lives.

Mostly what I want to know is whether this is something that I should really bring up to Frank. I don’t know if what happened is something that friends should do to each other. ",14Oct2017,1

My group of boys is a very good team. We’ve always competed for 1st. And we have maybe 3 kids out of the 15 that aren’t very good. Anyways the game was tougher than I had expected and we were tied with 15min left. The whole game the other team was playing rough and what were clear fouls on us were not being called. I was yelling at the kids a bit more than usual but nothing negative. They scored on us and we were down by one, in the next play we had the ball and my player was in the penalty area about to shoot when two of the other players swung for the ball and instead kicked my players legs. I could hear the contact of their shin guards all the way from the bench. The referee was literally right in front of them and let the play continue while my player was on the floor. They scored on us again during that same play and I lost my cool. I pulled my team off the field with 5min left in the game and we forfeited.

153,"I am in a very toxic job right now and I NEED to leave as soon as possible. I have been applying to jobs for the last month or so, I haven't heard back from some, have heard back from a few but didn't even get an interview (granted my experience was just the bare minimum so I am not surprised). It's come to a point where I wouldn't even mind working retail again as a filler job to just get me out of the toxic job I'm in right now. 

The retail job has better hours, (11:30AM-8PM M-F) which is great for me because currently I have to get up at 6:00 every morning to be at work by 7:30 and I get off at 4, home by 4:30...and my boyfriend STARTS work at 3:00 so essentially we have opposite hours. So this retail job is very appealing and it's a position where you do not even have to deal with customers. It pays slightly less than what I make now but they have the same benefits as my current job and they say they feed their employees so I wouldn't even have to worry about buying food to take to work. And it's 5 minutes away from home as opposed to the 30 right now. 

So this job sounds great, HOWEVER there is another job I have applied to that is taking longer, they are gathering up applications for 3 weeks then will review and then will invite the top for interviews. Given the requirements for the job I feel I have a good shot at it; but they're just being slow about it. I feel like retail hires very quickly and have a friend who applied at a different location of the same company and she was hired overnight. So I don't want to miss the opportunity of working at the store, but would hate to accept this job, start it, and then a few days later hear back from the job that I would rather have. 

My current plan is to just go ahead and apply for the retail job in the next day or two, and tell them that I can start in two weeks (after I have given my two weeks notice to my current job) and so hopefully, in those two weeks, I'd hear back from the other job one way or another. 

I feel like it's better to ""cancel"" a job offer once it's been taken but BEFORE you've actually started...but I also don't want to burn bridges with this company in case I wind up wanting/needing a job from them again in the future. 

Does this seem like a good plan?",14Oct2017,2

160,"LOSE THE TRAINING WHEELS

When we were learning how to ride a bike, many of us began with training wheels. The training wheels allowed us to discover balance without the risk of falling down. It protected us. It kept us safe.

So why not just always have that protection even as we got better at riding??? Well, because training wheels limited speed, they get in the way, hell they weren't cool. Haha. 

At a certain point, in order to have the freedom and joy of riding our bike, we had to lose the training wheels. 

#HereComesTheMetaphor 

There are a lot ""training wheels"" in life, but now they aren't as obvious as the ones on your little pink or blue bike you had when you were 5-6 years old. When we were little and crying, our parents gave us a pacifier. When were were restless, they gave us a security blanket. If we were upset someone gave us a stuffed animal or a device or a toy to distract us with. 

As kids, we subconsciously learned that if something was ""wrong"", it could be fixed with an object; with some 'thing' outside of us, something external. For some people, this could have impacted our ability to self-sooth; to be able to correct our own behavior and attitude. 

Maybe we began to look at these objects as things that we needed to protect us, needed them to help us balance our lives. Began to see objects and other people as crutches. 

I'm not saying this is everyone, each of has to look at the ""objects"" in our lives that have become crutches or soothing mechanisms for us. They are like the training wheels that were supposed to temporarily help us balance but now we rely on too much, and perhaps they are now preventing us from stepping out into freedom.

Is it TV? 
Is it Food?
Is it shopping, drugs, Netflix, alcohol, social media, celebrity gossip, sex, partying, money, religion, fitness, work, etc. 

I'm not saying any of these things are bad on their own, but it is our relationship to these things that can become a crutch, a need, the subconscious training wheels that are preventing us from stepping into a life full of freedom. 

In order for us to enjoy the full freedoms in life, to chase our dreams, to live passionately, to be motivated...we have to be aware of the areas that we have developed mental crutches and have the courage and discipline to get rid of the crutches. Say no to external soothing mechanisms.

I’m unemployed now. A part of me feels like I SHOULD go get a job and start making money again. I used to work in the PR industry as a writer, and I feel like people around me (like my parents and friends) are pretty disappointed that I’m not making full use of my skills and time.

But the problem is, I no longer know what to do with my life, what kind of job I want to take, and if I want to work full-time at all. I’m scared that a stressful full-time job will...deplete and depress me. Money, thankfully, is not an urgent issue, as my spouse can support the both of us. I want to find work that makes me happy — it doesn’t necessarily have to pay the bills. And my husband supports that.

My girlfriend witnessed me fumbling around in the car for about a minute looking for the wallet the next morning, then started into a plan she came up with off the top of her head to help me keep track of my wallet. It amounted to doing a wallet check every night before bed, like I do before I leave the house. 

I told her that was a great idea and I'd think about what system would work best for me. She became immediately uneasy at the idea that I didn't want to follow her advice exactly, citing that it was exactly what I do in the mornings so it was my idea anyways, and that I was ""digging my heels in"". 

I responded that this wasn't something I felt was a huge issue (I've misplaced my wallet about 5 times this year, but usually just in the hamper or occasionally between the car seat) And that I would need something extra to remember, like maybe a note on the door to remind me. 

She seemed dissatisfied that I would want to want to do any extra steps or incorporate something else, thinking it would overcomplicate things. At this point I was feeling pretty defensive because I thought it was a useful idea that already encompassed hers, and I didn't understand why she was bristling at it.

I told her that part of having an equal adult relationship is collaborating and accepting room for compromise, and she eventually admitted she was being mildly triggered by events in my past where I was (to be fair) engaging in some fairly harmful lifestyle choices and didn't really listen to her concerns. 

The thing is, this kind of situation seems to happen with us fairly often. Something bad happens and my girlfriend recommends very specific methods for both of us to deal with it, which she isn't very flexible or open to compromise with. I end up feeling disrespected and mildly manipulated when my suggestions aren't considered, especially in issues that affect both of us. 

**tl;dr** My girlfriend seems to subconsciously get a little manipulative when bad things happen, and suggests lifestyle changes for me that she is not very flexible on. Suggestions? Perspective?

167,"I work two jobs currently. One position is as a housekeeper for a motel in a very seasonal little town. We have about two weeks left of bustle before tourism stops almost entirely until summer. (There is one big weekend near Christmas that gets a lot of attention but otherwise it dwindles down to almost no work.) I've worked here for two years. This is not the job I am contemplating ghosting. The second job is the shitty one. 

I also work for a franchised popular sub shop which many of you probably have at least one of in your town. I've been there a touch over two months. It's run by another company which quite frankly is so poorly managed that people walk out left and right, leaving subpar opportunity for actual training, which causes a lot of confusion and overwork for the people who are employed there. These over stressed individuals leave the company and so repeated the cycle of undertrained short term employees. 

And I hate it. I get stuck closing alone with more work than can be done without staying late. So of course corporate informed me that if I don't leave at or before 9:30 I will receive a write up. Naturally without having any support staff, and not wanting a write up, I was forced to leave without finishing my work. For which I received a write up. 

For my last three shifts I have clocked out and finished my work so as to receive no reprimand. While you'd probably think the company would not want me to continue working without pay as it is unethical and illegal, they turn a blind eye to it. My manager and several coworkers have resorted to working off the clock. 

I didn't take the job to work for free, obviously. Nor did I take it to be stuck with this moral conundrum of leaving without notice though since my main job is winding down, this would be my best chance to find something else before I'm effectively unemployed there. It's very common for people to leave this job without notice. And if I provide adequate notice I'll have all the free time in the world to find another position elsewhere but with a gap in my employment while searching which I cannot afford. Which leaves me with a last option: keep working a shitty job while I'm almost encouraged to get no pay for my closing efforts while I search for something else and hope not to be fired.

I invited a good amount of friends over to watch scary movies (Friday the 13th on Friday the 13th) and X and I sat next to each other and got more comfortable and ultimately were sitting with each other. After the movies ended and I dropped everyone at home I dropped X last and we both sat on her porch for a good hour talking, and it was a little cold so I brought out the blanket I keep in my trunk and we sat together with it and talked.

The thing is I don't *love* this girl, and I am not in love. I have been so accustomed to being in a relationship where I can snuggle with somebody and be very close but after losing that ability I have been sad that I've lost that and being with X made me feel a lot better. I told her I wasn't sure if I wanted to be in a relationship but I appreciate I can have her to hug and be close to since I have had that in my life for so long.

I want to be more than friends, be able to have her over for movies, snuggle, and just be close but I don't think I want a relationship. She broke with her ex over the summer and it was a jagged break but she has since lost feelings. At the end of the summer she messed around with a guy and after he only ignored her and didn't want to talk or anything besides use her she got him out of her life for just using her as a piece of ass.

I am sitting in my bed typing this and tonight is the homecoming dance. I want to be close but she has just left a situation that went horribly wrong, and if I want to be a similar to what I want that took a turn for the worst. I don't think she'd want to engage in something like that again just after what had happened.

Sorry this was incredibly long, but I appreciate it if you read through and are willing to give me advice :)",14Oct2017,1
176,"After completing a 2-year college course, I went straight into my final year of university about a month ago. Since then I've felt like absolute hell.

I'm only in 6 hours a week, which honestly doesn't feel like remotely enough time. Since starting, I felt like my skills have gotten worse, not better, and my only option is to wait several months for my other modules to start.

I've made no friends since arriving; nobody messages me, I don't really go out and do anything most nights, and I feel isolated and alone.

Worst of all, me and my girlfriend (who is also on the same course) suddenly broke up about a week ago. Since then, we've had no contact with each other outside of class time, and yet whenever I see her, she seems to be coping perfectly well.

I'm just seeing no reason to stay at the moment, and I'm not sure what to do.",14Oct2017,1

180,"This girl was my closest and dearest friend for most of high school. Our personalities meshed pretty well; we were both competitive people, perfectionists to some extent, but had a silly side. She liked to push my buttons (a lot) and I liked to be annoyed by her. Though this dynamic sounds really whack, it was all just harmless teasing. Never really was a moment when we didn't have anything we could talk about. She was maybe the closest thing I had to a sister at the time.

This past summer, we took a leap, and decided to explore being more than just super close friends. This, unfortunately, came at the worst time ever. a) We were about to head off to college b) her college was about 400 miles away from mine and c) we had about a week of actual time together before she had to move in. I realize this is obviously and clearly a horrific idea in retrospect but we thought we'd get through it without a hitch. That...didn't happen.
After about a month in college, she decided it was having issues and we couldn't fix it. There were indeed issues. Admittedly, I had been becoming clingy and not my old self over the last few weeks, which I was consciously trying to reduce. Unfortunately it couldn't stop the relationship ending, yet I can't help but feel that there's a lot left unresolved.

During the breakup itself, we agreed that we wanted to remain friends (verbatim from her: ""I don't want to lose you forever""). I know this isn't always sincerely meant and that if it does happen it won't be close, yet I still feel like it's been left on an ambiguous note. We met up a few days ago and though we clearly weren't altogether that comfortable with the situation we still could (for the most part) act like our old selves around one another.

I realize this pondering isn't helping me get over her (which is what I need to do), but I'd just like to hear your thoughts on it, reddit. I'm now abstaining from contacting her and focusing entirely on my new college life. What do you think would be ideal for me to do if I want to maintain a personal relationship with her into the future (friendship or otherwise)? Despite obvious conflict between us right now, I genuinely think that she was a good friend and a better companion than I ever deserved, and would hate for us to just have to drift away.",14Oct2017,1

183,"So in the past few years I've been through a lot. When I graduated from high school I was given a large amount of government funding for college due to my financial situation (lower class), with that I decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in business administration. As college went on I decided that the major wasn't for me, and since I have a long history in computer knowledge decided to change into an information technology major starting my junior year. Well, during the end of my sophomore year I had gone out to a party with a few of my very close friends and we had drank a LOT. Now at this point I will note that I am a very helpful and apologetic person, I gained this from my home life as I had very strict parents and in a form of mental abuse I just assumed that anything that had gone wrong was in a way or another my fault. Anyways, as the night had gone on I and my colleagues had gotten completely blackout drunk and the next morning I had treated it like a normal day - I had talked to everyone from the party about how great it was and I hoped that we would all do it again soon. Later on that night I had gotten in contact with the police, stating that one of the friends I had talked to that day reported that I had sexually assaulted her. Being filled with so many emotions I had shut down; the friends from the party knew (including my girlfriend of two years who was as distraught as I was), and due to this the school was notified and I was not allowed on campus for the duration of the investigation. I had talked to everyone who was there that night and they all agreed that nothing had happened, nor did there seem to be anything off that night. So during the meantime I had stayed with my sister (I know now this was a horrible decision, I should have gone straight to my mother but there's no sense in talking about past screw ups), and I had gone through a rough battle of depression. I didn't know who I was anymore, nor how it even happened. The investigation went on for nearly three months and by the time it had concluded the police reported that there was no evidence whatsoever of the crime and due to that it was dropped. However, the college deemed it to be legitimate and expelled me, regardless of information but to what I had said in my statements (like I said, I am a very apologetic person and every incident that happens, whether minor or severe, I assume is my fault). At the start of all of this however, our ""friend"" had ceased contact with the entire friend group and at the final hearing, said that she felt ""betrayed that everyone would take my side"", when they were all there telling her that they were not biased. Anyways, cut to now, nearly half a year after the incident; I live with my mother again and I am at a dead-end job. I am still at a long fight with depression with no sense of direction in life at this point and due to me getting expelled from the school I can no longer receive funding from the state. I cannot fight the expulsion to get my name cleared due to my financial situation, and I really just don't know where to go in life. Is there any chance for me to make it out of this?",14Oct2017,1
184,"Hi, I'm a [15M] and I have a friend who is also a [15M], and he's turning 16 in a few days.

However, I've been having some issues whether he's actually my friend anymore. I've noticed that recently he's been talking to me in a condescending manner lately, and he's also been ignoring whatever I say to him with a simple ""ok"".

It's usually me that initiats our conversations, and he doesn't seem to care usually, he'll usually just brush it off with an ""ok"".

Often, he'll actually talk to me, but it doesn't look like he puts in effort most of the time.

197,"We live in a college town. Every year, we have problem with trick-or-treaters, but the worst part is older teenagers and adults who either trick-or-treat, or bang on our door late at night, after trick-or-treating is over, to ask for candy (or even other stuff, if we say we ran out earlier).

For the people who just bang on the door after-hours, we're just not going to answer it. We already keep the lights off, so hopefully it won't happen again this year.

For the late teens/adults... I don't mind as much if they actually dress up, but they show up in regular clothes, or regular clothes with cat ears or something and want free candy. We buy as much as we can afford, but always run out when there are still little ones trick-or-treating. Also, to be honest, I just really hate it. It bothers me SO much.

I had an idea to have a ""good bowl"" and a ""bad bowl"" this year. In one, put the regular candy. In the other, put apples, bargain toothbrushes, and black licorice. If an older person comes trick-or-treating without a costume, they get the bad bowl. Of course, this doesn't help when adults trick-or-treat with little kids and also want candy themselves, but it'll help.

Just turning anybody away isn't an option because we're worried they could egg our house or something.

He still hasn't moved in, and I don't believe now that he ever will. I've stopped telling him that I love him, don't send kisses any more, don't talk about future and not planning for one with him. I don't think anything has changed for him though and he still seems to be attracted to me, still talks about us having future as spouses, parents etc. I don't really care if I see him each week or not.

2. All my life I've adored animals, always had several pets. My social media accounts were all filled with animal groups. My phone was filled with photos, especially of cats. I had to give my pets up a couple of years ago when I moved, but I had been counting down the days until I could get some again. A few days ago I removed every animal photo on my phone and accounts, left every animal group. Stopped feeding the stray cats around here. I've shut my mind to ever having a pet again. I don't want to see any animals or have anything to do with them.

I don't think I am depressed because I still enjoy time with my friends, I love going out for dinner or coffee, still laugh at funny videos. But something has changed in me.

I just never understood how other people's brain functions. So I always had to assume  how people think and treat them like it which turned out to terribly wrong in lot of cases. 
1) Being bored. 
I simply don't understand how people can so bored in seconds, if you leave me, I can think for hours and hours and I just don't understand what people think while being ""bored"". 
2) How people think?
I just get lost with this one, end up being so weird around people. I either assume that they don't mind some things or they really mind some things. I can't balance it out. Whenever I do a mistake people make a joke out of it, point it out few times and then I guess forget it. So whenever I ask ""do you think this about me?"" I get a big reaction, I learnt some things here and there but it still happens. It is like, people are mean but they forget quick or don't mind them. 
3) Unspoken rules of friendship. 
I am a leader type in friendships but I end up not knowing what to do. Like, what am I supposed to feel? How am I supposed to respond to basic things? What do people think and talk about? It is almost as if I lived in a cage when I was supposed to learn these while being a kid and kept living in there. 
4) Communication 
I can't communicate for shit. Whenever I say something even if I think it is clear, people misunderstand it. I also talk about ""deep"" stuff while they are general things to me and sometimes people don't even understand. I just don't understand how people don't think the most important questions they should've tried to look answers for. 
5) Expression
Sometimes I am told that I said something that was really mean and sometimes I am told that I am worrying too much. No balance. 
6) Not creativity
I think with very different perspectives as I am told which becomes as problems and I realize how unrelated those two subjects are after thinking a while. 
7) Stupidity 
I ask stupid questions. Say stupid stuff. My responding quickly with logic mechanism is working awfully. I hate being stupid yet I am most of the time. I started to think that I am the only one with this which isn't possible but every place I've been is proving this.

222,"TLDR: How do I navigate moving out when I have Helicopter parents who went off last time I tried?

I am 23, I have a stable income (I am a teacher so it is stable but I am also poor lol), I am excellent at saving my money, and I have always made good choices and succeeded in life. 


For some background: My parents are helicopter parents, I grew up in a strict environment, I am 23 now and I am to a certain extent, still treated like a child. My Dad gets EXTREMELY offended if you do not take EVERY suggestion he makes about anything as small as chapstick to as large as buying a house. My mother also wants control and wants me to live in a way that she sees fit, although she is less intense than my dad. I have one older sister (27 years old) who is a full on delinquent and failure, she has hurt my parents countless times. My parents still attempt to have an influence in her life even though she doesn't talk to us. 


I tried to move out last year into a house with a long term trusted friend due to fear they would allow my sister to move back in (I cannot be around her anymore, she's horrible). I had a plan, told my parents about it and experienced UNREASONABLE resistance (including but not limited to an intervention, gas-lighting behavior, trying to convince me I can't live on my own or that it would be extremely hard to, telling me if I move out I will NEVER be able to afford a house, I'll be poor forever, etc.)


It is now a year later, I have $35,600 saved. I have saved almost all my money with the exception of going on a few trips and going out to eat here and there (going to Chicago for fun, kept it inexpensive though). I am more established and prepared to deal with my job (teaching is hard), and quite frankly I am done with the restrictions that come with living with your parents (which are magnified with helicopter parents). They do not feel I should move out until I save approx 30 grand more and am ready to buy a house. I do not want to buy a house, I want to rent an apartment and then move out of state in the next 5 years.


My question is how do I present this? How do I remain strong when I am harassed with helicopter bs and not allow myself to cave? 
How do I go about the apartment searching process without allowing them to butt in? Do you think it possible for me to have them be involved AT ALL or do you think I should just find an apartment and not allow their involvement (I feel like I don't get to have normal parent-child moments with them)?

Any tips on how to assert myself and get past the process of telling them I am moving out would be appreciated

223,"I'm bad at explaining so sorry if this isn't very clear:

About a couple months ago I decided to boost my self-esteem to stop feeling bad about myself 24/7. For a while, I was aware that my few friends were going to the gym + one was learning a second language, so I decided those two things would be a nice start. Two months later and I'm feeling noticeably happier, especially when I see my progress in either case.

However, thinking back, I realize that I was probably envious of my friends because of those things. Basically, I feel awful thinking that maybe I acted upon my selfishness and jealousy to make myself feel superior, instead of doing so to improve myself as a person. I really look up to my friends but I'd hate to finally do something about my life just because I feel insecure around them.

Does that sound dumb or should I stop what I'm doing? Even if doing these things been making me happy, I don't want to think I did them just because I'm selfish.

TLDR: Started to improve my life; I now fear that maybe I did so because I'm jealous, and now I feel guilty about it.

226,"My best friend was down on her luck. Her bf of 13 yrs broke things off with her when she quit her job and let her lease run out to move and be with him. Being the helpful people we are, my husband and I moved her to the state we live in to help her out. She is like a sister to me and an aunt to our kids. Ever since, it has been a big transition that I wasn't counting on since she used to be with us, for what seemed like 24/7, before we moved. WRONG!!! So wrong!! Things we never noticed are very annoying. Her dog isn't potty trained, she talks out loud either to us or herself, loud when everyone is asleep, talk loud, constantly asks for advice and then ignores it, laughs when things are serious. Why haven't we noticed this before??? Anyway, we had a family meeting last week and since then, she has spent every night at this guy's house in the neighborhood who she just met 2 weeks ago!!! It seemed like she did it to take the stress of the dog off of us bc she said she listens over there.(???) But my problem is that instead of working on things we suggested at the family meeting, she is hiding out over there. My fear is that when she or he tires of one another, she is gonna be back over here like she never left and  that it is expected to be ok. It's not ok. We have an 18 and 8yr old (boys). I don't want them to think it's ok that she practically lives with this guy (after 2 weeks) only coming by here to get a few things every day for about 30 min as if she is just checking in or reserving her spot. Am I being a B by wanting to tell her, a grown single woman, that it's not how we want to model things to them? Am I being petty? When should I say something? Should I let another week go by?

227,"I'm in the market for a new car. And I'm debating between buying and leasing. I'm reading that the terms of the lease agreement involve returning the car after the agreed-upon term with the car in its original condition minus normal wear and tear. My concern is that with children aged four and six, the wear and tear in the interior might be deemed beyond normal. It's not that my kids are rambunctious or dirty or careless. But they're young. They sometimes put their feet on the backs of the seats, they sometimes eat in the car (which I may have to restrict -unfortunately), and are just a little bit harder on the car than an average adult might be. So I'm wondering if anyone here has had experience leasing a car with young children or is a lessor involved in leasing cars to clients and what the opinions are or results have been in these situations.",14Oct2017,1
229,"Thank you for reading. I'm sorry it's really long.
I really don't know what to do. I've had bad chronic headaches for 3 years, neck muscle spasm pain/shoulder pain for almost a year, my face is slightly swollen, jaw pain for about 8 months ( I got braces which caused me to clench so I had to get them removed early and now I can’t stop clenching and I have TMJ), and episodes of sharp jabbing/ burning pain all over my face for about 6 months and foot pain for about 6 years. The pain just takes over my life and allows me to do so little. I can’t get out and do much. Sometimes I just start crying/screaming it gets so intense. I've been to every doctor and they don't have any answers. I've tried so many different drugs that don't work and just give me bad side effects. I've had physiotherapy, massage therapy, and chiropractors. Massage is the only thing that gives me a little bit of relief. I’ve had lots of those. My parents don’t have coverage or bad coverage and so I've been paying now. I only have a couple thousand dollars.

 I'm 15 and things aren't great at home. My brother has always treated me very badly. I am told when I was born (he was 4 at the time) he would have dreams about trying to hurt me and would tell his parents he wanted to hurt me. Though my life he has always treated me like shit. Threaten to hurt me (punch me, kick me, throw things at me,etc.) make fun of basically everything I do and repeatedly tells me I wreck the family, am useless/worthless, that he wishes he could get rid of me, says nobody wants me/cares about me, calls me an idiot, one time said he would like to kill me (he said he would like to kill someone but it was obvious he was talking about me), ect. I haven't been well lately I can't go to school that often and he always makes fun of me about that. A couple times he has hit me. One time he was really bothering me and being rude to me so I lost it and threw a tv remote at him about chest level (he will always claim it was at his face, it never even hit him) so he charged at me and pushed me into the wall unit. I went through the wood part and thankfully my leg was just badly bruised but u almost went through the glass. A few times he has thrown stuff at me (his pants and a dirty rag).  My parents don't do much about it. My mother takes his side 90% of the time and just tells me to ""stay out of his way"".. My bother makes me feel very unsafe. He is 19, and 5'11. I'm 15, 5'1 and 95lbs.

My dad has been rude to me lately when I'm in pain and can't do what he wants. He has said I'm a fucking retard, that I must have an IQ of 2, that he wishes he had never had me, that I'm a moron, that I am stupid, etc. One time when I was crying/screaming because of the pain he was yelling at me to stop because it was so loud and he wanted to sleep. I couldn't stop the pain was so bad, My mascara ran and he told me to ""go wash my monkey face"". He was coming after me and I got scared that he was going to hurt me so I kicked him in the leg and then he grabbed me by my face, hard, where the pain was and he pushed me into the couch and it hurt really bad. He was also being rude to me again yesterday. I was crying because my head, jaw, and neck hurt really bad and I also have caught a bad cold now. He was going on about how stupid I was acting the other day and I lost it and threw something at the wall, which left a small mark. He just threatened to make me sleep in the back yard. My mother came down and yelled at him to treat me nicer when I was in pain. He just says that I’m making the whole thing up and that if I was really in pain I would take the drugs (I have been prescribed lots of medications that either don’t work or I can’t take them because they make me too tired, dizzy, have blurred vision,  chest pains, or give me a worse headache).

My mother and I get along most of the time. She is quite nice to me about 60% of the time. Most of the problem is she is very anti-LGBT. I’m a closeted bisexual and I can’t tell anyone because my family is completely anti-LGBT. My mother is a strict Christian and makes me tell her that it is wrong to be gay after even watching a TV show with a gay character. LGBT kids are made fun of at school too. I’ve told my parents that I want to die. My father just tells me not to do anything stupid. My mother used to tell me how she would miss me and that that can’t happen but one time she was mad that I was crying and yelled at me to go downstairs and die. I feel like my family is making me go crazy. I tried to tell this to my mother and she just says that “I make my family feel unsafe”. She says that if I go and talk to someone they will just put me in a group home. She says that I have a pretty good home life that I should be thankful for.  She has threatened to put me in a group home multiple times. She once said she would like to take me down to children’s aid and leave me there. 

 This morning I woke up in a lot of pain and started to scream/cry. I have had some unusually bad period cramps that I had been asking them to take me to the hospital for as well as the usual pain. It woke my brother up and my whole family  got really mad at me.  They said how they would just love to send me away.  I told them that I hated them.  My parents have to do a lot taking care of me which I appreciate but my mother just started to yell that she wasn’t going to do anything for me anymore and that I would just rot and die in the house. My parents complain all the time about how they have to take care of me. I try to tell this to my mom and she looked like she was going to cry and just said that she loved me and loved taking care of me.  Then the other day the pain started to get so bad that I kicked the wall. It left a hole. I really didn’t mean to and felt really bad.  And they all started to yell at me about how they would call the police on me.  I’m going crazy I can’t take this anymore.
 I think I’m going to have to drop out of school. School just started and it's too hard for me. The chairs hurt my neck, classes are loud, sometimes the lights make my headache worse, and it's too hard for me to keep up with the work.

I’ve started to “cut”, aka running a push pin into my skin and it leaves light marks. I have tried to commit suicide 3 times and all I think about is how to kill myself. I’ve been planning that the next time I am home alone I am going to go down to the drugstore and buy some caffeine pills to overdose on (would they even let a 15-year-old girl buy multiple bottles of caffeine pills?). I know it’s not a very good idea but I’ve also been looking up how to commit suicide by cutting your neck.  For a long time, I used a pro-suicide forum that had a lot of really sick people on it. I would ask for help with how to commit suicide. A lot of people would tell me to message them and they would give me a “pep talk” if I needed it.

I contacted kids help phone during their live chat and they suggested calling CPS on my family. They said a counselor could do it if I called them.  My family would be livid if I called CPS. I don’t know if I could even say these things out loud to someone.

Then we see these two guys climbing up a ladder, coming towards us and shouting at us to stay where we were. We listened and it turns out one was security and the other was a manager of some sort for the shopping centre. He told us that they were taking us down and that we were on camera and the police had been called. We didn't try to run away or anything like that and they took us down to the bottom. 

They took our names, ages and dates of birth and when the police showed up they did the same but also asked us our addresses and phone numbers. We were compliant throughout the whole process and at the end they told us they were letting us go. When we were leaving the manager thanked us for being polite and 'making things easy' for them. 

I'm worried cause if my parents find out about this I am dead. I don't know whether I should tell them, with the possibility of the police not phoning home, or not telling them and the police end up phoning them and they go ballistic at me for not telling them.

We are both male.

Me and a third friend watch game of thrones.


Now that we've covered the salad, let's get to the steak.

Accusation 1: he claims that I talk about the girls in our school extremely inappropriately AT school.

Rebuttal: I have never to my account talked about any of the girls inappropriately in school. I have older sisters and was taught strictly to respect women.

Accusation 2: He claims I brag AT school about the sex and gore scenes on game of thrones.

Rebuttal: The only person I've talked to about this at school was my other friend. I asked him in class which episode he was on while whispering.

Ending statement: He is going through his 4th breakup this year. I supported him and gave him advice Through all of them. He comes from a very wealthy family and has a hint of rich snob in him. He takes advantage of his parents generosity. To this day they still don't know he's had/has 4.5 girlfriends. We've been friends since 4 years old.

242,"I'm thinking about transferring or just restarting and applying to another college. Some of these colleges ask you if you have any extenuating circumstances. Well, when I was a kid my dad used to drink a lot and he would physically abuse me. My mom likewise was very emotionally abusive, she would tell me that I was dumb and worthless or that I ruined her life. At school, because I was so anxious about my homelife, I never knew how to fit in and I ended up getting bullied a lot.

However, things took a turn for the better when I entered middle school. I stopped getting bullied and my dad got arrested after getting really drunk and arguing with my mom. They only held him for the night until he could sober up but after that he started drinking significantly less. Also, I just started ignoring my mom and I guess she realized that she couldn't phase me anymore so she left me alone. 

Unfortunately because of the abuse I suffered from my early childhood to early teens,  I had a lot of insecurities. It took me a long time to realize this, but I ended up internalizing and blaming myself for what happened and as a result I had so much self-doubt and paranoia, that I never really took high school or college seriously. That's not to say I didn't get decent grades. I've never failed a class and I actually have a 3.66 GPA, not counting my Pass/No pass classes. I never came up with a plan though because I was afraid to. I entered college with my major undeclared, and took classes without a clear goal in mind. Anyways, I ended up dropping out of college  a few months into my sophomore year after I tried to kill myself.

That was about 10 months ago, and I've basically done nothing since then. I I did do some soul searching though and I think I know what I want to do now. However, my college does not offer a degree for what I want which means I would have to go to another college to pursue this. So that brings me back to my original question. Does insecurities and fears caused by domestic abuse count as 'extenuating circumstances'? Besides my suicide attempt, nothing really bad has happened to me in the last 6 years. Should I even mention it? One guy I knew who used to work for college admissions said not to mention this because it would raise a red flag and colleges don't like people with my background.

Normally, I wouldn't really worry that much about it, just date and have sex when it felt right, no big deal. But, I'm moving in a year, so I don't really want to date, but I also don't want to wait a year to have sex. I also really don't want to just become fuck buddies with one of my friends because at this point it's a pretty tight circle and I'd rather not throw off the balance, just in case.

So...given all that, would it really be so bad to find someone casual to just help me basically relearn how to have sex with women? How do you even ask for that?

My mentor (of 3 years) is opening up his own lab in NY (about 4 hours away from my current home) in 2018 and wants me to move out there to work with him until my PhD starts (~July 2018). He is not an easy fellow to work with (very stubborn and needs things done his way, on his timeline) and has a tendency to completely remove the line between professional life and personal life. He tries to be my friend (go out with me, ask what I'm doing, wanting to meet my girlfriend/friends) while also being my boss/mentor, which sets me up for some really shitty situations. (E.g. He once got upset that I blocked him from seeing my profile on a social media platform and then was a jerk at work in the following weeks. He'll still bring it up to this day and question ""how a friend could do that"")

Furthermore, my family, friends, and girlfriend are all here at home-- I don't think I'll be happy leaving them behind, even for 4-5 months. I've been working with this guy for 3 years now and I do 95% of the technical work, proving to be a very valuable asset for him, even helping him finish his PhD.

I feel he is actually trying to string me along and keep me around during my PhD, as he is already telling me to apply to a lot of programs in NY (which I don't have much interest in, and he knows that). One complicating factor is that he's writing me a letter of recommendation for my PhD applications and has connections in my top choice program (which is here).

On the other hand, if I don't go, I think he would withdraw a lot of his support and hold a grudge against me, leaving me in a strange situation for some time. He loves to make things personal to make one feel guilty and is VERY good at this. So yes, there's definitely a manipulative nature here and I acknowledge that. He's trying to entice me by saying we can finish up a few more papers (for publication) and it will look good to have as a first year PhD student.

258," How do i emancipate myself?
My Current situation at the moment is that im living with my uncle, and im almost certain my mom is not mentally stable, i used to live with my mom but for the pas 15 years, ive never had a bed to sleep in, my brothers and mother i feel have verbally abused me and I never had a healthy life style over at her place. 

Since ive moved into my uncles place i have lost a lot of weight, i am now at a healthy life style, and if i didn't live here then i wouldn't have been able to get my first job and i have overall became a better person, attitude, and habit.

But the problem with my uncles place is that my cousins are Druggies, they bring drug dealers to the house at least once a week, and they are selfish, and with out a doubt they are dangerous to my life, and i dont really have a choice but to deal with it until, or even if i do get emancipated.

So pretty much i want to get emancipated, but all i want to know is, how do i do it? i'm 17 with 1 year until i am 18, and i'm planning on joining the army after i am 18 after i get my GED. and please dont tell me to wait until im 18, i dont want to be in this drug house anymore, even if it means homeless.",14Oct2017,8
260,"Ok, I have problem redditers. I am a college student right now and I have this thing I do where I set off on a new diet or new workout routine or study/sleep schedule and follow it pretty damn tight and then roughly a half week to a week goes by and I just eat like shit and throw my schedule out the window. I can't stop doing it and all my friends give me shit because I start and fail at so much shit (and keep starting new things). I like running and rock climbing and need to thin down a bit (I am by no means fat my body just naturally holds a lot of weight no matter how in shape I am) in order to get better. Any tips on how to stick to something? I'm suspecting that I get some weird pleasure from doing shit I know I shouldn't (i.e. spending money on food, smoking, and eating shitty), but at this point, I honestly couldn't tell you. This has happened so many times I've lost count. Any advice helps. Thanks in advance. update; I'm starting to think it's some kind of compulsive disorder that i need to give into ha",14Oct2017,1

264,Alright so I go to university as a computer science major and this semester I took a job as a tutor for programming. So I have a couple programming  students who I tutor and for the most part it's going pretty good. Most of the way I tutor is pretty hands on and I help them make little games and things that they find interesting to keep their interest. I have one student though who does not seem to get it. It almost seems like we start at step one everytime he comes in to see me and the fellow is a little odd but over all friendly. He comes in to see me and that has me believe he is wanting to put real effort to learning to program. Anybody got any advice for this?,14Oct2017,1
265,"So I'm 24. I only started betting about 5 weeks ago. I opened up a Skybet account whilst a I spent a weekend with my friend. I went from £10 to £200 in 3 weeks of steady bets. 

I cashed out the £200. Today I put in £10 again but I want to stop but I love the feeling. I'm very worried this COULD turn in to something more...",14Oct2017,7
266,"Hi! I might have to give some background.

Up until about grade 7 or 8 (year 8 or 9), I was a complete perfectionist, and I could be, because I was straight-A. Then, doing guitar lessons, cooking lessons, and extra sports all caught up to me and I got super stressed, stopped doing anything at all, and faked ill enough that the school had a talk with me officially. I quit guitar, got switched to a different cooking class, and redirected my life philosophy. This worked for a long time; Instead of perfectionism I used apathy. It doesn't matter, was / is a useful way to escape pressure.

Fast forward to grade 12 / year 13, now, and you'll see that I still employ this. The trouble is, I get ill around November-time for some reason (school resumes in September). This leaves a backlog of work, and my natural pace of work just about keeps up with how much I get set anyway, so I don't really catch up... Last year it fucked over my AS levels and I did homework instead of revision (although it was still fairly good academically, it stressed me out to try to catch up to the deadlines)

Recognising the parallels between that and the earlier breakdown I had, I focused more on caring less, since stressing out that much wasn't going to do anything for me (also was killing my teeth - I clench in my sleep).

Unfortunately now for the first time I have the alternative problem. My reference has been sent to universities, it no longer matters for that which grades teachers predict for me. The homework I get set is difficult, I suppose, which is why it makes me back away from it. Which, again, I suppose means I need to practice it, and do the homework. But I find myself just not caring. If I do it, I get the astrophysics course I want at uni, and wing it from there. If I don't do it, depending on how much I don't do, the worst ranges from merely being guilted at by my teachers to not knowing enough for exams. But after that, there are opportunities to resit, and even after that, I have many safety cushions. My family are nice enough that I could do nothing my entire life and live off them and then inheritance. I don't get what my incentive is here.

I do really want to do astrophysics but because it's something I can do, and for bragging rights, and because I want to build up the cash to buy a ticket to space as a tourist. But wanting it apparently is not enough for me to actually do the homework. I get annoyed at myself for a bit but then let it slide. Trying to keep a feeling going except mild contentment is like trying to climb up an ice wall.

Is this normal, is there something I can do, and should I see a councillor instead of reddit?

EDIT: I'm gonna see a therapist anyway, actually. This happens too often. My question should be: What can I do to alleviate this?",14Oct2017,3
267,"Hey guys. I'm 19, a second year uni student. 

I'm about to start week 3 of being back at uni and so far I already feel very behind and haven't studied at all pretty much. Last year I did this all year and barely scraped a pass (all my modules were in the 40%s). Should act as a wake up call to get my shit together right? Wrong. 

I just can't bring myself to sit down at a desk and do work. Like I actually can't. I've bought a new laptop, I've cleaned, decorated and organised my room and applied for a job in my chosen field (which I think I'm going to get) hoping it would boost my motivation but nothing. 

I've tried to sit there with just pen and paper no distractions but I just zone out and could literally sit there for an hour just staring at the blank paper and not pick up my pen. My brain just feels so fuzzy, like hazy idk how to describe it. But I get so distracted by my thoughts and I just feel like there's no point, I just feel really tired and sleepy (more like I'm inside a dream than I want to sleep) and like I've started skipping lectures let alone doing work on my own time. Because I literally can't drag myself out of bed.

I feel so lazy and stupid writing this out but I'm trying to fix it and nothing's working I tried the pomodoro technique I've tried turning off all technology I've tried classical music, everything. Even with coursework last year I didn't start it until the day before or on the day it was due. I still got around 60%-70% which is average I guess but it pisses me off because i hate to think of the grades I could've gotten and could get if I wasn't being such a useless sack of shite you know?

I know if I continue like this I'm going to fail and really fuck up my life (or at least make it much more difficult for myself) but that doesn't even scare me or really bother me at this point. 

How do I snap out of it? ",14Oct2017,0

270,"I had an assigment due that needed a lot of research. But also had al my exams land really close to eachother. I struggle to make time for my assigment, but did my best to get it submitted on time.
For some reason I decided to look over it, and now I noticed a grammar mistake and the very last sentence of it is cut off and doesn’t make sense.
I can loose up to 10% for poor writing quality and I belive I lost 10% and I bought outside of that I did perfect. So, I’m panicing I may of failed my assigment. I just didn’t have enough time to put in the quality work...
I never failed anything before, but I have gotten low grades. I’m very worried and I’m praying for a C.
Has anyone else done poorly due to not enough time to add quality to as assigment or really messing it up because of that? Perviously in the class I had two As and a C (due to a silly mistake).
Edit: I understand I have extream anxiety problems and I have been waiting to see a counsller for a few weeks to help me before my grades suffered. Part of me belive that half of my writing mistakes was due to extream stress of the situation with school workload and a major life changing event in my life. I just want to know if anyone has been in my position about failing something but somehow being able to come back from it, or doing badly when normally they don’t, due to not having no enough time for quality work.",14Oct2017,1
