0,"Hey Reddit, didn't know where else to go, so I'll just post this here. I met a girl, we were chatting for a couple of days, so I run into her in some bar, and she tells me how a perfect couple we would be, mind me I was really drunk so I didn't really hear what she said. We continued chatting and she invited me to come to a town where she's studying. I went there, we talked, hugged etc etc. Then we went out to get drunk, I kissed her, she continued kissing me all night long, hugging me, holding my hand etc. We even slept in the same bed after nightout, we cuddled, kissed, talked, it was all normal the next day, it looked like we started a relationship. The next day however, when I went back to my hometown, she started getting really cold to my texts, answering with short texts and would never continue the conversation or write first like she did earlier. I don't if I did something wrong or whatevs, but what could it be? I really liked her, but I can't understand her acting like this. Any advice would be of great help. 

Sorry for the long text and bad english. Thanks!",06Feb2017,2
2,"My grandmother over the past 3 months has been really concerning me and she is 68 but looks way older.
 To be clear I live with my grandparents.
She retired in November 2016 after having the initial plan of retiring in December 2017.  Since she retired in November she has lost an immense amount of weight doesn’t talk to any of her friends and doesn’t answer calls about her retirement situation. She weighted 143lbs in January 2016 to the best of knowledge but I have no idea her current weight, it can’t be more than 90lbs. She literally looks like a skeleton. I’m scared to hug her because I think I could break her. There is something clearly wrong with her. She is bleeding out of her genitals and just lea1ves napkins of it around her house or hides them in the coach cushions but recently she hasn’t even been hiding it. I find this super disgusting and clean up when I can and bring it to her attention to see a doctor but she just gets angry with my nagging at this point. The past Sunday I found here blood and urine soaked underwear in the bathtub just lying there. Yesterday when I came downstairs there was a napkin with blood and a black/green substance on it, when I picked it the aroma hit my nostril and I gagged and almost vomited. 

My mom and I scheduled her a Doctor’s appointment that she lied about going to it. She refuses to go to a doctor and all day since she retired she sits on the couch and twirls her hair watching lifetime. 
I can’t take it. I can’t take watching her die and refusing to do anything or even admit anything is wrong. Are there any steps I can take to force her to go to the doctor or put her in inpatient for what appears to be a mental condition as well?

I just want to know if I have an option.

I tried to ask but she made an excuse and left as fast as she could. There was nothing out of the ordinary about them but she won't talk about it and is now acting really scared around me. I don't get what's going on. Help?",06Feb2017,4

7,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and this is the longest relationship I've had. I'm going through a rough patch in my life at the moment (career wise) so I'm already feeling pretty down most of the time, and usually he makes me feel better, but lately I think I've just been feeling worse.
He used to be the nicest person I've ever met, he was so kind and caring and always gave me compliments on everything. He was always affectionate like even when we watched movies we didn't have to be constantly cuddling but we would alwaysjust be touching or what not. But just in the past month or so I have noticed a change, he got a new job which he is a lot happier in but he seems to be different at home. He isn't as nice as he once was, not just towards me but about other people etc he seems to have lost empathy and has this kind of 'it's not my problem it's yours' attitude. He isn't mean or horrid to me but he doesn't compliment me and I've been trying really hard to put in effort. The only time we are affectionate is when we're about to have sex but other than that he doesn't touch me at all unless I initiate it or ask for it. It makes me feel so worthless and unwanted. Because I haven't been in a relationship that has lasted this long before, I don't know whether this is just a common thing to feel more comfortable that you aren't as 'lovey' towards the other person. I don't want to be a pain in the ass but I feel like I'm not asking for anything more than how he used to treat me. Plus he never asks me to do something or see him anymore, it's always me asking if I can come over. Honestly he probably doesn't even realise that he's doing it but it makes me feel crap. I just want to feel wanted. Can someone give me advice on what all this might mean and what I should do? ",06Feb2017,2
8,"This has been weighing on me since the decision was made and I have tried my best to avoid giving it much thought but I'm afraid I can't pretend much longer. 


I met a boy. He is funny and smart, interesting, opinionated, stubborn, handsome and everything I never knew I wanted and for whatever reason he loves me back. We have been together very little time but after some less than favorable past relationships I feel happy for the first time in a long time, he makes me feel like I am alive and like I can move and breath, with him I feel like I am finally with someone who seems me as an equal, who respects my opinions and actually finds me great. I have felt in the past like a burden to a lot of people, like a tool used to satisfy desires both physical and power based and I feared being left alone or maybe being rejected so I flew far from those who made me feel that way, hurting them and myself in the process. For the longest time I long to feel happy like this and maybe he feels like I do, I really wish I make him as happy as he makes me. 

Now, let’s talk about the problem. He is leaving for college to Miami. I knew this when we first met and after months of friends and then dating and later being official we avoided the topic because we knew it would be decisive in our relationship, this December I couldn’t hold it much longer and I brought it up, I asked when he was leaving and he said there was no date set, as I sat there in silence trying not to cry he asked me to go with him. I said yes. He said he loved me for the first time and I cried and I said I loved him back and so the road began. 

My parents want me to go, everyone wants me to go and yet there is always the lingering question of is she doing it for herself or for him and I am always trying not to think about it, not to look at it too hard but I have to, I eventually have to see it for what it is. 

My university of choice is different than his but we would be leaving together and living together as well, we are going as a couple and this is just such an exciting prospect I am thrilled to have an American student lifestyle I’ve never had before and yet I know deep down I could have better choices for my time studying, I could go to Europe or maybe a different city and yet I’m limiting myself to this one city for him…

I am torn and so hurt I have to deal with this, I just want everything to work out for the best but I just don’t know what to think, help anyone? Some comforting words are greatly needed.

20,"The title explains the gist of it: I am finding it difficult to remain motivated about the career that I'm pursuing (currently a Computer Science student), because I believe that there's little chance for me to become GREAT in the field. I don't doubt that I could get better and eventually become proficient within Computer Science/programming, but considering my biological limitations, there's no way that I could ever match the skill of some of the most talented people in the field. People around me seem to have no problem pursuing fields wherein they will only be average or slightly above, but to me, such a pursuit seems unfulfilling.

This does not apply only to Computer Science. I have considered other disciplines before, such as Applied Math, and Engineering, and shied away from them partially because of the belief that I could never become an expert within them either.

23,"Hello reddit users!

So I got my bachelor's degree in Inter-media Design, which basically is an umbrella term for video art, animation, sound art, video game graphics, etc. I went to NIU, so it's not a super amazing university like Cal Arts or anything, which might influence some people. 

I have been doing a lot of freelance work to try and beef up my resume in the mean time of looking for internships, apprenticeships, and jobs. But obviously I don't want to freelance forever since it's not financially feasible for me. I am seriously struggling here. I am having a really hard time getting anyone to call me back. I'm willing to go anywhere, move anywhere, even at my own expense if it means I can get some experience. My search at this point is extremely wide. I will do almost any artistic job out there, even if it's not in my field. I will be an assistant to the assistant of an assistant if that's what they need. I just want to be able to make enough to afford a place to live and food. Lol. I am desperate. I know that artistic fields are very competitive, and they always say ""starving artist"" is what you'll be. But this is my passion in life, and I want to be doing something creative for my career. Can someone help me? What am I doing wrong? Perhaps I am looking too eager?

26,"So I'll try to provide enough detail without going on too much--

I'm a hetero male, I've been seeing a hetero female psychiatrist for maybe a little over a year and a half now. This isn't the first one, but the first time I've ever stuck with one. In the past I just haven't felt I've really needed it or just found the doctor's to be quite disappointing. I have a sort of strange dr/patient relationship with any as I actually went to school for psychology almost the whole time. I never finished or went for more like I planned however; I now work in a different profession. 

Anyway so she was referred to me by a friend of my who has his own practice but he is terribly busy and we figured our friendship might compromise the therapy. She has been pretty great aside maybe just a couple minor calls I wouldn't exactly agree with- but we have a really great thing going and she is able to understand that I know quite a lot about certain things she might ""text-book"" suggest or go through, though I never mean to undermine her or be disrespectful at all.

A few months ago I started to notice something a little different, she gradually started to seem more and more happy to see me. She is very vibrant in general and has a great way with people so I didn't think much of it, eventually I started to wonder what was what so I kind of texted it. Admittedly I sort of spun our sessions around a couple times and started playing doctor. The last time I did this she really started opening up (which I know some LSCW types will do deliberately, etc) and then I noticed she kind of caught herself, and me, and shut down. The few visits since then there has definitely been this weird unspoken knowing of what's happened and along with what I also used to shrug off there is this sexual tension with us that HAS NOT let up though it's only getting worse. I noticed over a year ago she seems on guard with me, she's super cool but kind of minds her body language and simple things cause I'll catch things and make jokes about it. 

Anyway, we have scaled my visits back by half and I have one coming up soon. The first time I met her I knew she was a very attractive woman and that has only grown, no big deal. I'm also aware of the ""transference"" which is soooo common where a patient places certain things they lack or stressors in the Dr. like sexual attraction (""everyone wants to screw their therapist"" thing) or misplaced anger, etc.

It has been ages and I'm starting to realize we actually just know each other very well now- she has maybe for better or worse divulged some rather negative, realistic, or just unprofessional views and ideals to me. I'm noticing the more it goes I actually just like her. Like this isn't some classic transference I don't believe. She reminds me of ex-girlfriends a little maybe sure but MAINLY fits into the kind of woman I am really into in the now and had been before seeing her. It's almost creepy how well we click in a lot of ways. It is only making the therapy a difficult now because there's no way she doesn't know what's going on. I know a lot of long term therapists will address this as to expose what the root/problem of the attraction is and the defuse the tension ideally. This is just not that however. I can tell she is actually attracted to me or is maybe putting her own transference into me as some sort of strange relief. I went ages knowing this stuff happens, then further more ignoring all of this and repeatedly telling myself I'm insane.

The psych subreddit discourages asking advice so hoping anyone from any group might have their own input- just curious. I am feeling at this point I DO need to mention it myself as the not knowing and the lack of comfort and how we're both on guard is both getting in the way of my therapy and could potentially lead to my own cognitive dissonance. My gut feeling however really wants to just ask her out like anytime I have asked a girl out. 

Any thoughts? How should I address this in the most courteous way? Thanks so much in advance for any pondering or input",06Feb2017,1

31,"Hey r/Advice,

I am so overwhelmed at work and I am thinking about quitting. I need some advice. Here is some context. I am a 26 year old project manager working for an electronic medical record software company. I manage the implementation of one of our software modules, which entails traveling to customer sites most weeks out of the month to manage the 1- to 2-year-long customization and installation of our product. The work is thankless, stressful, customer-service-oriented and entails long hours of doing whatever you can to make the customer’s install a success. I’m going on my fourth year at the company now, and I have really had enough. I am stressed out most all the time, though there are times that I get on a “high” when I love my job and feel like I’m made for it. Other times, when there are stressful calls with users or managers who put you on the spot and demand you give them answers right away, it makes me want to die. I struggle with stress management in general and have an eating disorder that rekindled from my past because of the stress of this job. The job pays really well (120K/year pre-tax), which makes it very hard to quit. I am almost through one of my customer’s installs now (they bring the software live in April), so I am thinking of quitting after they do so, but I am unsure of my decision and am looking for some advice. I recently started learning programming, which I really like because it lets me be a “maker” instead of a manager, and it has reminded me what it is like to do something fun and that I could do for hours and hours and not notice any time has passed.

What do you think I should do?

After months of trying to forget about her, and finally getting over her, I now see her in school, and rather than being sad about not being friends I just kind of wish I could talk to her again and just say ""Hi, what's going on?""

37,"I considered posting this in /r/travel, but I felt like I was likely to get a biased response there and I really am trying to keep an open mind and make a well informed choice.

So some context.

My dad and I have gotten into some pretty heated disagreements about this lately. He is conservative, mid 40s, career oriented (and very successfully so). One of those built himself from the ground up types -- which I very much respect. I, on the other hand, am in my early 20s, just earned my BA, and have had no success as of yet landing any type of career position. But I work hard where I am and save diligently, so while my bank account is certainly nothing to boast about, it isn't running on fumes. What I have been pursuing is freelance writing and I've been having some luck with that.  

While in college I spent a semester studying abroad and I caught a serious case of the travel bug. I just love how much a glimpse of a different culture can open your mind and change your perspective.

So my thought process is this: I'm not having any luck with a traditional career and I honestly don't think I would be satisfied with the same life path that my dad took (and wants me to take). But I am incrementally picking up some momentum with freelance writing, which can be done anywhere and could even greatly benefit from travel and the new material that would provide. But this certainly doesn't offer the same degree of stability. 

I feel like the world is becoming more and more oriented toward mobility and less nine-to-five anyway, so this isn't that radical of an idea. But my dad thinks that this thought process makes me a ""hippy with no work ethic.""

So, Reddit, your thoughts? Travel with the hope of building a non-conventional career? Or try to pursue a more traditional career that may or may not leave me dissatisfied with the hope to one day have time to travel?",06Feb2017,1

39,"I am a department manager with one salaried person - middled aged, experienced adult - who reports to me who has been here for about a month. He came in right at a very hectic time with the final stage of a major project under way, with lots of chaos, lots of fires to put out, things generally in disarray. To many people it looks like a cluster, and it certainly isn't going nearly as smoothly as it should be, but to me I see things getting under control as time goes on and the chaos doesn't bother me nearly as much as it bothers some. This is just heavy turbulence, it will blow over and life will return to the new normal soon enough.

This past week has been killer on me though: 18 hour days, only getting 2-4 hours of sleep then heading immediately back to work again. I'm far more stressed than I've ever been before - not the ""what am I going to do, I don't know what to do, the world is ending"" type of stress, just the ""I have soooo much work to do"" kind. I know it won't last for long and I'll get through it, but this new guy (I was the only person involved in selecting and hiring him, HR just rubber stamped my decision) became the problem.

He's been doing ok, keeping up and getting things done, but he doesn't have my work ethic: I give things 100% and stay until the work is complete and I know that this will be compensated for being able to go lighter/fewer hours. On hiring I made it clear that working more on one day results in working less on another and that as long as things got done when things needed to be done I was good. It bothered me a little bit that even though I was getting in before he does, at 5:00 he was ready to go and would maybe stay a little over beyond that, but at the end of 8 he would leave even though I still had another 8 hours to go. He never asks if there is more to be done (and he doesn't need to, he knows perfectly well), and just isn't dedicated to the work like I am. But not everybody's like me, so it ranks only as a minor annoyance.

Then last weekend I was completely beat and absolute needed some sleep. I had told him ahead of time that we'd be swapping on-call weekends (working from home, answering calls, coming in if absolutely necessary) and told him that I needed him to be on call. He said ok and that was the end of that. Until the next morning when he said that he had gotten too many calls (he probably did, but I was at the point of physical collapse) and he wanted me to pick up where he left off. Fine, I'll do it. He said that he'd go online again that evening, but by that point I was catching my 6th wind and figured I'd just let him be and switch back with him the next day, expecting him to appreciate the break.

As I'm ready to hand things back to him the following afternoon (he'd been online for about 8-10 hours the weekend) he starts to complain that he can't do anything because one of the systems was down. By this point I was desperate for sleep and gave him a suggestion to try to resolve his problem and he started to backtalk saying that method A didn't work so what was he supposed to do. I gave him my proposed solution again and he continued to insist that it didn't work even though he hadn't tried it, so I tried my solution in front of him, showed him that it worked and expressed my frustration at which point he lit into me saying that he's never seen such a horrible place, that he has so much experience and could do everything better and that I didn't know what I was doing and that I was withholding information from him, playing games, keeping him out of the loop and keeping secrets from him and this, that and the other... it was not a pleasant conversation.

I countered back and pointed out - again - that he knows that this is a major change in the day to day work flow, pointed out - again - that the biggest causes of the problems are out of my hands (which he already knows, and has said as much previously), that I think things are getting much better fairly rapidly, gave him a brief outline of what I'm working on, explained yet again that if he has an issue that is very important to him then all he has to do is stop me, tell me that something is really important and I'll stop, but otherwise I'm literally running from fire to fire (my phone says I'm doing about 4.5 miles a day and if I'm giving him short answers that is because I'm literally running from fire to fire. (Which he already knows and can see.) He said something about he doesn't want to work in a place where he has so much to do, I say that if he doesn't want to work here he can leave at any time (at no point do I ever threaten him with anything - important to note this) and I continue to talk to him for far longer than I had time. I am very good at talking people into a state of calm and the discussion ended amicably enough, but...

My problem: I like the guy, I think he can do the work, I only got frustrated with him because he wasn't even trying to solve a really simple problem in the heat of the moment that I knew he could. I know he's feeling stress, I know he's frustrated with things, I know the chaos is very off-putting to him, I know he wants to start working on the things that interest him.

About me: I'm very laid back, I hate micromanaging and would rather say ""get this done"" and it get done without strict oversight. I don't care how it gets done - he certainly knows how to do some things better than I do so I'm not going to dictate how he gets things done. I am exceptionally calm under stress (people have been mentioning that to me a lot lately). While I have the ultimate responsibility for what goes on, I don't like the boss/non-boss relationship dynamic, I want there to be a team. I don't play games, I avoid politics, I just make sure that things get done and I never have conflicts with anybody. Until now.

This is literally the first thing that anybody could call ""fighting"" I've been engaged in for a few decades. I don't hold grudges and I don't hold one against him now, but suddenly I don't trust him. His lack of respect, his (relative to me) slacking and his ""we have very different work ethics"" (exact quote) weigh heavily on my mind. I would have his back 100%, without question or hesitation but I don't trust him to have mine. I don't dislike him, I don't hold anything against him, but there's just that lack of trust I suddenly feel and I'm not sure if there's anything he could do to fix things even if he wanted. 

So what should I do?",06Feb2017,1
41,"t I've been struggling with this for a month and I need help. I don't know if I should take Spanish or Child Development next year. I can't decide at all and I'm running out of time. Please tell me what you think.

Reasons to take Spanish:  Ive already taken 3 years, I'm good at it, I enjoy learning Spanish, I've gotten a lot better at not panicking when I have to speak it, Everyone says it looks really good to colleges if you've taken all four years

Ressons not to take Spanish: I'll probably forget it all anyway,  Even if I remember it I still won't speak Spanish, This one class is probably the cause of 75% of my stress in school, For whatever reason everything about Spanish  class makes me anxious

Reasons to take child development: I kinda enjoy it (?), the kids are cute, it's a nice break from my other classes, it does give me options if i decide I wanna work with kids as a career, for some reason I really don't want to *not* take it

Reasons not to take child development: I'm probably not going to end up working with kids and also we have to work in groups and depending on who's in the group I barely say anything or share ideas because some of those girls seem like they think I'm an idiot every time I say anything. 


What do you think is  the better   decision?",06Feb2017,1
44,"Hi /r/advice! I'm going to college very soon as a pre-medicine major in the hopes that I can work in medical research (ideally epidemiology or pathology but we'll see where I find my place as time goes on). However, there's a bit of a hitch. I'm scared to death of needles. Not just the standard ""I don't like getting shots or giving blood because it's gonna hurt"" fear; whenever I so much as see a picture of a needle/syringe or I see one in a film or tv show I start to get sick to my stomach. (Not to mention whenever I see someone getting injected with a needle sometimes I can feel the sensation of a needle in my own arm? Is that normal?)

I am also 110% open to constructive criticism if I really am in an alternate reality, and I'm being selfish as well as making a decision that will significantly impact my life negatively. 

[This really became a memoir of my life and I didn't intend for that but I found this very therapeutic. Thanks for this space!]

**About me: **
I am a 20 year-old male pre-med student, living in Australia, with a guaranteed spot for medical school. My family is thoroughly working class and my parents financially crippled themselves to provide me with the best education and childhood they could. My primary(elementary) school teachers confirmed that my first school did not have enough resources to extend me/didn't advise it. My parents wanted more for me than they had for themselves (as all parents do, I'm sure). I am incredibly grateful and will forever owe them for their decision to put my education above all else because my new school, then completely set me up for life. But it did come at an astronomical expense which we are still feeling over 13 years later. 


In my final year of my private primary school, my parents' business failed, they were overextended on their mortgage, school fees were only getting higher and they had huge credit debt due to bad planning. I honestly don't even think my mum knew the extent of it because I remember one night, listening at the top of the stairs when I was about 11 years old, while she was crying in shock asking ""HOW much?"". My dad is one of the hardest working people I know, but also completely and totally unable to plan beyond dinner and cigarettes for the next day. He was brought up used to being able to buy things whenever he wanted something. I am italian/greek and the competition, at any cost, to have the best of the best for show, even if it is completely unsustainable, is a habit both of my parents have. Mum had left their business decisions and finances up to him and it was all fine until it wasn't. His need to keep everyone happy even if it means hiding the truth from them, meant their business went under and they owed a lot of money...


So! they sold our house and we went on a month long holiday to Europe with extended family, again spent an insane amount of money, the whole time having no idea where we would live or where I would go to school because they could not afford my new school anymore. 


We finally landed at my mum's parents. My sister (5 years younger than me) and I shared a bedroom not even big enough for 1 person. At the 11th hour though I secured a scholarship to an absurdly expensive, but also incredibly competent Catholic high school. The crisis was averted. My private education would be continue and my parents avoided the guilt and embarrassment of not being able to continue non-public education for me. I saved them that embarrassment of losing completely everything and about 60 thousand dollars in the process. 


Of course every family has their hurdles in life - mum got really sick and couldn't work for 2 months. My grandma hoards *everything* as a response to my now-passed grandfather's debilitating Alzheimer's (6 people living in a house with 2 and a half bedrooms and one bathroom) and I could never have friends over to witness the madness of my domestic situation (think piles of unsorted garbage, mouldy food on display regularly). I went through puberty sharing a room with my little sister and I even heard my parents talk about divorce once. Everything was always tense and angry - imagine screaming matches, a few times dad getting kicked out of our house passport in hand and clothes in the front yard, and my dad has extreme anger issues (now mostly resolved with age). During this time, I absolutely took it upon myself to be the best behaved, best representative of our family, even when it made me deeply unhappy, including keeping up with my parents' lies about things like defaulting on my sister's full-fee private school and having her forced to leave or even my dad's need to always lie all throughout my primary school that we were building a house somewhere or lie about his job. He has a completely awesome job as an automechanic. He is so good at it. He also works from 6:00PM-9:00PM in a second job emptying bins, vacuuming floors and buffing hall spaces for a skyscraper in the CBD. He is not a regional manager for 30 stores with hundreds of people working for him. And it all comes back to keeping up appearances which I honestly care 0 about now. 


I couldn't let my parents down though so I would lie to friends and family all the time for them even though it really cut me up inside. Once, following an especially bad fight between my parents over how long it took for everyone to get into the car after one of them saying we were ready to go (and I was the last one in the car), I refused to accept responsibility for their extreme screaming match. Usually we never interject when my parents fight but when I was yelled at for causing it all, I only said ""It's not my fault"". Immediately the car was stopped and I was told to get out onto the side of the street. Having no idea where I was, I was so distraught and I refused to go home that night. I called a friend who picked me up and I felt so guilty for not doing what was expected of me which was to just forget it and go home. My parents were distraught and regretful as they always are when they seriously got angry at either me or me sister. That was the first time I ever put my foot down though and is just an example of how we were always at breaking point of stress and anger and debt. 


The only break from all of this, that seemed to justify the entire struggle, was my achievement in school. Any time I received an award, or did a debate, or played basketball one time, or got a good mark, my entire extended family would show up to support me. As in they would be the whole crowd and I loved that. I had many opportunities through my school to travel the world representing them in a number of ways (quite niche activity, don't want to be traced!) and of course nothing was free. My parents worked so hard to give me every opportunity and even though it means nearly 9 years later we are still living in a cramped, honestly filthy house, it did mean I got into the university course of ""our"" choice - pre-med - which was a huge achievement for my family. (I hate physics, maths, and only just scraped through chemistry - I love languages, arguing about the law, politics... I didn't end up choosing a degree that studied maths and physics by accident... I don't regret it and it could have been much worse, but I'll never know how good a lawyer I might have been because I'll be a doctor. Of course.) 


Even though emotionally it was a tough, tough childhood - never knowing whether to interject with our fighting parents or just let them sort it out and pretend like you had no idea anything was going on and then pretending like it never happened - I honestly was not ever bogged down by that. If anything, it really did motivate me to make sure I was never like that. But what actually got at me was being the kid whose family relied on your academic excellence, and yet not having a desk to study on, a bookshelf to put my books on, be allowed to put a calendar on the wall (grandma always insisted it would cause serious damage to her ridiculous floral wallpaper) or even a closet to hang my clothes up in.


I enjoy learning. I want to be the best student, and then best doctor, that I can be and that might be lame but it is true. I've dedicated my life to being smart up until this point. And with the home situation I lived in, moving out was the only way to do that.


When I went to University, I decided I would make the very uncommon, very expensive and therefore self-financed decision to attend a residential college on campus to finally get my space. To do this I had to work 20 hours a week, tutoring high school students, working at schools with their debating programs and even in the college's kitchens. My degree also required 20 hours of classes and an additional 10-15 hours of study each week. I was stretched to my limits. But I thrived. Academically I excelled, my social life opened up, I made connections with professors that I would invite over to my college to converse with and I had a generally excellent time. My relationship with my family became strained though because my achievements weren't as obvious to them and I think they felt betrayed that I had wanted to leave in the first place. At one point, they did chip in $500 of the $15,000 for the semester which I really, really struggled to keep up with. I was and am still so grateful. Unfortunately, the stress of it all did become a lot and it didn't seem wise to continue beyond one semester. But I had done it, I had lived away from home, my family eventually came to accept it somewhat and it had been a smashing success.


Then I moved back home. 


I did this so that I could save up money, so that I could repay my outstanding college debt and also it felt like I'd gotten it out of my system. 


Of course, it was hard being accustomed to being able to study in a library at whatever hour of the night and go back to my dorm at 1:00, or out to a party or a dinner or a sleepover without having to tell anyone and suddenly having to change my lifestyle. I struggled through that second semester at university, disconnected from my friends who I'd lived with, back to not being able to have friends come over, having the city and university within walking distance from me. I love university, I really do. And having travelled the world, I have really become an independent person. Living back in the messy, mouldy house of my childhood was demoralising. Somewhere along the way, I gave up on moving back out to my own place. It was comfortable at home. I love my parents and grandma. My sister and I became close again. We transformed the living room into a new bedroom (no, the wedding and family photos of my aunts and uncles and parents, gothic-era couches no one is allowed to sit on, and open archway looking into the kitchen remained - but we took the TV and coffee table out). I have a mattress, on a bed frame and I'm allowed to throw my clothes wherever. I don't have a wardrobe in there, and it makes my grandma annoyed if I put clothes on the back of chairs or couches so it's either the floor or the suitcase I leave open in the middle of my room. 


And so this has been the arrangement since I moved out of college a year and a half ago.


But I don't want to do it anymore. 


The thing that stopped me moving out of home was the COST. Rent, I was always told, is a waste of money. Freedom is unnecessary - none of my parents or grandparents had it (which is not true - my dad dropped out of school at 16, just before turning 17 and regularly ran away from home and got up to all kinds of things he brags about. Mum rebelled in less extreme ways, but dating and then marrying my dad was the most extreme - he was greek, the one rule she had with boys!) 


I always hinted at wanting to move out, to immediate resistance from my parents. ""Don't be silly"", ""why wouldn't you want to live here with us"", ""what a waste of money"", ""of course you can do what you want"", ""grades come first"". So I didn't push it because I wasn't even ready myself. Everything was fine.


Until I met my girlfriend. My girlfriend is one of a kind - she is smart, generous, kind, respectful, comes from a great family and always, always has my back. Announcing this to my parents was almost like I killed someone. Telling them she didn't study medicine and studied SCREENWRITING (OH MY GOD NO) was like loading the gun with a bullet. Asking them to stay over one night in her apartment was like pulling the trigger.


When I was at college, I was completely responsible for myself. It was part of what made my start to university so successful and part of what made my second semester so miserable. 


I didn't realise I was living in a house that had rules because I had never tested those limits before. But to be told at 20 that I couldn't do something I was free to do at 18 seemed a huge backward step to me. We fought a lot. One night I had a pair of keys thrown at me as my parents blew up because I told them I couldn't trust them to follow through on a promise to get me an apartment of my own - I still live at home by the way. 


That night, they told me to leave home. And I did, I stayed with my girlfriend and she immediately pulled up dozens of listings as to where I could move out, offered to have her apartment key cut for me and said I could stay with her as long as I needed to. In that moment, my family rejected me and this girl I'd been dating for only 3 months was prepared to have me move in if that's what I wanted. 


I was determined that this was the breaking point and better because you can't propose moving out to parents like me and expect a supportive discussion. I learned that the hard way. It's obviously because they love me. They want the best for me. They want me to be successful. Mostly, they want to brag about me and feel like their lives really were worth it. Every day a kid from a broke family sits in a lecture on anatomy should be evidence enough that their sacrifice really was worth it. 


The next day I took a call from my grandma who begged me to come home. It is her house, remember, and she gave me the puppy dog eyes and told me I could go and come as I needed and my parents couldn't question it. I should have known that wouldn't last.


Here I am seven months later, at home and was completely refused the opportunity to stay at my girlfriend's new house. Yes, we lasted long distance over a summer mostly apart, I have stayed in her family home for a week, her parents very much approve of me. 


I am not a kid and I don't like being told what to do especially when it is absolutely a manipulation of what was told to me just a few months ago. And I understand it, not my house, not my rules. But in a home environment where I still don't have my own, truly private place to study, freedom to socialise inside and outside of my home and can be told that I must be home or else... It is not worth it for me anymore. On the one hand, they are happy for me to travel the country and the world as I please - and I do! It is for an academic purpose but my best friends and sometimes girlfriend are often with me so for those few weeks life is bliss. On the other hand, I didn't realise, but really what they say goes. I won't throw a tantrum but I will assess my options, weigh up my finances, and see if a different living arrangement is better for me. 


They will not compromise and even if they do, there is obviously no expectation it would be permanent. 


My parents love me the most that any parent ever could. Clearly have led their lives in a way that has completely and totally put me first. They are doing the same now with my younger sister. 


I am financially independent and have been since I moved out for college. My parents like to give me money around an annual overseas trip I have taken at christmas time and they actually lent me a significant amount of money when a passport issue had me stranded overseas. I am now in a position to, and will immediately completely reimburse them. 


I really hope that that help doesn't have strings attached - strings that mean I have to do what they say or they won't love me. 


And so, here is the situation:


An incredibly cheap, conveniently located living opportunity has arisen in my girlfriend's share home. A roommate wants to move away and I really am tempted to take them up on the offer. 


I have a rent-free period of three weeks, where I can trial living in this house. Maybe living with my girlfriend and one of her friends will be too much. Maybe the house makes weird noises at night. Maybe I'll miss the occassionally off, but more often delicious home cooked meals my grandma makes.


But this move makes sense to me. 

* I will have my private study space
* I will again be able to have flexibility over my social life
* I look forward to the challenge of being responsible for my own meals and maintaining a house that I didn't even have at college
* Once I'm in medical school/a doctor, I won't have time to enjoy living away from home, or potentially even able to afford it
* My relationship with my parents will actually, hopefully improve because there is already a lot of tension about my situation at the moment and especially now, if I don't even try this, I will feel trapped and stupid
* I am really attracted by the trial period - seriously what is the harm!

I told my parents yesterday and its been nothing but tears, dead silences and even being woken up and yelled at at 1:30AM since. 


Their concerns are:

* I will be distracted from my studies
* There is a chance me and my girlfriend might break up
* Share housing is not in our ""culture"" (I'm 2nd generation Australian)
* People will talk
* (They see this as a choice between them and my girlfriend ---- which it REALLY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE)

This has been accompanied by massive guilt-tripping - mum gave away a work shift today because she is too stressed - extremely angry reactions, being called stupid by my grandma a number of times etc. 

I understand it puts them in a tough position because I am their golden child and their reputation is now intertwined with mine and people in our family will ABSOLUTELY disapprove. I don't understand why they can't just tell them they told me it was a bad idea, we disagree about it but there's really nothing they can do. Because I am completely able to defend this decision. I'm a young person signing my life away to become a doctor! They have given me everything and I have given them everything and more. My entire life is built around their happiness. 

The reason I don't just up and leave is because my family is incredibly important to me. I also am completely prepared to shamelessly return home if it is a complete failure. 

I am not asking them for financial support, for moral support, for furniture moving support or for anything really. I just want to know if other people see this decision as unjustifiably selfish, or if I am entitled to live my adult life on my terms, even given my circumstances.

I know they love me unconditionally and will get over it, if not now, when I have my graduation from my first degree at the end of this year, and become a doctor in another four. 

I am not a dropkick kid looking to move out because no one understands me. I am a young man that wants to start his life on his own terms. I am clearly committed to my studies, to a good career path, am willing to put the work in to achieve that and equally have my finances in order, work hard and am responsible. 

I'd love to hear about people's sharehousing experiences or advice - PM me if you'd like. 

I've also decided I'm going to show this to my mum in the hope she understands. I really do love her, she is an awesome mum even despite all of the hard things we've had to deal with. I hope she can see my side of things, and not hate me for my choice!

60,"Lately I've been feeling very depressed, psychotic, and short-fused. And mainly because I haven't made progress in my life for the past year or so, and everyone else is racing right by me in their lives. 

When I graduated high school a few years ago, my mom stated that she wanted to move back home with the rest of her family in another state, halfway across the US from where we were. Since she got divorced from my step-dad she was a single mom for my middle school and high school years. She fought tooth and nail for me to have what I needed for school and to not be left out as well. I was obviously a momma's boy at that point.

So when I graduated HS, I packed my things as well to move there with her, since I didn't have a job, not enough help, and no family (aside from my mom, who was moving) in the city we were living in, my sister who had moved out and began to live with her husband lived around 3 hours away. 

I'm 19 at this point, so now that I""m an adult, I prioritized getting a job once we moved. She got me a job working at the same store she was working at, I was barely getting any part-time hours and basically sitting at a stand still. (Around December 2015 when I started)

So later on (Around June/July 2016) my sister came to visit us with her children and husband, and she offered me a chance to move back, so I could go to college and make something out of myself, and after a few days of coming to terms with the fact that I have to move out of my mother's (she had a separation problem too, I really felt bad), when it was time for my sister to leave for home I packed my things and moved back with her to live with them.

I have prioritized over and over on getting another job here. The job market here is a lot more horrifying than it was where I came from. I have applied to nearly every job in a 30 mile radius, and trying to make do without an actual driver's license (which my mom was always so busy so she couldn't take me to take a driving test). And I can't get in-state tuition costs in any nearby colleges until I've lived here for at least a year consecutively, or have had gainful employment for three months consecutively, which neither of those have been met.

Not to mention even if I do happen to get in-state tuition costs, grants, scholarships and such going for me, I'll probably still have to put myself in debt to finish school regardless. Which I am really scared of.

Now I'm 21, I can't get a job, can't get to school, I help around the house as much as I can make myself useful to. Even playing video games in my spare time to pass the time in between application periods. But this process is becoming so repetitive it's making me feel like a waste of space and resources. Put in applications, dress myself up, tell these places that I've applied, go home, check the calendar, look at college costs, cry a bit, then play video games until it's time to repeat it again.

Not to mention we're definitely struggling right now, since my sister and her husband have to feed their 7 children, themselves and I, as well as house bills for the home to accompany such a large family.

I know my problems are probably nowhere near as bad as someone else's and hope theirs are fixed in time. And I definitely hate to see myself complaining, almost exclusively for my previously mentioned reason.

But I really need help, because it feels like I'm thinking myself into insanity.

72,"I'll try to keep it as short as I can, but it's a long story:

Wife and I moved back into the country a few months ago with our infant daughter. We moved in with her parents--we didn't have a lot of money saved up, and it made sense. They had room and wanted us there. We got decent jobs, doing reasonably well, everything is okay at first.

Problem: her 25-year-old brother lives in the same house. He's a creepy, reclusive shut-in who doesn't work, doesn't socialize, and doesn't do anything but play computer games and sit in his room. At first, this was annoying and weird, but more or less tolerable.

Recently, however, I set up an empty bedroom next to his room as my computer room, and once I started spending a little time in here, I realize I'm hearing him snorting something on a regular basis. I've had experience in that world and know what it sounds like. Clicking of razor blade on glass--the whole bit. Suddenly putting all of this together and I'm freaking out. I've let this asshole hold my child. Fuck.

I've discussed it with my wife, but she's at a loss. She honestly had no idea what to do or how to handle the situation, and is essentially looking to me for guidance. Her parents have been enabling him and probably don't even know what's really going on. They're immigrants and a great many aspects of American culture are still relatively foreign to them. I don't know if they would have any idea what to do in this situation.

Who am I kidding? **I** don't have any idea what to do in this situation. This monster is sitting a few meters away from me; I can literally hear him doing this shit RIGHT NOW while I'm typing. I brought my wife and one-year-old child into this fucking shit, and now I feel trapped. We both have jobs, but we've been trying to save up and it'll be a while before we can afford to move out--not to mention the fact that the timing for a move won't really be realistic for at least another four months or so. When I discuss moving out, my wife gets scared--our jobs are stressful, money is not too tight but definitely a concern, and as new parents, we regularly feel overwhelmed and are really glad to have her parents' support.

I'm terrified. I don't even know what kind of drug he's doing (I'm guessing Oxy--coke seems plausible but I have no idea how he could afford to maintain such a habit). I don't know what he's capable of doing. What's worse, we share a car with him--he occasionally takes it at like 3am--probably to buy drugs, and if he were caught, the car would almost certainly be impounded. I don't know what, if anything, he might have exposed my daughter to--drugs, diseases, whatever. He doesn't have access to her regularly, isn't really interested in her or anything, really, but still, I'm paranoid as hell now.

I've put keyed locks on our bedroom doors, but sometimes our child sleeps in my in-laws' room (their room doesn't lock). I've considered buying a gun, but I know the statistics and reality of that shit, and besides, guns scare the bejeezus out of me. I don't know if he has one, though, and the thought frightens me in a positively unholy manner.

I want out. If it were up to me alone, I'd have run already--my job is good, and there would be serious penalties if I were to be forced to quit, but realistically, I could find a way to make it work. I've got options--my sister has an empty rent-house in a different state, about 8 hours away, and she told me she'd let me and my family stay there rent-free as long as I need... but that would mean losing my job, my wife losing her job, both of us probably having our professional licenses suspended, and both of us facing some massive uncertainties as we went forward.

But the certainty is maybe worse? The certainty is that I live with a drug addict, and that I brought my family into this situation.

I've considered just calling the police, but what if I cause a massive familial rift? What if my wife doesn't forgive me? Worst of all--what if he doesn't get caught with anything, or if he gets caught with a small amount of drugs and comes right back after a day or two? I'd prefer he be incarcerated for at least enough time that we could move out. But what if he knows (or suspects) who ratted him out and wants to take revenge?

Fuck. Fuck everything. I thought I'd escaped this world. I'm so angry and scared. I love my wife and child so much, and I feel like a massive failure for putting them in this situation; for not having the financial means to get them out right now, even if it meant staying at a hotel for a few months or something.

I don't know what to do, and when I think about it, I just get more and more scared and confused, and hate myself even more for being so pathetic and helpless.

I'll welcome any advice you guys have to give. I'm so sorry to have talked for so long.

TL; DR: Bro-in-law snorting something, I brought my wife and infant child into house with him, want out but financially and realistically impractical right now, feeling scared and vulnerable, need advice.

73,"I am getting married later this year. I don't have many friends, I'm not great socially and I tend to drive away the few friends I do manage to make. But I knew that my two closest (and frankly only) friends would be all I needed to stand by me on my wedding day. So I asked them both and they both said yes, they'd love to. 

Fast forward to today. One of my bridesmaids, we'll call her Rachel, asked me if a certain person, we'll call him Alan, was also going to be in the wedding. Now I knew these two didn't get along because of some drama that happened a few years back, so I told her yes, he is going to be in the wedding as well, but that I would make sure to not pair them together and to seat them separately, etc. She then proceeds to tell me that she doesn't think she could even stand to be anywhere near Alan because he sexually assaulted her when she was a freshman in college. 

I have heard from Alan himself in the past several times his versions of events that night. He says that Rachel was very drunk, and he helped her to her room. He was helping her into her bed when one of her friends (also drunk) walked into the room, saw Alan and Rachel, and then flipped out and thought that he was doing something to her. Alan has stated again and again that nothing happened, and the friend that supposedly witnessed the assault was his ex girlfriend and is notorious for trying to spread rumors about him to make people hate him. Alan does have a bit of an arrogant nature, so it is easy for those who are not friends with him to assume the worst. So when that friend told Rachel the next day what she thought happened, Rachel believed her and has hated Alan ever since. 

Rachel's version of events are that Alan forced his dick down her throat while he was helping her into bed. Even though she says she doesn't remember that happened because she was too drunk. Her only account of this happening is from the friend that walked in. 

She called me and my fiancé a few days ago to discuss the fact that she doesn't feel comfortable around Alan. We talked with her and told her we completely understand how she feels and that we don't want to ever make her feel uncomfortable. However, we told her that we have two conflicting versions of what happened that night, and we had no way of knowing which one was true. She mentioned two other friends that could corroborate the story, but she said she didn't want us talking to them because she didn't want the story spreading. So we still have two conflicting stories and no way to prove either one. 

We told her that we want to make her feel as comfortable as possible, and will do everything in our power to keep her separate and safe from Alan, but as it stood we didn't have enough reason to completely ban Alan from the wedding, as he is one of my fiancés best friends and he really wants him as a groomsman. 

Rachel texted us today and said that she no longer wanted to attend the wedding at all, let alone be in it. She said she was sorry, but she felt like we didn't believe her and that we were taking Alan's side. This made me completely distraught. Like I said, I don't have many friends, so losing one of them like this and not having someone who I've been close to not be at my side on my wedding day would be devastating to me. Rachel is one of my best friends and I love her to bits, but I just don't know who to believe here. I want to make her feel comfortable and safe and not have to be in a wedding with someone she perceived as her rapist. But I'm also friends with Alan, and my fiancé is not going to kick out his best friend from his wedding based on hearsay alone. 

I am completely at a loss for what to do. Rachel hasn't answered my texts and calls since she sent me that last text earlier this evening. I want to talk with her and figure out a middle ground but I don't know how to do that. I don't want to lose my best friend and bridesmaid because of a misunderstanding. Please help. 

Tl;dr: My bridesmaid thinks my groomsman sexually assaulted her when she was blackout drunk based on something her (not so trustworthy) friend told her. Groomsman repeatedly says he didn't, no one can corroborate either side of the story. Bridesmaid now says she doesn't want to be in the wedding, and I have few friends and would be completely devastated to not have her there. What do I do?",06Feb2017,7

76,"Hello,

To jump into things, I'm a relationship type of guy. I rather be in a relationship than constantly having one-night stands. I, however, always get a bit jealous when I hear other guys discuss ""how many chicks they banged."" I recently decided that I should try to be this type of guy because these dudes seem to get a lot of respect and praise. So, I got a Tinder and met this girl who also went to my university. She was actually an amazing human being who spent her free time working with child and people who are intellectually delayed. We went on two dates and last night she came over to watch some movies with me. We didn't have sex but she got naked and I performed oral sex on her. We cuddled and made out a lot during that night. She slept over my place and we shared some nice pillowtalk moments.

Here is where I am having a conflict. We didn't actually sleep much, so by this morning, around 9AM, I was tired af. However, she needed to go back to her place so that she could get ready for her sports practice at noon. Again, I am out of my mind tired. I simply tell her goodbye and she leaves. If I had more energy, I would have loved to walked her back to her place. 

Later, I get a text from her saying that we may have gone a little fast and that she doesn't want to continue with the current pace. I feel awful because I maybe messed up a chance to have a long-term relationship. However, before she texted me, I was able to tell my housemates/best friends about the night I had. I got to be the guy describing his one-night stand and I got to look cool for once. All my boys were smirking and talking about how proud of me they are...yet I don't feel proud of me.

If I knew there was a strong chance for a long-term relationship then I would have loved to slow things down. Now I just feel empty. I suppose I don't know what kind of guy that I want to be or at least I do but why did I ever get jealous of those guys who bragged about how many women they pulled? That's not what I want or ever wanted...so why did I ever get jealous?",06Feb2017,1

A year ago I had never been fancied by a guy before let alone been in a relationship. So when I was told he thought I was attractive me, well, younger me was over the moon. We became closer friends but not hang-out-alone-close. When he asked me out recently I think I just had this built in response to just ignore factors like ""was I physically attracted to him?"" (not really) ""Did I want to hangout and text him a lot?"" (again no) and as much as it makes me feel bad to say it, ""did I want to even share the fact that we're an item with people?"" No. I just felt this ""yes"" come out of me without thinking. It's like it had been conditioned to want to like him romantically after him being the first person who ever express interest me, not to mention after all the heckling and pushing from our friend group to get together. 

I don't know what to do. He's nice, but I only like him as a normal friend. What makes it worse is that our friends are constantly spouting shit like: ""Aw, after a year you both are finally together!""

88,"A good friend of mine is the owner of a local gaming center in the area, and has recently had issues with people of Somalian descent coming in and being generally disrespectful and messy to the other employees and property belonging to the business. They come in with food, alcohol, and marijuana, and make a mess of the place, making it reek of weed. They pay for one person to play the games, but all of them hang around and use the consoles anyways. When the business tried putting the controllers and games behind the counter for people to ""rent"" out when being used, the group of people still comes in and uses the systems anyways, even though only one person paid. They've left food stuck in the carpet that a vacuum will not get out.

The issues arises any time an employee asks them to not break the rules. They bring up the race card. ""Is it because I'm black?""

90,"I will try keep this short. It isn't a big deal but I don't particularly know how to handle it since this is my first job.

Im 18 and started my job as a supermarket cashier in August/September 2016 (I can't remember the exact date). I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 4 or 5, I was pretty young. The doctors said I might grow out of it but alas, I haven't.

My asthma isn't super severe. I have only been to hospital once but I have had a few other attacks where I have thought I might die. I would have gone to the hospital for those but I had no access to one, for example, one of these times was by myself on a train that was 3 hours away from home. My inhaler usually helps a ton. Very occasionally it won't but I still like to have one with me when I'm out of the house for a long period of time.

At work, we don't have anywhere safe to keep valuables. There are approx 30 lockers that are available but only high up people like managers and supervisors have their own designated one. Also, workers that have been there for a while also have their own lockers as well. The rest of us newer employees use ""spare"" lockers that don't actually lock. They are stuck on the ""locked"" position when they are open so they don't even close properly. These aren't designated either, they are random and you just throw your stuff in whatever one is empty at the time. I don't have a handbag so its usually just my phone and sometimes keys in there. At the moment I'm only working a few days a week but I'm hoping to pick up more shifts soon and I'm also on call and get called in often.

For a while I have been thinking about having an emergency inhaler at work permanently. I know most of my triggers but sometimes an attack will just happen with no obvious cause. I don't currently take one with me because I don't have anywhere to put it. It doesn't fit in my pocket and I don't want to leave it hanging around and getting in the way. This would be easy with a locker since no one else would have access too it, but since I don't have my own, I don't feel comfortable just leaving it around because I don't want it to get in the way/stolen/lost/taken accidentally ect.

If I were to take an inhaler to work, I would need to leave it down near the registers in a draw (much more low traffic than the shared lockers). Each register has a draw but this is usually only for work related things such as paperwork/money bags. That being said, they are mainly empty. Again, registers aren't designated and we just hop on whatever register is empty at the time.  

Is it appropriate to ask to leave something personal down where we are only supposed to have work things? Is it better to ask for my own locker that actually locks? It would be there all the time incase I ever needed it rather than taking it too and from work each day. Is this an appropriate request? I have no problems with taking it every day but it would still be left laying around and I have the worst memory so I would most likely forget it most days, also, if I get called in its usually pretty last minute so I'm usually not thinking about inhalers.

**TL;DR:** I have had asthma for approx 14 years. I Don't have a designated locker at work for valuables. I would like to keep an inhaler there at all times for emergencies but it would need to be down in a draw that is meant for work only items. Is this an appropriate request?",06Feb2017,2

 Living like that, knowing its just a matter of time untill one of her attempts will not just be an attempt has been hell, i had to work since i have been 14 just to pay rent since she would occasionally just spend all her money on drugs or alcohol and not get food or pay rent, knowing what was coming i distanted myself emotionally as much as i can without showing it on the outside and became too good of a liar, making me unable to really love others, so far the only person i truly loved was my ex (16-19) 

Fast forward 8 years, im 20, serving in the army and come home for a weekend every other week, my brother just finished his service and i got roughly a year left for mine, had 1 episode so far during my servince and was lucky enough to get a surprise vacation and stopped it when i got home. During that time i was still with my ex so i had at least some support.

So, for all of my life, I've been wondering what I actually want to do with it. I've been blogging, making YouTube videos and doing all sorts of other stuff, but I finally found something that I want to give all of myself to. 

Competitive League of Legends. 

Now, I've played League for almost 3 years now, but only in the last six months have I started really trying to get good at the game and now I'm at my high point, better than I ever was. If I could keep up with my pace of playing at least 3-5 games (1,5-4h daily depending on the length of the games), I'm certain that by the end of the year I would be able to reach Diamond, which is top 0.1% of the players, and by the end of 2018, probably after upping my training schedule, I can see myself being good enough to play pro. 

There is a catch though. For the last year and a half, I've been experiencing serious back issues. At first just ignorable discomfort, then all out pain. 

I'm doing tons of excercises every day. The Tibetan Rituals, Work Excercises by FitnessBlender and others, mainly focusing on stretching. Overall, I look like a really fit person and you would never correlate my sillhouete to back pain. 

The excercises help, but not enough. I spend upwards of an hour daily excercising and while it nearly eliminated the problems in my back, my neck is as bad as ever. 

When I'm on a school break it's really fine. I then spend 4-6 hours a day sitting at my PC, but do regular breaks, stretch, go for walks, etc. 

When school rolls around though, I have to sit there for sometimes upwards of 8 hours on really shitty chairs, and then coming back home to spend even 2 hours on the PC just feels like self-harm, but I have to do it if I ever want to reach my goals. 

Is there anything I can do to prevent my neck problems from holding me back?

97,"I'm from Ireland. Median income is 30-40k euro. I've just finished a PhD in mathematics and don't know what to do.

Role 1:

I am 3 days away from leaving a large financial institution that trade stocks. I'm working as a quant, an intellectually demanding role. This is my first job out of a PhD. It is an internship but once they heard I had another offer they made a large offer of  an 85k euro salary plus benefits. This is would put me in the top 5-10% of income earners in Ireland, perhaps higher. In my first week in this role I wanted to quit as it was all too much. The learning and development hasn't been the best but at this salary they expect you to research yourself. No one talks to each other, everyone verges on being autistic. Think there was a week were I didn't speak to anyone. The people are nice though but always professional. Wouldn't talk about things we did on weekends off or anything. The theory of the work is semi tough, feels like an extended PhD. There's unlimited free food and loads of services like onsite doctors, gym, clothes washing and drying. If I stay on the salary would enter six figures in two years.


Role 2:
Salary is 69k euro. Role is business intelligence analyst. Very small team of 5. The company is a large job search engine company. Model their culture off google. Manager is not very technically minded but  is a go getter, quite motivated. My best friend is one of the people on this team.


My dad who works in HR has said the financial company is better for my career and thinks the level of coding and expertise won't be the same as this other company. My mother thinks I need a break and this other company is the way to go and ignore the money. I don't know what to pick and I've been struggling for weeks with this. Long term I don't want to work for anyone but myself. I want to manage real estate. To do that I need money. However I've suffered from depression in the past and can get fed up with life occasionally. My dad thinks it's up to me to manage this and it shouldn't have to do with the company I work for. If I stay in the financial institution I'd have to go to the gym more and look after my health to get through it.

That said, I fear it is a pie-in-the-sky dream and perhaps at this point, late 20's, I would be better focussing my energies else where. I understand that to attain the type of position I would like in psychology would, at minimum, require about 5 more years of studying and probably double that in employment uncertainty. Anywhere else won't of course add to helping answer these questions but maybe it is a more realistic course of action. 
I'd like to be able to work in something interesting, worthwhile and be able to travel, maybe psychology is an incredibly difficult version of this? 
I have looked around online, too much perhaps, and have been left feeling disheartened, inspired, determined and dejected all at once. Any personal experiences would be much appreciated. 

Thank you. ",06Feb2017,3

He stopped returning my texts and phone calls Like i don't exist. I was very hurt by him. I blamed myself for him not talking to me anymore. Got drunk and texted him that i have tons of issues and that i shouldnt have talked to him in the first place.  I also said that i was trying to make him like me and that he's so handsome and he deserves a good girl not someone who is messed up like me.

107,"I am a girl, but for the entire part of my life (especially after I have gone to puberty) I felt uncomfortable in the typical ""girl"" attire, actions, etc. For the next half of my life I cut my hair short and dressed like a guy, and acted like one because I felt myself was much more cooler and myself than when I acted like a girl. However, I have never liked girls, I have tried dating one in my highschool and she was very nice and everything anyone could ask for but I simply had to break up with her because I really wasn't attracted to her. I know for sure I am not lesbian, or bisexual by that experience. I have also dated few guys but after trying them out for few days or weeks, I'd be just not attracted to them. My dating experiences go from interested in the person to not anymore after I get to know them a bit. They weren't bad people either. I never really enjoyed dating or the thought of being in relationship. It does get lonely at times but when I see people those thoughts just disappear.

Above is a drawing my girlfriend did. It's obvious who it is, and I think she's extraordinarily talented. Unfortunately, she see's all the faults. She see's every imperfection. 

Lot's of people have asked to buy her drawings. She's done commissions before, and made a small amount of money that supports her hobby. I've suggested she do more - and we could make a little business out of it. 

I'm in two minds.. she says commissions are the worst because there is so much pressure. I'd love her to be happy with her art, and I'd love her to get some appreciation and a boost to her self-confidence if people start paying her for her work. 

That said, it's her hobby, and it's very private. She's almost ashamed of it. So - do I continue to try and convince her she should try to make it more serious, or do I let it remain her hobby, despite it being one she hides.

Im not artistic, I have no secret talent. I have no idea how intimate and private this kind of thing can be, but I have an idea. I dont want her to feel pressured into turning her hobby that she enjoys into something she no longer loves to do - but on the other hand, maybe a little appreciation and general interest in her drawings will make her more confident with it, and she can do what she loves more often.

119,"Hello dear all, 

I'm 19 and from a Chinese family but I was born and raised in Western Europe. Obviously, there are quite some differences between Westerners and Chinese parents and I got caught between that. To me, the ""Western"" ways are the normal ones but my parents keep trying to push me in the Chinese direction (get straight As, if I don't I got punished in various ways etc). I endured all of that until a few years ago because I found a girl who I felt like that she's my soulmate of some sort and she made me realize that what I was going through at home wasn't normal. I started my first semester in university now and my goal was just to graduate, I didn't aim for the best marks or anything like that. I tried to keep my SO secret from my parents because they would have gotten furious about it, as my mother thinks that relationships shouldn't be a thing until you're 26+ (When she met my dad basically). Well my mother recently found out about her and said that she'll smash my phone+laptop and basically lock me up if I don't get three As in my first three university exams. I had the exams recently and I'm 100% sure it's impossible that I got these marks, also I don't wanna go thru her bullshit anymore. I've been considering ""running away"", as in moving to my SO, her parents already said that I can live with them if my parents get unbearable and that they'll gladly accept me. I'm scared how my parents will react if I left one night without them noticing and only leaving a letter, I cannot discuss this with them either because I'd end up in the ""locked up"" situation immediatly otherwise. My biggest fear is that my parents will find out where my SO's family lives and kidnap me of some sort and/or cause the family trouble. I like the family a lot and I consider my SO's mom basically my second mom now, I don't want to ruin their lifes or make it more complicated in any way. (Also I have to post this under a new reddit account because my mother goes thru my laptop when I'm on the toilet and forgot to Windows+L the screen, that's also how she found out about me having a gf). 
What are your thoughts on my current situation and how would you advice me to handle the situation? I'd be glad for your help as I'm kinda just stuck in a miserable/desperate mood right now, not knowing which way I should go and what is right for me.

120,"I am 22 years old, and currently studying (a 2 year education). I got diagnosed with ADHD about 7 months ago, and also have anxiety and prone to depression (last 4 years). 
My everyday life is filled with worries and fears of all the responsibility. Things i have to do, things i should do and things i want to do. 

Whenever life gets me down, i dream about traveling. I want to see the world, leave everything behind and ONLY worry about myself. Not having the feeling of having to answer to somebody. I've only been hesitating because i'm scared of. Well, what i leave behind. I wish to do this with an open mind. Take a break from the world. I just don't know how to do it. I'm so scared of what people will think of me. And it really scares me off. And i'm afraid that i will fail. That i will give up and go home, sulking and frustrated. 
This has not been a ""spur of the moment"" thought. I've planned it before, but always pulled out when things started to get serious. Whenever something in life happens, then i start to worry too much about what might happen and how people will feel.

I don't know if i should do it. And how. Like, how do i tell people that i do it? Do i just make everything ready, then go home to mom and dad, explain them that this is what i want, or what do you think? As you might be able to see, i'm so frustrated and scared. I'm done having to go around and feel like i have to answer to everybody, when i just want to answer to myself. I feel, that if i go out and leave everything behind (not indefinitely) then i might be able to finally see the world through the eyes that are blinded now. So i ask you. What do you suggest? 

I know, that whatever i do. My parents always have a bed for me. 

Should i do this, and if, should i tell anybody before i do it? Hope you will understand and guide me in this.

129,"So about half a year now I've known this guy, we became friends really and it's not even a f-zone joke, we were like just friends. We met on the Internet and he was nearby (I'm guessing but I'll explain later) so all we really did was play games together. That's it. I know guys like girl gamers but we only ever talked about that game or maybe something else but it wasn't that much.

He then started acting weird, he did that annoying stuff like trying to agree with everything I say, trying to impress me by lying or repeating things I say. Even messaged me everyday like he couldn't go a day without me. After about a month of that torture I was almost ready to just say, I need space. A lot of space. But he finally admitted he was in love with me... I turned him down saying I'm just a girl online and other things and he took it ok.

Well, skip to maybe December and he magically lives near me. Now there's games that ping nearby people to you but I mean with his impress me crap I thought he was lying but he wasn't. So once I finally decided to meet, we met at a mcdonald's he tried so hard to act like it was a date. He wanted to pay for everything, wanted to pull my chair back etc etc. Skip Skip past him slowly trying to get me to like him...

Finally I decided to just scare him off, I stopped taking baths for maybe a a week now but when we met in public he didn't mind. I invited him to my house, to my room he was completely polite and even though it smelled bad he still felt happy and commented on my dirty floor I purposely made saying I could maybe clean a little.

That brings us to now, a few days ago, I assumed that was as much he could take so I offered sex to him, I expected him to stop and change his mind because it's been at least 2-3 weeks since I bathed. He was so ready for this though that I sort of felt bad for him. When we started and we finally got naked the entire room started to smell horrible, it reeked literally, I felt like I went waay to far. He even brought his head down to my vagina and I thought that's it, he's done. But he just started fingering me.

I was completely surprised that I just let him do it and eventually he put his dick in and started going for it... the entire room felt so bad... and with all the sweat it smelt literally like hot trash. I think from no baths that just made me queef so much which didn't even faze him. I even flipped on my stomach to stuffing my face in the pillow to block out the smell and he went at it doggystyle, the queefing made it really smell like farts and crap. He finally stopped. I really assumed he was done, but he just flipped me back over, kissed me and literally went at it until he finally said he was about to cum and he can't stop. So I pushed him out of me and he dripped down in pure bliss... 

Now. My room smelt bad, I smelt worse, even his smell cologne was gone now. But he was so happy, I get he was probably a virgin but how desperate can you get. And I don't think guys will do anything for a pretty girl, all I have is the face. I'm very flat. So it's not that he wants. He did mention he doesn't have many female friends when we started talking online but... I can't wrap my head around this.

I took a bath after he left and the water was literally like covered in my filth. I could not figure out why he still had sex. He even still messages every day but I turned him down to meet in public lately. He even assumes it was him and says he wasn't too rough or too bad or anything... and I'm like... is he serious? What does he see in me?

TL;DR This guy has the biggest crush on me and despite the fact I try to gross him out, he brushes it off like it never happened. So... can someone please explain what he sees in me? I can't find out why to save my life. He likes me even more now...",06Feb2017,2

156,"So I have another account on Reddit where I make lots of posts on small subreddits for some of my interests and I seem to always get downvoted. The situation came to a climax yesterday when there was a post about credit card security, which is my area of expertise so I wrote a long comment that outlined a lot of pertinent information about the topic. I proceeded to get downvoted, shit on(they also shit on the bank I work for), and disagreed with by a bunch of people who DON'T work in credit card security. I've been told that I'm condescending and I just don't understand why in 4 years of being on Reddit and actively posting everyone seems to hate me and hate my opinions.

157,"So I'm a junior in college, I have this 4 credit class half lecture and half lab that is very important to my industry.  In fact, when I have interviews for internships or summer positions one of the first things potential employers ask me is what experience I have with DDC, which I would have experience with enough to at least hold a conversation about it if the class were being taught, its entirely on DDC of HVACR systems.  However, our professor had back surgery between the fall and spring semesters and keeps getting the date when he's allowed to return pushed back.  The college also never set up the lab over break, so us the students are doing it under supervision of a professor who is clueless as to what DDC of HVACR equipment entails, and he has told us this multiple times.  We aren't even setting up the specialized equipment like controllers anyway, just running wires and mounting dinrail on the walls pretty much, learning absolutely not a fucking thing about what the class is supposed to be teaching.  When the semester first started, we were told the original professor would be back the second or third week of class, which isn't too bad, but it's now the fifth week of a sixteen week semester and we haven't met our professor or started any material.  I am seriously concerned about the quality of education I'm getting.  It's not just that we're paying to take a class that we are doing a job somebody else was to be payed to do, but I'm having potential employers ask me about DDC, I say I have this class, they want to know what we're doing, and we aren't doing shit that has to do with DDC.  Then next semester and the following classes will build off of this class and we haven't even started.  When I brought my concerns to the dean, he flipped it and made it me complaining about the professors involved. I tried to make it clear it's about how the college assigned people to cover the class who can't do it and the fact that our lab wasn't even set up, but its like he was dead set on making it seem like I'm complaining about the professors so that I would be afraid to press it any further to not have a shit relationship with my professors, and it worked.  I was actually impressed at how well he was able to take my complaint and twist it into something I wouldn't want to continue with.  But people of reddit, should I do anything else or just let this play out and play the cards I've been dealt.

158,"I am from the UK. I haven't used my degree in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and i have no relevant experience in the field (I graduated with a Third Class Honours - I know, I fucked up, I wasted the opportunity and my time on a 4 year course). I also now feel like I have forgotten the vast majority of what I did learn while I was there.

&amp;nbsp;

When I graduated in the summer of 2014 I tried my hardest applying for countless chemistry graduate jobs (the vast majority i was under-qualified to even be considered - minimum requirements of 2.1 or 2.2 classification). I ever only received one interview of which I was unsuccessful.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So I had joined the Job Centre. This is where I had weekly meetings, where you get paid a small amount of money when you provide evidence that you have been looking for a job. My Advisor had suggested doing week-long course to work in a warehouse where i would be guaranteed an interview at the end. I felt like I had to say yes because I needed the money and if not they would assume that I didn't want a job and would stop the money - I did want a job but not in a warehouse.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I got the job in the warehouse. For 3 months I did shift work - 4 days on 4 days off, 48 hours in 4 days which works out at 12 hours a day. During this time, I didn't apply for any chemistry based jobs, due to being so tired and demotivated. I was laid off as there was no work after Christmas (Dec 2014).
 
&amp;nbsp;

I was then unemployed for 3 more months still applying for jobs in the Chemistry sector. I was then contacted by the same warehouse to work for another 3 months.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Approximately 1 year later (June/July 2015) after graduating I had gotten referred by a friend to work at an online travel agent in customer services (£17,000 a year). After 6 months I was internally promoted to the Corporate Travel team (1st Jan 2016 - £17,500 a year) which I had worked for until November 2016.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I was then approached on LinkedIn by one of the world’s largest hotel companies to work as a global sales coordinator in the meeting and events department, where i am currently working (£18,000 a year). The role I am currently doing is basically an admin role, however when I had the phone interview and face-to-face interview this was never really expressed to me actually how much it is basically just admin / data entry. Basically, we receive requests and send them to the hotels directly and then the hotels go directly back to the client with us in copy with a proposal for the meeting/event. A quarter of my time is spent chasing the hotels for a response or a follow up to the client for an answer… the other three quarters is spent entering data into salesforce to track the requests which come through to the inbox. There is no sales involved.

&amp;nbsp;

So after explaining all of this, basically I am wondering would it be possible for me to get back into a chemistry based job? I am extremely unhappy in the job I currently have, as I feel like it has been misled. Ideally it would be something chemistry based, or alternatively account management or even sales? I assume the job title I have sounds good going forward and I could easily exaggerate the truth of the role, but that’s about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Any questions if you would like me to expand on anything posted, let me know.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;TL;DR – Completed my chemistry degree, got a 3rd class (lowest grade), feel like I’ve wasted 4 years. Two and a half years later it has dawned on me. Hate my current job and wish I could go back. Seeking any advice…",06Feb2017,1

163,"I had testicular torsion about a month ago, luckily, it 'resolved itself', which means my testicle twisted back by itself, no emergency surgery was required.

I'm not good at public speaking I hate it, and furthermore, her fiance... I'm not sure about.

I'm more of a person who thinks you should wait to get married until you are like 26 and emotionally/financially ready. She's only 21 (her fiance is 20) and we're all in college. She just loves planning. Also they fight EXPLOSIVELY yelling and stomping and slamming but then make up quickly. They decided three days after dating to get married. They've been together either two or three years now. She can look past most of it by seeing it as mere ""political opinion differences"" but some of the things he stands for seem morally wrong to me (discriminatory, violent) so it makes me personally even less excited for this wedding. 

But if she's going to marry him regardless, I want to be there for her. What do I do as a maid of honor? I can ask the bridesmaids for help, probably will, but some of them I don't mind if I never talk to them, you know?

My mom got full custody of me and what i've learned from my dad was that the conditions would be she could keep full custody as long as she provides a safe environment for me and my twin sister (bailey) to live in. My mom recently lost the house that my mom, bailey, and i lived in. she decided to try living in 2 campers, one for her and one for bailey and i. btw, we live in minnesota and 2 weeks ago the weather was below 15 degrees.

anyway, i told my mom that i would live in a camper under the condition that SHE would fill it up with propane every week so we have heat. she suffers from depression, so she never did that for me. she's filled it up once since we got it in october. 

we parked the camper in my older sister's back yard. bailey and i started living in our camper right away, but my mom crashed hers, so she never got it and kept telling us that it was still ""getting fixed"". yeah right. so she's been living in the house with my older sister and watching my twin sister and i freeze in our camper. she has offered for us to come into the house, but the house has 2 bedrooms and 4 people already living in it... not an ideal situation. 

i decided to move in with my dad because then i would at least get a meal every night and be able to sleep in my own room with an actual bed. my dad wanted custody of me, but i told him that i didn't want him to go to court for that, so instead he's asked my mom for income documentation in order to stop paying child support to my mother for me since i'm living with him. my twin sister decided to stay in the camper because she's had problems with our dad in the past. 

this morning, i stayed at the camper with my sister because she needed a ride home and i felt like sleeping over with her last night. my mom came into the camper this morning and was super angry at me, but loving towards my sister. this is what went down in the conversation with her:

mom: what are you doing here? you don't live here.

me: bailey needed a ride home and i decided to sleep over.

mom: well just so you know, your dad is suing me for custody of you. (this was in fact not true.) 

me: are you blaming me for that?

mom: yes, you didn't have to move out, you could have stayed in the house with me.

me: it's my fault because i wanted privacy and my own bedroom? 

mom: also i'm not paying for your phone bill anymore because i can't afford it. (she gets 2k every 2 weeks because she's an Registered Nurse and makes a lot of money.) 
 
then she left. i don't know what to do, apologize to my mom and move out of my dads house and back into a freezing camper where i have to do everything on my own and act like an adult, or stay with my dad and lose the super strong connection i had with my mom because she would hate me for the rest of my life.

Basically, the deal is: He will give me the money, the house will be under my name, and I will pay him back interest free over 30 years.

However, ever since then, he has been a straight dick to me. He belittles me, disrespects me, and treats me worse then dirt. I can't put into words how frustrating it has been. I've kept my cool, and attributed his lashing out to grieving. 

Its getting harder though, I feel as if he is dangling this house over my head. I was trying not to reinforce his cynicism, but circumstances has left me with no other option.

210,"I am 14 and in 9th grade in high school. The first quarter of the school was rough because in my 6th/7th grade year there was a rumor going around that I was autistic (which I'm not) and I missed a lot of school back then due to depression so I lost all of my friends so I spent those first months of school rebuilding my friendships. We're in quarter three now. I have been feeling very depressed everyday for about three weeks now. I cannot force myself to wake up in the morning (I wake up at 5:55 so I can make the bus to school), I dislike all of my friends and I don't feel like I fit in with them and I'm having a rough time concentrating in my classes. I'm planning to do the volleyball team late next month and I'm starting a new job but every time I talk to people I don't feel any better but worse and I don't like how I act and the things I say to people sometimes.

213,"Basically I'm in my 3rd year of university but expect to graduate in Spring of 2019. That's another 2 years (I cut my course load to work part time, which drastically delayed my graduation, and also took a semester off). Within the semester I took off, I learned about the stock market, had a mentor teach me the basics and I basically made $100k in 1 year (borrowed $15k from my dad, so over 300% gain). 

I'm currently in Engineering, and when I started I was very interested in it. However, after finding out an easier way to make money, I don't think my degree is useful anymore. I speculate this money to turn into $500k within the next few years, which I plan to further invest into businesses and such. Overall, I don't want to work as an engineer. 

My dad is telling me to stay in school, since having a degree would make me more ""credible"", but I don't plan on using this degree at all, nor am I guaranteed a job as an engineer when I graduate, since most students don't even end up working in the field they studied.

At this point, I feel like I'm wasting my time with my degree. I just recently introduced my friend, whom I've known for about 10 years, into the stock markets after showing him my portfolio, and I'm helping him make money. I project his portfolio to be up $100k by the end of this year, like mine was, and we'll be sharing these funds and expanding our opportunities. However, he's in his final year of university, so he'd be done school by the end of this year.

So basically, am I wasting my time and money with my degree?",06Feb2017,1

I'll be attending the Paul Hall Apprentice Program this April and I had a few questions about the program and mariner life in general.

1) Cell phones - I currently get my cell phone through my job. I don't have a personal phone. Should I get a personal one for the program, or should I just wait until after the apprenticeship?

2) What will I be allowed during my downtime? Is there a weight room? Can I bring my guitar? Can I bring my Kindle e-reader? etc.

3) In general for mariner life, where do you young guys end up living when you're not working? As much as I enjoy my parents' company, I'd rather not move back in with them. Do you guys find short term rentals or roommates?

218,"Hello All,

I know this might seem like a strange post but I would like to think about all the repercussions and this is kind of a complex topic... so I am going to let Reddit hash it out for me.

I have been a blood donor for over 10 years now. I am AB+ so it's especially important for me to donate - especially plasma. When I was in High School I used to give to the American Red Cross. I moved to Missouri where there was a regional blood bank that was really good. They were a lot like Red Cross except they only serviced southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas and didn't do any of the support overseas.

Now I've moved to the Detroit area and there are two options: I can go back to Red Cross or there is a place that looks like they pay you directly for your donation.

Here's my quandary...

American Red Cross has been involved in some bad PR as of late. I like to think that they do more good than harm but they've gotten so huge and have become so wasteful. I'd like to go with a regional bank that is going to treat my donation of blood like it's the last unit of blood on the planet and make the best use of it.

I don't want to get paid for my donation either. So I thought that if I went with the local option and they paid me that I would take that money and give it to a local food bank or buy a meal for someone who needed it. But what does those blood banks who pay you do with your blood anyway? Do they just collect it and turn around to sell to American Red Cross anyway? Even so, I feel like if I'm getting ""paid"" and turn around to give that money to a food bank or any other charity that would still be doing a little more good than simply giving blood, right? Because a blood bank is getting blood or plasma AND some other unrelated organization is getting something good from it too.

Any constructive advice is welcome. Thank you in advance.",06Feb2017,1

Of course he stops communication after an email stating ""he will get back to her"".

231,"My whole life I never really had a relationship. I told myself it was because I never really found anyone that interested me but in reality it was because of my crippling shyness. Once college came around I started trying out online dating. About 3 years ago I met C. Things started off really slow and I was going to give up but I just had this feeling and eventually we got really close and started a long term relationship (10 hours away). The more we talked the more I found out she had never had a boyfriend either and had told herself shed never find anyone. Another thing was that there was a decent age difference, at the time I was a sophomore in college and she was a still in highschool. Things were great for about a year and then everything went downhill. The typical stress and doubts that came with a long distance relationship crept in and we just constantly argued and things were never the same. We kept taking breaks then coming back together and repeating the cycle over and over. Well eventually we took a long break early last year starting around February. I decided it was a good idea to focus on myself and not try so hard. So that's what I did, I graduated and got a good job and my own place and everything was going really well. After a while though, loneliness really started to set in. I was in a new city and the company I'm at doesn't normally hire college grads so I'm the only one my age in the office. She was the one that I always talked to and shared my day with and we were always there for each other and so I decided to message her again. Things actually started back up and were almost where they used to be, but then she started drifting away. She said she felt like I wasnt giving back the same feelings she was and that she was obsessing over me to the point where she was making sacrifices and skipping things just to have time for me. I'm not a very expressive person so I can see why she felt that way, even though deep down I really cared for her. So we took another break and I decided to try tinder. I thought I needed to try something real and to get more experience with dating in general. So I installed it honestly expecting nothing and I got a decent amount of matches. But I never felt anything. I just let conversations die because I didn't care. I never felt any kind of spark or interest at all. So of course I decided to message her again. She was happy to hear from me and we caught up but of course all the feeling was gone. But the more we talked we both realized we had feelings still. We talked about how we would get over the distance and the fact that she'd be in college focusing on her career and it just seemed like there were too many things against us. She also said she just really needs to feel like what she gives out she gets back in love and that she was also afraid of me from back when we had the arguments and things got ugly. I know the obvious answer is to move on, but I've really tried and it just seems like I can't. I've tried focusing on myself and bettering myself but the depression just sets in after a while. I know there are probably multiple points in here that will make you want to bang your head against the wall at my stupidity but I'm honestly just inexperienced at the whole relationship thing and really need advice.

235,"So I'm in sixth-form college (kinda like high school but for only two years and much more chilled than secondary school) and I've recently been facing some relapses of pretty low mood. It's not a huge deal as I can deal with it using some of the techniques I learnt from CBT. 

Since school I'm better in nearly every possible way - I'm beginning to lose weight, I'm getting better academically, suicidal less etc. (although these do float around a bit)

Recently it's been quite a bit worse. I've had some pretty stressful experiences at college with tests that I found way too hard, and finding myself struggling to sleep well and to concentrate. 

In addition, I've started to reflect on loneliness more. I find that being worried about my academics has started to make me want to be alone a lot more. I just find that I like the people I know, I just don't know the people I like, if that makes sense. We get on well in lessons but at other times they're just in friend groups where I only know them, and other times I just don't know where they are.


Also, I'm kinda reflecting a lot on my lack of a boyfriend what with Valentine's Day coming up soon and everyone talking about relationships and things. I know the best way to meet one is just to get out there and talk to more people, but I find this really hard to implement in practice. Maybe I'm almost clinging on to the loneliness because it makes me feel alive? I also joke around a lot about being a bit dead inside as I can often have a pretty good laugh about how shit life is sometimes. But maybe that's bad for me. I feel as if having a self-deprecating sense of humour that's pretty morbid (but sometimes ""caustic"" to other people as one of my friends put it) is kinda a part of me though that I don't wanna ditch. I guess I'm an asshole sometimes because it can be pretty funny so long as people understand you're just kidding around but I worry people might think I'm not kidding around. 

I just find it really hard to enunciate what the problem is, too. It's like everything's kinda gone tits-up. I guess it's just getting over the initial hurdle of coming out of my shell a bit.  So I don't really even know what my question is, it's just I'd appreciate any advice on finally breaking out of this habit. ",06Feb2017,1
236,"Hello R/Advice

&amp;nbsp;

Made a throwaway account for this but really think if i keep this inside me any longer I'm going to explode. So short back story my mother and dad broke up with I was quite young and then she re-married and has a kid from her second marriage. Now I suspect with the second marriage burning out she is emotionally (I hope to god its not physical, I tell me self shes too old for that to sleep at night)

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the problem, first marriage (with my dad) didn't work out on grounds of difference they ended it and they kept in touch due to me being a shared parenting kinda system. So it was normal for mum to get an occasional text from my dad or even a call, sometimes I felt she would though call him up and talk to him on and off (after a few drinks) (again emotionally being unfaithful to my step dad) My dad has told me she sometimes would get a little drunk and say her second marriage is horrible etc but she can't get out of it due to my step sibling. (my dad never wanted back in, it damaged him too much) So over the phone she kept in touch with my dad (I know for a fact nothing physical happened) but this was all done in secrecy and I ignored it growing up. Worth noting I am blessed with a step dad that is very loving and is the reason I am who I am today, he is a horrible person at times (drunk/hostile) but me and him get along very well to the point I am on his side on this issue beyond his random outbreaks on the weekend. Note both of them have drinking issues.

&amp;nbsp;

So fine mums second marriage also isn't going to hot, and her first one bombed but now I noticed she was always on her phone and was HIDING it from me when I got close. One day I zipped into the kitchen as she was showering and checked her texts from a name I had been seeing a few times on her phone. To my DISGUST there was all these ""I LOVE YOU"" ""I MISS YOU"" ""TAKE CARE BABY IT'S COLD"" etc. Seems like the dude has a kid and is a single parent but what bothering me is the entire household is so engrossed in their own lives nobody cares. I'm the only one that knows and its disturbed me horribly on the inside. To think I even asked my step dad to consider taking mum for a 'routine mental health checkup' since she kept forgetting things, I wanted to get it seen to 6 months ago before she starting doing what shes up to now.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday was mum's bday and my bio dad sent her a set of flowers (despite mum dropping the show on my bio dad who has still yet to recover from the marriage [he's still single and just lives alone] so still not over her, he sends her this and drops her a text to tell her she got them, which she ignores to talk to new guy and my bio dad was confused asking me over the phone ""how busy could she be"" ""she always thanks me for a birthday gift"".   

&amp;nbsp;

All this is KILLING ME, too many sides in this and I'm getting horribly screwed over mentally keeping all this in.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the issues:  
Tell Step Dad: Can't, he get's aggressive, violent and out of control when he losses his temper. He also might know and is running his own side op (has hit one a random lady before that pissed mum off)  
Tell Bio Dad: Would crush him on the inside, or whats left of him after he hears what my mum is doing  
Tell Mum: Shes is unstable to the point that she gets also very aggressive when things are not going her way, so I don't trust how far she can go with her anger, I prefer to leave that door closed.  
Tell Sibling: Too young, my step brother is only 14.

TL;DR mother might be cheating on my step dad had nobody to vent to thought Id just put it here and hope for the best for some solid advice.

237,"I’m almost 25. I completed a BA two years ago in Classics (History + Latin/Greek) and I’m currently making between 20-25/hour working as a grammar tutor perhaps 20 hours a week. I have 7k in savings; I’ve paid off my student loans and for the past year I’ve been coasting. 

I’ve considered doing a Masters in something for a long time, but I live with my aging and ailing grandparents and I think that moving away for something I love to study is a bit unlikely. My mother has a drug problem and has been a drain on my grandparents financially for her whole life. As it is, I don’t stand to inherit anything in the near or far future. 

My GPA from my undergrad isn’t super high because I spent so much time working. I ended up with around a 3.4 (3.5 if you don’t count first year courses). The Ontario Government has announced that as of this fall (2017) tuition for full-time, low income and mature students will be free. Obviously, this has me dreaming up a hundred possible futures. 

The issue is that I don’t want to pick something generic, like Classics, when I go back. I can go back to simply raise my GPA as a non-degree student, or I can pursue a second Bachelors Degree. 

I love languages, biology, environmental studies, history etc. I also love working with my hands and selling wooden and leather journals, making wood carvings, editing and writing essays. I’m interested in a lot of things and I have so many options now that tuition isn’t such a stumbling block.
Basically, I need a major that will lead to a career. 

My dream job would be doing something outside towards the larger goal of saving the environment from humanity. Another dream job is writing for pay. 
My family has never supported my education, and I’ve never received advice from anyone I respect. By the time I am 35, I expect that I will be on my own (or with my current partner) sans my current family due to age etc. I’m trying to think ahead.

257,"Hello everyone,

I would like an outsiders opinion in this situation. I had a best friend for over 10 years. About 5 years ago she met this boyfriend and our friendship changed. 
This much older man (he was 28 when she was 16) never had a job, never finished school, is living of his mother and is in general a very negative person. He made it clear from the beginning that he did not like me and her other friends. 
I was ready to block this friend from my life, but felt compelled to get back in touch with her after a tragic event happened shorty after in her life. There was tension in our friendship, this was mostly due to her boyfriend. The tension in our friendship continued to build up. A few years down the line I noticed that  money, clothes and other items went missing from my house. (I live by myself in a small appartment). I felt strongly that this 'friend' took my stuff, but I could not prove it. One day when I was at her house I found a necklace my parents gave me when I was 13. It was especially made for me and has a lot of meaning.
I immediately confronted her about it in front of a few other people that were there. She said I must have forgotten it at her house. I never wore this necklace because I was too afraid to lose it. I was very angry and started shouting, I asked her what else she stole from me and accused her of a few things. She denied everything and called me a liar. Her boyfriend kicked me out of the house (literally).

I feel used by this person and a year later I still get angy when I think about everything that happened during the last 5 years. I have a friend who still sees my former 'best friend' at times. She told me that she was spreading rumors about me and she thought it was pretty funny and well deserved that her boyfriend was violent towards me. I think she got away with everything too easy and strongly feel like taking revenge.

 What should I do? :/

258,"Why am I writing this? I’m sorting through something messy, uncomfortable, and dirty af in regards to my life experiences and the current fire tire in America. I came to this conclusion, I do not identify with white privilege.

To quote a man adored by birds, “Let me be very clear,”…I am not refuting the existing of white privilege or that I have not been affected by it in some way, I’m saying that I don’t identify with it. In the literal sense, I do not have strong links to it.

To define white privilege as it has been taught to me- a position of power, a position of privilege, not being the center of attention, not taking up space, and defending the marginalized when a non-marginalized person is demeaning or threatening them.

As I was sifting through the chaos of these thoughts and trying to understand the conflict within me, I came across a comic from the Star Tribune: (http://68.media.tumblr.com/2dc6fce7f645f9e981a71dea7a40a723/tumblr_mq36j454y91r55d2io1_500.jpg)

The contrast is abundantly clear but provided me with the questions I needed. The questions I haven’t been able to put into words for the entirety of my life. What if there was another scenario?

What if there was a third “talk,” depicting a white parent pointing a gun at a white child?

After 10 years, I was able to read a victim's impact statement for injustices against me that will never be served. Although, I did help solidify a lengthy sentence for his current crime by providing historical context. (https://www.advocatesrising.com/statements/2016/12/29/to-my-step-father-the-defendant)

If you have read that and are now back, I’m going to add more context to my background. I’m a white, bisexual, female. My descent is Norwegian. My great grandma came from Norway on a boat, when she was 16. I’m a first-time graduate and did so entirely independent of my pos parents. I was never talked to about college, and when the conversation occurred, I was told that it was unreachable for me. I thought I had to join the military to get a better education, so I did. My body did not approve. At some point, I ended up in community college and a university but was ashamed of myself the whole way. I never thought I belonged there. Before I turned 18, I had moved 33 times and went to 15 different schools, and –every-single-one-, lost my vaccine records. Yeah, I’ve been vaccinated beyond acceptable. Just like me, lost in the system. I’ve had around 25 different jobs, the first one at 16. I’ve been homeless. I’ve dug through trash to find cans/money for food. Now, at almost 30, I have achieved the “American Dream.” I have a home and a car, both achieved through a miraculous life insurance policy, (we weren’t related), two handsome boys with four legs, and a stable job. I’ve also achieved the “Millennial Dream,” constant subconscious dread about extensive student loans and the inability to rest in the search for a meaningful existence.

I’m going to go back a little further in time than in my statement. I won’t cover it all, just snippets. When I was seven, my mom, my brothers, and I were on the run from a different abusive “stepdad.” After traveling for only a little while, my mom realized he was following us. She went to the police for safety, but there was nothing they could do. She had no proof. From then on, my mom video recorded us while we slept to gather evidence. Eventually, we got him on camera, but he wasn’t alone. We watched the playback of him and two of his friends hovering over my brothers and I while we slept. My mom confident that would bring us protection took the footage to the police. It still wasn’t enough. They couldn’t see his face. Fearing for our safety, my mom abandoned everything we had left and took us to a women’s shelter. I remember vividly, that was my first memory of a poc. As I sat on my mom’s lap, I gazed across the room. A little girl of color sat on her mom’s lap. We both looked at each other for a long time. My only thought, I wonder if her daddy beats her, too.

My next encounter with a poc was when I was 8, Michael. An intelligent, charismatic Vietnamese boy who lived across the street. I was captivated by his love of oysters and respect for his family’s customs. I would’ve done anything for that kid, and when I could, I did. I gave up my elephant ride at the circus because he was so passionately fixated on it and when a classmate called him a g---k, I got my a---- beat by my white principal for going after him. Did the other kid get in trouble? Nope. A white person beat me because I lunged myself at a white kid and called him a cracker, and the kid who actually used derogatory language and insulted a poc, nothing.

When I was nine, I was invited into the home of my little brother’s doctor. It’s been too long to recall the specifics, but they were from India. They guided me through their extraordinary religious poses, taught me the significance of the paint they adorned on their bodies, and they allowed me to wear their beautifully ornamented outfits while dancing in a peacefully choreographed celebration, unique to their culture.
Between eight and fourteen, every school that I went to. Every time I was the new kid. I was instantly befriended by a poc. I’ve taken this to heart now that it’s because people of suffering recognize people of suffering. Through my teenage years, I kept close to Pamela and Betty who had no care for my hand me down clothes or that I lived in a trailer park. We lived there together. We stayed away from the violent gang activity together. We cried over Selena together. When my mom was wasted and abusive, they invited me to their home, and I got to experience every bit of what it means to have an extended, caring family.

It wasn’t until I was fourteen-eighteen that I was forced into what I now see as white privilege culture. Another move, forced by the pos my victims impact statement was for, to a small town. Every city I lived in before was predominately poc. Now, there was only one family of color. Thankfully, they lived across the street from me, and you bet, we became friends. I couldn’t handle being near the rest. As I sat in class listening to them about dating, college, shopping, vacations, cell phones, cars, and getting grounded over bad grades, declaring that I wanted to scream and vomit all over them, violently, is an understatement. I wished so desperately those were my only worries. I wondered what kind of life I could have, what my grades would be like.
Instead, I wondered what would happen when I went home. Would my mom be beaten to death? Would we have enough food to eat? Are my brothers and I getting separated again? If we did get separated, would we be forced to move back in with that pos, again? All for the sake of “Oklahoma family values.” Will I be able to walk home safely from work or will tonight be the night I get arrested for being out after curfew? Would that pos put a gun to my brother’s head and pull the trigger, this time? Will we have to move again, tomorrow? Was I going to make enough money to help pay rent or electricity? Was our house going to be set on fire?

Through typing all of this out, I’ve removed blinders off my white experiences. White people abused me. White people oppressed me. White people made me fear for my life, every day, constantly threatening me, taking every opportunity to tell me I’m worthless and that I should kill myself. White people tried to kill me. It is has been exceedingly rare for a white person to sit with me in my pain and discomfort, then or now. (Obviously, this excludes my wife). White people called me a liar, and they still do. White people told me I was going to hell for loving a woman. White people said I was overreacting and making up lies because I couldn’t actually appreciate my life as a gift. White people told me that if I would just accept what was happening, that if I stopped fighting, everything would be okay. White people feel comfortable touching me without my permission. White people force me to accept their narrative. White people ostracize me for speaking the truth.

So where does that leave me? With a severe psychological disorder, PTSD, among many other physical fear responses I can’t control. I’m working on them, though. It’s only been in the last few years that I have reached the point of not sleeping in my clothes for safety, and not locking the doors repeatedly every time I wake up from night terrors. Working on my interactions with people has only been a possibility within the last year, and that last pos”stepdad” had to harm more innocent kids last year, throwing me back into all that trauma all over again. Even further, when I tried to get involved in the case to help, a white person had the audacity to ask me “what good I thought it would do now to come forward” and a white lawyer defended that pos’s right to a reduced sentence out of safety concerns, and requested him to be relocated to a safer prison. You know who was there for me with all of this? A police officer of color. That same police officer of color took my statement of what happened 10 years ago, after finding out that small town police department shredded my first statement. They shredded it two years before my statute of limitations was up. Even further, it was that police officer of color who walked me through all of the evidence on my mom wanting to abandon me for that pos. It was that police officer of color who offered me support from that point forward.

Over the last 10 years, I haven’t been involved with people at all. It’s agonizingly challenging for me to be around people. One of my greatest endeavors of the last year is becoming friends with a group of like-minded people, who were inspired by a man adored by birds. Two happen to be poc that I admire, greatly. When I met them, I didn’t think they were equal to me. I thought they were better than me. Smarter than me. More caring and intellectual than me. Here I was, barely feeling like I deserved to get an associates degree, and they’re getting their Ph.D.! Herein lies the overall problem, I don't remember to think of myself as a person with white privilege because I barely remember to think of myself as a person of worth.

Without them realizing it, every interaction I have with poc empowers me. The confidence I wish to aspire to, I hear in every speech given. In their writings, their work, in their movies, their art, at a rally, a protest, or a solidarity march. Their natural, authentic self, speaking with boldness, conviction, and truth. That’s who I want to be. That is who I look up to.

I want to help. I want to say, “Those people hurting you are not my family. Those people hurting you are not my country. You are important. You are equal. You are my peer. You are my confidant. You are intelligent. Your life is worth it. You are worth it. You are beautiful. You are brave. You belong here. You are home. You are my family. You are my country. You are my diversity. You are my unity. You are my vision for the future. You are my definition of love. You are my strength. You may not realize it, but you are every bit an ally for me, as I am for you. For these reasons, I would sacrifice my life to protect you and so much more.” 

To the main point of this piece. This year, 2017, is the first year I have given myself permission stop shaming myself, to take space, to consider my life is worthy, work with my PTSD and get involved, have friends, not be afraid, and just be myself. Whoever the hell that is. I'm trying to learn how to exist and talk about abuse and love people and validate them for who they are. That's my skill set.

When I interact with other people, I sift through several filters. First and foremost, abuse. In what way is this person feeling hurt, fear, anger, sadness, and/or oppression? The second, how is this affecting them in who they are: sexism, racism, misogyny? This doesn’t include my own layers, does this person even want to talk to me? Why are they talking to me? What exactly do I have to offer them?

If my first filter is supposed to be white privilege, that means I would have to think of myself first, and I don’t know how to do that. I’ve never done that. I don’t know if I want to do that because it’s not about me.

These are the questions I’ve come to: 
• White people abused me, oppressed me, ignored me, and didn’t protect me. Does my abuse by white people mean less because I’m white? 
• I’ve never belonged or been able to take space at the white table, now that our culture is awakening to the explanation of privilege, I can no longer sit a poc table. Where do I go? 
• After being brought up in terror and programmed as worthless, do I now have worth and power from an entire group of people, because externally it appears that I belong to this s**t system? 
• Where does my abuse and oppression end and my power begin? • What if I never had power and I don’t know what that looks like outside of abuse or how I can obtain it?

Not everyone wants to deny. Not everyone lives in comfort. Not everyone is on that far end of the spectrum. Some of us want to help and have no idea how to get there. If I hold capacity for a poc to lash out against me because of the cruelty in this hellish world and somehow manage to deny the psychological fear/ hijacking of my mind, can a poc have capacity for me? Not just call me out, but show me exactly what I can do to obtain that power and not dehumanize me in the process?

261,"Call me Anis. I am 26 years, living in a small developing country somewhere in central Africa, Rwanda.

I have noticed, recently, that in my country there is no system to recover lost ID cards, driving licences cards and other personal identity documents. When people lose them they just start a process to get new ones. It is funny because those lost cards are spread everywhere and there is no institution responsible to recover them, not even the police.

I have thought of a system of recovery that would save time and money of the procedure of getting new documents, but where and to whom do I present it?

I have graduated in Economics in 2014, and believe that if I was given an opportunity to present my project I will do it just fine, and I see it as a very good project that would gain a lot of interest.

I was thinking about going to the police but there everyone has his boss, who has his boss, who has his boss, and so on. And the big Boss who is in the right place to make a decision (to allow this project function) is very much inaccessible, especially for someone like me. Sigh, this was important to me because I see it as a job opportunity, and I am struggling to make my own life here. Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you for the time, heart and consideration you will give my concern.",06Feb2017,1
264,"Hi, I don't mean to say I'm asking for legal advice, I'm not. I tried ""Ask a Lawyer"" and they're honestly so mean over there, so I deleted my post. I want to try to keep this brief, so I'll just say that I'm a young adult female in Florida taking care of my terminally ill mother. My husband is at our home in TN. I've also been in pain management for a back injury since Feb '14, and on 1/3/17 I voluntarily went to the ER after experiencing nausea due to a new prescription. 

The next seven hours were a terrifying nightmare for me, with the ER staff openly verbally abusing and mocking me, denying me usage of the restroom, and lying to my mother and husband on the phone, telling them I'm ""fine."" I was forced to strip, forced to give up my belongings. A security guard rifled through my wallet and purse, and even my shoes were taken from me. I was left barefoot in an open-backed hospital gown, adding to my humiliation. I was yelled at for vomiting into the sink from fear, because they wouldn't let me go to the toilet. The staff threatened me to hold me down and forcibly catheterize me if I could not produce a urine sample. I begged the security guard to either let me have a lawyer, a social worker, o ra patient care advocate. This was denied. I told them, begged them, saying I didn't feel safe. The doctor smirked and said ""Thats why you're going to psych."" His staff giggled at this. 

In the morning, after what basically amounts to a 7-hour panic attack, they forced me onto a stretcher even though they had not treated me for an overdose, and I was not stumbling or in any way disoriented, just very frightened. I asked them where they were taking me, with no answer. I cried from fear all the way to a town about 30 minutes away, where I was forced to enter a closed psych unit and locked in. 

I don't have a specific complaint about the psych unit staff. They were actually very nice to me. But I continually flash back on my experience in the original ER, and I'm starting therapy on the 13th to help deal with it. 

When I got out, I contacted the risk management department at the original hospital and explained my story. The lady agreed that what had happened to me was awful, and she waived all fees. Now I'm attempting to get the second hospital to do the same, but they are being resistant. I told them I will not pay them $1300 - I will pay a lawyer instead. 

But the reality is, that's a bluff. I don't have it in me to fight this hospital. My mother is dying and this is a terrible time for my family. But I told them I will fight them if I have to.

I swear I'm not looking for legal advice, but.. does this sound like a legitimate complaint? If so, what would YOU do if it was you or a loved one? And what do I do about the nightmares and random flashbacks? I have to keep myself together mentally and physically to be able to care for my mom. And frankly there was no ""psychiatric crisis"" until the hospital staff inflicted one upon me. 

thank you for reading, and if I'm leaving out any crucial details, please let me know. ",06Feb2017,2
265,"I'm kind of in a big hole currently with my medical school status. I went to Caribbean school on the islands back in 2013-2014 (finished mid 2015). I was able to pass all 5 semesters of medical school, yet was not able to pass the comprehensive basic sciences exam on the island. That exam was mandatory part of being able to take step 1. After a few attempts I was not able to pass. After those attempts, the school either admin withdraws you, or you withdraw yourself and transfer to another school. I ended up transferring to another Caribbean school (already looks bad).
I had to take a course in the states followed by another attempt at the comp exam. I was not able to pass the comp exam like I intended to, although I was only two points shy. I had several family health issues coincidentally occurred, including myself that included time in the hospital. The sheer stress of medical school has bought about anxiety, fear and all sorts of thoughts of failure.
Now I have one final attempt at this, and I just don't know how to approach it. I had to take at least 4 months off because of health issues previously, and now I have to completely rebuild the study process. This is not just cram over night type situation either, months of due diligence is what is needed. I'm trying to figure out the best route for me. I have completed all 5 semesters of medical school and passed all my classes, yet comp exam is not complete.
I've been debating switching careers or doing something else but I made it through all my classes with no issues. Personally just looking at a timeline, I still have to pass this, then only I can take step 1, which would be about 3-4 months down the line (total time for both). Future wise, even if I pass everything, still have rotations, shelf exams, step 2, step 3 etc. I know it's going to be hard for me to match because of the transfer, and long timeline of events. Hospitals would much rather the choose the student with a proper timeline, than one with family problems and skewed timeline of failures. I don't know if it's worth it to move forward if its a very narrow path to success. I'm only still at the halfway mark that I was few years ago, and that stagnant feeling is hurting me deeply. It’s very hard to avoid social media, where you see classmates moving on with success, but things happen. I know I can be successful one day, but just need some direction. It sounds like several excuses on my end but my parents, siblings, and personal health factored heavily how things have transpired. I know my own worth and I think have what it takes to pass this exam and move forward.
The Caribbean school does not prepare you well at all for the comprehensive exam at the end, rather you figure it out on your own. Thousands of dollars has been invested into my future, which looks like a loss at the moment. Several students have failed out throughout the semesters, but I had no issues and was able to pass and and do well. That’s what gives me hope that I can officially pass this. Another major issue is that since medicine is constantly changing, exam details will also change to a certain extent from the time that I was actually in school. Just trying to get some advice moving forward. Before medical school, I received my bachelor of science in Health Science degree. Now have major doubts moving forward. Do I pursue masters, or go into nursing, or I don’t even know. What are all your thoughts about this, looking for all opinions moving on. Thank you for your time.",06Feb2017,1

269,"Alright this is going to be fairly long. I'll start by giving some background. I'm an 18 y/o male college student living on the west coast. I'm at a decent weight for my height and I like to think that I'm decently attractive. I'm fairly introverted, and don't really have a lot of friends at college, since I'm pretty shy. I have a few friends from high school but that's about it. If I am introduced to someone, I'm generally pretty comfortable talking and being social with them, I just have a hard time going out of my way to make new friends. The girl in question is 19 y/o and is also a freshman in college on the west coast, but in a different state. Anyway, I spend a lot of time playing video games, my favorite at the moment being Overwatch. I have a whole group of friends online, some that I know irl, some not, that I play games with. We all have a Discord server together in which we talk and play games. A while back, a girl we met playing Overwatch brought her friend, the subject of this post, onto the server. Immediately I was infatuated by her voice. I know it's a tendency to be attracted to any girl that happens to play video games, but I genuinely enjoyed talking to her and thought she had a great sense of humor from the beginning. I wasn't sure what she looked like at the time, so I didn't really have a crush on her, I just thought her voice was cute. Eventually though I did find out what she looked like and instantly I had a massive crush on her. As I said before, it's not just because she's a ""gamer girl"", I actually think she's attractive and I love her personality. She has a similar sense of humor to me in that she's not afraid to make edgy jokes, (she watches iDubbbz for fucks sake) but at the same time she's kind of cute and innocent, and I don't know why, but I fucking love it. She has also told me that she's shy and doesn't really have many friends at her university, kind of like me. Anyway, we often play Overwatch and Rocket League together and I get along really well with her (at least I think so). I make her laugh a lot and she makes me laugh. I try to tease her and be more flirtatious with her than with the other girls in the server, but I'm not sure if she notices. On the other hand, almost everyone else in the server knows I have a crush on her and they say they notice that I'm being very flirtatious with her. Either she isn't picking up on it at all, or she is and she doesn't mind it. I would hope for the second one obviously but I don't think that's the case. I play games with her a lot, more than anyone else in the server, because I like talking to her and it seems like she likes talking to me as well. I've also been Snapchatting her for a while now. We have a streak of almost 20 days going. Nothing we send back and forth on Snapchat is really anything special. We just take pictures of random shit and basically talk. I try to send her funny pictures and make jokes if possible rather than just Snapchatting her for the sake of the streak, but honestly I'm not great at using Snapchat. She's totally cool with it and I don't think she minds snapping me, but I don't know how to be flirty. I also gave her some emotional support recently, as one of the guys on the server was being overly pushy with her, offering her gifts and shit and claiming she didn't care about him because she was spending more time talking to other people like me. She was willing to let me talk to her about it, and I tried to be as understanding and helpful as possible, so I hope that goes a long way towards showing that I care about her.  


All of that was mainly for background. I've already decided that at some point I'm going to tell her how I feel but there are a few issues with that.  
1. She is considering moving out of state (not to the state I'm in) to live in an apartment with one of her friends and go to community college there, because she hates the university she's going to.  
2. All of the people on the Discord server, including her and I, are meeting up to go to a convention in July in her home state. This means that I either need to tell her how I feel before the convention, or tell her when we meet in person. Telling her prior to the convention could make things awkward on the server and may ruin my chance to meet her in person if things go horribly wrong. Telling her at the convention however could possibly make part of the trip awkward, and even if she agrees to date me, would render our relationship long distance at best as by that time she would have already finalized her plans to move in with her friend.  
3. A few of the people in the server have said that they are 99% sure she likes another guy on the server, but that he has no interest whatsoever in her. While it's good that he doesn't like her, if it's true that she likes him, she's probably too focused on him to pick up on any hints that I try to give to her.  
4. I'm not sure about this one but I think she may be getting a bit suspicious of when I choose to play games with her. Last night I was playing Rocket League and when I saw she was playing Overwatch, I quickly switched over and joined her group. She said ""I thought you were playing Rocket League"". I said ""I was, but I'm done now"". After that she said ""lol ok"" and we moved on. Our conversation was normal after that (granted, this was all over text chat) but I can't help but feel that maybe she found that a bit suspicious. I don't want to miss an opportunity to talk and play games with her, but I also don't want to make it blatantly obvious that I have a crush on her. Being flirtatious with her is one thing, but if she feels that I'm following whatever she does, she may get creeped out.  


All of this is to say that I don't know what to do next. Do I wait this out and tell her how I feel in July when we meet in person? Do I tell her soon and let her know that I still want to be friends if she rejects me? Do I try to flirt with her more on Snapchat first, and if so, how? Do I attempt to get her number and text her because it's more natural than Snapchat? Is it possible that she would consider dating me - even if she doesn't find me inherently attractive - because of my personality and how nice I've been to her? What sorts of things shouldn't I do if I want this to work out? All these are questions running through my head, because I really don't want to fuck this up. Her personality just fits mine so perfectly in my opinion and she's really pretty too. I didn't even mention that she's an amazing artist which makes her even more attractive in my mind. The thought of her rejecting me, or worse, her liking me but me fucking it up by saying something stupid scares the shit out of me. I know this is a long shot to begin with, but I just feel like if I play my cards right, it could work out. Anyway, any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, because this has really been getting me down lately. I'm not depressed, but I feel a lot happier when I'm talking to her.",06Feb2017,2

273,"I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at a university that I love but there's a serious problem and I have no idea what to do. My university forces students to do 5 co-ops which are full-time jobs where you must be paid and it goes for a semester. To a lot of people, that's pretty cool but I hate it. I have always wanted to run my own company and I've been in the process for the past few months and in fact we're releasing our first product next week. My passion lies in coding and while my co-op is at a tech company all they have me do is run tests, which is mind-numbingly boring. But I honestly hate the corporate world, even if I were doing something more impactful I just won't learn anywhere near as much or make as much progress towards pursuing my dreams as I would if I were spending all of that time on my company.

I want out of this co-op so badly, I wake up every day dreading going to work and I spend most of the day plotting how I can get out of it. My university is incredibly strict about their co-op policy and it's hard to bend their rules. I love my university I have so many friends here and I don't want to switch majors but I might have to if I can't get out of this, because I can't see myself doing this for another 3 months let alone 4 more semesters.

Please understand this isn't out of laziness. I want this time to dedicate towards my own ventures, it's incredibly frustrating to lose 11 hours a day (9 hours working plus commute etc) to something that is a dead end in my eyes.

279,"Long story short, met a woman in college about 6 years ago. Saw her daily for 2 years while she had a boyfriend, dropped out, haven't seen her since. I loved her, I know I did. Since then, I barely kept contact, only contact was initiated by her. Couple times a year, during those times it was a few weeks of contact. Thought I moved on, been with my current girlfriend for 2 years. Cut contact with this other woman. But I could never fully stop thinking about her. I convinced myself for awhile that I hated her or never liked her to begin with, but I always knew that wasnt the case deep down. I still think about her, still haven't met anyone like her. There's just something about her, and I don't know what to do. At times I'm glad we don't talk, other times it kills me. I told her how I felt years ago and that basically started the separation/end of our contact. I feel like if I'd talk to her now it'd be too weird, and what would the point be? I just fucking miss her, so fucking much. What can I do or what do I need to know to help myself? I like to think I live a decent life without her but I've never felt this way about anyone. Not even the woman I've been with for 2 years and that hurts too. It's not like she interferes, because she isn't in the picture but in my mind, every now and then, she emerges and it does this to me. I just need some help.",06Feb2017,1
280,"So I'm currently 19 and studying at university. Last year I met a girl, and although I'm still young it has to be said that I have never met a girl like this before. It's as though something just clicks when we are together and there is definitely sparks between the two of us. I can tell she feels it too as there are often tense but good moments between the two of us, as if we were dating. The issue is she has been dating a guy since a year before I met her. I have only met her boyfriend on a couple of occasions and so can't accurately comment on the state of their relationship, but i know that there is definitely something between us. My question then is, what is the best course of action for myself? Should I tell her my feelings and if so how? Or should I wait things out and hope that the two of them break-up? Many thanks.",06Feb2017,2
281,"I'm noob to snapchat, and I added this girl I've been talking to for weeks.

I wanted to keep the photo to show to look at later, then it sent a ""you took a screenshot notification"" AAAHHHHHHHHH.

I'm so embarrassed, I think she likes me too. 

Ugh, asfasgagaasdas and I told her she was pretty on it too.

I'm such a creep.

282,"So, in my gym class we're doing the mandatory volleyball unit which I often fail horribly at. I really just hit 5 foot and with everyone around me being well over 5 feet, it's difficult to hit the balls soaring over my too short head. I try to hit the ball but its always just out of my reach. My vision is also rather bad but I don't have glasses, not that I would wear them considering how often the ball hits people in the face. I normally wouldn't care but I feel like I'm disappointing my tournament team members, what can I do to improve or at least, to hit the ball?",06Feb2017,1
