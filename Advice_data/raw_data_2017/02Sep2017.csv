1,I got expelled from school today over horse playing and I’m not really sure where to go from here I’m very depressed and I just don’t know what to do from here any advice is welcome btw I had been had the school for 11 years and it was my junior year,02Sep2017,1
5,"I am moving in on Sunday to a new student house and the issue of room allocation has come up, and I don't know how to sort it, while trying to be fair as the first one in. 

Me and one girl are fighting over a room. I originally said I didn't mind to be polite, and she said she liked this one room as she couldn't remember what the other one looked like. I suggested I take photos when I arrived so she could see both, and that I couldn't remember them either, so maybe we should decide then.

I go in, take photos, and say that I'd prefer this room as it's much quieter and I've already told them all I'm a very light sleeper. She says she'd prefer it too. I suggest maybe swapping rooms half way cos then we both get a turn? She agrees.

Thing is I still feel very resentful. She found the flat on the internet, however I had to call them up and organise the viewing as she ""doesn't have a good phone voice"". I then sorted out securing the flat where she had to borrow money from me. I now am the one having to pick up the keys as they are international students, sort out the inventory, internet and bills, plus kitchen supplies, all under my name. I feel like I've had to put a lot of effort in, like I'm mothering (especially as I'm 8 years older). I feel upset that I don't get to pick a room, or that I get any sort of thanks from them. It's my own fault for being too polite. 

What should I do? Or how can I stop feeling angry about it? She moves in two weeks after me. I'm trying to be fair as I don't want to fall out too much when we have to live together, but also to be recognised that I've done everything to sort the flat out.",02Sep2017,1
6,"There's a lot going on in my life right now and I need some serious advice.

The major problem is I'm stuck in a wierd lull of what to do in life. I graduated last year with a degree set up to attend vet school. Long story short, I've talked to more than 5 vets who have discouraged me from applying to vet school because of the cost (~250k+) with some of those loans having 7% interest (Grad Plus) and also because you come out making next to nothing (average in 2015 was about 65k entry level as a veterinarian). Because it was a plan in my head for so long to go, I'm conflicted and getting some outside pressure to attend from friends, mentors, and family. Part of me wants to go still, but another huge part of me fears not only the debt but the long hours (most vets work 50+ hours a week) and the nature of the work and compassion fatigue and social issues with the field. 

ON TOP OF ALL THAT: I'm at that point in my life where I feel so pressured into finding a relationship. I've found myself crushing hard on a married man I work with (but not acting on anything of course) and have been trying desperately to divert my attention to finding someone to date but it's really just a clusterfuck right now. I feel the pressure and need to find someone to date--everyone always says ""When it's meant to be, it'll happen."" But it seems all of my friends are actively dating/married and I need something to take my mind off this crush. 

Ugh, help. I'm crumbling. I feel like a lost middle schooler. ",02Sep2017,1

9,"I am a 15 year old girl who was sexually abused by my brother about 3 years ago and I've had a bedwetting problem since. I thought it would just blow over, but I do it 3-4 times a week and sometimes twice in a night. It's really hard and I don't spend time with friends because of it, I don't sleep at their house and when I have to stay at a siblings house I stay awake the whole night incase I do it.

I get nightmares as well, I have flashbacks, basically I think I may have a form of post traumatic stress disorder. I don't know how to mention this to a doctor, I have a psychiatrist but he has a little bit of a history of not really helping me that well.

11,"My girlfriend and I occasionally share xxx photos and videos with each other and will sext when we have to be apart or just when the mood strikes. She is chronically I'll so it's hard for her to always have the energy and self esteem to feel good about this behavior but I always tell her she looks great and try to be supportive. 

So when I discovered several long videos where she is ""taking care of herself"" and speaking in a much more dominating way than she ever does when making videos for me I began to worry. 

She doesn't know I saw this material but I asked her point blank if she's sending such things to anyone and she said No. she almost never lies, like it's a problem she can't even use an expired coupon cause she feels guilty. 

So I'm seeking rational reasons she would have gone to all this trouble to take dozens of photos and make 3-5 videos all at once and even tho we were texting all day that day and the days after she never sent any of it to me. 

I can understand if the videos perhaps made her self conscious or something but I can't think of any reason she wouldn't have shot one or two of those photos my way in the 3 months since she took them. 

How can I take her word at face value while still wondering about what I saw???
She'll know my behavior is off if this stuff stays on my mind but I asked her a question and got an answer. I need to move on. ",02Sep2017,1

13,"I can get a sweet deal on a 32 inch smart TV. Regular 250, on for 199 with no tax for one day only (tomorrow), and could get a staff discount from my friends mom. I currently use an old tube TV and have to use my very old laptop to watch Netflix on so a big screen HDTV has been on my list for a while now. 

However, I owe money to the government (less than $1000), and have a few unpaid debts. I currently have saved enough to afford this really good deal on a TV at the moment, but am hesitant because I'd feel guilty about not making payments to my already existing debts.

What do you think? Having the ability to watch Netflix and utilize the other perks of a Smart TV would significantly improve my quality of life. Is a nice TV a worthy enough investment that I can splurge right now? I don't go out much, don't treat myself to much besides ordering food in. Or should I pay off my debts first? Have to decide by tomorrow morning, so any input here is greatly appreciated.

14,"I'm a high school senior. I have straight A's and am taking all AP's and college classes. However, I don't act like it. I'm carefree, easygoing, and I like to joke around.

However, since I don't act like a typical smart person, any time I do something ""silly"", many of my classmates start to think I'm dumb.

Right after highschool, I got into a reputable University for a Science Bachelor's degree.

I could go back elsewhere to finish my degree but I fear failing again and my financial situation doesn't agree with that either(Student loan ftw).

46,"I've been home schooled my whole life because my mom is a christian fundamentalist and wanted to shield me from evolution and secular ideas. I have to get each and every book, movie and video game I read/play/watch approved. Anything with sex or too much violence or language or an ""offensive portrayal of Christians"" was vetoed. Only christian music was allowed in the house.

The only social interaction I got with other kids was with my christian cousins, christian kids at home school group that I went to once a week (Don't even get me started on that place, it was full of stay at home moms teaching things they knew nothing about), and christian(Noticing a pastern here?) at church and bible study which I attended three times a week(Church on Sunday, youth group on Wednesday, and bible study on Thursday).

The actual homeschooling wasn't too bad. Basically my mom would buy books that I would study and then take the tests in. Of course, they were all pretty skewed. Science spent a lot of time ""debunking"" evolution and global warming (Which makes the biology I'm taking in public school difficult. I have no knowledge about evolution at all.). History taught that the reason America is such a successful country is because of how awesome Christians were. Somehow they didn't manage to put god into math. I also managed to fit online programming classes into my work.

Working by myself actually taught  me good self discipline and studying habits. The school work is extremely easy because I'm actually being taught by teachers instead of having to just read a book. If I ever had trouble with a specific math problem I would have to go over my whole book looking for how to do it and trying to figure out where I went wrong because my mom doesn't know how to do math.

Right before school started this year my mom and I had a fight and she decided that she wasn't going to home school me any more (This is funny because she never did home school me past when I learned how to read.). You may be thinking that I should have asked to go to public school a lot sooner, but in that situation it's hard to tell what's true or not. Mom would always comment things like ""Look at all the poor public schoolers on the bus. They have to wake up at 5am to get ready for school, and they don't get back home until 4:45. Then when they do get home they have to spend the rest of the day doing homework.""

So basically my problem is since I have been brainwashed for my whole life I have no idea how to interact with people. I don't think I'm a christian, but It's still culture shock. Like, I know in my head that most people don't go to church, but in *my* world *everyone* went to church. In English we were reading Sinners in the hand of an angry God and the teacher kept stressing how this was an hour long sermon but we were just going to read 10 minutes of it. When we had a discussion about it afterwards everyone was saying how they couldn't imagine listening to someone talk for an hour. I was just sitting there thinking that I listen to someone talk about god for an hour three times a week.

I have no idea how to talk to people so I just sit alone at lunch every day reading a book.School now gives me an excuse for the books I want to read so I managed to get 1948 despite the sex.

EDIT: he also said something about her being hyper-sexual... so maybe they've talked about it before too...idk

FINAL EDIT: I confronted her and she took it mostly good and removed him from everywhere right in front of me and understood what I said my boundaries are. She said he was the first friend she's had in a long time and that he was really cool, he was just an idiot and had to keep saying weird stuff like he's trying to hit on her or something after she repeatedly said she didn't have any intentions with him. It bothered her but she wanted a friend. She's been home a lot and I work full time so I get that she gets lonely and just wanted a friend. 
I have no evidence that she herself has talked weirdly back to him.
I told her that if someone is talking like that to her she needs to set boundaries and state then and there, that him and her are not going to be talking like this. If they keep doing it, she needs to keep those boundaries and remove them. Letting it happen feels to me like it's on the fence if not fully crossing a boundary and she seemed like she understood.

It's a school I had to apply to etc... don't get me wrong, I've met people, but the one friend who I met on the first day has basically ditched me for another friend I made, and now they're super close. I have other friends, but none as close, and it  pisses me off. She always follows her around, ignores me, cuts me out of ""the circle"" etc. What do I do?

56,"As the title says, I'm [21F] a rising senior in college and torn as to what the ""right"" decision is when it comes to post-grad plans. My long-term goals are to get my Ph.D and to become a psychologist, which I'm really passionate about, but I'm taking a year or two off before I start applying to programs because it's generally advised to do so. My mom wants me to apply to jobs near my hometown and live at home, which would save me A LOT of money. But at the same time, I feel like this is a time in my life where I'm free to live wherever I want because I want to live there and gain my own independence. 

A little backstory: I ended up going to college very close to my hometown (10 min drive), and although I lived on-campus for all of my time in college, I did frequently see my parents, get help from them, etc. Although I'm incredibly grateful for their support, I feel like I never gained the true independence that my friends who live further away got. Also, at home I still share a room with my younger sister, so when I graduate and find a job, I'll inevitably have to share a space with my 17-year old sister (and my mother, for reasons that are unimportant here). 

All in all, I'm just torn between the logical thing to do (find a job in hometown, live at home, pay off student loans, save for grad school) vs. the experience of being on my own. I'm just looking for people who have experienced a similar situation/have life experience in general maybe to offer a bit of insight. ",02Sep2017,1
57,"So today I had to let someone go because my boss wanted him out of the store, I'm 20 years old and I've only been an assistant manager for about 3 months, in fact I'm still in college :/ The kid was 18 years old just starting school and he had a really bad habit of not doing what he was told and being late, the other day he was a hour late and today I had to fire him because my boss had enough with him, but the reason he made me fire him was because it was his off day and he didn't feel like coming Into the store.

It was my first time doing it and it didn't go well, the kid blew up in my face and stormed out. Not I can't sleep because I feel so bad about this whole thing. I need advice to help me move on.  ",02Sep2017,2
58,My father refuses to drive me home from theatre because all in all he is pretty selfish. I don't want to get into the details but he's always doing this. He doesn't want to drive me the five minutes two and fro from theatre. I want to be an actress after high school and eventually college and my family knows that. That's why theatre is important to me and getting more experience is important to me. It's the only thing that makes me happy and he also knows that. I don't want to give up on it. Would it be smart to buy a bike and ride it to and from school when I have theatre practices? The ride would be 30-40 minutes early in the morning than around like 6:30 in the afternoon when it ends.

59,"I'm a 20(f), live at home with both parents. I just finished my two year degree at local community college. Work at a local grocery store and overall very independent. 
Here's my problem. My dad and I cannot be in a room together for more than 10 minutes without an argument breaking out. He wasn't a bad parent so to speak when I was younger, however he was far from a good one. My dad has been verbally and emotionally (occasionally physically but he is quite a big dude so I've been able to take him out) abusive my entire life. To me, my angel of a mother, and my brother (who moved out at 18 because of my dads unpredictability). From constant belittling, random outbursts of anger directed at us, blaming us for anything and everything, I mean anything that goes wrong is immediately mine or my mothers fault. 
When I was around 10/11 my dad developed a drinking problem - eventually drinking up to 2 gallons of whisky a day. When I graduated high school (16) he made his first trip to rehab, swindled my mom into letting him come home. Started drinking again. Long story short he put us through fucking hell and back (like living in motel 6 for a month cuz he threatened to shoot us and kill our dogs if he came home kinda shit). Anyways my dad is an absolute control freak. Keeps my mom on a TIGHT leash, she doesn't have really any friends doesn't go out without his permission sort of stuff. Today I told him I got a job for a receptionist/secretary at a law office in our town. Eager to share my news with my father he immediately shut me down and says ""why the fuck would you do that? That's a horrible idea. You're going to get fired"" all I said was ""forget I said anything"". Just to try and avoid a fight. I'm tired of fighting with him. I can't do it anymore. Anyway he ended up telling me I'm disrespectful for not listening to him tell me to stay at my current job. I apologized that he didn't think I was making a good decision but advices him that I'm an adult and making a decision based on my best judgement. My dad responds by saying ""you're an ungrateful bitch get the fuck out of my face"". 
This is like a once a week kind of thing that happens. Since he stopped drinking he hasn't been as angry but he's still an absolute lunatic. In my life there have been thousands (no joke) of these kind of situations play out between my father and I. Plus all the fucked up shit he did to my mom and I while he drank which anyone with an alcoholic in their family knows how horrible it can be. 
So here's where I need advice:
im moving out in about a month and trying to decide wether I want to continue to have a relationship with my dad or not. I have to mention that he financially is very well off. He tries to make up for being a piece of shit and giving me a horrible childhood by buying my forgiveness. I know I can be fine without him. I can't take being put down by him anymore... HOWEVER my poor mother is caught in between all this. She has been with my dad since she was 16 (she is 42 now). He has had her on his leash all these years. My mom knows that my dad is an absolute bastard and to be honest I think she hates him just as much as I do. But she can't leave. He won't let her, she tried to the second time he was in rehab and he bought her a new car and gifts to win her back. ""I feel so guilty for what I put you through"" she says. When she didn't do anything. It's all my dad. I don't know what to do when I move out. I love my mom more than life itself and would die for her but I want to cut off my relationship with my dad. Well maybe not cut it off. I don't know. That's why I am here. I need advice on what I need to do with the relationship between me and my father. ",02Sep2017,1
60,"There's this guy in one of my classes that started talking to me, and we had a normal conversation about school, but he asks for my number after two minutes of talking to him. I didn't mean to show him I'm interested in talking more, I was just being polite and friendly. And I didn't want to make anything awkward (it was pouring outside and I couldn't leave if I rejected him), so I gave him my number. And then of course he starts texting me, and again I don't want to make things awkward because we're in the same class, so I respond, hoping that he gets the idea when I take a few days to respond. And very recently he's asking to hang out. I can't seem to say no to people. And I can't lie and say I won't be around after class because I'll be on campus all day. I know I could just go along with him and stop assuming that he's attracted to me, but I'm very shy and anxious and very introverted (even though I don't show it when I speak to strangers for the first time). I'm the type of person that only wants to talk to the same two or three people. Spending time with strangers is terrifying for me (especially if they're men, I've just rarely had good experiences with men in my life). But I don't know how to say no.

64,"So I'm 14 and in foster care, I've been with my carer for 3 years now and i've never been 100% happy but I just thought that was normal. Her daughter and grand-kids have moved in (they've moved in and left many times, but now it's permanent) ever since then it's gone downhill much more. About a month ago my carer said that I was being moody and slamming doors and she's sick of it, when in reality I haven't. To be honest I'm super scared to, I'm scared that if I even accidentally slam a door she'll have a go at me. Anyway she then finished it with ""My family is more important to me, I can't be expected to help someone who isn't even related to me. I'm ringing up DOCS tomorrow and telling them I want to quit, if they say 'no I can't' then I will for real' Then she left it at that. It really effected me, whenever I try and say my point, she ignores me. 
*
Last night we  were having dinner, her daughter and grand-kids were out, she asked if I wanted to go horse riding tomorrow because (friends mums name) said that I can go to her house after riding. I said I'm really tired and just going to have an easy day tomorrow and I have homework to do.  She slightly got angry and said ""if  (caseworker name) asks why you're not doing it, tell her yourself. I'm sick of you committing to things and then saying your tired or something else"" 
This annoyed me but I just nodded my head. I have never missed horse riding before, I love it. I needed the sleep because I fell asleep in school that day. I was sad that I'd be missing it but I knew I need sleep.  The week before I missed horse riding because her grand-kids had football and I didn't want her to miss it and she was going to have to if I went to horse riding (she'd have to leave early to pick me up) 
Then later on in the night while I was wiping the dishes she said to me ""(Friends mums name) texted me saying (friends name) said that you told her that you were bummed and I wasn't letting you go to horse riding,"" I said no I didn't and she ignored me and then said ""You're being so manipulative, the boys football comes first. They were here first. I am so close to spitting the dummy"" I agreed that the boys come first.
Whenever she has a go at me she always says she's going to give me up, spit the dummy, or call DOCS.

**please note** 
* I have always made sure horse riding doesn't get in the way of football.
 
* I do all my chores- clean room, offer to cook, do chores, walk my dog, clean in general. 

* I'm a good kid. 

I feel like I'm being treated so unfairly. 

* The boys don't clean, cook, they don't have chores. (They're 11 &amp; 12) and they get so much love from my carer. 

* When I ask for a hug she sighs and says shes busy. 

* If I need her to repeat instructions she gets annoyed (I can't help it, I have a learning disorder) 

* I never slam my door, good grades. I do everything I can to stay in her good books but she keeps pointing things out. I don't think I am manipulative. 

* We never go anywhere, I mean anywhere. The only time I get out of the house is school. (We live on a farm, 5 minutes from town) 

If i ask her to take me to a friends house she says yes but later on uses it against me saying stuff like 
- You expect too much
- Ungrateful
- I do so much for you 

*I no longer ask her to go anywhere because I know she'll use it against me. I get paranoid if I even drop a bowl on the bench because I'm scared she'll get angry at me.


* I can't move back to my mums cause she passed away and I don't know my dad, I have an older brother but he's disabled. 
I have a dog and I'm scared if I move the new carer won't let me take her.
I want to move, but I'm scared if I tell my caseworker then she'll make my carer and I talk it out, and I just couldn't. I can't trust any of my friends because if I tell them any of this I'm scared my carer will find out and she'll have a go at me. 

I just want to know if my feelings are valid and if she should treat me like this? Please I'm really confused and stressed about it.

66,"I work at my family's company, about 6 years now, that does wine sales. I've recently taken over essentially running all day to day operations after we decided to shrink our management structure. 

As such, I've taken over managing 10 employees who work in our small office. I have one employee that is continually about half an hour late about 3 out of 5 days a week. I've spoken to him about this on a peer level, things like ""Hey Brian, you gotta stop coming in late"", ""you've got to make it here on time. I know your commute is long but it's unfair to the other reps (sales reps)"".

He is always very apologetic but nothing changes. We technically have a write up warning system where I could write him up several times and then he would be subject to a firing. However he is one of our best sales people and knows this. 

Our previous manager whose position I've filled had tried this in the past, and the late rep called his bluff, knowing we wouldn't fire him. We did not fire him and basically have allowed this behavior for 2/3 years. The usual just ""hey man late again, be on time"". We do take the half ours out of his vacation/sick time. 

In kind of a bind, not sure how to fix this. I do not want to fire him as good sales people are extremely hard to find, and he is a great employee otherwise. But he is undermining my authority and what is required of him. Any thoughts or questions, lay them on me.

72,"Reddit is probably the last place I really want to ask anyone for help, but I'm grasping at straws. I don't know where to go from here, though the direction I'm headed feels wrong.


Here's a rundown of my life:
I'm 22, soon 23. Transfemale, MtF.
2015, I lost my best friend and soon to be fiance. It could have been due to aging and maturation, but personally I blame her depression and unemployment, and my lack of attention at home. I spent most of my time at work to try and cover the bills, and often buried myself in games to cope with the stress. I'd say I regret it, but she turned out to be kind of a lousy person anyhow.


My truck broke down, kind of a blessing, as it killed my finances. Father offered to help with the loan payments on a used vehicle. Great little Ford Focus. Loved little Scylla. Totaled her two months later.


Family helped me find a new vehicle - Ford Fiesta - Beatrix. Okay, baseline model, cheap, affordable, can't complain, but the loan is my problem now. No help there. Dad's vanished now, and Mom's across the country helping my sister.


A year ensues of me struggling to get back on my feet, self harm, being drunk, nearly flunking out of school... Then I move back in with family, land a decent job and graduate with some BS associates degree. Moved an hour away from home.


Quit the job six months later to move to Uni in attempts to further my education, just to find out how useless my AS was, depression kicked in high gear and I wasted 13k on a year of school with nothing to show. 


In that time, dated a couple people, really fell for someone across the country... We met, had a great time. She returned home and said she was spending time with family, but we hardly spoke for at least three weeks... I'll admit, I have some attachment issues, but I was more or less pissed. I said some hurtful things, and she didn't exactly do much to reconcile the feelings... All in all, things broke off. Found out not too long ago that she fell for and moved in with two guys. I'm not sure what hurts me more, that she moved on so quickly, or that she found a couple she could be happy with when I struggle to find anyone that doesn't look at me like a machine? I've moved on and reconciled with my attachment issues and have recently learned to become my own person, despite how much I hate isolating myself from people. All I've ever wanted was to belong to someone(s).


Being at Uni hasn't helped me any. I'm in counseling. He tries to help me by what appears to be psychoanalysis - questioning my thought processes and getting down to why I think what I do. That's great.. but I don't want to understand why I think the way I do. Words have never helped, action has always been my solution... I tolerate it however, because I'm not always right, and maybe it will help? I feel momentarily better... but the only real thing that I've accomplished is moving a little further in my transition.


So here I sit today, 30k in debt at 22, working full time and then some, as well as Lyft/Uber on the side. I sleep maybe four hours a day and I have to cram school into that schedule somewhere. I keep trying to save up money for medical expenses, but every time I get anywhere, unexpected expenses knock out everything. I can't even manage an emergency savings. I'm in school for Computer Systems Engineering, and sure that'll make me some big money one day... But what about now?


I missed out on teenage things because I was a shut in and devoted my time to video games and some internet heart break... I'm afraid of losing my 20s trying to stay afloat and fight for my goals... And for that matter, I don't want to finally garner the money to complete my transition at 35! It... I don't know if it would really mean anything to me at that point. Maybe it's shallow, but I want to enjoy being pretty for a little bit, and maybe it's because I'm young, but... I feel like at 35 and beyond, there really isn't any reason to focus on outward beauty, as it seems anyone worth while wants what's inside. Maybe I just want to feel attractive. 


I'm scared of losing my 30s to my career, finally completing school, and seeing as I had no life then, find that I have nowhere else to go but work yet, and what happens when I'm 40? Will I even have a chance to start a family anymore? I hardly even know mine. I want to be loved, I want to be cared for..


I'm not a brutish type, I feel I'm kind and considerate where i can be, but I know I'm a bit of an absurdity in how I think and act. I'm very blunt and forward. I don't care to dance around a problem or 
trade gossip. I'm a very results driven person, and maybe that's off putting to most people? I've been told I move and act very much like a soldier.. and at first I admired that, but the longer I thought... It's not something I'm sure I can be proud of anymore. As I said before, I come across as a machine.. I'm also this androgynous vaguely feminine with some mild curves, and a kind of square face, save for the stupidly large breast forms I wear (apparently they fit my frame very well). I'm kind of square- less in a masculine appearance, but how I hold my body, strong, tall, forward... Ready to take on the world, is it too intimidating to people?


I have four friends that I love to death, and four friends that I'd dearly call my own. I can't turn to them... I'm their rock, their grounding post. I'm the most stable among them (less unstable, that is), and any time I've turned to them, the conversation turns into their own self inflicted insecurities and I'm forced to bail them out or risk damaging the very few human relationships I have...


What do I do? Am I asking too much?


TL:DR;
I hate myself and everything I've worked for. I work day in and day out just to scrape by. I know it will end eventually, but at what cost?


Also, a little humor to quiet my tears.

~wake me up inside, before I come undone~

76,"Hi guys. I have an Indian friend who gets regularly shat on by her parents for her weight and for her 'lack of success', despite the fact that she does science competitions all the time. She tends to fall for guys very easily, which is usually just amusing and melodramatic. But around seven months back, she got a crush on this guy at our school for being smart and friendly. They've never spoken or anything. Which is okay and all, but in recent days, she's been telling me that she thinks she likes all these guys because she desperately wants a choice in who she loves.

I was really ignorant at first, but after quite a bit of research I found out that apparently, arranged marriages are still a thing for Indians. Even if they're in the States. My friend's parents have already told her that she's going to have an arranged marriage when she's older, no ifs, no buts. And if she doesn't it'll bring 'shame' and they'll do something bad to themselves in retaliation. All my friend wants is to choose. That can't possibly be too much to ask for, but apparently, it is.

I could rant about how frustratingly unfair this is for paragraphs. But right now, I need to know - is there any possible way for her to get out of this? I can't stand just telling her ""yeah, that's your fate now, you happened to be the one born with this shitty freedomless life, deal with it"", because she deserves better than any of that.",02Sep2017,1

I'll be honest up front. My husband was debatably verbally/emotionally abusive before but not on this scale. I feel it probably contributed to my actions: i cheated on him- but I will not blame my marriage or actions on the way he made me feel. I chose to make a very poor selfish choice and am now paying the consequences of it. 

It's been almost a year since he found it/I admitted it. We went to counseling. I grew, I thought we were moving forward positively albeit slowly. We got pregnant with our third child (probably dumb.. got it) I'm now 9 months pregnant and the abuse is only getting worse. Every tiny thing I do is terrible. 

He has threatened to take my kids if I leave, to ruin my career and life, and tonight told me that when he looks at me he hates me and if he has to be miserable then I do too and have to suck it up (I was trying to ask him to not scream at me and just talk to me). When he gets mad he calls me a cunt and a whore. 

I don't know what to do. I want to be a better person I want to be a good wife and mother but it's proving increasingly impossible. I asked him tonight to treat me with some human decency and he refused because of my actions. It appears nothing I do will be enough and even tho I want to do anything and everything to save my marriage and family and make it as right as I can (I know it won't ever be 100%) I am starting to think that there is only so much abuse people should be willing to take. 

TLDR: I fucked up and was unfaithful in my marriage, SO found out, we are working through, but lately he has been extremely verbally and emotionally abusive to me and makes me cry almost every day (while 9 months pregnant).

I noticed i didnt get along with these girls, but i didnt want to give up. I wanted all those new friends and go to all those parties. I visited 3 groups, 1 didnt like at all, the other was okay, the girls were kinda nice but they were very different, and the 3rd one were the kind of girls who were like me (but they were the popular group) , but we didnt click. Anyway, i felt soo bad cause everyone had a wonderfull time and i did not. So when we supposed to give our list. The 3rd was my first choice, the 2nd group my second choice and the firsr my 3rd. One week later i got a call that my number 1 and 3 group didnt want me and the 2nd wanted to give me a chance. Before i go on, u should know this. My studenttutor, this guy, his girlfriend was in the popular group (the one i listed as my number 1) and he'd ask me all the time how it was and if i found a group. He then heard from his gf that their group didnt like me. Next day he asked me if i already knew which other group i liked and what i would do now. I was so ashamed so i told him a lie:I told him that recently my aunt got cancer and thats why i quit.(i really did quit)  (I cried while saying this, and the reason i could cry is that my aunt actually died from cancer 2 years ago, so every time my studenttutor started anout it, i just thought of her). My studenttutor, his gf and me, we all study the same course. And my study has a meeting every month, but its more like a party with free alcohol.

To clarify, Y hasn't told me but I'm sure he wouldn't mind telling if given the opportunity. Were all seniors in college, some academic stress but not really, pretty stressful in the past though.  Good social life and no drug abuse or known stressors. I believe Y is seeing a counselor now.

86,"Recently my mother and I have not been getting along. It all started a few days ago. It is my job to do the dishes at home so after dinner one night I cleaned the kitchen spotless and had put up the food and started the dishwasher. My mom then asks as soon as I'm done if I will make her lunch. I have no problem making her lunch but I got annoyed because now I have to get out the food and re-wipe the counters. She notices that I'm annoyed and walks away saying ""wow, I can tell when you don't want to do something""
Over the next two days she has been giving me the silent treatment on and off, and the issue escalated this morning. I told her that I was getting school supplies but my bank account balance was low so she gave me her debit card to buy them. (I'm 20 years old and my parents still help me financially, and I am grateful for it, but they don't do everything for me anymore because I have a job). She then proceeds to curse me out and say how much she does for me and that she didn't appreciate my attitude when she asked me to make her lunch.
     I then try to explain to her that it wasn't the lunch, I was just annoyed because I had *just* finished cleaning the kitchen. She then called me a ""fucked up kid"" and threatened to harm me physically and financially cut me off if I did something like that again. Finally she said that she doesn't forgive me for my actions previously.
I'm at a lost of what to do, should I confront her or is it even worth it? She forgives my brothers so easily over much worse things they have done, (Like getting expelled, yelling in her face).
She also is very careless and hurtful with her words and actions and in the past when she's apologized I have forgiven her every time so I am really angry that she is not forgiving me over this simple matter.
Am I wrong? What should I do?
Side note: my ""attitude"" that I had did NOT involve rolling my eyes, being verbally disrespectful or slamming anything like that. I also made her lunch exactly as she asked.

97,"Please help me exact revenge on these people. The more of their lives I destroy the better.

I got a job at a sushi restaurant &amp; when I started working there I immediately noticed that our bosses were “cheap,” to say the least. The owners are this awful married couple but I’d only ever interacted with the female witch.

Cheap as in “will have only 1 waitress working the whole 5 hour lunch shift by herself in a 15 seat restaurant taking phone calls, preparing food, &amp; taking orders at the same time.” 
Cheap as in “hey look your paycheque for the last 2 weeks is 20$!” 
Cheap as in “oh you do overtime every day but we don’t pay you.”
Cheap as in the other waitresses are constantly telling you to keep tight track of your own hours to ensure that you’re getting paid the right amount or the bosses with undercut you.
Cheap as in “we’re going to use the company name to get cheaper car deals &amp; say we use it for deliveries even when we don’t.”
Also it's probably important to note that when the health inspector shows up, our boss runs around the kitchen yelling “HIDE THIS HIDE THIS.”

So 11 shifts into my time there, comes the fateful day of the Party Tray Incident. A woman called in ordering two party trays. I confirmed with her three times if the tray she wanted was “Party Tray T” &amp; she said yes, so the liability is off me, as I’d like to think. I get an angry phone call from my boss about how I put in the wrong order &amp; that she actually wanted Party Tray P. Amazing. She goes on &amp; on about how angry everyone was, how confused the other waitresses working the dinner shift were, how angry the chefs were for preparing two large trays of sushi only to find out it’s the wrong one, how everyone was upset. She told me the cost of the trays ($150) was coming out of my paycheque.
Later, the other waitresses told me that the woman actually felt really bad about the mistake so she actually bought one of the trays. My boss was trying to charge me double. 75$ more than necessary. Still 150$ more than legal.
In short, I find the BC Labor Laws detailing the illegality so I tell her this &amp; the next day she’s all “oh the point wasn’t to make you pay” even though it totally was. She was real gung-ho about telling me how she was going to take it off my next paycheque. She talks it through as though she would let the mistake slide this time but next time I was going to be let go.

That night I receive an email, addressed to someone who’s name looks very very similar to mine but wasn’t mine (because they didn’t even double check the spelling of my name), telling me that I didn’t need to come in to work tomorrow. I essentially got fired. Or maybe it wasn’t even me, who knows, definitely didn’t spell my name right.
That night I also learned from the other waitresses that the other boss once physically kicked—physically—kicked her in the restaurant. The others have had to pay for till shortages. One of the girls even checks the invoices for company purchases. And she’s a waitress. A waitress. The waitresses also prepare the food. The chefs don’t finish making the food or putting the toppings, the waitresses do. One of them told me the bosses go for 5 vacations a year, yet easily underpay us &amp; literally try to find reasons to steal our money. Shortly after I left, the witch tried to make everyone pool their tips together to be paid out twice a month by seniority, not how much you worked. She also tried to take a cut of those, too.
When I told the rest of the waitresses what had happened to me in my situation, a lot of them actually put in their two weeks. A lot of them are still there, however, &amp; I really want to tell them to find different jobs because it’s not worth staying at a place that constantly tries to rob you.
How do I take this place down? I’m pretty sure I’m not eligible to file for unlawful acts because I most technically did not get deducted before I got fired but I can’t let the other poor naïve souls work there &amp; let them get stepped all over. No one should ever have to work with people like that &amp; no one should be supporting an establishment that behaves this way. I’ve been pondering what to do about this for months now but I think there’s just no solution at this point. Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR my boss needs chill the fuck out &amp; stop stealing money from her employees in various creative ways so I need help taking the restaurant down to save my fellow waitresses.

98,"So I've been working at a family friends company for a year now and we've always got along great. The way it works is the boss texts me wherever there's work for me and his son will pick me up. One day I waited for 30 mins and no one picked me up. I figured it's not worth my time to come in if no one wanted to pick me up. The next day my boss sends me a text saying he forgot to tell me I was off and that he's sorry. This was the first time it happened in the 10 months I've been working for him so it was no big deal. 

Now here is where things get frustrating. I was sick for a few days while I was off and my boss had to tell my Dad to ask me if I wanted to come in that day instead of the next but unfortunately I was still stuck in bed so I couldn't and he was cool with it (if anyone is sick he doesn't care how long or often you are away because there's too much to get done and falling behind is killer). I woke up a little late the next day, checked my phone and seen his son had sent me 4 nasty texts about how he waited 30 mins for me and that I wasted his time when he could have been working. I told him that his dad told my dad I was off then he said I shouldn't have to rely on the boss telling me when there's work. This is what got me frustrated. I asked my dad since he's always up when I go to work if someone knocked on the door or honked the horn and he said no. We got into a bit of a text war but after seeing he'd never admit to being wrong I just ignored my phone and moved on with my day. I was supposed to work the next day as well but again he didn't pick me up (I assumed because I called him out on his bs). 

I was off for about two weeks before his dad said there was work the next day. Again I waited and again no one showed up. I could have texted him to pick me up but after waiting 30 mins I figured he never came to the door if I wasn't ready why should I tell him to come get me if he's not here. It's been a full month since I've got a text from them as well as my dad even talking to them. My boss isn't the kind of guy to leave you hanging like this. He legit tells it to your face if you're gone I've seen it so many times when we were under staffed, guys just getting kicked out left and right because they don't know how to do the job. I haven't received a letter in the mail saying I ""abandoned employment"" like most places do and to top it off I still have his equipment that he lets me use and hasn't asked or came by to get it. The thing that's making me worry is my email for our timesheet no longer works (that or I'm not guessing the right pw) and I can't even reset my password. He did make my account with my email and I just changed the password when I first started the job. What do you guys think, have I been fired? If so why has nothing come in the mail or him not even tell me? I guess I probably should have texted him a few weeks ago to see if anything was ready but then I remembered he was off for a full year in 2015 because there was no work. I don't even know what the schedule looks like either since he just tells me when to come in. I really hope I didn't get fired because it took me 3 years and endless interviews to get a job just to luck out with a family friends company that was a blast to work for.

EDIT: I forgot to mention two things. I still get emails from the time sheet site to submit my hours for the day so the email is still active. The text my boss sent me after being off for two weeks it almost looks like he didn't get my messages: ""Heads up there's work tomorrow afternoon"" Ok. ""Hey do you want to work tomorrow afternoon??"" Yeah I said ok. He claims he didn't get those messages.",02Sep2017,1

He texted me today asking if we could have sex again and I said no and he said lol but we agreed on having sex so I wouldn't tell. That's not at all what was agreed.

102,"I was in this group chat for a few months now online, recently things started to get odd with the leaders of it accusing people of lying about their lives and flipping out on them. 

Last night I was in the ER for a couple ear infections and stomach pain. Right away they accused me of lying and removed me from the group...which was fine and dandy with me because I was gonna leave it soon anyway. 

Then things take a turn for the worst as the night goes on. They message me all night...while I'm laid up in the hospital mind you and start calling me all sorts of nasty names. Ok fine, that's what the block button is for. Then they blow up my cell phone. Block again. This is STILL going on now 12 hours later. I had to delete the group chat app because just fuck that shit I have worse things to deal with right now. 

These people CALL THE HOSPITAL to try to contact me. I say no way and they take this as another sign of me lying. 

Then things seem to die down until a few hours later, they MESSAGE MY MOTHER on Facebook calling  me a phoney and a liar and how they want to ""help me"" or whatever....ok...you wanna help me after calling me names for half a damn day while I'm sick in the hospital. 

I block all of them on Facebook and set my Facebook to super private. But my mom doesn't really have the best relationship with me and I didn't even want her knowing I was in the hospital. They are still currently making new profiles and trying to find multiple ways to contact me. Messaging my mom saying they're ""concerned for me and devastated I lied to the for months and schemed against them."" Now my mom is questioning me, and won't block them. 

I reported them but I can't think of any other way to get this to stop.they just won't let up. I haven't responded to them since this all started because...I'm sick as fuck, my husband is sick as fuck, and we are bedridden. And because just fuck them.

103,"I've been talking to this guy online as a friend for over a year, and in the past couple of months we kind of stepped up our game and been chatting non-stop all day, whenever we can. If we aren't gaming together we are using something to continue our conversation. I noticed that we were really connecting and getting along, we even exchanged phone numbers and had a few phone calls which were amazing having that one on one time. 

Then a few weeks ago his whole attitude changed, it's almost as if he is forcing himself to talk to me and the way he was treating me before seems to be nonexistent. I have tried talking to him to find out and it's stress or he has been busy with things, which I understand. I tried giving some space and not reaching out as often but still remains unchanged. 

Then three days ago we were casually talking still trying to give him space and the next thing I know he is calling me, cool np, I pick up and he's back to the old him super sweet, genuine, caring about my day and just talking my ear off. I was loving every minute of it and it leads to us having some naughty talk, we do our thing, chat for a bit more he says night and we hang up. 

After that night his attitude went back to treating me as if I was nonexistent again. I tried again to bring it up and it's the same thing busy, stress, lots of things to do. I'm so confused and heartbroken, I really care about him and we have a connection, but this lately has just been bringing me down. I'm trying to be understanding and I've tried talking to them multiple times. Should I just give more space? Should I just enjoy the time he will give me and be happy with that? I feel like something is going on and he isn't telling me. I'm not sure if it's to not worry me, but what he's doing now hurts. 

What else can I try?  We live in the same state only a couple of hours away from each other. Do you think I should offer to drive and see them? Invite them to come see me? Maybe having the irl connection will help or am I wasting my time?  Any advice would be helpful. ",02Sep2017,1

After a few months of trying for a baby I went to the doctor with my wife to see if something was wrong and the doctor gave us the news that I am infertile. The ride home was silent and very tense. I've wanted this for a long time and I teared up a bit and I told my wife I'm sorry and that I feel so shitty about this. She didn't respond for a moment and then started screaming at me telling me how worthless of a man and how much of a nothing I am and how pathetic I am. She then proceeded to attack me. She slapped and scratched me. I had to pull over or I would have gotten into an accident. All I could have done was try and protect my face I wouldn't lie a hand on her. She stopped and cried and then I drove us home. She then told me if I told anyone that she hit me and attacked me (I have a busted lip and scratches on my face) she will say it was self defense and say I beat her to my family. She's hit me in the past but it wasn't like this it was a slap here and there.

UPDATE: hey everyone. Thank you all so much for the support and replies. Being in this situation is rough but I'm glad that you guys are being so kind to me. She wouldn't let me go to work today because of my scratches (I work in construction and get up early). I called in and she tried to ""make it up to me"" by having sex with me. I told her I wasn't really in the mood and she flipped out. I really don't understand what's gotten into her but she's like possessed or something. She was throwing dishes at me and said she wants out and that I'm nothing she wants anymore. 

This is really a mess. My moms kinda all I have left and I called her and told her what's been going on and she said I should get a divorce and stuff and it really broke my moms heart and I feel guilty now that I have to put her thru this. 

The real cherry on top though isn't all of this mess, it's that while she was throwing her tantrum I went into the bathroom and locked the door to just get away. I had my suspicions but she's been sleeping with another man according to these texts and there's one point in their conversations where they talk about how she's blackmailing me and he said it's wrong and she should just leave me.

How couldn't he of thought about me right before he kissed her, why wasn't he thinking of me? He did tell me he had doubts and worries before he got with someone else but he said it has made him realize how certain he is that he wants to be with me. Part of me genuinely believes he does want me, but a part of me believes he's only feeling guilty at the minute and it will probably wear off, meaning he might cheat again? We've only been together over 2 months and it was pretty much the first time I properly went on holiday, so it's going to take so much for me to be able to trust him again, but I do think he will learn from this mistake and not do it again because I know what type of person he is and he knows that if he ever did it again I wouldn't even consider staying with him. I've been with him
through some of the hardest points in his life, and I know that when he's hurt he is genuinely hurt, and I can see it in his eyes when he apologizes to me.

113,"Wonder what the heck you are doing in life? Wonder why opportunity is so scarce in your area? How about living day to day wondering wow I have 3 months to get on my own or else I'm homeless? My name is Austin Johnson and I am 19 years old from South Central Pennsylvania and I am writing this post in a means to figure out how I can live my life to the fullest. All my life one thing has attracted me to continue living and that is social interaction with others. Something about being able to have heart to heart conversations with genuine people is something I struggle to find. I feel as if due to my past history of depression, stress anxiety, and suicidal thoughts has impacted me heavily on how my mind takes stuff on a day to day basis. I treat everyone except my family with respect and I am confused why I can't just ""Snap out of it"" I really dislike the use of Anti-Depressants because of bad experiences in the past with them. I'm drug free and I can't even drink because obviously as stated before I am 19 years old. I've had 2 jobs with one being McDonalds and the other being Rutters (Gas station) and I left both jobs based on 1 thing and that was pay. Sure you'd think 11.50$ an hour working third shift is great, but the catch to that is how it impacts your mental health and most importantly your physical health. Graduating high school with average grades of a C+ I wonder ""Huh? Why did I not value education ?"" I'm pretty good at writing and I love playing video games in my spare time. Sure it might not be the most healthy hobby, but when you have barely any money it's a decent way to burn time. I have no license, no job, and no idea with what I want in life. I am a minimalist so I don't really require a lot in life. Simple things for me would be internet, a car, nice clothing (not that hype beast crap) and potentially a family one day. I didn't go off to college or a tech school do to my worry about debt and also the fact that school ""Just isn't for me"" I mean I hated Computer programming even though I love computers. I am not looking for pity, but I will give you background knowledge on my life. I was brought up in York, Pennsylvania growing up I don't remember much of my childhood other then that my mom wasn't in a good place thus leading up to a divorce. I remember the decent times with my 1st step mom who actually helped us in school and what not and we treated her like shit. Genuinely the times I had with my step mom (1st) were usually quite positive, but relationships don't always go to plan. Once she left the picture we didn't know what to do mentally I was seeing therapists and I didn't really feel like the therapy helped me. Speed up to about the end of middle school is when shit really hit the fan. Grades dropped and depression set in, people were harassing me and what not, but then again school tends to be shitty when you don't fit into certain groups. I would've have considered myself an outcast, but just the type of guy who didn't mind if you sat at my lunch table as long as you either didn't shit talk me or that you needed friendship. In high school I learned that I appreciated talking to awkward students even though they weren't my ""Ideal group of people"" I still appreciated them as individuals. I was an emotional ball of sadness, anger and rage at this point. I am not good at remembering dates of certain events although I do remember key life lessons I learned throughout highschool. 1. Get involved in a group or sports 2. Don't try and be something you aren't. 3. Don't let the things others say about you bring you down. Other then what I've mentioned high school was somewhat hell, but it was the escape from bullshit at home. Dad works as a pipe foreman so he is always tired when he gets home. The type of dad that doesn't really talk to you when good things happen, but usually will speak to you when he is angry or wants things done. I give my dad a lot of shit, but when he works that job he doesn't have time to really be an ideal father.I know he works his ass off, but his brother works as a mechanic for the same company and he manages to raise 3 of my cousins without their mother (That's another story, but it was mental issues) My cousins from my dads brother seem to be in decent standing. My mom however was addicted to Narcotics and I found out she was doing heroine only about 2 months ago (She's recovered) but these are a couple things that catalyst'd to where I am now. I went to Florida for 3 months to visit my Uncle and I hated it. The goal was to visit family and enjoy their company and he was up my ass about getting work while I was down there? That wasn't the point of being down there. He was raised to try and piss people off and if you get mad at him he just shuts you down and you have no say.

116,"I took this class long time ago and didn't get a passing grade. This class required heavy writings but there was no descriptions about writing when I registered the class. The class didn't even require the college English class to enroll. My English is like an elementary student level.. especially the time I took the class, I just moved to U.S. with my family, it was horrible and I could not get a passing grade. 

Now, I need to retake the class to get a passing grade to graduate, but the class kept cancelled due to the low enrollment. This time only 1 student enrolled the class and got cancelled by department again. I guess it was only me. Anyway I waited for 2 years but the class never opened. It is really frustrating. I tried to talk with professor about this issue, but he never emailed me back. I even went to his office several times during his office hour but he was never there.


I talked with the department recently and they allowed me to withdrawal the class only if my instructor gives me a permission. So, I waited for him in front of his class for 2 hours to talk with him. (I knew he wouldn't answer my email already) He said he would give me permission. Now, only thing that he needs to do is emailing to the department. But he is not answering my email again and not even department....
I'm so worried that he might have changed mind already. I want to graduate and move forward. Want to go back to my country after finishing this school...

Please give me any advice. Should I wait for him in front of his class again..? should I email him one more time..?

She's been talking about giving it up when she has panic attacks but I've managed to get her through it most of the time. At first I thought it was depression but apparently she's been diagnosed with a stress reaction disorder. And the doctors said that the medication she would be getting prevented self harm and suicidal thoughts.

I've been pretty calm when she has waves of depression/stress. Most of the time me and my other internet friend do a good job of calming her down. But... we're so close to getting her help. But her waves have been more severe lately. Or she's just opening up even more. She's thinking on running away, and maybe killing herself while doing it.

How do I assure her that she can get through it?
I've been trying to have her embrace waves. Like having her think ""it's a thing hat happens and I have to react accordingly""

119,"Hello everyone. I'm new to reddit so if I ever violated any of the rules, I'm really sorry. 

Just to give you guys a clue about my background, I'm Asian and our culture here is that we can stay with our parents until we want or even if we want to leave (for independence or whatever reason), we should ask for our parents' permission first and if they don't want us to leave, we can't. It's like that ever since. There's nothing new about that. Hence, they are the ones who pay for our education even in graduate studies.

So, I just graduated from college last April 2017. I already asked my mom if I could work first because IDK. I just dont wanna study again yet. And I wanted to help with the expenses by paying for my own tuition fees if I were to take up law studies. My father is the sole provider in our home and I have 3 other sisters still studying (my father also pays for their studies). To cut it short, my mom and I had a huge fight. It happened last May I guess. So I just shut up and enrolled this June for law studies wherein I was accepted by a state university. Classes started in June and I really really had a problem with keeping up with the lessons. Not that it's hard for me (my pre-law course was related to law so it has given me a heads up to what lessons in law would be) but because I really wasn't ready to study again yet. My best friend in college named Lyanna is also experiencing the same problem but the difference is, she was allowed by her mom to work simultaneously while studying law. However, she realized she wasn't ready yet for law school too. Her mother also did'nt allow her to stop from studying. She studies in a different university so we weren't together. Lately, we were talking about dropping out and getting together in the same law school next school year (2018-2019) and me being a working student as well but I really don't know if my mother would let me. My whole family pressures me to be a lawyer soon and not to waste any more time (even my sisters). I have no one to confide except my friends. Knowing my mom, she'll just scold me again and she doesn't even believe in psychology (when my sister suffered from depression, my mom just scolded her) so she won't understand that I just want to take a rest, even just for a while, from studying. Last week, I wanted to test her reactions so I told her my best friend wanted to drop out from law school just for now and her mother didn't let her. My mother said ""why would she even drop out if they can afford it? There's no reason to drop out at all anyway."" So yeah, you get it. My ""unreadiness"" also reflected on my grades already and I haven't told my mom yet as she would be furious if she would know. Any advice? I really cant say it to my mom knowing what her reactions would be :(",02Sep2017,1

126,"My best friend was in an awful long-term relationship. He was trapped, in a sense. They lived together and she was emotionally unstable, so he was afraid if he broke things that she would do something to herself.
We developed feelings for each other and I was a complete jerk and ended up cheating with him, many times. Finally, one day I cracked and very loudly explained to him how awful he was treating her and what he was doing was so much worse than just breaking things off. I told him I could no longer be friends with him or have anything to do with him because it hurt too much, so we stopped speaking.
He was devastated. He spoke with my friend a few times asking them to ""put in a good word"" and tell me how sorry he is.
Finally, a month later he contacted me and told me loosing me is his biggest regret of his life. That he ended things with his girl friend and had moved out. That he is so sorry and would do anything to have me back in his life. I told him no and that I was done forever.
Six months passed and I still could not get him out of my head. I was in constant pain and I realized after ending things all those months ago that I was completely in love with him.
Then, he called me. He told me that he couldn't stop thinking about me. He told me that he's in love with me and wants to be with me forever; words I never thought would come out of his mouth.
Now I am wondering if I can trust him. I know that things with me are COMPLETELY different than they were with his previous girl friend. I truly believe that he does love me. However, I can't get the fear out of my head that eventually things would change and he will do to me what he did to her. I don't know if I could take loosing him again. The first time broke me more than anything ever has and if anything happened and we did have to part ways again I know that I would never fully recover, but I don't know if that is reason enough to not give it a shot. 
He has told me repeatedly that he is in love with me and would never do something like that and that nothing is worth ruining what we have together, but I still can't get the idea out of my head that it could happen with us.
I don't know how to fix the trust or if trust is even a possibility.
Is it worth giving it a shot? Is he worth giving a second chance? Is the possible agony of loosing him again worth trying? I know that if I could trust him we would be great together, everything we want in life matches perfectly. I just don't know if we could ever get there.

Side note: We would be long distance for a year until he finishes school. So that worries me as well.

*What is the problem:*

I am 20 years old. My mom doesn't: let me go out, let me stay late at night, listen to me, respect my opinion, try to change for me, give me any type of freedom, etc. Instead, she is acting like an absolute boss who has all the rights and I have none. She chooses everything for me and my opinion is worthless. The situation transforms me into a socially-disabled person and I am unhappy / depressed.

*What I am planning to do:*

I want to escape to my home country where before 10+ years my parents divorced. Possibly Returning at my dad's. Haven't kept in touch with him for all those years, due to fear. I already have a plan in mind of how I will process and friend who can assist me, but I am scared of my lack of knowledge.

*What I am scared of:*

Can I get tracked down and escorted home if I fail to leave the country in 24h? Because from what I've heard it takes 24h of someone missing for the police taking measures. (Not sure how correct is this information). I am above 18, tho, so usually I can do what I want, right?
I am also scared that if I fail to contact my dad and have nowhere to stay, whether I will manage to find a job and shelter / survive, since I have forgotten a lot of my native language, but I still understand most of it when people talk. I have no university degree, either and I have absolutely no idea how to do stuff.

146,"Medical consultancy.
Company 2008/9 - 40 employees.
35 people fired/left.
Company 2017 - 10 employees.
Boss hired 5 family/friends who have never worked in the industry. One was a professional bowler for 10 years. One worked selling lawn products. One was fired from another consultancy for causing a multimillion dollar stuff up. Two from overseas - previously worked in a cosmetic store... another warehousing. Last year one of them killed someone and company was investigated but cleared of charges. That employee has since left but the two mates he hired still work here.  



I'm now the 'token' employee. Everyone is white white (loves white things, love talking about white sports and white activities... you know the ones)... it's not hard to imagine them being members of the kkk. I eat lunch alone. I get picked on daily. It's a constant 'oh P... he's stuffed something up, let's all dump on him. Over and over...' but the stuff ups are so minor and insignificant. Everyone makes mistakes, the mistakes I make are forgetting to turn off my office light, or forgetting a patients name for one of the cases. The others will do things such as mess up a patients blood test results or completely forget to send a client their medication list. They won't even get a second look. But shit... I forget to turn off my light and I get a 30 second grilling about how I'm destroying the planet and costing the company 5c a day, yelling, in front of the company panel. Just completely random random comments. It's so weird. It's just the strangest strangest thing I've ever experienced. Oh and in board meetings, I've been there 10 years but I get dismissed within the first 5-10 mins. Even the graduates/admin and warehouse guy stay longer than me to discuss business.  



I'm good at what I do to the point where I sit on three medical committees for advisory stuff and work with a university in curriculum development - but the employees just have no respect. The boss serves a niche market - he makes millions and millions a year and doesn't care about little things. I'm the only employee who's gotten a job there who applied using a formal job application ie no one else did an interview or hiring process to get a job. I do 50 hour weeks, the others do mostly 30-40 hours. Midday on a Wednesday half the offices is gone. Last Friday at 2pm I was one of three people in the office, I found out 5 of them had gone to the local bar for lunch and drinks and never came back. This happens once a month.  



I'm 35. Most the other employees are my age +\- 5 years but I get referred to as 'the young guy'. I've been with my partner 15 years yet I get talked down to at work 'you don't know what marriage is like... you don't have any experience in life... blah blah blah' all they do is complain about their marriages or their wives, their kids, their money problems. I never have the heart to tell them I've been with my partner for 3x as long as they have been with theirs and that were very happy. They dump on me saying raising kids is hard and I'll struggle etc etc. I know this post has been a bummer but I'm normally super super positive and friendly which is probably why I have lasted so long.  



When they need something 'approved' they need my signature on things becuase they aren't legally allowed to sign off. Im paid well but for them being admin assistants and warehousing they get 250k+ company cars. BMW's, Merc's and porches. They live in three story homes in the nicest suburbs. They are all from money.  



I don't mind the work or the money or the nepotism. I've been here 10 years and I've just had a baby and bought a house. I have about 20k in the bank. I want to leave but I'm scared. Im scared I won't get paid as much. Im scared I'm quitting a good thing.  



Has anyone else who's NOT white been good at their job and paid well. Had a similar kind of work place. Left to seek better employment. How did it go? Was it rewarding?  



Who here has stayed in that job. Have you kept going and done 15-20 years? Did it get better?  



Two weeks ago I was offered a job consulting to educational institutions full time. It's a dream job but I haven't done education and I haven't done anything but my job for over a decade. I'm worried if I don't perform I get the instant chop 3-6 months into it.  



The jobs likely going to pay about 30-40% less and the hours will probably be longer... Im just not sure what to do. I don't want to stay but I don't leave. How do you decide and how do you pull the trigger. Even if I don't take the educational institutions work should I leave anyway? Can people share with me their experiences. I'm mainly looking for people who have specifically been employed in a company such as this and either left OR stayed. What happened. How are you. 5 year later. What's changed. What's gotten better? That's how you become a respected specialist - apply your knowledge and work for 10-20 years. Don't job hop.

On my last day of primary school, she cried knowing that I was going to high school. Ever since a few months in high school at the age of 12, we stopped talking. If I can recall correctly, she unfriended me with no reasoning behind it. Only until recently a few months ago, did I friend request her on Facebook? She did accept it, however, the both of us didn't message each other. For the past few years, I didn't really think about me missing her although there was still that reminiscence of her popping in my mind here and there. 

Now I'm at the stage now that I really miss her. I realized that she is the only person outside of my family that I have truly connected with. She's beautiful, she has a great personality etc. Years ago she did get me something for Valentines, but I'm unsure whether this was a primary school friend or something more. I'm a bit anxious whether to try and talk to her again, as I'm afraid there would be tension between each other, especially as I fancy her and I'm not sure if she still does (let's say she did in primary school). I've had deep thoughts about it several times this year, and now I'm in my last year of high school not knowing what to do.

I'd appreciate any insightful input.

153,"I'm 29, and absolutely nothing in my life is going well. I'm only just able to cover my bills, sometimes even requiring me to do side work just to pay for gas, I'm working all the time and not even getting ahead -- hell, I even have to work on holidays most of the time -- and I feel like life has already passed me by.

I hate how I look, but lack the drive to actually change. I've only been on two ""dates"" in my life, and neither one lead to even so much as a follow up date. I'm not good looking enough to be boyfriend material, not successful enough to be husband material, no experience to even be a one-night-stand, and while I was once considered to be ""funny and good with people"", I feel like that part of me is completely dead now.

I just don't know why I even bother to keep trying. I'm a failure by quite literally every standard one could apply, and I don't even have the ambition to want to do anything.

I really want to just have an entire month to have my own space, where I can do whatever I want and not have any kind of expectation or obligation. To wake up, watch whatever I feel like watching, and not have to put up with people's bullshit.

I'm seriously considering just quitting my job. If I do, I immediately lose my place to live, my car, my phone, and I have no idea how I would afford to move any of my things back to stay with my dad. And I don't even want to be back there, but it's about the closest thing I can think of to just ""quitting"" my current life.

I've never cared anything about travel, but sometimes you read these stories of people -- usually girls -- who give up everything and just go place to place, making a living as they go, and I kind of think ""I'm struggling just to survive in a place I'm not happy, maybe I could do something like that too?""

I miss being able to just ""exist"". No constant pressure, to have friends to invite you to do things.",02Sep2017,9

I'm a senior in college and I wanted to do an independent study on sports marketing. My professor is asking me to create a syllabus to go off of. 

The problem is that I don't know how to format the course. He recommended I do a final presentation at the end of the semester. The thing is I prefer to do it another way (because I'm not sure what ONE topic to pick for the presentation). 

- I want to do a different formatted course because I'm not sure what type of sports marketing field I want to do as a career. I don't want to stick to one topic. 

Should I answer a sports marketing thesis question? Or just write papers on each individual topic within sports marketing? What kind of assignment could I do?

Any advice is appreciated!!

161,"**Forgiving a girlfriend whose cheated on boyfriend**

Hi everyone. I'm 26 (Currently a Commercial Student pilot-Building hours) and my girlfriend is 21(2nd year I.T. University Student),we both have financially strong backgrounds and education standards. We both have been dating for 2 years straight and we've been going through typical relationship dilemma's and which those were hiccups that we both seemed to have gotten the gist of things. We don't stay together, and further more,we live in different Provinces (States)- 512KM (Kilometers) apart. The long distance has NEVER been a problem and doubtfully will ever be since we get to see each other every 2weeks for every 3rd/4th day stay together.

Trouble hit the fan 3 months ago when I went through her phone while she was in the shower (since it was ALWAYS on silent, on airplane mode and ALWAYS dimmed completely), and this wasn't out of distrust for her but with confidence and more-less out of curiosity. However, I happened to have found multiple texts (sexual) from guys that she speaks to and some females, so to say. They were shocking and put me off immediately since some of them were too sexual for me to say. I confronted her about the messages and she immediately diverted to the point of why I had to snoop through her phone. She laterwards apologized and promised to cut all ties with everyone by blocking them etc. Well, and I forgave her with the impression that she felt the gravity of things and how close I was to walking out of her life for good.

Well, she did it again. 4days ago. This time I was much furious because it was the very same guys she spoke to the last time I saw from the conversations when I snooped through her phone. It was so sour and bitter because this time the messages popped up infront of me while I was trying to grab photos of her while we were out in the morning to do some casual shopping. It wasn't pleasant and I felt extremely heartbroken. I chose to speak in the afternoon with her and decided to pack my bags and stay with a close friend who stays nearby so I could book a flight back home for the next day. 

She apologised and told me that I was being emotionally distant to her that's why she texted the guys and continuially seeking for approval from those guys(One of them is in the same classes as her btw). I explained to her that I was sorry too but my career also demands a lot out of me and its hard to maintain everyones needs (Her,Family and friends). She's the type that will never let me go and chanting the fact that she never wants to lose me and loves me so much. I feel the same coz of the fact that we've been through some very difficult times and we still stood by one another but cheating is a whole new different game to me that I cannot stand because I DONT play that game, I hate cheating and cheaters.

I'm at the point where I've forgiven her, but because its the 2nd time, its hard for me to forget. I told her stop calling me pet names because that's exactly what she calls those guys and the fact that shes slept with one of the guys(I called one of the guys and he told me they both had a thing going and have slept together- since she wasn't giving me enough reason why she cheated on me),or all idk. I want to fix things because we've worked so hard for each others lives but I constantly have this fear that she will do it again, as much as she cries a river saying that she will stop her ways. Little does she know of the engagement ring that I bought and waiting for her in my cupboard.. 

I don't know what to do, I'd appreciate every feedback?            ",02Sep2017,1
162,"I need some advice. I [27F] live in a townhouse with my mom [56F] that she owns. We share walls with neighbors on both sides.

On the one side, there is a family of 5 with a dog. We NEVER can hear them from inside our home. 

On the other side, there is a single guy [33ish?] who rents. Since he has moved in, there has been daily loud bass to both music and television. My mom originally went over there to ask him to turn it down, and he was super rude to her. This was before I was living with her. She decided not to go back, because she felt uncomfortable talking to a young man with clearly no respect. Now that I'm living here, I have no patience for inconsiderate neighbors. We have contacted our HOA (home owners' association) representative who has given the neighbor several warnings with no change. I left him a note saying that it would be great if he could understand that he shares walls with other people. He rang our doorbell, invited my mom and I into his home, showed us his ridiculous entertainment set up (huge TV mounted to our shared wall and a subwoofer near the kitchen), and said ""oh just let me know when it's too loud.""

We thought this was great and were really happy that he took the time to try to work it out with us. It was better for like a week and then went back to loud every single day. The bass can be heard over whatever I'm watching or listening to. It vibrates our walls.

I should also mention that his car exhaust and sound system are just as ridiculous, if not more. We always know when he is coming and going, because his car sounds like it's going to explode. 

Should I have to go over there EVERY DAY to tell him to turn it down? Like, if it's too loud at whatever volume or setting he has it at once, then it is ALWAYS too loud at that volume or setting. Is that an unreasonable thought?? Also, why should I have to leave my house daily to tell him to turn it down??

We've been told to call the police for a noise complaint, but both my mom and I feel like a bother for something that is not criminal. The noise can only be heard in our house, not from outside that I can tell. We've talked to his neighbors on the other side, and they've only heard him once or twice- their shared wall is further from the TV and subwoofer.

I'm at my wit's end. I do have some mild PTSD and serious anxiety from childhood trauma. Sometimes the bass makes me feel like a panic attack is coming on. I don't know what to do, and I honestly have fears about him retaliating or becoming more of a nuisance.

ANY advice is welcome!!!

TLDR; Neighbor with a shared wall has a subwoofer. He rents and we own. We've talked to him directly and contacted our HOA representative with no lasting change. Not sure how to make the message stick without making the conflict worse. ",02Sep2017,2

169,"In late 2016, my boss and I were told by a senior level individual that some organizational changes would be taking place, and we should both be expecting promotions.  

5 months later, I approach my boss and asked him if this was still the plan or if things had changed.  He told me that he would still be receiving the promotion described, however I would be receiving a lesser promotion, but still a great promotion within the next couple months.  

2 months later, my boss gets promoted.  I ask if things are still on track for me, he states that he hasn’t heard anything, but to be patient.  

1 month later, my boss starts telling me details of the proposed role that I am to be offered, but it’s not actually offered. 

6 weeks later, after him telling me just about every week that I should be getting the offer “next week”, my boss senses something is up, and I admit, very respectfully, that I would truly love to stay and work for this company, I have another offer on the table.  My boss reacts very positively to this, states he will call his boss and have the offer to me by the end of the week.  At the end of the week, I meet with my boss, he states they aren’t going to make me an offer unless I turn down the competing offer, because they don’t want my decision to be based on “monetary value”.  
I declined the offer, my boss states he will get the offer to me soon.  

2 weeks later, my boss states he has a call the next day with his boss and his boss’s boss to work out the final details.  

2 weeks later, I still haven’t heard anything, by now I have absorbed most of my boss’s old responsibilities and my work load has doubled.  After receiving a great performance review, I bring this up to my boss, I am told that I will be seeing an increase on my paycheck starting this week to compensate for the additional duties and that I will be back paid as well.  

3 weeks later, I have not seen a pay increase and I am still being given additional responsibilities.  Admittedly, my frustration with the situation was starting to overcome me, and I let it show in a conversation with a colleague.  I asked a witness to this interaction if they thought I was too tough and blunt on the person, they stated that they thought it was straight forward but not inappropriate.  

The following week, I receive disciplinary action this event.  I asked my boss if the people involved in making this decision were aware of my history and the timeline I have written about above, he states they don’t know, and that it shouldn’t matter.  Also says, “as a friend, if I was in your shoes, I would have left by now”.  

A month later I haven’t heard anything about the promotion or seen a pay increase, I assume my disciplinary action was used to take it off the table.  Now I truly feel as though my boss sabotaged me by making promises and telling me things that he was maybe not supposed to tell me, but ultimately couldn’t deliver, and now is covering his own butt by letting me take the fall for this event and hoping I leave.

186,"Hello all. 

Let's call my best friend 'A'. He is my age, works full time and is recently married (as in less than a year ago as of the time of writing this) with no kids and none on the way (that I'm aware of, so much for communication).

I'm single, but also work full time, sometimes well into the night and even weekends.

For some time before he got married, my best friend would only rarely reach out to me to hang out. Really, it has been me doing all the work. Last year, I was really understanding and chalked it all up to the stress of arranging a wedding. No problem there. But now that he has settled for almost a year, I don't really buy the 'I've been busy' excuse anymore. 

This past month I texted him several times but did not even get a 'Seen' indication on my messages. I let it slide for two weeks. I finally decided to reach out again asking him how he's doing and suggesting we meet up. He replies a few hours later saying 'Yes, it's long overdue. How about this weekend?' I reply agreeing. That was in Tuesday, Aug 29. Message not seen as of Sep 2. Follow up message on the 31st not seen as well.

Contrast that to another good friend of mine (who is also married and works full time) who I texted yesterday asking him if we could catchup this weekend. He replies an hour later with a voice message saying he was out of town and would remain so until next week but that he would be back next Friday and asked me if we could do it next weekend. I reply that I would be free on Sunday and he answers back saying: 'Okay, then. Next Sunday.'

Returning to the aforementioned best friend, if I don't initiate conversation with him, we can go for two months without talking, let alone seeing each other, and I'm fed up with this behavior.

That said, I'm willing to send one more message telling him that I didn't hear from him during the week and if everything is alright. You know, being supportive and all. He's been there for me when I went through tough times and viceversa.

But I'm not willing to do that anymore if he doesn't put the effort. If my supportive message goes unseen and/or unanswered I'm just about ready to drop all efforts at communicating and continue on my way, hanging out and catching up with other friends. 

Thing is, I don't want to burn bridges unnecessarliy, especially since we have lots of common friends, including a twin brother of his I'm really close with. I need advice on how to handle future encounters. What should I say if he says 'Hey, long time no see. Why didn't you remind me to go out and hang out?' or 'I'm really sorry, I've been really busy.' Should I bring all this up with him the next time we see each other? What should I say so as to avoid getting him all defensive?

187,"I'm 18 years old, male, and graduated a year ago.
I've never had a girlfriend, and everyone around me is getting into relationships, and it makes me feel a little lonely. 

During high school I've had opportunities with a few girls who would always try to get me to open up. (Was a little shy around new people) however during the time I was going through a weird depression phase, which made it hard. I was always really awkward around new people, girls especially. I was into this one girl who would always try to talk to me. Everytime we'd talk we wouldn't exchange anymore than a few times. 

Then a different girl started sitting next to me in computer class, and we became good friends. We would hangout during lunch, and started messaging quite frequently. I was crazy about her. However my Mom was going through financial problems and we couldn't afford rent. So I had to move (middle of my senior year). I stopped talking to her about two weeks before I moved (probably made it easier on me).  I still had a lot of feelings for her; I was planning on asking her our before I knew I had to move. 

Now that I'm not in school I'm essentially clueless as to how to meet girls without being cringy. I've tried dating apps, with no luck. Plus I'm looking for something meaningful and long-term. 

I've just never really been good at courting girls. I feel most comfortable when I know there can't be anything between us (i.e. friends girlfriend, brother's girlfriend, older girls). I find the more attractive I find a girl the more awkward it is for me. Especially if we're not hanging out just 1 on 1.

All advice is appreciated. Please specify if you've been in the same predicament or not too. 

TL:DR - 18m I want a relationship, had opportunities but blew them, how do I meet girls? And more importantly how do I land dates?

188,"There's a girl at my school who I have in several of my classes. We've had mutual friends for quite some time but we'd never been super close to each other. Recently however, we've begun talking more often in class and I even decided I'd take a risk and started messaging her on snapchat occasionally, to which she's always been happy to talk. 

Long story short, I've really started to develop feelings for her. I thought I'd ask her if she wanted to hang out outside of class sometime, so, I sent her a message asking her just that. 

I realize now I probably should have asked her in person but oh well, too late now. But in response she asked ""As friends? Or…"" and that's where I think I screwed up. I said that I hadn't thought about it any other way and, after that, she just asked where I wanted to go. 

Should I tell her now? Should I give it some time? Advice is much appreciated",02Sep2017,1
190,"Few weeks ago I started babysitting boys ages 4 and 9, they live quite far away from me, but the pay is amazing usually 30 euros/h.

They live in this sort of mansion, with huge fences and gates surrounding it, and everything seems really expensive.

It seems besides me there are 2 more babysitters that watch over kids in different times, I usually watch over them at the evening because their parents are away for a business trip, at least that's what I was told.

Now, I'm starting to doubt if I should continue to babysit.
I've seen many fully black expensive mercedes jeeps, range rovers and super cars in the span of few weeks.
Most people I meet look like average mafia people from movies and what not, from what I've seen there are also many cameras inside and out. The kids are well-behaved most of the time,    every single person I've met there was really nice and respectful but still....

Am I thinking about this too much, or should I stop babysitting for this family?",02Sep2017,1
192,"There's one thing that always made me sad. My family always argue. The annoying thing about this is the reasons are mostly so stupid and easily solveable. Everytime they are in an argument they shout at each other, say very harsh things, cry. Im sometimes bad tempered and easily furious like them but comparing myself to them i can say im more level-headed than they are. Im mostly not in the arguments and I get angry because when they are not talking to each other they kinda imply me to pick a side as if they are enemies and it lasts for weeks sometimes more. Whenever i try to speak up my mind to end the offense or try to prevent the argument in the first place they say im just an adolescent or i dont understand. After all of this i feel like our family ties wore down. It has always been a depressing thing for me even since early childhood. Why wouldnt we be enjoying the temporary time given us together happily and have pleasant memories? Can somebody tell me what kind of a step i should take in order to end or even reduce this thing?",02Sep2017,2

194,"First day I worked with him I just thought he was just an awkward ass. We all work at a Domnios that hasnt been open very long its very busy. We did dishes together and just chatted. He kept asking if I was married, single, what I do outside work. Any interest I listed, he just happened to do. I said I play games on the PC and he says he did too. I said I mostly spend time in ARK and Skyrim or Oblivion. ""I've never heard of Skyrim. Guess you'll just have to take me over to your house and show me."" HAHAHA no. Being a gamer and not knowing what Skyrim was is a giant red flag for me. For the rest of the dishes he kept making brief mention of going home with me.

 Often when I try to get by someone, I put my hand lightly on their back and say pardon so I can squeeze by or so they dont whip around and drop whatever they're making. He just stands like a statue even if I apply pressure to indicate I cant move. Doesnt matter if I'm just going up front or the manager told me to come over ASAP. I tried to get through with a large load of boxes he just snaps ""go around!"" despite there being a busy production line on one side and a 500 degree oven on the other. (he was in the walkway waiting to pop more bubbles on crusts, nothing huge that couldnt wait) He's a big guy who gives no shits about who he blocks

Then our shifts dont line for a few days thank god. But then he elbows me in the boob yesterday. Of course I say ""ow!"" EDIT: should probably note this was accidental. He was lifting his arms up but his following reaction is what pissed me off. A few hours later he springs out of nowhere and says ""you know getting hit in the boob doesnt hurt right?"" Bitch you gonna tell *me* that? I said that it did and he needs to watch out next time, but then he comes back with ""it's not like you have much to hit there anyway"" in a very dismissive/uninterested tone. BITCH CALLED ME FLAT CHESTED. I really thought about reporting him then and there but didnt. I figured if he ever gets in the way, makes any sexual comment, any body comment in general, I'll give him a verbal ""piss off, dont do it again"" and then report if he keeps it up. 

What do yall think? It's bad enough he's staring at my chest apparently and mad he cant tap this. Should I just report it the very next time? Now?",02Sep2017,2

199,"The thing I've always been passionate about *and* talented at is fitness - I'm great at designing new exercises and programs and motivating/teaching people how to work out and have a healthy lifestyle. I'm *not* great at anything else, really - mostly due to a learning disability; i could not do most professions. 

but it seems like the fitness industry is one of the most over-saturated things ever. the amount of competition just seems insane and it makes me angry/frustrated just thinking about it. and i'm already 30, so i'd be competing with people 10 years younger than me, which makes me feel even more hopeless. 

i've known since high school what I wanted to do- and equally as important, I've always known I wanted to be my own boss and be successful at self-employment, but i kept stubbornly trying to go to school for other things, avoiding what i really wanted because of fear of failure/expecting to fail, telling myself i can't succeed financially because freaking everyone in the entire world wants to be a fitness coach of some sort. 

but avoiding what i want has only made me depressed and frustrated and exhausted. i have to at least *try* to make it doing what i'm actually good at. does anyone have advice for how to stand out and succeed in an over-saturated industry?

200,"I have landlords (a couple) that I'm not sure I can consider to be honest, trustworthy people.  If they were honest people, I would feel more comfortable talking to them about anything that got broken or damaged in the house because I would feel that they would handle the situation in a just and fair manner.

Anyway, the window in my room has two little locks that lock the window into place when you slide it up and down.  One day, I came into my room to find that one of the locks was no longer in the window and was nowhere to be found.  I asked a housemate (also untrustworthy) about it and he claimed he found it in the common area and put it in a plant in the common area.  He acted a bit suspicious.  I never found the lock. 

Also, the frame of my window screen cracked when I was handling it, probably because it was really old.  I don't really see this as a fault of mine, just like the mysterious disappearing window lock.  

Anyway, is it better to report these things to a landlord or just wait till I move out and let them take it out of my security deposit? I was kind of hoping that they wouldn't notice if I didn't tell them about it.  If I do, I'm not sure how they'd act.",02Sep2017,1

Not sure as to my next move as we approached them in a mall and left soon after.

204,"So to start off, I completed a two person screening interview and later that day completed a 3 person briefing interview. They spoke very quickly and because of the group dynamic and time constraints I wasn't able to ask almost any questions before they shoo'd me out the door.

They called me later that day and told me I got the part, but then I did some digging and I'm suspicious now.

1. The lead managers name is extremely similar to the prefix of the company name. It's an energy company, so it's structured like ""managers name"" Energy. 

2. They told me they are an expansion of CenterPoint Energy, which is a legit company, but nothing on their site says anything about a presence in my state. I tried to call, but the HQ is in Houston, and guess what city is flooded. Dead end.

3. I googled the company name. Nothing comes up except LinkdIn, ZipRecruiter, Job search websites. 

4. Taking links from these places to the energy company home page, brings me to a super bare bones page. Stock image of paperwork, a brick and mortar address, and a simple phone number. NOTHING ELSE. No policy page, no about us, no career section, nothing.

5. They don't want to discuss wages until orientation. They wanted to blast me into the company with a few days, but I hadn't even moved to that city yet so i told them to wait until the 18th.

6. They want to crash course train me to manage my own branch under this energy company. I have zero experience in anything like this, they said thats what they preferred. Feels like they want to take advantage of people who don't know what to expect.

7. The brick and mortar location is in a shitty part of a shitty city. Think slums. They didn't even have a water cooler and it's over 100° out. 

8. They dropped words like ""sales"" and ""customer service"" but I honestly can't think of what they would sell without a product other than 'energy' , when they don't even seem to have any plants or workers to distribute it.

9. Here's the big one. They said they are expanding into my state, because my state is ""currently in the energy deregulation process"" yet when I Googled it, my states been deregulated for 22 YEARS!

So please, if you know anything about this, or have heard of anything similar, please let me know, cuz I just don't understand anymore. I dont want to become part of a scam or be used, and it's looking to be just like that",02Sep2017,3
205,"Im 20 I'm currently working a security job in a supermarket, if I said I didn't enjoy my job I'd be lying because it gives me a buzz. The problem is more the 5 other people I work with. So let me give you some background, I got the job over a year ago now and from day one I could tell they were already in their friendship group together as well as work mates, I have always struggled making friends despite being a nice guy I was determined to make sure that I got on with the people I work with, I do to an extent in work but can tell they constantly are talking about me behind my back and making fun. I just thought in time they would begin to like me and want to get to know me. However this is not the case as I realised when the new guy joined 2 months ago. Within 2 weeks he was going out for drinks with them and laughing and joking in work. Something that I've never been able to do with many people. This new guy is very arrogant and they find fun in pulling me up on things that i either have made a mistake with or fabricating things that I haven't done. All this has sent me to the edge of my mental capacity, my anxiety which was previously non existent is now a constant in my life. It makes me consider quitting my job because I can't handle the stress of being belittled and feeling out of place. For example last night they all left work 3 hours early and left me finish the shift on my own so they could all go out which I found out through another colleague because they mustn't have wanted me to know.

214,"This may not be the ideal community but I don't know which one to post to so I will try my luck here. 

I am 21, a college dropout, I have two non-functioning vehicles, I am married to the woman of my dreams, I am a line cook that barely makes over 1k a month, I struggle to pay my bills in my apsrtment, I have three maxed out credit cards, I am overweight, and I don't enjoy very much. I don't have hobbies that bring me profound happiness either at all, or not like they used to and I haven't found anything to fill the void. I don't know if I'm a good husband. I don't know what that looks like as I don't have many great models in my life and the people I could even consider seem to want nothing to do with me. I feel alienated from my family. I was the crown jewel of the family. After my parents divorced I was the perfect model of both houses. The still ideal unification of a bond that no longer was. I made both houses proud even when one was a 1000 miles away and the one I formerly spent years with and rarely heard word of the other. By house I mean last name, encompassing grandparents, uncles, aunts, and such. When I moved to the other house I became closest to them as I have matured the most here and achieved all that I did. 

I was my high school mascot. I created school events. I lettered in many things. I played sports, I traveled with academic teams, and I earned friendship from my teachers all while working and having some of the best friends around. Maybe I peaked in high school. I was going to be the first person to get a college degree in my family. I wanted to be a US Deputy Marshall. I was very liberal. But the court system scared me. The authority seemed too much. I had moral quarrels with what I was learning and what I would do. I changed majors. I became a political scientist for my second year and had gotten my first apartment with my now wife the summer before and worked full time to keep it. I gained weight from all the stress. I quit my campus job. I hated the school's selective politics and how the cliques ruled all. I felt alone. My family had little to do with me. I was hundreds of miles away from the closest house and the literal house that was closest to me had no bed for me either. I lost my ability to connect well with people. I had felt betrayed by the bestest of friends I mentioned earlier and those that would leave as well in college. I had a radio show but people stopped listening. I don't know why. I was so bitter and angry and hostile but so hungry to learn. What an odd combination. I became libertarian and quickly saw the hypocrisy of the campus and it's student body and wanted out. While visiting my mom for Christmas I surmised I needed to move back and get rid of credit card debt and get back in shape and try pursuing my degree to understand power and maybe find whatay I want to do with my life at a different college. The one back home. My sister had moved out so there was a room. That was it though. My now wife and all of our belongings either in one room or a storage unit. It was in a tiny apartment but she made it happen for us. She had a roommate however. A former friend of mine. He had lived across the street from us when my parents got back together. Two years ago my mom left my dad and this roommate was the catalyst of their seperation. He had shown her that there are people more like my mom than perhaps she had thought and that line of thinking had negated her willingness to be with my dad. She left 3 days before my 19th birthday and one month before I left for college. Her best friend from before the divorce had moved here and she and the roommate moved in with her and her two kids. These kids don't function entirely well. They have autism and have maturity and anger issues as well but they're not heartless. They just don't always know better. The story goes they never cleaned up after themselves forcing my mom and the roommate to do housework in a home that wasn't theirs. There were feuds. Eventually the roommate for whatever reason got in the youngest's face (17 years old) and bitched him out and threatened to hurt him. He was told to leave but my mom chose to leave with him. This man has no job. He was in the army doing anything but what he claims to have done as he is a compulsive liar and manipulative. He is on disability for whatever reason. He claims to have awful stomach pains and have to endure shitting all the time and that is somehow his disability. He's seen almost a dozen doctors over the past six years who all say the same thing; it is in his head. But he refuses to listen. They recommend psychiatric help but he won't take it until his pain goes away. I've been woken up from this bastard screaming and cussing at the head of a clinic because of his doctor there concurring with former opinions. I wouldn't want him in my house either. This gave my dad cause to strike up a romance with the former best friend. She is now my step mom and my real mom had gotten a place with this douchebag. It's not a romantic relationship in any way but he has wronged my sisters. Physically. And one morning at 5 am, he beats his dog and I confront him and he tackles me and breaks nearly everything immediately behind my bedroom door and chokes me. Almost until I pass out. I should have gotten up and swung with everything I am. He is nothing. He knew I wouldn't because of the sheer shock of the moment and that's why he did it. I'm stronger than him. Even then. And I don't have a weakness in my midsection like he does. I didn't though. I locked my door and called the police and told them what happened as he is screaming through the door telling me I'm a pussy this and my wife is a fat slut that. The police arrive and can only issue a harassment ticket since there isn't apparant physical damage because he wore a thick hoodie when he did it. I went to the court to get a restraining order. They denied it. I requested an officer to keep peace while I gather my valuables from that room so my wife and I can have them wherever we go. They denied it. He refused to leave. My mom wouldn't evict him in court despite saying she wanted to. All the leasing was in her name and paid for by her. She wouldn't. I stayed with my dad. In a bedroom. Again. His new family was unexpectedly great. I was wrong about these people I have known for most of my life. I failed in choosing where to put my wife and I. I failed in what to believe about my dad and step family. 

I enrolled back in to college as did my wife. We had a month to come up with enough to get our own place. Three months behind schedule for that. My dad was moving 1000 miles away again. But she and I did it. We got a place. Now we are married, broke, and she is shipping off in 16 days for the US Army and I cant yet because I'm not in weight compliance. This is the best I've been eating and I have been working out religiously and am making significant progress. I've lost 30 lbs since I moved back 7 months ago. But it's not enough. I lost my job at the time of the assault because I wasn't the same after. I was visibly hurt and irritated. I got a new job and I work with my mom who has since gotten a trailer with this roommate she has chosen to continue to be with. My dad is gone and struggling. No one in either house seems to care anymore. I told this story to them and I got, ""I'm sorry to hear that"". Maybe I'm looking for validation but nothing makes me happy. I have 16 days left with my wife and No money to make those days special and I can't get out of my head enough to make them special for her. All this time during all my struggles I have not gone backwards. Kept going and yet it seems fruitless to have done anything. The past two years I could have laid in bed and would have accomplished just as much. So why do I keep trying when no one cares. Why do I keep trying when I know in my heart I'm going to get fucked again? I've become so apathetic. I hate my job. I dropped out because I can't afford school. My mom chose this man over her kids. And I'm still too big to join the army and maybe finally see some light at the end of this tunnel. 

What did I do to deserve this? What did my wife do to deserve me? I go out of my way to help. I give. I take the path that doesn't offend or make people feel small. I just stick to me. But I am a failure. And there is nothing and no one I can stick to but me.

215,"Hi all. I am a 23 yr old traveling nurse. For those that don't know what that is, I live and work in a different city every 3-6 months. Travel nursing has always been my dream. It's the whole reason I became a nurse. I did it because I wanted to see the country, meet new people, make memories, and ultimately find the place that I want to call HOME. However, I'm realizing now that maybe travel isn't as great as I thought it was going to be. I've only been to one hospital so far but it's been such a miserable experience and has made me question nursing altogether. My mental health has taken a HUGE hit... I cannot even begin to explain how horrible it's been. I know I can't let one bad assignment define the whole experience.. but there are a lot of pros to being permanent staff that I took for granted before I started travel. Examples: support from management, PTO, self-scheduling. I actually was able to travel the country more as a permanent staffer than I am now.

Half of me wants to quit travel nursing but the other half wants to give it another try. 

Plus, I met a guy here who I've been dating for a couple months and I'm really serious about him. That's saying a lot coming from me because I have never been serious about a guy. I've had relationships but none of them really did much for me. Romantic relationships have never been a priority of mine... Until now.. Things are going really well with this guy and I honestly think we have a lot of potential.

My options are :
- take another contract and move 18 hours away, putting our relationship on hold for 3 months which puts us at a high risk of not working out.  
- quit travel nursing and take a permanent position in a local hospital, giving our relationship a chance to do its thing. 

If it doesn't work out, I can always go back to travel. The opportunity to travel will always be there... he may not. However, I don't want to be that person who ""gives up their dream"" (although my dream kind of sucks now) for a guy I've only known for two months. 

The timing is horrible. If we were together for 6 months, or a year... this wouldn't even be a question. We've talked it over in great depth and just keep going in circles. I know no one can make the decision for me but I'm looking for insight from people who don't know me and won't give me biased advice like friends &amp; family. Thanks in advance, guys.",02Sep2017,1

I fear that if she knows that I'm feeling this way right now then she will be unable to enjoy herself. She can't exactly come by and spend the night with me.

I was living in Los Angeles working freelance in the film industry, I've built up a pretty awesome resume and have made some great connections, but not enough to keep me fully employed. I couldn't balance a restaurant gig with my freelance work so I couldn't afford my rent/bills. 

My family told me if I came back to Louisiana they'd help me out, so I took what money I had, packed my car and made the drive so I'd avoid being homeless in Los Angeles. Once I made it back they decided against what they'd promised and I'm currently homeless in the wrong LA. 

Out here I can very easily get restaurant jobs where you make decent tips, in fact I've just been offered two jobs so I can work about 80 hours a week. Living in my car and working 14 hours a day on my feet is exhausting me to the point that it's affecting my performance at work, but eventually I can get an apartment and just keep doing this. 

But this is not the life I want, the city I want to be in, or the job I want to have. It's just what will keep me afloat until maybe I can afford to try Los Angeles again in a few years. 

Or I can take what money I've made so far, and just drive back west. Im already homeless, but where I am in Louisiana it's illegal to sleep in your car, and it's humid so hanging out in the car in my free time is pretty miserable. At least in Los Angeles I can post up on the Westside where the weather is bearable and sleep in my car legally while working freelance until I've made enough connections or have gotten the days to join the union and get more permanent work. 

Also, in Louisiana I'm showering at the same gym where my boyfriend was murdered several years ago, so that's adding to my stress a little bit. It's the only one nearby, and the only one I can afford right now. 

So I'd like the advice of people who don't know me. Do I keep working in these restaurants until I get an apartment and just do this for a while?

Longish version- a couple weeks ago I was on a night out with a couple of mates, clubs were shit so we went walking around town chilling, we ran into a group from our college who we never spoke to before but we started hanging out together. 

I started chatting to a girl in this group and we kept chatting and walking off on our ones, my own group wanted cabs home but I ended up staying to chat to this girl more, and that I didn't want to go home yet lol. Honest to god I didn't think she was interested. 

Morning came and her friends were completely wasted so she had to get them home. Fast forward to now my mate just messaged me saying that her friend was talking to him about how we was really upset I never messaged her and that she's really interested. 

Thing is though, I'm off to uni in a couple of weeks, so I have no idea what to do. Like I did proper like her and that and maybe if there was more time I'd go for it. Maybe I'm just making excuses though, I've never actually asked someone out before and I have no idea what I'd say. ",02Sep2017,1

226,"We have a serious problem that I do *not* know how to rectify.  

I have a 19 year old son who lives at home.  Since he graduated high school, he virtually done nothing.  He sleeps all day until someone comes and picks him up.  He'll stay gone for days at a time, then shows up to pass out in his bed.  He has claimed depression and, for a time, sought out professional help.  He hasn't really followed through on any of it.  

I have tried to encourage him, threaten him, take things away from him.  The last job he truly held, he was let go from... last October.  From February through April, I threw him out of the house.  He wasn't allowed to take his car or any belongings besides clothes.  He jumped from couch to couch until he asked to come home.  He had just started a job at Dunkin' Donuts.  Within a week of moving home, he abandoned that job.  

I took away his car in May for failure to maintain a job, it is now September.  I returned the plates and parked it.  It no longer starts.  He doesn't care about the car, clearly.  He has spent the summer waiting for friends to show up, pick him up and he gets dropped back off whenever.  Could be hours, could be days if he convinces someone to ""let him crash"".  He's not a drinker and he absolutely hates people who do any type of drug (he's ended friendships with people who even just smoke pot), so I don't think it's a substance abuse issue.

This is turning into a nightmare for me with my wife, who is his step-mother.  We are arguing and fighting about this constantly.  She is at the point where if she sees him, she's angry.  If he so much as eyes a slice of bread, she's demanding to know what he's doing.  Right now, we're fighting and not speaking because I allowed him to open and eat half a box of cereal we bought at the grocery store an hour ago.  How dare I be OK with him just ""eating everything"" as soon as we buy it?  This is a great way to spend a Saturday night.

My wife and my son have NO actual relationship and they hate each other.  We have been together for 9 years.  His biological mother is not really in the picture and it's better that way.  She's actually no better.  He can't move in with her because he's over 18 and she is living in subsidized housing with her other 3 children... that are not mine.  I'm not sure they'd allow another adult to move in there with her because it's government regulated.  Plus, like I said, he doesn't speak to her because she's a complete and total mess.

The problem is that my wife and I have really, really different parenting backgrounds.  I know *her* parents would not have allowed this and that is her background.  The problem is:  my parents have... and *DO*.  When I threw him out the first time, I had ZERO support from them.  To top it off, they're divorced and are free to from their own opinions... and it's still the same.  

I have two brothers virtually in the identical position as my son: 

I'm 36 and I have a 34-year-old brother who never graduated high school.  When I say that, I mean he has an 8th grade education.  He managed to get disability payments for, what I imagine would be agoraphobia and anxiety.  What really happened is he went face first into being defiant and nasty and my mother could not handle him, so she allowed him to drop out.  Alcoholism and abusing OTC cold medications soon followed.  Nobody really discusses it, he's clean now.  Everyone just laments his limitations and it's accepted that he is a non-contributing member of society, a true never-has-been and never-will-be.  

Do you know what my family blames it on?  His becoming *diabetic* at the age of 12.  I have never seen anyone just sit out on life because they have Type I Diabetes and I don't think this happens and is not a legitimate excuse and I've said so numerous times.  This brother is like the late-stage version of my son.  He sits in his beautifully remodeled bedroom with a state-of-the-art computer and collects government benefits, which he rarely spends (just on smokes and computer overhauls every couple of years)... it just collects in random hiding places like he's living in the Great Depression.  He lives with my mother and it's abundantly clear that he will never, ever be able to go outside or interact with anyone again.  He has no friends left.  

My mother has begged me to never throw my son out again.  As it is, she will randomly transfer money into his bank account so occasionally he has some spending money.  She ""can't take it!"" and it ""kills"" her to think that I would do that to my own child... because as difficult as my brother was, she didn't do it to him.  Instead, she actually excused it and got him a diagnosis that would pay.  Best of all: when my mother passes, this brother becomes my responsibility.  It's in her damn will.  Not that I don't love my brother, but I can't fathom maintaining two homes and he will *never* move out of that bedroom, never mind the actual house (that I will actually *not* own, he will... but I will be tasked with maintaining him and the house on his shoddy SSDI budget, which I fear will not be enough).

I also have a 20 year old brother, who is my father's.  He is severely coddled and has to be woken up and begged to attend his college classes every day, my step-mother going so far as to become a professor at his college to keep an eye on him.  He is going into his third year at a 2-year school.  When I went over his house last night, he was passed out on the couch... he like had been the entire day.  He got up at 8 PM and nonchalantly left to hang out with his friends.  

He is tremendously overweight (like he's 5'10"" and likely 300+ pounds). He barely holds a part-time job at a grocery store.  In addition, he has stolen large amounts of money and antiques from my father and their house in the past.  He has been hospitalized for threatening suicide... twice in the last year.  He has to have special ""clinicians"" come over to try to teach him how to dress and shop for appropriate clothing (if it were up to him, he'd wear a shirt 3 sizes too small and shorts with a hole in the crotch like it was nothing).  I showed up last night to find out my father co-signed for my brother to buy a $12,000 pick-up truck.  Really?  My father also *did not* support my decision when I threw my son out the first time.  When I ask for advice on how to handle my son, they shrug their shoulders.  If they knew, they wouldn't have a similar child.

I do not want to throw my son out again and I'm honestly wondering if this is truly something fucking genetic here.  Does he really have some type of mental illness?  Do I throw a child like that out?  

I'm not necessarily seeking thoughts from people who have never been in this position.  If only because, in my experience, people who have never been there tend to be really strict in their opinion... until they have a child like this.  My father was so angry with my mother for being ""so easy"" on my brother, until my youngest brother started down the same road and now my father is terribly lenient with him.

Is there anyone who has been in this position and successfully turned it around?  It is true, I've ignored his behavior for a long time because I didn't know how to handle it.  My wife just pressures me to go and ""TALK TO YOUR SON!"" You think I haven't?  You think I haven't forced him to sit down and apply for jobs?  You think I haven't badgered him to get his shit together?  You think I haven't barged in on him at 9 AM and told him to get his ass out of bed and that it isn't my fault he stayed up until 5 AM?  I have.  You think I want every single conversation to revolve around what a let-down he is?

I feel like I threw him out and that was supposed to be a learning experience and it was *not*.  He learned nothing in the 2½ months I cut him off and I'm still in the same position.

Aaaand go.


EDIT:  I'll mention that he isn't COMPLETELY immobilized.  He plays in a band.  This band plays a few shows a month all over New England (MA, CT, RI, NH), but they do not get paid for it since they are at the bottom of the marquee list and haven't gotten a large following to headline their own show.  They have released some singles and EPs of their work and I think it's technically good, but not really my taste (which is fine by me).  

His maternal (so his MOTHER'S SIDE) grandfather has stayed as a significant influence in his life, also, enabled him by encouraging him to focus on music instead of ""real life"" because he, himself, is a failed drummer and is trying to live through my son a little bit.  Grandpa goes to most of their shows and supports this facet of his life tremendously. When I speak to this grandfather and explain my concerns, his answer is to call him incessantly and spending time with him, but I fear -- not encouraging him to get into the ""life game"".  My son is a GREAT drummer and took a decade of lessons, but to think he can strike it big is a massive longshot and should not be leaned upon as it has been in lieu of being on someone's payroll and having responsibility. 

Before you ask, he can't really break into the music industry in other ways to get money.  For example, he had brief intentions of becoming a music teacher -- that requires a master's degree.  Even to teach private lessons in most cases, such as at his music school, in this area, they will not consider him to be an instructor unless he furthers his education.  Hasn't happened.",02Sep2017,1
227,"So my girlfriend recently wanted to take a break, I'm sure some of you saw the post I made a day or 2 ago. She said she still loved me and would come back to me after the break. But today she messaged me asking how my day was going, and I thought today would be the end of the break. But she told me she's still thinking about a lot of stuff, and she can't promise she's going to come back to me. 

I don't know what to do, I'm shaking. We've been dating for almost 2 years, and now it looks like I'm going to lose her. She's back to ignoring me after I asked why she's considering not coming back. ",02Sep2017,1
228,"So I'm 20 and got a place with my girlfriend about 6 months ago. Went into this with positivity and confidence. Girlfriend and I have been together for around 3-3.5 years now. I don't go to collegebut she does. I work 40-45 hours a week to pay the bills. Throughout our time living together we've both changed of course. Just not in a way that sync with one another anymore. Most of our conversations are her telling me things i need to get done, her wanting me to stop joking with her(something that she used to love and do back) or an unnecessary argument about whatever ridiculous thing you can think of. We don't really love on each other like we used to or talk about much other than our jobs or what I've already mentioned. 

I've got one ""friend"" who I only see when I'm willing to drive the 30mins it takes to him(he isn't). My job, while quite easy, doesn't satisfy me the way I'd like it to(would never be there if not for the paycheck). 

Also, girlfriend's dad recently worked on my car(he's a mechanic) and actually fucked it up so bad it shut off randomly on me while on the highway. He could've fixed it but never bothered to even try so it eventually was towed by the state and scrapped(not paying to get it out since it doesn't run anyways). Girlfriend defended him om when i broight it up and did nothing to help.

 So now I'm stuck living with my girlfriend whom I no longer get along with, but spend MOST my time with her since i need her car to get to and from work, barely able to save for a car because i pay for almost everything since girlfriend doesn't work much cuz of college, and i feel like it's just been me staying strong by myself for a while now. I can feel myself slowly getting more and more fed up with this situation, I just don't know the next move to get out. 
   
   Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love life and everything it has to offer. But when shit doesn't serve you, shit doesn't serve you. I'd love to hear what you guys think would be the best move here. ",02Sep2017,5
230,"tl;dr: My stubborn/toxic dad is going to disown me because my bf is a different ethnicity. I refuse to pick one of them over the other. Advice on how to find a middle ground without giving up my boyfriend and my right to date whoever I want? Anyone with a similar story?

ACTUAL POST:
Hi everyone! This is my first post and it is very long, so I apologize in advance! I tried to include a tl;dr above, but I feel this is a complicated issue so it might be shit lol. If you read the whole thing I appreciate u

I'm looking for advice on how to deal with a stubborn (and emotionally abusive) father, who will not accept or even meet my boyfriend of two years. He has very seriously threatened to disown me if I stay in the relationship, all because my boyfriend isn't the same ethnicity.

To give some background; I am a first generation American, with both sides of my family hailing from the Eastern European/Balkan region. All my life, my dad has been a sort of helicopter parent, especially when it comes to me (his only daughter) and my interaction with the opposite sex. This behavior became more enforced and overbearing after my parents got divorced -- something my dad has always demonized my mother for. The divorce definitely changed him in ways I cannot fully describe. He fell into a pit of depression and his view of women became skewed -- he some times demonizes them the same way he does my mother. Because my mother left him for someone of South American descent, he's made me promise him that I would only date and marry someone ""of our kind"". He also insisted that he ""pick"" a husband for me. This started at around the age of 5 or 6. He kept my brother and I sheltered, secretly fearing that we would become ""too Americanized"".

For a while, I actually believed that I would marry someone he picked for me. That didn't last long though. I was never a rebellious kid -- I did well in school, didn't party, and did nearly everything he asked. I'm still doing well, too. I just graduated from a competitive university with a degree in mechanical engineering. But my dad can't recognize all of my accomplishments because, according to him, the only thing that matters is me keeping our family ""pure"". And since I've failed him in that aspect, he's decided to cut me out of his life.

It's hard for me... Because I truly love my dad. As a single father, he's worked so hard to provide for me; to put me through school, to make sure I have enough to eat, ect. He has his issues, but he's not a bad guy and he's always reiterated how much he loves my brother and I. But now, every day, he looks at me like I'm the biggest disappointment of his life. He picks fights, emotionally tearing me down. He says I don't love him because if I did I would listen to what he says. That I'm actively ""choosing"" to make him unhappy. That I'm ""choosing"" another man over him, and that I ""can't have both"" of them. I don't know what to do. 

My boyfriend is amazing -- honestly, probably the best thing that's happened to me in a while, especially given how fucked up my family life can get. He's everything I've ever wanted in a guy and I feel so lucky to have him by my side. He's kind, funny, intelligent, ambitious, and an engineer and first generation American like me. He's a fucking catch -- I hope to marry him one day and there's no way I'm letting him go. But again, somehow this is all negated because he's not from the Balkans.

To me, this fight between my dad and I is about so much more than my current boyfriend. I mean, he is the reason this is happening NOW, but it was bound to happen at some point. I'm fighting my dad for my own independence, something that he has constantly stripped me of (or tried to). I believe I have a right to date whoever I please, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, ect. Is that so wrong?

I've talked to my dad about how I feel. I've told him that I want to have control over my own life, and most importantly, who I spend the rest of my life with. And he's told me his side of things. Mainly, he wants us to preserve our culture. The Balkan culture is very tightly knit -- everyone knows everyone, and they all hang out and interact regularly. Huge family gatherings are common, and weddings are even bigger. I get that he wants to keep that. I believe that my boyfriend can be included and actively partake in our culture, but my dad doesn't think so. He remains unmoving. He says as soon as I find a job and move out, I'm not welcomed back home. He says I won't be welcome to visit my brother, my cousins, my aunts, or uncles, either. While I don't fully believe that, it still scares me. My dad can be pretty ruthless and hasn't had a problem cutting other people out of his life.

What should I do? I love my family to bits. Maybe things will never be perfect, but I just want my dad to be happy for me. I want to be able to be around him without being emotionally shit on or compared to my mother. I want him to be happy too. I understand that he wants to be involved in my life -- that's normal and fine, but I draw the line at my love life. He doesn't seem to understand why I don't want him involved in that, and thus becomes even more upset.

I feel so tempted to cut him off, just as he threatened to do to me. Just out of spite really. I would have never threatened to cut him out of my life the way he did me... it would feel almost just to do it first, borderline petty. He's been a toxic person for most of my life, so part of me feels it would do me good. On the other hand, he's my dad. I'd rather keep my distance than cut him out completely.

Anyone in a similar situation? What did you do?

Any advice on how to diffuse the situation, maybe some good arguments to help me compromise? It's very hard for me not to get passionate when I'm arguing with him, so I suppose I also need to work on using a more civil tone. 

I also would appreciate any tips on dealing with emotional stress and anxiety. Whenever we've gotten into fights (almost every day), I'm unable to work or be productive for the rest of the day.",02Sep2017,4
231,"I'm a freshman this year. I have insomnia so I wake up frequently throughout the night and on a few occasions when I've woken up, I've heard my roommate masturbating. Obviously this makes me uncomfortable. I don't know why she would do that while another person is in the room even she thought I was asleep. I don't want to confront her about this because it's really awkward. I really have no idea how to handle this situation.",02Sep2017,1
232,"I am 13 and I go to a private school in London. My mother makes me do piano lessons because she thinks I need a hobby, and I agree with her. However, before the piano I found I liked singing at around 8. It was my escape from my parents divorce and it helps me through my troubles. I am not usually shy, but when it comes to singing I just close up. I don't know why I do, my throat goes dry and I kinda sweat a lot. I sometimes sing with my friend as a sort of joke, but I want to sing freely. The only times I sing are while I'm alone or in the shower. My family sometimes talk about what I want to be, they say that I would make a great lawyer etc but I can't say I like singing. My voice has started to break and I'm losing my singing voice. 

Another problem is I'm having trouble with my sexuality. I have not ever said anything about this so this is a first. I think I'm bisexual. I feel attraction to both genders. Some people in my class and family members throw the word 'gay' around, but I know my family doesn't mean it because they have a lot of gay friends. I can't tell whether I mistake attraction for friendship because I can get kinda clingy.

233,"Okay, so I found a meme that I thought was pretty funny, but was a bit offensive. I didn't think it was too bad, because in a group chat, me and a couple of other people send memes that were pretty offensive, but we wouldn't take it seriously. So I send the meme, and some people go crazy over it. One person even said to go ""kms"", but then apologized afterwards. I did apologize about the meme but it just seemed odd. I asked my brother if it was offensive or not, and he asked if I made it, and I said ""no"". He said it didn't really matter. 

TL;DR - I sent an offensive meme that usually isn't too bad for a group chat I was in. Everyone went crazy over it.

Did I go to far?

239,"Ok seriously, what would you do in my situation?   I am at a loss. My lawyer has been completely unresponsive for two months and it is driving me crazy. I wanted the lawyer to help me deal with a property issue (land that I want to sell that is co-owned with family). The property issue is very stressful for me and has been going on for decades, and it has contributed to serious problems I have with anxiety and depression.

Prior to a trip back home to Canada four months ago (I now live in the UK), I asked local friends if they could recommend a lawyer. My friends recommended a lawyer that they have used for many things in the past - wills, real estate transactions, business disputes, etc, and that two other friends of ours have also used. They all spoke highly of him.

So, when I was in Canada, I met with the lawyer for an hour, and I gave him all the background to the matter. He seemed like a good choice. He recommended that I try to get some information from a family member, which might shed some light on one of the relevant issues. It took quite a long time to get that information, and in the end it was incomplete, so it was quite a waste of time. However, I learned by internet research that I could have found out the information from the local court house, so I or the lawyer could have just done that instead of trying to get the information from the family member. I lost six weeks because of this.

When I finally did get the information, I emailed the lawyer to set up a time for a telephone meeting so we could discuss getting the matter underway. I received no reply. For the first few days I thought ‘Well, lawyers get busy, so he’ll get back to me when he can’. A week passed. Then another week passed. And then another. So I emailed him again, asking again for a meeting to get things underway, and also called his office to ask what was the best way to get in touch with him. They put me through to his voicemail, where I left a message asking for a meeting, and also mentioned that I had just sent him some information via email that he should have a look at. No response. I waited a long time, in growing annoyance and shock. It has now been over a month since my second attempt at setting up a meeting, and nearly two months since my first attempt.

Then, two days ago, I sent him the following: ‘What on earth is going on here? Why are you ignoring all of my requests for a meeting to discuss getting this matter underway? I have lost two months because of you’. He responded in a few minutes with: ‘what time tomorrow is good’? Nothing else. I was so upset I didn't answer.

I mentioned earlier that I have a problem with anxiety. I’ve got a particular problem with being ignored or being treated as of little consequence. It really, really messes me up and basically worries me so much that I cannot do anything.

So, I don’t know what to do. Should I just pretend I am not furious and go ahead with this lawyer (and be nervous all the time that he’s going to become unresponsive again), or try to find a new one? Bear in mind I am thousands of miles away, and five time zones, and I would need to discuss all of it with the new lawyer by phone and email. And I would basically just be picking a firm off the internet with no guarantee that they would be any better. Maybe this is just how small-town lawyers are?

Yes, I know I should have done something within a few days of my first ignored email. And I know I shouldn’t have waited two months. You don’t need to tell me. It’s a problem I have, part of my anxiety.

TLDR: My lawyer has been unresponsive and is jeopardising my chances of getting things resolved quickly. I am furious and very worried. On the other hand, finding a new one will be time-consuming and there is no guarantee they will be any better. I don’t want my anger to cloud my judgment. What should I do?

240,"Its a long story but my friends have always been there for me, but lately I've had a couple tough weeks and really needed someone to just talk to and listen to me.

However she has a boyfriend, which is fine but he is just as important to me. Anyways, I texted her much more often than usual and called her a few times because of my need to vent. I'm normally not one to be needy, it was just a period of time I needed someone to talk to. Anyways, I shouldn't have done that and it didn't help that I visited her at work and gave her a gift the same day to show my appreciation for her and because I wanted to cheer her up because she wasn't having a great week either. Yes it was too much, and they took it the wrong way. Their other friend, Riley is the only one I can trust to help fix this. I told her everything that happened and confirmed that I do not have feelings for Beth. I hope they can forgive me and understand, but if they don't, I don't know what to do. I just want everything to be okay between us and that it was just a mishap. And if not, how can I make friends that provide me with the same thing they did for me, in case I lose them?

241,"I'm not sure where to start. I've [24/f] been with my boyfriend for 5 years now. We are in love and I see no end to the relationship in sight! We are currently living with his parents while I save up for a car and for a down payment for a house. My boyfriend works too and together we make a good amount but our incomes are inconsistent. I'm a stripper and he works online everyday. Things are going very well for us financially and otherwise.

But here's my problem.. His parents are both disabled and living on welfare. They are so poor that they can barely afford to eat three meals a day. They have never asked my boyfriend or I once for money but my boyfriend helps them here and there if things get bad for them and it doesn't hold us back. But his mom has gotten sicker and she might pass away within the year and if she does they are all going to become homeless. My bfs dad is challenged and his sister doesn't have any idea how to save money. His mom is the one who coupons and makes it stretch so if she dies they lose that AND her SSI money. On the way to work today my boyfriend said that if his mom dies we'll all have to move out before we have enough for a good house and won't be able to get me a car. But that's MY money I've been saving... I feel like a cunt for even thinking this.

Of course I don't want the woman to die but i cant help worrying about how this is going to effect ME financially. I am still recovering from my own financial crisis from my car accident and probably won't be able to pay my taxes. I'm worried about getting dragged down with them. Am I being too selfish? I don't believe they are looking at me as a bag of money that's gonna bail them out of poverty and homelessness but I'm afraid that's the position I'm gonna be in if something happens to effect their living situation while I'm there. I just want my boyfriend and I to have a chance to get out before their lives fall apart. I hope I can get a car before his mom dies so that the money I saved doesn't get soaked up by medical bills, their new duplex, etc. I feel the need to start a secret stash of money so that  it doesn't get used to save their asses. I love my boyfriend so I do care about I'm his family. I really do wish them the best even though I don't want to get dragged down with them. I also worry about how this would effect our relationship. I don't want him to see me as a heartless bitch that only cares about myself. I have always been able to tell him anything but I don't think I could express this to him because he's too emotionally involved.

245,Like when I brought out my wallet at school send people thought I stole it. So I showed them my ID so they thought it was fake (there is no restriction in my state as to what age you can get one and I'm surprised it's just my parents that made me do it.) Or the time I jaywalked in from of my gf and her sister. You get the point. I keep telling myself that the past is the past but it's simple things like that I beat myself up over. Help.,02Sep2017,1
246,"I'm the boy's father.

My son who is 17, has a girlfriend that he really likes and it's to the point where he is considering asking her to marry him, while I know marrying this young is kinda iffy, it's still cute he likes her this much.

However, on the flip side, she is cheating on him. I was at a local diner getting some food when I saw her come in the place with another guy. I figured maybe a relative. Then they start kissing and doing stuff, him reaching inside her shirt, her rubbing his crotch, ect.. stuff that relatives shouldn't do.

Before you ask ""How do you know it's her"". Three things, one she has half her hair dyed hot pink, so did this girl. She has a tattoo of a cross on her forearm, so did this girl. She drives a yellow SUV with a ""Honk for Jesus"" bumper sticker... so did this girl.

So that's 3 out of 3, I'm pretty sure it's not a coincidence, not to mention I recognized her voice and she waved at me when she first came in the diner.

So, how do I approach this? We are getting ready to move and the last thing I need to deal with this a depressed child who is already sad about moving, and if you add that I don't want to know how bad he'll be.

So anyone have any advice? Should I wait until after we move or break it before? Also, I know for a fact he hasn't, done anything with her because he is very adamant about not doing sexual things before marriage and says people who do are ""Idiots who can't control animal urges"".

Edit: I told him. He didn't believe me and called me a cunt and stormed off.",02Sep2017,45

249,"Had a formal aka Prom for you rednecks last night and it was unideal to say the least. Long periods of silence with me and my date and didn't get many photos taken.

It's so hard for me to just find common interests or topics for me to discuss with a girl. I'm a complete sports nut but all I talk about with chicks is school tbh which is obviously uninteresting.",02Sep2017,1
250,"I hope this isn't too silly/childish for this sub... Basically, it's almost 1am, I just spent the past hour freaking myself out by reading creepy threads and watching the challenger explosion. I'm home alone for the weekend and feeling irrationally scared lol

How do I convince myself that there are no ghosts or entities roaming the dark corners of my house, and that no one's going to rob my house in my sleep?",02Sep2017,4
251,"My grandmother's housemaid told me ten years ago that I will never find 'true love' by reading the palm of my hand. I am 22 yrs old now, gay, and never had a boyfriend. I know that I am still young but it irritates me really hard that this bi*** told me my fortune before I had the chance to 'choose' it my own way. I am an attractive dude who just has not find the Type of guy I like and I am scared that I will never find him because of my expectations which get bigger by the time. It sounds superficial but my youth and Beauty won't Last forever and I Tell myself that I have to find someone who will love me for the rest of my life, also when I get wrinkled. Please don't judge me.
My questions are:
1. Do you think you can see from your Palm your love life from the rest of your life (only Professional Palm Reader please)
2. Is it wrong to wait for the perfect guy (I know it Sounds cheesy) and should I just meet up with people who are not that interesting to me? To get experience and learn to be good in bed lol

253,"Hello! Sorry this might be long I'll just try to summarize the background and then go into y feelings about this. So right now all my friends pretty much hate me or are ignoring me right now because of last night.

last night was very over dramatic I was getting ready for a party at a friends Zach's house and another friend named Brad went to the party we were supposed to meet up early and got angry that I wasn't there in time and was planning to leave and Brad stopped communicating with me and then I was texting them to communicate w me and my anxiety started going up bc I realized they were angry with me so I tried to send a screenshot to my close friend to see how I could ease brads pain(?) but accidentally sent Brad his own conversation and he was very unresponsive when I got the party.
 
While Brad was being unresponsive another friend Zach was trying to communicate w Brad and Brad kept brushing him off because he was annoyed and doesn't like Zach so Zach had a breakdown at the party asking ME why Brad doesn't like Zach and then Zach left to his place (where I'm staying at) and I got worried and kept texting Zach if he needed anything and he just sent""what did we ever do to Brad"" ""just go have fun with Brad"" and I?? It's the next day and they're both ignoring me. 

 The whole night was a mess I never got to have any fun or enjoy myself because I was so worried about how Zach or Brad were feeling at the time and I'm just tired of caring for everyone but me!! I just want to enjoy myself once. Also how do I even handle the situation from here on out? They're both being shady or unresponsive. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this ",02Sep2017,1
