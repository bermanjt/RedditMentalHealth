0,"Skip to the 7th paragraph to skip backstory.

Backstory: In 9th grade of high school i met a guy who ended up being one of my best friends. lets name him John Doe. John, me and several other friends wold hang out during and after school. everyday for about 2-3 years. John was older then me so he graduated a year before me and moved away soon after. a 3, almost 4 year friendship gone. 

2 years goes by and now im out of school along with most of y friends. i decided to give John a call and see how he been these last few years which leads to us reconnecting. he is doing well for himself so he has his own apartment and car and what-not so whenever he has some free time we hang out. this goes on for about a year or so.

Then seemingly out of nowhere, John starts to get a crush on my lil sis. which is fine and all, she is an adult as well at this point and there really ant much i can do. out of respect for me tho. lil sis and John decide not do anything. 

Its a very bad idea for them to hook up cuz i already know both of them and can already predict what will happen. lil sis dont do relationships, she never has and probably never will. while John is a love sick puppy. if u sneeze in his direction he will fall in love with u. so all this hook up is going to do for them is, she will bust a nut for a few weeks dragging him along. and he will fall in love with her. once she is done with him she will toss him aside. he is going to be heart broken and never want to see again. she lives with me tho. so if they hook up and split up, i will lose one of my bets friends again.

well.... it happens. we all(John, lil sis, me and 3 other friends) take a vacation to the beach for a weekend and i end up getting drunk. in y drunken stuper i start thinking how awesome it would be if John and lil sis end up staying together forever. my best friend and lil sis... it could be awesome. like in the movies. 

as i predicted, they hook up and weeks later she drops him, he stops coming around and i lost my friend. it took me a few weeks to stop being mad at lil sis but i forgave her.

My issue today: So all that back story happened about 2-3 years ago. 2 weeks ago i was thinking about John and all the good times we have. so i try to call, changed his number. its been almost 3 years. new number is expected. so i try facebook, i find a pic of him with some girl on her profile. i message her asking if she can get ahold of John and let him know i wanna talk to him. i get a reply a few hours later that says ""i told him""...... ok?? so what now? i assume he dont want to talk to me, which is why i wasn't given any contact info.

 so i drop it and move on with my life. 2 days later my mother tells me that John has friended her on facebook and she was talking to him. catching up on things over the years. i think its kool that he wants to know how im doing but i still think i should wait for him to make contact with me. i already extended a hand. all he gotta do is accept it. 

fast forword to today, about 15 min ago actually. i asked my mother to use her cell phone to make a call sense my is dead. i make that call and hang up, but at the moment the call ends one of the pop-up things for facebook messenger shows up i notice its my old buddy John. 

I know i shouldn't go thru peoples messages but its my friend and my mother. how personal could it be? they probably talking about me or lil sis or something casual. whats the big deal snooping a lil to see what they talking about? right?.... right?

well it turns out that this piece of fucking shit is has been messaging my mother about hooking up with her, dating her, sending her dick pics, sending her pics of money talking about he can support her.

i dont know what to do? im thinking double homicide but there is a chance that may be to severe. im also thinking therapy but thats not severe enough.

im just gonna wait to see what reddit thinks and keep this to myself for awhile. i may need to sleep on this info for a few days to make a rational decision. ",30Sep2017,3
2,"I'm a 17 yr old female. I just got out of school this afternoon and headed to the local library to pick up a letter of recommendation from one of the employees. After collecting the letter I got in my car and started driving to the exit of the parking lot. When you pull left out of the exit you get onto a slow 25mph neighborhood street that ends with a traffic light intersection a few yards from the library exit. I make a short stop at stop sign at the library exit as I look to my right- which is a hill on 25mph neighborhood street. Then I look to my left as I see the traffic light turn and cars start heading my way. I pull out with plenty of time and room for the oncoming traffic. Then I hear a honking from behind me. I look in my mirror and there is a car right on my ass. Conveniently the traffic light turns red for me and the person behind me. I'm in the right lane and their in the left. The middle aged woman driving her car rolls down her window and proceeds to scream obscenities to me, like ""You almost fucking killed me!"" or ""You're fucking insane!""  I then rolled down my window and apologized of course but the light turned green and pulled away. I obviously felt terrible and figured I was being unobservant. But the farther I got down the road the more I thought that there was no way she wasn't speeding. As I said before: to the right of the library exit is a hill with a 25mph speed limit. Seeing a clear road and having a car almost smoke you immediately after you pull onto the road doesn't add up. Does anyone have a second opinion on this? Does anyone know how to get over this CRINGE?",30Sep2017,1
5,"So I've signed up to Reddit to ask what others would think of an idea I had to memorialise my father.

So last week, my father was killed in a single vehicle car crash. We are unsure what caused the accident, It is currently being investigated by Major Crash Investigators in my state. The car was obviously totalled.

I had the idea to buy the same model car, same colour, same wheels, everything, as a tribute to him that I could put in my garage and occasionally take for a drive. It is a fairly rare car, an Australian v8 ute. 

So my question is, should I do this or is this plain creepy?",30Sep2017,2
6,"I have a &lt;2 mile commute to my work, and thought it'd be a great idea to get some sort of electric transportation. I was thinking electric bike, but I see a big range in prices and was wondering if anyone could Offer some assistance. Thank you. ",30Sep2017,1
7,"First, this is a throwaway account due to my fear of anyone I know finding this or future employers or anything. It may be an irrational fear but whatever. 

Backstory, of course:

To compress something that would take much longer to write out than I would like, I am, or *was* on my last semester of college, but because of some stupid mistakes I made, and a supervisor's dislike of me/need for control, I was basically ""suspended"" (not technically on my record, but for lack of a better word, that's the way to describe it.)

I live nearly 300 miles away from home, and the only friends I have around here are people in my major. So when I got kicked out, I lost contact with all of them, since I no longer have class or anything with them. They all are constantly working in what  would kind of be considered an internship so I can't see them during the day. All my other friends live way far away, and I don't have much communication with them.

My boyfriend lives nearly 1500 miles away. Recently, though, it feels like he wants to talk to me less and less. We would talk on the phone every night, but usually he says very little to me. Usually, it was okay because we would have conversations, tell jokes, etc., but lately it's been much quieter than what it used to be. In fact, two nights ago, he told me that ""we don't have to talk on the phone every night."" Then he proceeded to tell me that it was okay to send him a text. So I haven't talked to him since then and feel like we're only talking on his terms. Let me be 100% clear, and this is going to sound super cliché, but he is not a bad guy. He is very sweet, has never raised a hand to me, never has forced me into doing something I'm not comfortable with, if I ask him to stop, he stops. I am head over heels for this man. He has in no way ever been manipulative, cruel, etc. However, this decision he has made in terms of us speaking has broken my heart.

I am working as an unpaid intern right now, and I am living in this building for free (they say that supplying me with shelter is my payment, and I would agree.) There are no windows, it is a metal building, and it's not in the safest of neighborhoods. I find it hard to wake up in the mornings because I feel so exhausted and there is no light in the room.

I have no money, though I'm currently searching for a job. I haven't had a whole lot of experience in the areas that most companies are hiring, and, like I said earlier, I don't really know anyone here other than people at school. The people who work at the place where I'm interning are old men.

I have bipolar depression, so that's really affected my handling of this, I suppose. It's really hard to feel happy.

I honestly don't know what to do. I can't move back home because I'm obligated to complete my internship for this semester. My heart is broken, I feel so alone, and I only go out so I can walk around and not get cabin fever. I'm not sure if this is the place to post this, but I thought it was worth a shot, I guess. If anyone knows what to do or how I can fix this situation, please, please, please, let me know.",30Sep2017,2
8,"This one needs some background, I'll try to keep it short. My friend, his girl, and I move out to Ca. On the drive out my buddy and his girl fight, seems pretty bad, I've never seen my friend so pissed. Her and I get food while he storms off.

Fast forward a couple months and I fall for this chick. Yeah it was weird, I tried to ignore this girl but conversation was easy and i enjoyed being around her. These feelings were ignored and nothing happened between us, but apparently my buddy saw how happy she was around me and apparently their relationship was not so enjoyable. 

me and this girl are drinking one night and my friend storms out of the house, flips a shit texting her and raging on that she is a terrible person. apparently this has been happening alot. Then she admitted to having feelings for me and had them all along, saying similar things i thought before. Started with a hug, then a kiss, then wriggled across the entire living room floor.. sure was intense. Meanwhile, my friend was outside walking around ended up punching himself in the head multiple times. Eventually comes back to the apartment bloodied, screaming in a wild demon voice while bashing his own head. She tells him its over and will not reconcile. Everyone felt like a piece of shit that night.

My Buddy still doesn't know I slept with her, she broke it off and moved home. Problem is we still have feelings for each other and are still talking. We wanted to, but have not told my buddy. Don't know if he can emotionally handle it, he messaged girl about killing himself on that one night. Though i'm not sure if it was a serious threat. 

Do i tell my buddy even if he might really hurt himself?
I'm crazy about this girl and she says she feels the same, should i stop talking to her? 
Do i leave my buddy and the apartment to be with this girl?

I want some real advice and it's frustrating I can't get that advice without the auto moderator removing my post. I then have to go through the time consuming process of contacting a moderator to unremove my post. By the time that happens it's already drifted behind everyone elses without any advice.

When the thread is new is when it matters most because people can then see it, upvote it and comment. If it doesn't get any responses from the start it gets burred and then I don't get the advice I need. :(

13,"This happened around 6 years ago when I was like 12. I didn’t have any friends that were girls because I didn’t exactly know how to talk to girls. My brother was my best friend and boys were easier to talk to so all my friends were mainly guys. So basically we would hangout and do dumb kid stuff that would make the neighbors angry and usually end up getting in trouble. Sometimes we would split up to see who could do more stuff faster. 

Basically one day we split up at I went with this one guy (I’m just gonna call him Jake). Jake was really cool and funny. He had just moved here and everyone loved him. I was young and didn’t actually care about relationships and didn’t really have an interest in my friends. Anyways he said he wanted to show me this cool place he found so me being 12 and trusting I of course followed him. We went to some guys back yard but there was a fence. Jake told to climb it and he would push me over. I was around 5 feet and Jake was around 6. As odd as it sounds he was one of the tallest people I’ve ever met in my life. I turned to start climbing and this is where it got bad. 

I thought he would push me up but instead he pulled me down and pressed his body against mine. I freaked out but he was a lot stronger than me so I couldn’t get him off. Then he started kissing me and touching me and he slid his hands into my pants. I started crying and he told me I was square and some other stuff. I kept trying to get him off but then he started to squeeze my arm really hard so I eventually stopped. Then a few minutes later the owner of the house showed up and told us to get off of his property. He kindly apologized and grabbed me to walk me home. On the way home he told me not to tell anyone so I never did. 

I currently have next to no guy friends. I actually completely forgot about the incident until I went to a party and a guy grabbed me from behind. Then I freaked out and had a mental breakdown. Like I couldn’t stop crying and I know he didn’t mean to freak me out like that. I’m just wondering if there’s anything I should do about all of this. Or if I should wait a few years to see if I’ll forget it again. ",30Sep2017,1

I recently started a new job (about a month ago) and I got a text from my previous boss asking me to send them an email from my new company domain ""say[ing] thanks for everything or whatever you like"".

16,"There's a girl who rides the same bus as me and we see each other for about 2 hours every day. She's really easy to talk to and funny and nice. I get the feeling she's flirting with me, I.E. moving really close to me, touching, frequent eye contact and the general way she talks to me. The thing is, she has a boyfriend, and she's said his name on a couple occasions. Obviously I'm not going to ask her out unless she's single because #1 I might be taking this the wrong way and #2 I wouldn't do that to another guy. But if she makes a move on me, what should I do?

19,"Hey all, 
 
26 here. 
On a kinsey spectrum, I'm more gay than straight. The reason I say it like this is because I do find girls sexually attractive as well, just not so much as men. I have enjoyed watching gay porn for the past 10 years or so, sometimes I watch straight porn. I only started to experiment sexually about 2 years ago. That means before that I had never kissed anyone. Because I was so into men when watching porn I decided I'd experiment with guys first. I have loved it so far. I have never done anal however (top or bottom), just not into it. I haven't experimented with women yet. 

Here's the dilemma, I'm not out. To anyone. Also, I'm in a very conservative religion, culture, family, community. Coming out as bisexual or gay would end my life effectively. No ifs or buts. 

I'm also at the ripe age of getting married, so I'm always getting told to find a good girl and settle down. 

My question is, has any man who's more gay than straight, been married to a woman? Especially, if they have experimented with guys before and loved it. 

If so, please speak out, and offer some advice please!!!",30Sep2017,4

22,"Hi, my friend recommended me to go here. This is my first time on reddit.

As the title suggests, I have anorexia nervosa. I've had it for around 3-4 years now. I've been trying to get better for the past two years, with varying success. I've tried going cold turkey and trying to eat, but it always ends up with me throwing up or running it off. I used to talk to an online therapist, before my father blocked it on the wifi.

I can't get help from my family, because they believe mental illness doesn't exist. I can't get medical treatment because of it. My friends can only help so much.

Right now, it's nighttime, past dinner. I've had a total of 69 (ha ha) calories today, from when I caved and ate a cookie. All day I've been distracted and angry and unable to think straight, as well as keeping my eyes open. I'm currently under two comforters and I can't stop shivering.

34,"I've been dating my girlfriend for two years and from the start I've known she has anxiety and I've adjusted to her triggers and have reduced it for her as much as I can. We have a long distance relationship during college where she's about 45 minutes away and so she's alone with her friends. 

She's had suicidal thoughts in the past and those were rough nights but it only happened a few times in our relationship. I would support her and we would talk on the phone for hours and I would say how much she means to me and help her as much as I could (this was last school year).

This school year she's has two nights one last friday the other tonight where she would just text me asking me how she should kill herself and I just don't know what to do. She says there is no point to her life and I tell her that I'm there for her and that her family is there for her. She just brushes me off and has been telling me that everything I say is just a lie and just let her go. Then tonight she said she was going to take NyQuil and that just scared the shit out of me. I said that's not a good idea because she doesn't have a cold. She just said she has a cold, although I talked to her on the phone yesterday and she sounded fine and she usually tells me about her being sick because we text all day. 

She's also been going to see a counselor at her school to help her with her thoughts and anxiety. From what I've noticed is that after seeing the counselor it's increased her sadness where she gets very depressed at least twice a week one being suicidal thoughts. The counselor hasn't seemed to give her any advice to help her cope with these thoughts except that she should see a psychiatrist and get medicine to help. So I'm not sure if this counselor is actually helping her or just making her mental illness come out more frequently.

So my question is what do I do to help her when she feels like this. Recently she's been brushing me off when she feels this way and has been not taking any of my calls. I try to say that I'm there for her and if she needs to talk just call me. She just calls me a liar or just says ""right"" but sarcastically. I've been considering texting her sister and letting her know what's been happening because I just don't know what to do and maybe her family can help more than I can. My gf just tells me not to tell anyone and if her sister did text her telling my gf that I told her sister that might push her over the edge and would just make it worse.

44,"My family lives in apartment complex on the east coast and we have a two year old.  The downstairs neighbor keeps pounding on our ceiling because the way my son walks.  He likes to run everywhere instead of walk and they said when I went down to talk to them that they want to enjoy their space and they can't with the noise and we shouldn't be living in an apartment.  He also insulted my parenting style for allowing this.  We've talked to management and they said the guy and his husband are crazy for pounding on our ceiling but told us to take care of it.  It's stressing out my pregnant wife and I am about to explode with rage.  Also, they will often play music late at night that's loud enough for me to hear the lyrics (and still the music with noise cancelling headphones on)and feel it pulsating while sitting on the couch. I have video evidence of this from 10pm two fridays ago

49,"My sister was friends with this man for about a year. They never dated, but he frequently tried for more. 

His behavior escalated slowly, but followed the classic cycle of abuse: he did something crazy, and then would apologize, cry, and buy her expensive or meaningful things. She would swear she was going to stop talking to him, and then he would weasel his way back in somehow (which was soooooo frustrating to watch).

Some examples of things he did include: calling her upwards of 80 times a day, refusing to let her out of his car, chasing her down the freeway in his car while she was on foot, calling her work pretending to be someone else, calling from different cell phones and blocked numbers, sending her expensive gifts in the mail, etc. 

Anyway, she finally went no contact with him, and he's lost his goddamn mind. The constant calling has continued, he's sending her expensive medical equipment specific to her courses somehow, and she just got videos sent to her from the girl in her nursing class that show him offering her $1,000 to befriend my sister and stage a meeting with him where she doesn't know he's there. 

She called the police, they gave her a case number, but the officer she talked to said he hasn't done anything illegal yet.

What should we be doing? Are there any resources available for this sort of thing? Is this really not illegal? How can we document this well?

53,"Hi

So I live in a crowded little apartment complex with little available parking, in a very college town. Last night and through the morning, there was a car parking me in about halfway. As there was also a car in the spot next to me and I didn't need to leave, I decided not to risk it and stay put.

This morning I was still semi-parked in, but the car next to me had moved. I saw that there was just barely enough room for me to pull out, so very carefully I did and all was well.

This afternoon I got a note on my door saying that I parked in their spot (not assigned) and they blocked me in because of it. They claimed I ""scraped off the paint"" and asked for my insurance information or they will call the cops and file a hit and run. I just received another note, this time MUCH more passive aggressive , saying I have until tomorrow afternoon to give them the info or they will file the hit and run, going on about how it will go on my record etc.

I have taken many photos of my car since with no obvious damage, called the (non-emergency) police as well as my insurance company and let them know what happened. Insurance co. advised me against giving them my info at this time. Is there anything else I should do? Should I respond and just say i'm not going to give it to them?

62,"first time posting. really at a point where i don't know how to rid myself of this shitty situation. excuse the grammar and formatting.

i'll try to keep this composed and not ramble. 

me and this girl (let's call her M) have been friends since preschool. our grandpas were friends so we'd hang out a lot on her farm and at each others houses. she is who i considered to be my best friend.

she was a good friend to my face. we shared a lot of great memories together like going to the fair every year and we pretty much molded each other into who we are today. 

it wasn't always smooth sailing. M is a compulsive liar. 

throughout our friendship she'd do little things to manipulate me, like lying to me about her ex who i was also friends with to make me hate him. she'd lie about stupid things like whether or not we had homework, then once confronted she'd deny everything. 
i never really caught onto it but she was actively molding my thoughts and was in constant control of who i was friends with.

at the start of high school M told me one of my friends (V) was talking shit about me and naturally i believed her. i wanted to confront her myself but she said she'd ""handle it"". what she really did was tell the same exact story to V to make her hate me as well, all because she didn't like how close we were getting. 

V and i had a constant feud until we went on a school trip (without M) and had to stay in a hotel room together and that's when the truth came out. we rekindled our friendship and i decided i'd confront M about it when i got back. 

M denied everything and said it was a misunderstanding. she kept apologizing and saying she's glad we were able to become friends again. at that point my trust for her was starting to diminish but i gave her another chance.

fast forward a year, another friend gets into the mix (C) who starts hanging out with M more and more. M starts telling C personal details about my life ""accidentally"" and that really pissed me off. 

we got in our first ""major"" fight and she took it upon herself to tell even more people about my shit. we finally made up but she never apologized.

my mental and physical health started to get really bad and that had an impact on school. i was in and out of hospitals and seeing sleep specialists, and i was rarely at school that year. she said she'd help me get caught up on schoolwork but she didn't.

she would say to my face how none of this is my fault and that i could get caught up in school. she'd be my shoulder to cry on, she'd spend nights at my house distracting me from all of the shit that was going on, and things seemed okay.

it wasn't.

i found out from C that she pretty much lied about how she felt about me. she told C that i'm ""too depressing to be around"" and that i'm doing really bad, that i'm probably gonna fail school. i only found out about that yesterday.

other little things tipped me off like her leaving my parents wedding early to go hang out with C then complained about how ""belligerent and annoying"" my entire family is, which C told me yesterday as well.

last month i had a party at my house for my 18th birthday and invited a bunch of friends over. she got in a fight with someone and came to me saying ""oh don't believe what she said she started it she hit my arm and called me a bitch she talked shit about you in your own house"" before i could get the other side of the story.
according to everyone else who was there, she was talking shit about the other girls boyftiend who was on the couch across from her. she then punched her in the face. 

i was pissed off and confused and made both of them leave. the other girl has since apologized (although it wasn't her fault the fight started in the first place) but M never did.

we ignored each other for almost a whole month. she then messaged me asking like nothing happened asking to hang out. i messaged C about it and she told me eeeverything.

i don't know what to do. i realize now how dangerous she is, she can manipulate people really easily, she could do the same to me. 

i still haven't answered her message. i don't know if i should tell her off or just keep ignoring her. i also don't know how to come to terms with this. she was a good friend to me despite all of the lies. i keep making excuses for why she did the things she did but i have no reason to go back to being her friend. 

this is the worst pain i've ever felt. 11 years of friendship ended up just being lies. i'm scared and spent most of the day crying. this really reaaally sucks. ",30Sep2017,1

1 cup of rolled oats, 1 cup of green tea and 1l of water (breakfast).

1 grated carrot, 4 cups of lettuce, sprouts and cucumber.

After school I will eat 1 cup of frozen fruit (strawberries) and 2 glasses of unsweetened almond milk.

For dinner I will have a vegetable patty (191 calories) and 5 cups of lettuce vegetables, 1 cup of green tea.

Before bed I will have 1 cup of green tea too, in total 4 litres of water and I will take an iron supplement.

I think this is around 800 calories. I guess I'm just looking for what other people think. Please don't remove this, I'm being serious. I feel so out of control and just need to feel some form of control and to become a low weight. I'm sorry if this doesn't really make sense.

70,"Hey, I'm in a bewildering and worriesome place in life now, and I wanted to get your advice.  Context: me 25M, her 21F.

So during the summer, I met a girl, and we got along amazingly.  So much so, that we became boyfriend/girlfriend; this was a huge milestone for me, since I never had a real romantic relationship (last one would technically be back in high school, which ended in a break-up over that girl cheating on me, but I digress).

Well around July, as we're making a big trip to another city to see a concert, she tells me that she's moving back to her parent's place - an hour from where I live - and that she wants to go travel Europe as soon as she saves up money (for a few months, is what she told me).  For me, I was worried: this was my first relationship, and while I was happy to hear her having such a great plan, I work full-time at a warehouse (which pays very well and has opportunities to move up, so I didn't want to give that job up - she did ask me to travel with her) so I can't join her in Europe for that long, and her moving back made me think that it was going to turn into a long-distance relationship, which I wasn't sure I was comfortable with - this was my first relationship, and I had no experience with this kind of thing before.  That, and I was worried the distance would dull our relationship and wither it out, which I was even more distraught over.  We discussed it here and there, but it was never as detailed as I would've hoped, and I only had a month left with her until she moved back.

On the night before she moves out, I have a panic attack at her place; I've gone through depression and anxiety for a lot of my life (was starting to finish up therapy prior to this night), but I never had a full-blown panic attack, and it was a genuinely terrifying experience.  In the morning after, exhausted and having to go to work soon, she asks if I want to break up.  I bleakly mutter ""yeah"", thus ending our summer relationship.  I called her after work that day to clarify things and tell her how I hope she could understand, but it didn't end so well there.

I felt horrible about it, and so ashamed that I couldn't bring myself to talk to her.  It wasn't until a month later, just a few days ago, when she reaches out to me again, telling me that she misses me, that I get the chance to talk to her about it; how I felt, how I managed it (badly, I would say), and whether we can make amends, since we still have feelings for each other.  Things are... not going so great in the discussion.  Her parents don't understand things and don't know why she even bothers with talking to me now; I've offered to go back to therapy and give up gaming (which, despite being fun, I think has taken my time away from a lot of other things in my life and it's time anyways to get back on track), while she is gauging my responses, making sure I'm not just a ""fuckboy"" who is trying to get back with her.

I'm worried I lost a potentially great relationship because of a panic attack I had no control over, and I'm not sure who is right and who is wrong.  Is there any way to salvage this situation?

EDIT: She is coming back down to my area this coming week for an appointment, and I've worked out a way for me to get off work so I can go and (her willing) talk to her in person.  Good/bad idea?",30Sep2017,1
71,"My girlfriend is being harassed by a mentally handicapped kid. He's in the assisted cheerleading squad for disabled students at our high school, so he's in attendance at every football game. She shows up to most games in the front of the student section and during halftime he comes over to find her. He usually asks to hold her hand, to hug her legs, to hug her, to sit on her lap, for her to pat his head and for her number. He'll reach for her hand and wrap his arms and body around her and her legs as he does this. She isn't the only girl that he does this to, but when he sees her he'll usually make a beeline for her. Basically all the girls that he asks, including her, feel obligated to comply to his requests, some (especially the ones not being targeted) externally voicing how it's ""cute"" or ""endearing,"" but when I try to imagine it from their point of view I can't help but feel as if there's some unspoken uneasiness about the whole situation that results from the general stigma of speaking out against the mentally disabled. Unfortunately, she's a grade below and I just entered my first year of college, so I can't always be there to block him off from her, but I do come home every few weeks. Today was the first time I witnessed it for myself, and what she claimed was true, in that he went through that list of requests/demands at least a few times before wandering off somewhere else. I tried to distract him with unrelated conversation, also inquiring a bit about what he wanted, but he generally ignored me in favor of pursuing her. I felt hesitant to physically tear him away because my girlfriend vocally acquiesed to his requests and because of that same aforementioned stigma. I'm also not sure if he's able to control his strength or temper and don't want any unnecessary violence to break out. There is no one that's really watching him during this period of time and I don't know if many people have actually voiced complaints about this either. After I had managed to finally distract him to the point where he had wandered away, the both of us agreed that we felt uncomfortable about the situation. I quickly looked for a reddit thread with a similar situation and found something about a mentally handicapped customer sexually harassing female employees. While I might offend some by classifying his innocence as harassment, I do believe that my girlfriend's feeling uncomfortable is enough to warrant intervention. The thread mentioned some similar experiences, and the main piece of advice that people gave was to be particularly direct about voicing the issue. They recommended saying things like ""stop it [name], (I don't like that/don't touch me),"" ""no [name], you can't (hug me/have my number/sit on my lap),"" and ""[name], please go away and stop bothering me"" so that the handicapped can get a clear indication of what the bothered party wants. I told my girlfriend to try these lines and to tell her friends that are going to be standing next to her what she intends to do before he shows up. What I'm afraid of is that a) he won't listen b) he'll just keep coming back even if he does listen for a bit and c) she might give in after enough persistence, which is what some people warned against (acquiescing). It feels relieving to share this with others, and I'd really appreciate any sort of advice that you guys might have to offer. I just hate that this situation is even a thing in the first place, because I understand that he doesn't understand the boundaries because they either haven't been properly established and/or his brain has a hard time with it. I also really dislike that near-palpable stigma-based silence, and this has honestly gotten me thinking about a lot of similar harassment issues that people of all different kinds face without recognition of its not being ok, among other things.

84,"So I'm 22 years old,I have a job. I make about $13 per hour as an unloader. I dropped out of college,and I'm trying to save up money to go back.Unfortunately,I don't have a car(well I did). Anyways the problem is this I rely on Uber and Lyft for transportation back and forth and it costs me $30 every day. I work Mon-Fri. So thats about $190 and I only get paid around $250. Which goes fast as hell by the next week its gone.

I'm currently working part-time,but I applied for Full-Time at my job Fedex. So my question is this What do I do? I plan on taking the road test  to get my drivers license tomorrow,but even then I'm just thinking to my self is it even worth it?Because I still don't have a car,and that'll be less money I'll have next week. 

What should I do? My mom can't bring me because of her schedule,and even if she could I work overnights some times 11:30-5 am or 3 to 8 am. I absolutely hate using Uber and Lyft,but I have no choice. Should I quit the job,and find something closer or should I just be patient and wait?

92,"This is going to be long, I apologize. 

I've been having an affair with a married man who is also a co-worker. It hasn't been long, just a few months. His wife messaged me a few days ago asking me if my co-worker has mentioned anything about their relationship to me and how they're having a rough time lately. She also asked me not to tell him that she messaged me. 
I replied telling her that we don't talk about 'personal' matters. Our conversation is purely work related. (a lie). I also was very friendly to her - I thought it was the polite thing to do. 

A little back story : (let's call the guy X) 
X and I are in love with each other. X claims that he's planning on leaving his wife, which he definitely is because we're going to look for a place of our own next week. 
At this point they are just living together. They barely talk or do anything together. The wife claims she loves him and throws all sorts of tantrums when X tries to pull away. She was also abusive both physically and verbally at one point. They've had this conversation of getting separated. Suffice it to say they don't love each other anymore, they're just hanging on because of their kids. (or at least X is) 

He has two kids. He's only taking this long because of his kids. I understand why. 

Now I'm not sure if I should tell X that his wife messaged me saying how he means the world to her and how much she loves him and how things are very bad lately. I'm scared of losing him, but at the same time I don't think I can keep this from him.

What should I do? Should I tell X?

95,"Hey everyone, so this might sound lame but I really need help with this. My mom hasn't talked to me in like 3 weeks or so after catching me and my boyfriend asleep on the couch. Now we were NOT having sex, we literally fell asleep. He was sitting while I sorta lay down my head on his lap. When I woke she had just entered the room. We didn't fight or argue. I just sat down properly and went on my phone like no big deal. Ever since then she has not talked to me, gives me disgusting looks, and has tried to make family members stop hanging out with me even during family meals. This is really stressful because it makes the whole house feel unwelcome and you can feel the tension in the room whenever we are near each other. 

I guess it didn't help that the day before I had sorta told her she's not a very strict parent with my brother and that maybe she should be, that way he would do his homework. Somehow the conversation turned into an argument. In the end I told her she needed to stop treating me like her ex abusive husband (my dad) just because we look alike. She denied she ever did until I started bringing out evidence about it. After the argument we were still talking until she caught me sleeping on the couch the next day.

I don't know what to do. I'm to poor to move out even though I have a job. My mental illness has been out of control since this incident. I feel so lame even asking for help because I'm 27 year old woman and living with my mom.

Well I came home today and noticed my book was missing. I asked her and she starting smiling and said I thought is was for me? I was baffled, it’s clearly a book not a letter.

97,"First off, I’m not even sure if this belongs in this thread.  If it does not, please do let me know and i will move it to the appropriate thread.

&amp;nbsp;

4 years ago, for financial reasons, I had to withdraw from my university.  I was a sophomore moving onto my junior year with decent GPA (at least for my standards, 3.7).  I am a business major for a fairly well known university in the states.  I’m an out-of-state student, so my tuition was off the charts (US Citizen living in another country, b/c my family lives/works there).  Since withdrawing, I moved back home and started to work in marketing - my parents knew people so they just let me work.  Started as an intern and worked for the sake of making money.   I’ve saved up quite a bit of money and have invested my money into online courses.  I was always curious about coding so i took a few coding classes and i felt like it was something i would like to get deeply into.  As a business major, I have border-line decided that i want to switch majors to computer science and switch universities as well. 


&amp;nbsp;



As i have worked for 3+ years, I have saved up about $25,000.  At this point, i’m more concerned about graduating than attending a big name school.  Of course it would be the best if i could find a middle ground - a school that is decently known and affordable.  


&amp;nbsp;


I’ve searched around and asked acquaintances, and have heard good thing about taking online courses to get a degree, or apply to a university that proves online courses.  I’ve looked into a school called ‘SMC (Santa Monica College) which was affordable AND provides online courses - which means that i could continue to work and take the classes online in my off-time.  Furthermore, they have a program that allows there students to transfer to UC schools depending on the student’s status - GPA and what not.  This program caught my eye, as I know that UC Berkley has a well-known computer science program, and at the moment, I guess i’m pretty confident that with my GPA from my previous university, transferring into Berkley will be possible.  


&amp;nbsp;


But the catch is, due to the financial difficulties when i was attending university, i have yet to pay off my last semester there.  I owe the school about $20,000.  Furthermore, i would need to pay that amount off in order for me to received my transcript, which i would need if i was to transfer schools.  


&amp;nbsp;


I have a few questions that i would like to ask the community and any insight or answer will be greatly appreciated, really.


&amp;nbsp;


As mentioned above, I want to transfer schools/majors.  If i do, i would need to take entry level courses (pre-requisites) for a computer science major.  Which basically means i have to take freshman/sophomore level classes again.  Would it be better to apply to SMC (or other suggested universities) as a freshman? or as a transfer student with my previous transcript.  IF so, this would mean that i would have to pay off the $20,000 i owe to my previous university.  Don’t get me wrong, i definitely plan on paying back the money, but i’m not sure if right now is the time to pay it off…  


&amp;nbsp;


If i apply to SMC (or other universities) as a freshman, I would have more money saved up and could potentially transfer into another school with more money on my back (to pay for tuition then….)


&amp;nbsp;


I have friends that have attended SMC and have transferred into well known UC schools - Davis, Berkley, LA - and even USC.  One side of me is telling me to apply so SMC and the other side is telling me to finish off the 2 years at my previous school.  


&amp;nbsp;


Besides SMC, i have looked into other universities that provide online courses - like Florida University - which is also apparently very well known, but the tuition is similar to that of my previous university to it isn’t that high on my ‘would like to go to this school list’


&amp;nbsp;


If you all have some advice, university/program suggestions, or any other general knowledge that may be helpful to my situation, it would mean  a lot to me.


&amp;nbsp;


Thank you for reading and wish you all the best :)

**TLDR**: Business major that had to withdraw from university b/c no money.  Good GPA (3.7), but no transcript b/c i don’t have money to pay off my tuition.  Want to switch majors to computer science.  Don’t know if i should apply as a freshman to a new school or pay off my debt to my previous school and apply as a transfer with my good GPA.  Also don’t know what schools to transfer to.  Im poor and want to finish college.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",30Sep2017,1

115,"Ok so just a fair warning this may be a bit of a long post. 

Ok, so what is happening right now where I live, is my dad is going to leave when the lease is up at this 3 bedroom apartment where me, my parents and my sister live. Me and my sister have jobs but my mom has no job. She has serious depression and anxiety and she thinks she isn't capable of getting a job and keeping one. I think she could, but she just doesn't have much self confidence or self worth. She's been in an on and off marriage with my dad for years. Well, he feels like his needs aren't being met so he wants to just leave. He's done this before, things get hard between him and my mom and he always tries to leave. 
Anyway, me and my family have kinda become co dependent on one another. Yeah it's true, me and my sister should have moved out already, since I'm 28 and she's 30, but we've faced problems of our own. I'm sure some of you might judge and be like you're 28 and still living with your parents? Yeah, that's right. I am. I'm not proud of it, but I've kinda just become complacent over the years.
Anyway, if he leaves it will really complicate our situation. We've all made ends meet together over the years, me and my sister pay rent, my dad would take care of the bills, and things were fine. But if my dad leaves it will strain our financial situation. I'm diabetic, and I'm on a version of Medicaid where if I make too much money, I could lose my insurance. Then I won't be able to afford the medicine that keeps me alive and helps me maintain my disease. I've looked into getting other insurance, and it's just been hard to find something affordable. My employer only offers insurance if I work 30 hours a week for an average of a year, but if I do that, my current insurance will be lost and I will be in a shitty situation. I know I should probably look for a job that pays better and has better insurance coverage. But change isn't always easy. It definitely hasn't been for me. My sister makes good money but she lives to spend money. She doesn't like being at home, so she goes and hangs out with her friends, goes to concerts, spends a ton of money on alcohol, etc. she spends her money even worse than I do. Anyway, I kinda veered off topic there but that was a little backstory.

Anyway, onto the biggest problem I have: my dad. I'm so angry at him. The way he's treated my mom, the stress and hell he's put her through. My mom already has clinical depression I'm pretty sure, where every day is a battle just to get out of bed. Just to be alive and not have a meltdown. I guess he's not satisfied with the ""progress"" my mom has made where her depression is concerned. She's been depressed for years, heavily, and it's like he just expects her to change overnight. I know it probably isn't easy being married to someone who's depressed. But that's another thing about my dad, he's just not very compassionate, understanding or loving. He acts like it's my moms duty to serve him whenever he pleases, like it's her obligation to just because they're married. Make his lunch for work, cut his hair, have sex with him. That's also another thing. I think he raped my mom. She didn't want to have sex with him, but he kinda forced himself on her. I don't know if this happened once, or multiple times. But it explains a lot. Also, it's kinda ironic how he has this big issue with masturbation, but he will force himself on my mom or act like she's obligated to have sex with him just because they're married. I haven't been married, but the way I see it, just because someone is married to you doesn't mean they have to have sex with you whenever you want it. Sadly, I think that's why he wants to just leave. Personally I don't care if he leaves. I'm kind of disgusted that he's my father. 

To be completely blunt, I think my dad is mentally ill. You can't be honest with him about anything, he gets so defensive and argumentative and angry. But he has no problems criticizing you. He perceives any kind of truth where he's concerned as hostility. You can't tell him shit. He also sees nothing wrong with the way he treats others. He will be a complete dickhead and he always finds some way to justify it. It's very rare that he apologizes. Where my mom is concerned it just seems like he's been very manipulative, especially when it comes to her and her emotions. He's even had the gall to try and make her feel guilty for having depression, like she chose to be this way. He claims he has anxiety and depression, but I think he must not have any idea what it's like, looking down on my mom for feeling that way, especially when he's probably a big part of the reason why she is the way she is. He sees nothing wrong with giving us little notice that he's splitting and leaving us to just figure out our lives when we've all been somewhat co dependent over the years. I think things will be fine, I sure as hell won't miss him, he's brought a lot of stress and tension to our home life because well, I just explained why. He's not an easy person to live with. I try not to worry about how we're gonna make up the money he used to make, but if he wants to just leave, well, no one is going to beg him to stay. 

I know our situation seems complicated and depressing. But what can I even do? I kinda worry for the future, because things just seem so dire. He's supposed to leave at the end of October, but that's the thing. He changes his mind quite frequently. I for one don't want him to stay. I kinda think he's a vile person and he should just leave. But at the same time my mom will have to find a job, which won't be easy for her, or I'll have to hurry and find a better job. It just seems like the winds of change are coming and I'm a little frightened to be honest. ",30Sep2017,1

120,"So I have really bad teeth, to the point where I have a missing front tooth that I haven't been able to get fixed yet. The problem is that my insurance ran out and I have to re-apply for it, and last time it took about 4 months for everything to get approved. I really don't want to wait that long. The problem is, I'm a 19 year old college student, I have like 2500 dollars that I could spend on getting my teeth fixed, but then I wouldn't have any money for car insurance, or gas for getting to college every day. 
My teeth have looked awful for years, and I can't stand it anymore. Part of it also is that it seems like there's mutual interest with me and a girl in one of my classes, and I would never ask someone out with a missing tooth. Honestly, I don't even smile by showing my teeth anymore, I can't remember the last time I actually smiled with my teeth showing. I'm too embarrassed by them, and I've been trying to get them fixed for years. Every time I try to get them fixed I get screwed over one way or another, so I don't know what to do anymore.

122,"I started talking to this girl, and the day we met she asked to hangout. We ended up watching a college football game in my dorm room (keeper, right?) and quickly began cuddling, with her eventually falling asleep with her head in my lap.

The very next day, she again asked to hangout, and it was a night of Netflix and spooning. At some point when I was stroking her arm, I brushed against her hand and she ended up grabbing mine and we held hands the rest of the night. Both nights we were able to converse really well and everything seemed to be going great. 

Two days later, we end up getting dinner at Applebee's, which again went really well, and we hung out at her place afterward, which consisted entirely of cuddling and hand holding. The night ending once again with her falling asleep in my arms. 

A day or two later, I went to the local sub shop with some of my friends and I saw her there with another guy. My first thought was to overreact, but I figured it was just a friend of hers, so I ended up texting her later that day asking about it. She told me ""I should've said something sooner, but I'm just not into you that way. I'd still like to be friends because you're a great guy and I really enjoyed hanging out with you.""

Now, before I give off that niceguy vibe, I understand she doesn't have to like me or feel that way about me, but everything that happened the three times we hung out gave off an entirely different vibe. I mean I just really didn't get it. To me, cuddling and holding hands are a fairly big indicator she would like me like that, and falling asleep with me an even bigger sign.

But, that's just backstory. I don't really have any pride, and I had only known this girl for a little over a week, so I figured I could try and be friends with her. We got food at the cafeteria a few times and hung out another, intermittently talking, but it was completely killing me inside. I come to find out I fell really freaking hard for her, and it was eating me alive.

I can't keep this facade up, so should I just straight up tell her ""I still have feelings for you and can't be friends right now.""? Or is that too selfish? Should I just text her out of the blue and tell her all of this, or should I try to in person to have a better gauge on her reaction?

TL;DR: I fell hard for this girl who rejected me but said she wanted to still be friends (and showed she did too). Being around her has been eating me alive, so should I tell her I can't keep this up? ",30Sep2017,1
123,"My wife is so out of touch with life outside of her job. 

I'm the stay at home parent (dad) living in a very small rural town that we begrudgingly moved to when my wife accepted a teaching job. Despite trying to make the best of things, there is nothing here for me. It's dreadfully boring and dead. I'm miserable here. Neither of us is happy here. My wife knows that I am especially unhappy here due to not being able to contribute financially. There are no jobs, let alone part time evening jobs. It is economically depressed. To give you an idea of the demographics, in 5 years from now, over 40% of the population in this area will be over the age of 65.

My wife's meagre salary isn't nearly enough. Though in her mind it is her job that is ""keeping us going"", in my mind her job is what is preventing us from moving ahead and out of catastrophe's reach. We're **well** within its reach as it stands now. 

She's away from 7:15am to 4-5pm every weekday. Which means that when she's around home on the weekend, she acts surprised that, for example, the car still shouldn't be driven until the belt tensioner and alternator is replaced (I can do *a lot* of repairs, but I need the parts), or that our son's tricycle is broken. We don't have money to buy a new trike, let alone to fix the car. 

I am doing an online course during the couple of hours I can stay awake in the evenings after our son goes to sleep. However, it's difficult to put a lot of energy into it when it is using up all of my ""me time"". I'm also unsure that online learning is the best option (although it's the only option here). 

I would prefer to live in a place where we are both happy and where we can have 2 incomes. I've toured internationally as a musician. If we moved to a city, I'd be able to gig AND continue to be a SAHD. 

I've tried everything. Nothing gets through to her. We will never be able to move away if we continue like this. She has the recurring idea that we'll somehow be able to save money. It's a dream. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm almost inclined to take the rest of the money that is reserved for my courses and put it towards our move. That way we can both have incomes and be able to pay for things without going into as much debt, not to mention all of us being happier. 

I am 100% committed to my son. I want what's best for him. I want to be the happy and fun dad that I really am, but it has been getting very difficult. ",30Sep2017,3
124,"I moved to a new neighborhood a few months ago. One of my neighbors is a blind veteran that works from home and has no family nearby. Apparently, he was decent friends with the lady that used to live in my house. I'm not sure how often they hung out, but she gifted him his cat as an emotional-support pet. Since I moved in, I've done basic neighborly favors. I made him cookies when I first moved in and a no-bake casserole once when we lost power. I'll bring his trash back up from the street when I see he hasn't, sometimes I'll grab his mail from his mailbox and put it at his front door.

But recently I've felt like I'm not helping him enough. He seems depressed since he just hangs out in his house all day and never leaves. He caught me on my way back from a run once and asked if he could start joining me. I haven't invited him. Yesterday, he caught me coming back from work and mentioned he hasn't seen me in a while. He asked what I'd been up to, and in response, he said he hasn't been up to much and just stays inside with his cat. The man is obviously reaching out. The problem is, I was raped a few years ago by an older man, so I can't bring myself to just up and ""hang out"" with him. The time I dropped cookies off, he insisted I come inside. I didn't refuse, but I found myself very uncomfortable and frightened. The entire time, I was texting my mom where I was and telling her that if I haven't called within the hour to come looking for me. I know that I overreacted, and I feel that now I am being a bad neighbor to someone who really needs help.

My question is how can I help my blind, veteran (and probably depressed) neighbor without sacrificing my own well-being?",30Sep2017,19

134,"I'm 17, I'm a female. My parents never give me privacy, their reasoning for never giving me privacy to begin with ranges but they come from something that happened when I was 11 or 12. Here are some examples of me not being given privacy, I am not a perfect human being, I did lie to my parents when I was 14 but only because my parents were strict and controlling and how they were with me.

-When I was 11 I was reading scary stories and was terrified of our basement because one story was about a decaying woman coming up from the basement. I had no lock on my door so my solution was to push a school desk I had against my door, my dad found out one time and told me not to do that anymore because there could be a fire and he wouldn't be able to get in. So now because of that I can't have a lock on my door, it went as far as my parents asking management to switch the lock to be on the outside of my door when I moved to Virginia. I had outgrown being scared of stories at that point. I still can't have a lock to keep my brothers out while I do my homework. 

-My parents read my diary until I was 15 and told them to burn the thing because they kept reading it and using things in there against me. They read it when I was 11 because according to them ""my brother was up there playing around in my room and he went under the bed and found my diary, took it and threw it and it coincidentally open on that page"" there wasn't anything up there for him to play with and why would he be looking under the bed that had nothing except my diary. The diary page was me venting and saying about possibly wanting to runaway, I was only 11 and didn't mean it. Plus I was venting about my stepmother in my diary because at the time she was being particularly rough with everyone.

-I couldn't keep a pass code on anything I had, no passcode on my phone, though at one point I did because it was my first smart phone and they never told me beforehand that I wasn't allowed to. It wasn't until I made a typo while changing my passcode I ended up locking myself out, my dad had to reset my phone. He scolded me afterwards not to put a passcode on my phone because he said I'm not supposed to have one and that he is allowed to go through my phone randomly so no more passcodes and that if I do he needs to know it. After that they'd take my phone at random and deleted stuff to free up storage.

In latest things, both my parents phones got broken, so until they get a new one my stepmother has my phone and is making it hers. She went as far as to put a pattern lock on it so I can't use it while she has it. On Monday I was logging into my gmail account from my kindle, which I have now. I tried logging in again on Thursday and the password wouldn't go through, why you ask, because she changed the password to my gmail on Monday. They've done this before when I got in trouble but I'm not even in trouble this time. How do I solve this problem? How do I get some privacy? Its driving me nuts! I've been thinking about getting a job and buying a phone with the money I make from said job so my parents can't control that at least.",30Sep2017,5

137,"Okay, so I'll try to keep this short, but I'm wordy

I am a sophomore at uni, and on the first day of classes I met this non-traditional student (meaning he's not straight outta highschool into college) who had been serving for several years. We sat next to each other in this freshman level course and bonded over how we felt old in the class, him obviously much much more than I, but these were some hella clueless freshman. One didn't even know what a syllabus was. Anyway we chatted and shared several similar opinions about the subject of the class, and he was very friendly. As soon as class was over he asked if I wanted to get lunch. I was baffled, never before have I been asked to lunch by someone I hardly knew, in my shock I took a raincheck using the excuse of having to talk to the professor, which at least I did have to. 
Skip to the next time. Once again friendly in class, he asks if we can get lunch. My next class isn't for an hour so sure. We walk to the hub of campus and grab some food. I ask who should order first and he says he has got it and orders what I said I was gonna have. 
Shit.
Is this a date? At this point my oblivious self did not even think it a possibility, especially from a guy probably 8 years older than I. And also I had been so caught up in the topic of the class, I didn't talk about my SO at all. So now I'm freaking because I don't know if this is his intentions or not, and I don't wanna be that girl that's all like, ""excuuuuuuse me, I have a BOYFRIEND."" So I accept and keep a close eye on his behavior, he doesn't seam to be flirting. And as we eat we get into topics I'm very very passionate about and I fail to mention SO again
 Shit. 
Skip to the next day we have class. I have to leave 10 Minutes early to get to a fancy meeting and had asked permission to do so before the class. So I get up and leave 10 minutes early, and the clueless freshman thinks that means they all can leave. So guy catches up to me (even though I'm not sure how he saw where I went) and chats with me and walks with me all the way to the meeting, he then asks for my number. I give it to him as I find him super interesting and I need more friends. Wait shit part two, does he want my number in a romantic way? Fucking hell OP, how stupid are you? I made it a point to mention my boyfriend in the first few texts. I do and he still keeps texting and being friendly. Awesome. 


Things that happened in the next week:


We chat every time after class

I learn he is turning 29 soon while I am 19

I learn he thought I was 22ish

He stays friendly with nothing I would call flirting 

He mentions he hasn't been on a date in years

He offers for me to come over, but I declined as I was working

He says that I should work where he does as they just lost someone and it is a job a lot like my current one, but more laid back

We only hang in public except one time he drove us to the comic book store and I kept a friend very updated on if I was okay.


I ask my friend at work what she thinks, she says he sounds friendly and asks if I found him on Facebook yet. She finds him and points out is says in a relationship. I don't think anything of it, until that night I remember him saying he hasn't been on a date in years.... I don't know what to make of it. 

Ask two more coworkers. They say he sounds creepy. 

What should I make of this? Friendly lonely guy or mild creep? I still like him and find him Interesting and would love to keep him around as a friend.",30Sep2017,12

143,"Hi Reddit, I'm here because I've got myself into a situation I see no way out of; I confessed to my parents that I'm not Muslim anymore 3 days ago. I thought they'd be receiving and understand my decision, not treat me like scum. I just didn't feel convinced by Islam anymore, or any religion for that matter for that matter. I said I was done lying to them and myself. My mum just broke down in tears, she's been in her room just sleeping, only getting up twice a day for food and in the 16 years I've been here, my dad's never once ordered food from outside but these past two days, my mum hasn't cooked and my dad's ordered food for the past few meals. Everyone knows something wrong but they haven't told my sisters yet or anyone else, even their own brothers, sisters or parents. It's obvious even to my 'blind eyes' that it affected my dad greatly too.


I thought they took it well until the next day. My dad started taking my stuff away starting from my phone, moving onto my TV, books even the wardrobe. The only things he's left in my room is the desk and the bed, no doubt because there's nowhere to put them. He went into my phone right next to me and deleted every single photo on my phone that had anyone in my family in it. There's only pictures of me left on the phone, he's deleted all my family's number and got a new number for every member of the family. He's usually the kindest guy in the room but now I see he's just as big a piece of shit as an abusive father (even though he's never hit me).


He followed this up by telling me if I didn't come back to Islam and become a 'proper' Muslim, I had two weeks to move out or else he'd put me into the car, drive me 100 miles into rural England and then leave me in the fields with two broken legs. I believe him. I'm only 16, I have no family to turn to in this country nor can I afford to go back, even though definitely he'll make sure there's nothing I can go back to. I have no money saved up and my A-Level courses just started, I don't know what to do, don't know who to turn to or what'll happen to me. Any help or advice? After the dog shit treatment I got from him, there's no way I'm going back to what I was doing just a couple weeks ago. Please, help me, I'm lost and scared with nowhere to go.

144,"It started off during college. I was struggling with an anxiety disorder that eventually became so severe I cannot go to a doctor. No matter how many times people tell me I just wont go out of fear. It is rational to go to the doctor I know, but I get overwhelmed with fear and then run away every time I even get close. It feels as though if I do not give into my extreme anxiety and run I will die. So I run every time.

During college I struggled with my coursework and grades. I found it very difficult and the college offered support for my anxiety to get me through the course. They gave me a counselor to talk to once a week for 2 years.

So it started off really scary because I panicked and basically had a panic attack on the chair meeting her. I was very scared and just wouldn't even look at her. I eventually however got very close with her emotionally and it felt as though she was I guess ""grooming"" me for a relationship.

She would get me presents. Text me outside of therapy. She would skype with me during the summer break and she'd even drove me home on occasion. We became so close it felt painful apart.

So she set up many alone times where we'd be alone just the two of us. The first time she set up we'd be in a new office downstairs away from the other college staff. I didn't question it at the time, but it was very weird. She pretended to had forgotten about our session and didn't book the room apparently... I find that hard to believe considering I'd been seeing her every day for the same time for the past year. The second time she got us alone together was when the entire student services staff were in a meeting elsewhere. It was just us two in the office alone and I felt a very intense sexual chemistry, but didn't make a move there either. The third time she got me alone with her for a car ride home late and night. I went to give her a hug before getting out of the car and she reacted as though I was going to kiss her. I've never dated before so felt kinda confused and awkward and left. The final time we were alone was the day of our last session. We sneaked off together and got ice cream and went for a walk through some countryside. She looked very disappointed and sad when we said goodbye. I only realized now just how much she wanted me to make a move on her. Everything that happened and was said suggests it. She even had me watching romantic movies about therapist and client relationships...

So my life now consists of endless boredom and loneliness. I never stop thinking about my counselor and she texts me occasionally. I tried to tell her how I felt over text and she basically made out our entire relationship was strictly counseling and it made me feel heart broken.

I felt so upset I've turned my phone off and haven't turned it back on for 4 weeks straight. I feel like my entire life revolves around her texting me and wanting to meetup and that's all I have to live for. I hate waiting knowing it may never happen.

Could really use some advice. I feel like I've got my hands tied behind my back due to my anxiety disorder and my heartbreak with my counselor is making me extremely depressed. I can't even go out and meet new people. I haven't left the house in several months.",30Sep2017,1

148,"21M. Never had a gf and have always been rejected because my face is ugly. I've had my face rated hundreds of times through the course of the years, asked women, used dating sites, used rating sites (reddit included), and always have been told by men and women my face is below average looking/completely unattractive. My dad is a pretty abusive guy and he has been my whole life. I'm not going to get into all that detail, but we have a pretty poor relationship as he's always helicoptered me. I also had plastic surger done recently (very minor, little-no change) which he responded to very negatively, saying that my face is handsome (yes, I've told him about what people have said about my face and he twists it to make it seem like me asking them caused them to say that) and it was a decision made from a weak place. 

Now, he knew that I've always had problems with women, but he attributes it to the wrong thing. I don't have any problems socially, but my face is my problem. He seems to think it's other things and it's something to the degree of ""you don't talk to them."". Whenever I give him examples of people I've asked out, he gets angry that I tell him they said no and says that I'm making it up to convince him that I'm ugly. I'd rather not discuss this stuff with him at all as my life is miserable enough already. 

For example, he told me to ask out people of my race, as he thought people who were white were rejecting me. I explained to him that I asked many people of my race and they rejected me. He became angry and started screaming at me saying that my stepbrother (who is good looking, but father says he's not) got a girlfriend but why can't I. He doesn't seem to realize that women care about looks matter most and he doesn't listen to anyone's opinion but his own. 

The worst part is he arrives at the wrong conclusions from the evidence. Most recently, he signed me up for match, and sent these message to women. He also favorited several people. Now, he saw that my profile got views, all from the people who he messaged/favorited. None of those people liked/winked/messaged back. Now, any normal person would realize that these women saw my face and thought my face was unattractive. He somehow rationalized it to mean that if someone views you, they must find you physically attractive because they wouldn't take the time to view your profile. I'm exasperated/scared to explain to him how retarded he is, because like I said, he's extremely abusive. He seems to think that my good paying job is a major advantage, but I explained to him that it's not and women mostly care about looks. He just started screaming. He also pointed out examples of hot women with average looking men, and I couldn't bear to tell him out of fear (tried before) that while average looking men can date women my face is below average. He can't seem to understand. 

At this point I already know I won't convince him, but I guess I just needed to explain to someone how impossible my life is. Life is already horrible being a male with a below average face as women ignore you. I wouldn't wish an ugly face on my worst enemy. But having an abusive father just exacerbates this pain.

149,"I am 18. I had a boyfriend, we broke up last month cuz it was kind of a realllllly long distance relationship and things weren't working out well. We can't be in the same country before 4 years. Even after that, there was no certainty.
I didn't tell my brother about the break up cuz I didn't get the chance to and i thought he didn't care anyway. 
The guy I was dating is a really brainy, witty, funny and good-looking guy, who happens to be filthy rich. But he is not a spoilt rich brat. I mean, he had drivers and servants all around yet he used his bicycle all the time.
 Today, my sister tells me that my brother was talking about how smart he thinks I am. On asking, he said, "" There are not a lot of ways to become rich. You either grind yourself, or you marry a rich guy. She (referring to me) chose the easiest way."" 

DAFUQ EVEN !!

My sister knew about the breakup and she knew it was never about the money. I mean, while we were together (11 months), I never asked for or accepted any gifts, nor did we ever eat out in any fancy restaurants. During those 11 months, I spent more on him than he did on me. And I knew he was never seeking anything from his parents' business. In fact, I helped him develop emotionally and mentally, because he hated his family. He's in an Ivy and he thanks me for helping him come out of his extreme introvert nature.

He helped me focus on studies. He taught me how to work hard and develop to my highest potential. These were the reasons I was with him. And, my own brother thinks I was with him for the money. I don't know what to think or do. Any advice? ",30Sep2017,1
150,"My younger sister is getting herself into all kinds of trouble. I am so fed up with her/my family and don't know how to help her. 


Unfortunately, I do not live near her or my family since I moved away for college four years ago and recently started a job in NYC, which is about five hours away from my hometown. So, I visit home about once every other month but can only afford to make short trips.


My sister and I had always been close growing up in a fairly dysfunctional family. Our biological father passed away but he and my mother were estranged and my sister never met him. We have two other siblings from my mother's second marriage, which also ended in divorce, but are still close with our stepfather. My grandmother has been a big part of our lives, and is now my sister's guardian, as my mother moved to a different state (Although I don't agree with this decision to leave your children and move to a different, there is no hostility between my mother and my sister). 


So, to paint a clear picture, my 16-year-old sister has been living at my grandmother's house for about three years, and it's just the two of them there. The rest of our family lives close by, aside from my mother and myself.


Right now, my sister is pretty out of control, and I'm upset that my mother and grandmother aren't taking action to do anything about it. 


She is addicted to marijuana and has tried other drugs, not motivated to pursue anything, and has major anger problems. 


For years, she's had absolutely no interest in attending college, and hasn't budged. I don't judge her for this because I recognize that college isn't the right path for everyone, and you can go at anytime. However, I am worried that she won't even graduate high school, as she is constantly missing due to ""not feeling well"" and already behind a year due to missing so much school last year and her poor grades. She is VERY intelligent, just doesn't turn anything in or do any of the work. She has a part time job that she also calls out of regularly, and overall she is just not motivated to do ANYTHING in life other than spend time with her friends. 


When she's home (which is very rarely), she lays in bed in her room and smokes weed while blasting rap music. Her temper ranges from very sweet and pleasant to talk to, to angry, screaming, and punching holes in the wall if someone tries to argue with her. She is always out with her friends and even though she was excited to see my mom and I when we visited home last weekend, she did not make a lot of time for us and still was constantly out. It's sad for me to watch her have to rely on marijuana to get through her day, and to see that she has no perspective and is pretty cynical and overall depressed.


Since I'm not her mom or her legal guardian, I literally don't know what to do. Talking to my sister is useless, she lies a lot and will say anything to make me happy, or will just tell me that I ""don't understand."" And I really, really try to understand. I try to communicate with her frequently by calling/texting since I don't live close, but it's a one-way street. She never wants to talk because she's always occupied with friends. I've tried to invite her to NYC multiple times, just for a weekend so she'd get to experience a different place, and she blows me off. I know that it's sadly because she can't go without smoking weed for even a day.


Honestly, I have no idea what she's doing with her friends. I know that she acts promiscuous and doesn't respect her self-worth or her body; she feels comfortable telling me that she casually sleeps around. 


I've told my mother and grandmother that they need to do something now while she's still a minor, and before she gets involved in harder drugs and spirals down this path, but both of them have taken very little action. It's like they're blind and not facing what could really happen. My grandmother has gotten in touch with my sister's high school administrators to keep tabs on when she misses school, her grades, etc., but isn't doing much else. She says, ""What can I say? The damage has been done."" And my mother has been enabling my sister by constantly giving her money anytime she asks, calling her out of school, and being her friend rather than her parent. 


It makes me sick that the worry and concern for my sister's well being has been disregarded because my family members don't want to ruffle any feathers or put effort into this situation - she's 16
! 

At this point, I almost want to call CPS, but I don't know if that would make things worse. I love my family but this isn't ok, and my sister is still a child. What can I do? Should I be doing more? I feel useless and mad at myself that I can't be there everyday and work with my sister in person, but I really don't know how to help this situation since again, I am not her parent.

151,"My motorcycle was parked on a residential street where it stands every day when from 5pm-7:30pm it was knocked over the kickstand onto the other side.
&amp;nbsp;

 I called the police and they tried to persuade me to not file a police report because my rates would increase (I'm sure they were being thoughtful and not trying to keep the crime figures low...)    
&amp;nbsp;

As i start removing the parts on the bike to assess damage and get ready to repair parts, the person who lived in the house that my motorcycle is parked in front of comes home, and comes back out to tell me that his wife witnessed the accident, saw the lady get out of the car after hitting it trying to lift the motorcycle back up, and has pictures on it happening.

&amp;nbsp;

The car model was a Nissan Murano that was before 2007 (because the rear lights changed after that) was black, had the rear windows with a tint, and driver and passenger windows were more transparent. On the 5th day while walking to work, i saw this car parked 0.2 miles (a 3 minute walk) away from where the crime occurred. 

&amp;nbsp;

I explained the situation to the station operate and she told me to call the police, which arrived and said they can't do anything because i don't have proof of a plate. Even if I have an eye witness to the car, the driver, and the crime. 
&amp;nbsp;

So if a car hits you and has no plates, are you not allowed to receive justice with all other evidence or are the police just being lazy. 

I have literally done all of the work that police should be doing and they still don't want to do anything.

EDIT: I called the precinct and they have no report under my name or license plate even, told me to cold another office on Monday to see if MAYBE they have it????

152,"Hi Reddit, the past week or so I've been thinking about making a job change. This may I finished a one year certification for welding and got a position at a company where I was traveling to different states during the week living in hotels. I decided I didn't like this after 3 or so months and found another job where I would be home each night. 

Fast forward to now I have been at this new job again for almost 3 months. The place seems very unstable and has a lot of internal issues, the pay is not great and I am not doing what I was hired for. I feel as if I'm wasting the few thousand I spent on schooling not using my skill. There is a job I could apply for right now where I'd be making 7 dollars more an hour and 20 minutes shorter of a drive, at a much more stable place where I will be using my welding skill.

156,"I'm a sadist and we met basically because he proposed he was in love with me. Before that we were simply just college classmates, I never really noticed him till he said he was in love with me and I thought he wasn't that bad looking; moreso a bit cute.

So being the sadist I am, I commanded him to do a few things and he did basically everything exactly as I said. That developed a slave-master relationship, I also kind of dom him in most of the sex we have unless I feel like laying back and telling him to do as he pleases. That was that until he left me about a month ago.

After a few calls, he returns a few nights ago to say he wants to meet and again and that he wanted to get back with me so I decided to test him with more sadist things. So he meets me in a park and since this is a small town and no one really walks around I wore basically a tight shirt dress that was pretty revealing. He liked that and told me he loved me, so I told him he was my dog, my pet. He shook his head which I figured he'd agree so I wanted to put him to the test.

When said he wanted to meet I called 2 guys to come so that I can see what my pet would do. Before they showed up, I told him, ""do not move no matter what and I will go out with you.""  Confused he still did it, then the guys came out and said they were ready to do it, at a hotel, obviously referring to sex. I looked back at my pet and then said no I want to do it here. They agreed catching on to what I was doing and they pulled out they're cocks and I started giving them both head.

&gt; I expected him to stop it, if you don't feel like reading the next few nfsw paragraphs

So I sucked both of them off for a bit and during this time he just sat there on his knees watching... the only thing he did is yell at a comment they made saying that's rude to say to a lady, yet he stayed there. Finally I let them cum on me and I was very disappointed in him. The 2 guys insisted on doing more with me but I disagreed and told them no, I need to take him home. They looked and claimed he was fine and wanted to watch more. I looked over and they asked him if he wanted to watch more, he just sat there on his knees watching... I seriously thought he might stop it this time if it was a bit more so I told them they could thigh-fuck me, that's it.

He didn't say anything so one of them started, I watched over at him and nothing he sat there looking down at the ground.The other guy started playing with my nipples then they start saying how they wanted to put it in, I told them no so one of them went over to talk to my masochist telling him that if he moves it will break my order; but if he doesn't he's okay with them putting it in me. He stayed there looking at the ground so the guy said okay we got his permission... so the guy rubbing against me put it inside despite me saying no.

Now I was being raped and asked my maso to help me, he mumbles but you told me not to move... I told him I was being raped, he just repeated himself. I was telling them to stop and him to help then the other guy comes over and says it didn't go how you planned and slapped me... then tears rolled down my eyes and he announced I was crying. Nothing happened, the maso just sat there now on all fours watching. And the guy in me says he's about to cum, so I told him to pull out he wasn't wearing a condom... he did it inside me anyway...

After that they put me on a park bench and continued raping me even taking my anal virginity for double penetration. After they finished and came inside both of my holes I just sat there on the ground so hurt, so scared, and disappointed. I went over to him and I got so pissed off... I cussed him out and told him I was being raped and he looks at me... all he said was you told me not to move so I... jittering and such. So I just left him there and went home.

&gt; Basically I got raped and he didn't stop it, he was so keen on keeping my order that he ruined everything and basically disappointed me.

Now that I slept on it, I feel like I went to far... I feel so very sick. I feel like everything was my fault... although I don't want to see him right now for a while. I feel like I may have really... ""betray"" him even though we weren't actually a thing. He was in love with me or so he would say, but then again I am mad because if he loved me why didn't he stop it... nothing was tying him down, the guys weren't big guys, I just got ones that my maso could probably have beat up. Or at least stopped it. But no.

I need advice... I am willing to accept I got what I deserved and that this is all on me. But am I wrong should I feel like shit? To be honest I've already gargled down anti-depressants and I still feel like shit. But is this all on me? I assumed that he would stop it, even at a point saying help, I never intended it to go this far and if he had only... I can't. I just feel like it's all on me. How do I get past this? What should I do? I'm very disturbed right now and I don't know what to do. My head is screaming at me wondering what the hell is wrong with him. I didn't even think he would let the blowjobs happen... like. Why. What would you do? Should I be mad at him or just myself?

Please... any advice will be helpful.",30Sep2017,0
157,"So I work in a performance related field in an office in Texas. My coworker, C, wasn't performing too well, and kind of got a ""time out"" from management. He was supposed to take a day or two off and clear his head. After a week the guy sitting next to me texted him and C replied that he was in California for a little vacation. Well, now, 3 weeks later, he's been gone a month. The guy next to me has been trying to reach him, the boss tried to reach him, and now I've tried, but nobody has seen a response, nobody has seen any social media activity of any type(not that he was very active on that stuff), and C also left a substantial amount of belongings in the office. We're pretty sure he has not been back. 

Now that it's been about a month, should I start worrying? I've considered giving the police a heads up, maybe they could contact acquaintances or something, but I don't know if that gives me any legal obligations or what. When would a person do such a thing, and what does that process look like? I'm a rather young guy who hasn't experienced this before. 

As far as C goes, he's pretty....isolated. He wasn't close to anyone in the office after having been here 6 months, but I do know he has a young daughter in the city and an ex-wife. I think he has visitation every Thursday.

166,"Not sure if this is good place to post this but I need some kind of advice.. this is a long post I apologize. so here's the run down: 

I'm 17 years old. Healthy physically for the most part aside from being diabetic, struggling with weight loss (more on that later, but I recently was down to 95 pounds) and just random aches and pains. I struggle mostly with more mental issues. At least that's what I would call them, I've never really had anyone to educate me or help me through these mental problems. I recently hit a tipping point of something and went off the deep end. Ever since I was kid I was always pretty awkward socially and kind of had a random way my brain works. My behavior was always a little off, but I also had another side that was very open and happy so no one really caught on to my issues. My freshman/sophomore years of HS I went through a lot of depression and mostly kept to myself. At the same time I started showing a lot of anger at random times. Most people just wrote it off cause I would go back to happy within time or just ignored it. I've never really been able to communicate how my ""brain works"" but it is hard. A lot of times I feel like my own mind is both a prison and the biggest open field full of freedom. Total opposites. Throughout HS the anger got worse, but it came on randomly and I can't control it. It feels like I'm the Hulk or something. I go one minute being my social, happy, hippie self to the angriest person you've seen. It physically hurts me so much I usually have to hit something or do something physically. I've hurt myself and objects around me multiple times. It scares me. It started as big physical bursts of this anger, but for the past year my mind has seemed to go down the rabbit hole.. I went to a therapist for some time but I can't really communicate well so I couldn't really get it all through and ended up not going back. My concentration and memory has also been going to trash the past year. This makes me so scared... as someone who taught themselves to code at a younger age and now can't even think through a simple program.. it feels like my mind has slipped me. I go through weeks of pure happiness, like in August. I got set on starting up my own business and start making money. I felt unstoppable. Then a small thing happened in my life and I went downhill. Then that downhill ended up having my long term girlfriend break up with me. She was my biggest support. So now I feel like I have no one. My mother tries to help, and she does with getting me food (again on the food, I go through periods where I'll basically starve myself.) and trying to get my into doctors but emotionally she can't support me at all. So the breakup from my GF set me into a weird spiral of depression but also this ego filled period as well. It kept fighting back and forth and I hit the tipping point a few days ago. I've had the worst headache I've ever felt for the past three days. Nothing is making me feel any sense of emotion. I can't read or hardly focus. And my mind just feels blank. There is a lot I'm missing out on in terms of some of the stuff my mind does, but as you can see I'm pretty sure I have a long term issue and this short term problem. I need to get past this depression state first and then I need to fix whatever the long term issues is. I just don't know what to do and I'm scared honestly... does anyone have any ideas? Or can give me resources to maybe get some support? I'm a 17 male, graduated from HS. I'm falling behind in college because of this recent event.

I did everything for this boy. He was the first human being to show kindness and compassion towards me, so I did everything in my power to make sure I wouldn't lose him. Apparently, giving him the world plus beyond more wasn't enough. To give a little background, back in April I caught him cheating, however, he had so much regret that I gave him another chance. Ever since, our relationship had been going downhill. I gained trust issues and he wasn't willing to communicate with me. My depression and anxiety grew worse, so he ended it. I'll never forget his exact words, ""I can't handle this anymore. I want to break up forever"". My heart shattered. It's difficult to put in words to how everything panned out, but I can say that he took advantage of my big heart. I gave and gave and gave. When I began to become strict and asked for him to give a little, he decided to drop me out of his life. It has taken a huge toll on me. We did everything together and created so many wonderful memories. Yesterday, I found out he had already found someone else. How could he move on so easily?

177,"I'm a recent college graduate still living with my parents. My work and house are fairly close to each other, about a 15 minute backroad drive. 

I want to move out, but I don't know where to. My parents want me to move into a house or condo in the same general vicinity/suburb, so I can be close to work and also invest my money into actually owning something. 

While I don't hate that idea, I really wanted to move into the city. It would be about a 40 minute drive to and from work, but I would be close to all my friends and I think I would have a lot of fun. I would probably live with some people to cut down costs, which I actually prefer. Downside is that I would rent and basically just be throwing my money away. 

My main worry is that if I live in the suburb on my own, my life would just be work-home-sleep and I would shut myself in. I'm social, but not enough that I can be comfortable going to bars and places on my own. I don't have any friends that still live in the suburb so I would be on my own.

One of my friends invited me to a party (not in dorms) that he's co-hosting and said that the ratio (guy/girl) is great and the last party he went to was great. My problem is that I'm quiet, haven't kissed anyone, haven't done anything sexually, and don't drink/smoke. I'll drink and smoke a little bit but I've never gotten drunk or high.

I know I need to go do my friends knows I'm cool and I'll get invited to other stuff, but I'm worried cause I don't know anyone and I'm really shy.

179,"I'm having problems with my family. My parents are fighting often and hard, although hard mostly comes from my fathers side since he is loud person. My parents have a rat stuck somewhere in their kitchen. My mom is really scared and doesn't sleep well because of it. My dad is not the empathetic guy who would really comfort her and ease her fears. It's been days now and it built up, I guess. Today was my birthday party and closer family got together. My mother started talking about it and with grandmother and aunt just talked about needing to hire someone to take apart kitchen, because rat is behind kitchen. My dad got it as a huge personal insult, like he can't catch the rat or take apart kitchen. It's nowhere near his profession, but because he helped to install it, he is convinced he doesn't need to hire anyone and sees it as a lack of trust. He got really fired up in front of entire family and practically made his mother leave the house. Today I managed to calm down the situation a little, but I don't live with them. I have a job and my university and I'm not a permanent solution, definitely not fit for it. I barely manage in regular social interaction, no way to do anything in this one.

180,"I've always been quite outgoing and goofy (always having a laugh and trying to break the ice and make people feel comfortable), never had too many problems when it came to making friends and bonding with people, but right now I feel kinda lost.

So 2 weeks ago I started my first year at university, and I'm finding myself trying to make plans outside of university with the friends I'm making but they canceled.

Let me explain myself, I had planned this Thursday to have some drinks with some friends of mine, I asked them to tag along because I thought they would enjoy it, they seemed kinda hesitant at first but then I managed to convince them and they looked quite happy about it. Thursday arrives and they don't answer to some of my texts in the morning and finally, one of them tells me that he's not coming and later my other friend says the same.

I wasn't quite happy about it and told them that it's ok, but it would be cool if we hung out of university for a change.

I had my friends over the Internet that I would game with and they come and go but I've never really had a best friend. And I've never had a girlfriend and I look back at the years that have passed while I sit in inertia and I get angry and depressed thinking of what could have been. And I get angry at my parents for depriving me of that. I truly think I could've had girlfriends and friends in high school and I probably could've lost my virginity. The main point is I'm incredibly lonely and I need a girlfriend. I'm experiencing apathy right now so everything is just terrible and I feel the only way to get over it is to get a girlfriend.

192,"**I would REALLY love to hear from the doctors out there, but also appreciate any and all advice. Thanks so much for taking the time to read my story.**  



Just a heads up, this could be TMI for some of you. Also- sorry. This is gonna be a long one.


  
Don’t even know where to start. I guess I’ll start by saying years ago, I got a bad case of mononucleosis that took me out of school and work for nearly a year. It wreaked havoc on my body in so many different ways, but I eventually got better. The reason I mention this is because mono is known to remain in your system for life, so sometimes I wonder if any of my problems could be related to it. 


  
(One last “potentially-TMI” warning) Fast forward to several years later, about January 2016. I start feeling a dull pain in my testicles. Thought nothing of it at first but after a while, it became very distracting and I decided to get it checked out. Oh- you should know- I don’t have insurance and couldn’t afford it at this time. So visiting the doctor/getting tests/etc was very expensive and made the decision to get help more difficult. Doc checks me out, thinks there’s nothing wrong. Thinks it could be diet or just varicoceles. Great, so I’m hoping it just goes away. A few weeks later, pain is still there and found a small bump on the left testicle. I immediately go into panic mode and head back to the doctor. He isn’t worried, but orders an ultrasound for me anyway (spending a lot of money already now). The ultrasound is totally fine- just a benign cyst. Thank God. Eventually, this pain just went away. I thought I was in the clear. 
  


Fast forward again to December 2016. I just had unprotected sex with my girlfriend (she is 100% clean and on birth control; we’ve never worried about this), but immediately after sex with her, I start to feel a burning pain in the penis when urinating and just in general, on and off throughout the day. After waiting a few weeks, it got really bad one day and I went to urgent care, where they tested me for a UTI (urinary tract infection) and said that I did have traces of an infection. They prescribe me Ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic, and within a few days, I’m feeling WAY better. Awesome! So my stupid self didn’t finish the antibiotics. I know this is exactly what you’re not supposed to do. I just wanted to get back to working out (Cipro is known to cause tendon rupture, so you’re not supposed to work out while taking it). At the time, this seemed to work out just fine, because I went several months with no issues. Also- I had NO idea what I was taking. If I had known more about Cipro, I would not have taken it. 
  


Fast forward to about a month ago. The pain is back, and worse than before. Because of the grace of God, I recently landed a pretty good job, but my doctor moved to a new system that costs a lot more than before (about $45 more per visit) and my insurance benefits don’t take effect until November. I go see the doc anyway, first thing he says is that he thinks it could be inflammation, asks me to take lots of ibuprofen every day for 2 weeks. This doesn’t seem to help. See another doctor, he says “you just never know with STDs”, recommends I get tests for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia before proceeding with antibiotics again. He also recommended I get a PSA test (prostate screen)… So I go and get those tests. I wouldn’t get the results until about a week and a half later. Between taking those tests and getting the results, there was a period of a few days where I felt 100% better. I was so excited and thrilled, but sure enough, came right back after a few days.  
So now I regularly panic and scare the crap out of myself wondering what is happening to my body. This is something I go through on a daily basis, and it makes it hard to focus at work and hard to sleep at night. Anyway- so the other day I got the results of those tests and all of them were negative (normal). So my doctor prescribes me Ciprofloxacin again. I was worried about taking antibiotics twice in a year (especially the same ones) so I did some research. What I found was very troubling- Ciprofloxacin has a high rate of dangerous side effects, including but not limited to complete tendon destruction and permanent nerve damage. Could this be the cause of some of my problems? Ever since mono, I’ve experienced random aches and pains in my body that I usually just shrug off- but recently, I’ve also been dealing with BAD elbow pain that makes no sense, as I am careful at the gym and don’t lift heavy weight.


  
So this is where the advice I’m looking for really comes in- I am scared to death of taking Cipro after everything I’ve read about it. I’m also scared to death of whatever is going on inside my body. My insurance doesn’t take effect for over a month, and I worry what damage it could do to wait that long to aggressively pursue solutions. I’ve asked my doctor for an alternative antibiotic, which could take several days to actually get in my hands. Meanwhile, I’m feeling the pain regularly and convincing myself that I have cancer and that it’s spreading throughout my body (continuing to get random pains elsewhere other than the groin area), but the testicle/penis area is definitely the worst spot of the pain.


  
I REALLY don’t think it’s my diet, because it hasn’t really changed at all, but I’m trying a fast right now to eliminate that as a possibility. 
  


What do I do? ☹ I’m so scared. I don’t want to make the wrong decision. It could be serious. It could be nothing. I want the pain gone. I want to now be scared all the time. I want to play it smart. Sometimes it feels like my doctor doesn’t care much, so if any of you are doctors, I would really value your input here. Other than all described here, I am a generally healthy person with no other problems. 


  
*Thanks so much for your advice, and thanks for bearing with me through an insanely long post.*   


  
  
**DETAIL OF WHAT THE PAIN FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW**: Often sharp, burning pain in penis. Dull, aching pain in testicles that comes and goes. Random other pains that go down to my foot and even sometimes in my back. The majority of the pain is in the groin area, and that pain is most consistent. It often burns when urinating. Sometimes the penis itself just hurts, like I got punched down there. It looks totally normal (according to several doctors). ",30Sep2017,4

195,"As you probably know, school recently started. As my little sister is four years old, it was her first time in kindergarten. Just four weeks in, it's apparent that school is not going well for her. She's both academically and mentally unprepared. In terms of skills her teacher talked to us about her slow learning. She can't follow write down the alphabets, numbers or much less follow basic instructions. We were also told her fine motor skills were lacking. She can't use the washroom and fails to hold a pencil properly. In terms of everything she's behind her classmates. I don't think she has a learning disability, but instead all this is a family fault. Before this, she hasn't been to a preschool. On top of this, she was heavily spoiled and ill prepared for school. Before school started her every day to day routine was going on the tablet for the whole day watching anything but educational content. The few times she was made to 'study', it was short and maybe once or twice a week at best. Obviously we fucked up in preparing her.

What I'm wondering is what would be the best course of action? Would it be better to take her out of kindergarten and into preschool or should she continue in school, with us helping. I don't want her to feel isolated in school, I want her to have fun, but that's hard when you're so behind in terms of everything. ",30Sep2017,14

201,"Three days ago I heard from my younger sister that, right before PE class someone had put a girl's sport clothing and tennis on the toilet. And yet she wore the wet clothes for class anyway. 

To provide some context and important information: My sister and I are new at the school (and the country). Our school is pretty much made for immigants and the Germans who attend this school are just here because it's close to their home. So basically everyone here speaks English with each other. 

It was also the girl's first year at the school (so 5th grade) so it's really difficult to understand why anyone would bully a 5th grader in the beginning of the school year. The school actually looks really peaceful and I can't see anyone who could've done this. Even if it were for racist/xenophobic reasons (our school is VERY multicultural so it's prone to have some clashes between ethnicities) I can't see why they'd target a little kid. 

The girl is not in the same class as my sister. They only share PE together, which they have once a week.

It doesn't seem like the teachers are going to do something about this.

Now here's the problem: back in my home country, I was very well known in school and beyond because of bullying (I was an easy target because I wanted to be alone), so, finally being able to be myself AND still be respected by my school mates/stay invisible is a miracle. But I know that if I ever confronted the people who did that to that girl my emotions would get the best of me and I wouldn't be surprised if I even ended up getting psychical. (Insulting them is definitely gonna happen and probably mention something about their home country/religion. Not against any particular trait, I can think of an insult even for my own home country, so yeah.) Therefore, I'd get known around the school and goodbye comfortably of being a nobody. Now, there are two different outcomes to this: A) Most students will appreciate my act, respect what I did and leave me alone or B) Start bullying me/ostracizing me because I tried to be the good samaritan. From my experience, kids will laugh at anyone who does a morally right thing. It's cool to be mean and lame to be nice. I actually get along with one of the big guys, so if someone tried to mess with me it wouldn't be s real problem.

Idk, this is just messing with my mind. I just want to do the right thing. I'm not trying to sound like a wannabe badass justice fighter, but I can relate to that kid, and thinking of finding my stuff on a toilet and still be forced to wear them and have no one, not even the teacher care about what just happened really revolts me. 

Tl:dr: 5th grader in my multicultural school was target of a petty attack (someone threw her PE clothes on a toilet) at the beginning of the school year. Should I try to help her and confront the bullies and get known in school for the wrong reasons or stay in my own lane with my invisibility from the rest of the school?",30Sep2017,1

207,"I got a divorce earlier this year after a 14 year, loveless marriage. I was married for all of my 20s and had three children. I had a home, a car and I owned a business. I was a work at home mom and a damn good wife.  I loved being married. Even though I didn't like the person I was married to , I loved the idea of being someone's wife.  It's a mindfuck for me, but there was a comfort in knowing I wasn't going to grow old alone.  He was a serial cheater and abusive in many ways.  I'm glad the marriage is over, but the aftermath has been horrible for me.  

I lost my business, partially due to business being slow and losing the drive to gain more business.  I was damn good at what I did, but part of my business was weddings and they hurt so much to be a part of. I got a full time job and my budget is just met and I've trimmed down all costs.  I have nothing left for entertainment or clothes, etc.

I had to find a home of my own and it's the first time in my life that I'm living alone. The bills are higher, and I'm struggling.  I had to rehome my pets and I hate coming home to an empty house.  My children are with their father half the time and the other weeks are hard.  It's hard when they're here too.  I'm so stressed and I feel like I'm failing them as a mother. I can't maintain the lifestyle there were accustomed to. They're preteens and they somewhat understand, one of my children has special needs and is having a rough time. 

I'm depressed. My whole life has changed in the past 10 months and while I don't feel hopeless about right now, I do feel hopeless about the future. I forwent college to be a mother, and I want to go to school and be something. I'm so strapped for time as it is that that doesn't even some possible. 

And the silly thing that spurred all of this : needing to make weekly trips to the laundromat. It was like the final nail in my pride coffin. I was raised in poverty and promised myself I'd get out, and i just see myself never getting over this hurdle. I can't even afford a washer and dryer.

I'm going to start therapy, because I just need someone to talk to, I don't have family per se. I feel like Ive mustered all the will I can to do my best, but it all feels for naught. Now I find myself working a deadend job, driving the last car I ever see myself buying and struggling to afford bills, let alone save.  And the really rough part: I just want to be married again.

Everything job-wise was manageable until I went to a training program for the company in which everyone was SO much more motivated to sell than I was. I was sitting there like “crap what have I done I don’t think I can do this.” And then there’s the part of the job where several people have told me it can be all consuming over time which is frightening me as well. 
Also I have a lot of interest in marketing (I feel like I might be a better fit for that), just not so much of an interest in selling from what I’m experiencing. 
How do I talk to my boss about possibly changing my career track, even if I’m still pretty new? (Like maybe going into another position within the company) 

(PS when she hired me on she told me to be honest with her and let her know if I felt sales wasn’t for me. She really is a fantastic boss so far) ",30Sep2017,3
210,"20f. I feel empty, but I don't know what I want. I just feel like something is missing in my life. I'm stressed about family and home issues, I'm stressed about an aspect of my relationship with my boyfriend. 
I don't necessarily feel depressed, I just feel like I want to be doing something I'm not. I feel like I'm missing out on something, I feel like I should be doing more. I am CRAVING a real, deep platonic connection with someone, particularly a girl. I have no one I feel like I can really talk to about things, I don't have many friends in the first place. I'm tired of meeting people, like at work, and having small-talk conversations and polite laughter and just not ""clicking"".
I don't feel like I'm having enough fun, I go to work, I spend time with my boyfriend and that time is either - chilling, watching films, eating together, etc., or visiting a couple friend of ours. I'm with my boyfriend most of the time, if I'm not though, I'll be at home, on the internet watching YouTube, playing on my phone/other games, and sometimes enjoying my hobby of art, but that's less often recently where I'm feeling so stressed. 

It's hard because it's a very vague feeling and I don't know what action to take next, I don't know what to do about it. I don't feel happy with how things are right now, I don't feel fulfilled. I feel like I should be somewhere else. I feel like I want to do something spontaneous and impulsive. I feel like I should be having more fun as a twenty year old, I only get dressed up for work, I don't go out and get drunk with my friends. I don't feel like I know who I am yet.

212,"I'm not entirely sure what to do, so I'm turning to the wonderful people of Reddit.
I live in one of 5 blocks of flats, so there are loaaaaads of other people living in this area, including a friend of mine. She lives in the block directly opposite the neighbour in question, she usually sees him on the balcony.

The neighbour is a little childlike (I think he's late 20's), he doesn't seem to be all there, I say this in the nicest possible way, I think he's a just a friendly, simple guy. He usually talks to the kids that play in the communal area that's enclosed between the flats. Anyway, he always says hello to my partner, they used to pass eachother outside at least once a day and occasionally my partner would see him talking to his friends, they're a little rough looking. Once he was talking about how he had no money, and was struggling to eat. My friend can back this up as she's caught him stealing sandwiches from the local shop a handful of times. He recently came up in conversation, and my friend mentioned that his curtains have been shut, and that he's not been on the balcony for at least 6 weeks, and my partner said he's not seen him either. Not a single sighting between the three of us. I don't know his name, or which flat he lives in, so I'm a little useless here. I've checked local court reports (they always list the street name) and in the last six months, nobody on his street has been sentenced for anything, so I'm pretty certain he's not in prison. So I guess my question is, should I contact the police to ask them to check on him as I'm pretty certain he's a vulnerable adult, although with my limited info, I'm not sure they'll be able to do much. Or do I assume he's moved away and that the new tenant just doesn't like daylight?",30Sep2017,70

She has worked her trade as a baker for about 20 years now. She no longer can do this because the lifting involved in gives her constant hernias. Her first surgery was in February and less than 5 months later she had to get surgery again because she had developed an additional 3 hernias since the first surgery. She is out of work and cannot return until November 11. Even then, she will only go to work to repeat the same injuries.

228,"Growing up the only thing that made me cry was getting frustrated trying to articulate my thoughts.  
  
I always felt like I explained myself well enough but people would just say things like ""I don't understand, try harder"".  As a kid, I mostly heard this from my family and it would prompt me to think it's not worth the effort, so I'd give up caring about what ever it was I was trying to convey, and move on.  
  
As an adult, I find myself in a position where I don't care about anything and now I plan on moving into the woods and becoming a hermit.  I kid you not, I told my partner I'm leaving last week, found someone to sublet my apartment, and packed up today.  
  
I've left companies I've started, twice, despite both being successful.  I've left companies where I've been promoted and given raises every time I try to quit, and I never last more than a few years at any of them.  All because I get no control over decisions that impact my role in the company.  
  
I'm ""trusted"" with figuring out how to make the decisions of others work, but not with the decisions making itself.  I almost always disagree with decisions made.  They're almost always more expensive and impractical than the options I've offered, but I still get brushed over for someone else to make a decision that, when it doesn't work out, they're not the people to clean up the mess, I am.   
  
Initially I chalked it up to people being selfish and wanting to be the ""decision maker"" and they feel comfortable in taking that role as long as they have me around to help solve any issues that arise.  But I'm older now and it's happened at too many places for me to just believe everyone else is the problem.  
  
What's the reason people will trust me to solve a problem, but not trust my recommendation to prevent it?  
  
It's frustrating to say the least but after 10+ years of just cleaning up messes and having no control over preventing them, I give up.

229,"Hi guys, so here’s my shtick:

I used to love my cousin when we were little. Didn’t see him for a few years, came back last year and now he’s kind of a creepy, weird ass dickwad. Like his personality seems oddly robotic and he is way to brainwashed by his family friends that own shady car dealerships that he’ll be rich some day and money is the only important thing in the world.

Also, the biggy: he’s a dick to his little sister. Like he constantly gives her shit over nothing and I’m pretty sure I heard him slap her in the face once. I actually still feel guilty for not stepping up, confirming what I thought, and teaching him a lesson. 

For context, he’s a senior in HS and I’m a year older. 

Now he’s asking me for help w college apps. On the one hand, I have the ability and time to help him out and possibly give him some guidance(?), but on the other hand after visiting him, I’m not sure he deserves help. 

Should I just suck it up? 

If I do refuse to help him. How do I do it? Should I be upfront about why, or should I just slowly stop replying to his shit? Also I kinda already offhandedly offered my help :/

TL;DR: Cousin is a dick who probably slapped his sister and I dumbly offered to help him get into college. ",30Sep2017,1

I have been teaching this particular girl for four years now. She's extremely beautiful, but as she advanced from freshman to sophomore to junior, she was nothing more than a student to me. We have always had a terrific student/teacher relationship. In fact she asked me to accompany her to an academic banquet where students (with their family) can bring a teacher that inspires them. Obviously I was very honored! Still, nothing more than student/teacher.

It is killing me from the inside out. My gut is twisted. My mind is scrambled. I keep trying to push thoughts of her out, but they persist. I go through all the scenarios of how awful this is from every perspective. Yet the thoughts are there.

240,"I'm in a pretty bad place right now. 

I worked super hard in high school to get into a good college, and now that I'm here, I'm not sure that I want to be. 

I live in the central United States, and I got into an Ivy League school on the east coast. I know it's an amazing school and that I worked incredibly, incredibly hard to get here, but I'm just sad-- all the time. It comes in waves, but it's always in the back of my head: I wish I were back home. I miss my family and my dog and my friends who stayed home for college. I miss always having my family nearby to talk to and share my burdens with-- I have no support group here and I miss it, constantly. 

I read up on homesickness and the general consensus is that it's a pretty normal thing, and that it fades over time. I've been here nearly a month and it doesn't really feel any better than it did after the excitement wore off a few days after I moved in. The sadness just consumes me-- I constantly wish I were home, and I have no energy and no motivation to study. I sit in my room on the verge of tears every day. I always had my family nearby to take a break and talk to if I got tired of school-- here I don't have that, and I barely have friends to talk to either. 

I've talked to my mom about how I feel and she's been very understanding and said that if I feel that I can't work through this that I can 100% transfer home, but that she truly thinks I'll regret it. I am scared that I will too. Like I said, I worked super hard to get here and it's an amazing school, but on the other hand I truly feel that being away from my family is making me depressed-- I'm not eating as much as I normally would, I have no energy, I don't want to leave my dorm... I see people all around me happy to be here and I don't know why I'm feeling like this. If I were simply here because I wanted to get away from home, I probably would've transferred back already. But that's not the reason I came here-- to be at an Ivy League school is such a huge accomplishment and opportunity and all my family, teachers, and friends have told me how proud they are. I was proud of myself, too. All throughout high school, I read up on how to perfect your application and what these schools look for, I got straight A's in the highest-level classes I could take, I even earned an associate's degree during high school that I knew wouldn't transfer just to help my application... and I guess it worked. And now I'm wishing I hadn't even gotten in in the first place. All I can think about it how much happier I'd be right now if I hadn't gotten in in the first place and was just at the university close to my house with my friends and I could commute and see my family every day. 

This is honestly tearing me apart from the inside-- I don't know what to do. Do I pick my family and happiness, or do I pick the amazing school that I worked so hard to get into?

I don't know what to do right now. ",30Sep2017,6
241,"Hi there Redditor, 
  
  This is the first time I've ever posted in this community so please take it easy on me. I've had a very long week and am just looking for ""outside"" opinions on my situation. I'm sorry for the long read but in order to understand my situation, I want you to know all the facts before possibly giving me some advice. Thank you for even taking time out of your day to read a teenage girl's problems. I know it probably seems pretty dumb to many, my petty little problems, but right now I'm heart broken and just feeling pretty lost so any advice at all would be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance 💜. 

  To begin with, you should probably know I'm a 19 year old female. That of course means drama, that I normally try my best to keep to a minimum. As of last night however, I broke up with my boyfriend. The thing is I'm absolutely MADLY in love with this man. He's the first guy in my life (relationship wise) to ever treat me right and also the first real ""serious"" relationship I've ever had. He's given me flowers, remembers any sort of ""little thing"" about me and will bring me food on the worse days of my life. He lets me call him at 3 in the morning because I'm so stressed and just listens to what I have to say and ALWAYS calms me down. He's patient with and just hugs me if I'm having a bad day. He helps me study and remain focused in school and also really just helps me have fun and kind of ""cut loose"" on the weekends. Most of all though, he's there for me and truly loves me. Something I truly, cannot thank him enough for. To you all, this may not seem like a lot but he's more than I could of ever thought possible. 


See the thing is, I'm not very religious, but because I never got to go to Prom (no guy ever asked me and all my friends had dates they were already going with), I would pray every night just for a man to eventually care about me. Of course this got added on later after some heartbreak, but after countless days of crying in my car and eating alone because all my friends were on their ""date night"", and I had no one else to eat with and didn't want to sit in a restaurant alone, I also prayed for a guy just to listen to what I have to say and eat food with me from time-to-time. This way, I could also have a ""date night"" and have a day of the week to look forward to instead of crying alone to Adele while eating some Chipotle (you can judge me, but I was in a rough place in life). So this man means absolutely everything to me. I tell him all the time how very fortunate I am to have a guy like him. Most women are married to guys who don't even pay attention to them, but I found a guy who looks at me, smiles and tells me how ""pretty"" I am. He loves making me blush with those little comments and he also loves making me happy. He would do anything to make me laugh and I'd do anything to make him laugh and smile as well. I try to be there best I can, comfort Gina me always talk to him and offer advice if he needs any. But really, he's the fantastic one, inside and outside of the bedroom as well as an all around, fantastic guy inside and out. He's also, literally, the guy who answered my prayers and showed me what it's like to be loved.


However, that's what makes my situation now seem impossible and why I feel so heartbroken. I know at this point, you're probably confused as to why I broke up with him. Well the actual problem is with ME. I'm currently trying to get my degree and become a Commercial Pilot. Let's just say the past year-and-a-half of college has not exactly gone ""according to plan"". I wouldn't say I'm that dull, but when it comes to Aviation it's been an uphill battle for me. I knew it would be since I went in to this major pretty blind (meaning I don't have family in aviation or many connections so all the information is brand new, whereas, most my peers have had 18+ years of being exposed to aviation through their family and such). However, I never imagined it would be this difficult. Now that I'm a Sophomore, my GPA is struggling to remain adequate enough for the aviation requirements. I'm retaking some classes that will replace my failed grades from before and I have honestly never studied harder or taken school more seriously than I do right now. However, I have been reconsidering what I'm really and truly capable of. After much discussion with my parents, I've decided that if this semester doesn't work out, I will be moving back home with them (a state away) and going for a different degree at a college near them. It's not really what I want to do at all since becoming a pilot has been my dream, and I'm still fighting hard for it, it just feels like it's not going to happen especially after yesterday.

 So, Friday I had two exams in one day and a speech to give. I made a 100% on my speech,  my exam in Chemistry I think I did pretty well on (80%+), but when it came to one of my aviation classes I just bombed the heck out of it. This particular aviation class consists of only four grades. Three of those four grades are 3 different tests, and the last grade consists of our final exam (another test, but this one carries more weight on our overall grade). I realized that while I don't have my test grade back yet, I still know I failed my first exam in that class. I know this because halfway through I was tilting my head like a puppy and going,""I have never seen this material in my life. This is simply a disaster."" Needless to say, I had to fill in most the short answers with some BS I know isn't right, but was my best guess with the information that I was given and what I know from previous classes/experience.  So I talk to my boyfriend immediately following the class. It was the last class of the day and I was really looking forward to seeing him last night because he always makes me very happy. However, while on the phone I finally realize that this is going to be a class I hardly pull off even if I make 100's on my next three exams. He knows what's at stake and just told me to calm down, but I also realize that because I just failed that test I will be getting the boot out of the Aviation program I'm desperately clinging to stay in. This means in December, I will have to leave the state and return home to my parents. This, not becoming a pilot and Pershing my dreams :/ 

I start crying because you know, I'm human and have a breaking point. Also, no one likes feeling, let alone, actually being, a failure. It just feels like even after days of studying I can't pull off the grades I need to in my own degree and also it's just been a long day. At this point, I'm exhausted and my boyfriend is explaining how ""everything is going to be okay and just work out"". How I wish I could believe him, he's just so f***ing great. But I also realize, I'm the one holding him back in the relationship. Between crying, stressing myself out and causing him unnecessary stress over this degree, having to move away in December, I'm like the parasite he doesn't need in his life. I need him, but he simply doesn't need me. I'm also basically stringing-him-along because if I leave in December he's not exactly coming with me. Why would I force him to stay with a failure like me who will be living about 250 miles away? I decided to tell him all of this, at which point he of course insisted that I made him ""happy"" and ""completed him"" just like I feel he completes me and that we could ""make things work even if it's long-distance"". Why would I make such a great guy stick with me, a failure he won't be able to see after December? So I broke things off. As soon as I hung up the phone, I balled my eyes out for about 4 hours until I fell asleep for pure exhaustion and heartbreak. He of course has texted me all last night and today, about how much he ""loves me"" and doesn't want me to ""go"". I don't want to ""go"" either, but for the next few months, I don't want to get closer to him in fear of hurting him even more when I probably have to leave and never return to this state, after December. 

So dear Redditor I hope you can see my dilemma and I appreciate you hearing me out and probably, my dumb life story. Again, I apologize for the long read but I just need someone, anyone, to understand and offer some words of advice while feeling very lost and of course, heartbroken like most teenage girls. So I leave the following question in your hopefully, very capable hands...

Should I be selfish, and try to get back with him or should I just keep fighting for my grades best I can alone? Alternatively, should I just do both? Fight for my grades while apologizing to him and hoping he'll take me back while working best I can, for my grades to get me past December? If there's any other route or suggestion you think I should take please let me know in the comments below.

243,"What would be the best way to still rise towards success while it is impossible to stay physically and digitally away from them?

TLDR: I feel like the low level of academic capability pulls me down some, but this person and I share common experiences and it is IMPOSSIBLE to not encounter them for at least one year. What you you do?

Background:
I’ve been friends with someone for four years now. We’ve never been best friends, but we’re friends nonetheless. Recently, I’ve been planning my ultimate future goals, which involves maximizing my monetary, physical, social, professional, and academic well-being. In self-help podcasts, videos, etc., leaders emphasize that we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with. This friend is somewhat slow/unintelligent and strives to pass all courses with the minimum requirements. On top of that, they seem to take forever to absorb concepts, even in regular conversations. For example, I was explaining a simple acronym, and this person took a solid minute or two to understand why the letters of the acronym made sense. 
I wish I could say that I was a super strong human being who is unaffected by the environment, but my weaknesses seem to have amplified since I started hanging around this person more this year. I cannot avoid this person for at least one year, so I’m not sure how I could even begin to stay away from them.


Edit: replace ""I"" with ""you"" in the title for clarity.",30Sep2017,1
245,"I have this friend, that I haven't been friends with in two years because she dropped me like a hot potato. It was over something really dumb that no one ever agreed with her about. She's also a friend of my sisters and my sister invited both of us to her Halloween party next month. I was uncomfortable about seeing her again after all this time and my sister told her that so she reached out to me. The conversation wasn't a huge success and things were still awkward. I didn't think we would talk much and definitely not see each other before the party so I still felt really uncomfortable. I invited my other friend who really is a nice girl and has put so much effort into being my friend even though I constantly curve her. I wanted someone to be there with me so I wouldn't feel sad when friend number 1 didn't talk to me because things were still awkward. Now, friend number 1 and I have really hit it off and have been talking a lot and just saw each other last night and everything is like normal again. At this point I wish I hadn't invited friend number 2 because it is going to get in the way of myself and friend number 1 having the best time that we could. Them two don't know each other so I couldn't hang out with both at the same time. What should I do?",30Sep2017,1
