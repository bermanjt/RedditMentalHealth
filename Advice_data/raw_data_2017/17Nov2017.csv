I cannot tell you how many times I've gotten Trump questions/comments/accusations once they find out I'm from the US. Most are somewhere along the lines of... ""FILL IN THE TRUMP BLANK must be super embarrassing....... You're skinny for an American..... You're LANGUAGE is good for an American.... TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP""

To say I'm tired of this is the understatement of the century. I'm trying to be understanding and ignore it, but I haven't found a reply that shuts down such conversations..

My question is: is there a responce to such ignorant statements that  is somehow polite/educating/shuts down the conversation?  My go to at this point has been something along the lines of ""Yes, as a 21 year old from California I did not decide.....""

Please note that I am not looking to hide who I am, so pretending to be something else is not the answer I am looking for. I'm hoping for some phrases I can use that can shut down such conversations politely. 

Thank you in advance :) ",17Nov2017,1

2,"When I first rushed it was honestly great I learned a lot and got to meet a ton of really cool people and hoped that unlike high school I'd have some really close friends who'd have my back and even to hang out with however recently I've gotten the feeling that I'm really not liked by my fraternity in general they will get mad at me for stuff other brothers get Scott free with , I feel like I'm always being talked badly about and I can't remember one of the brothers or even one of my pledge brothers messaging me asking to hang out recently it's been upsetting me to the point of me telling my president that I want to drop however my father doesn't want me to leave his fraternity and my schools pretty small so it'd almost be impossible to avoid them If I did so I should I stay and try even harder or should I just leave?

3,"I put this in the sex subreddit, but decided to try here too. 

I’d like some perspective on something that really changed the sex mood between my girlfriend and me today. I had just finished giving her oral and she had a strong orgasm and was giggly. She then went to the bathroom to put in her diaphragm. While she was walking in there, I grabbed my phone. She asked me “Why are you getting your phone? Are you going to watch porn?” When I said yes and that it was to keep me hard while she got ready, she immediately teared up and said she didn’t like it. Seeing her strong reaction, I did not look up any porn.


We proceeded to have sex, and afterwards, she told me she wanted to talk about it. She said she doesn’t like porn, but puts up with me looking at it during my alone time since she sometimes gives in to watch it herself every few months or reads erotica. And she didn’t want to be a hypocrite. She said, however, she doesn’t want it in the bedroom unless it’s discussed beforehand and we agreed that the porn would be used as a foreplay. When I told her that I don’t want to go soft, she said that she’s usually only in there a minute and she would gladly suck me hard again. She also offered to put in her diaphragm before sex (we usually avoid this since spermicide tastes awful).

On a side note, she has mentioned in the past that I look at my phone too much and watch TV a lot. While I don’t agree with this, I have made adjustments. When she talks to me, I turn off my phone and we turn off the TV during dinner. She has said she likes these adjustments and is happier with it. At the end of our post-sex conversation, she said she didn’t want “another screen” in our bedroom. She wanted intimate time to be just the two of us. She asked if I understood and saw her logic. I told her I did. She said she is drawing the line here and this is a deal breaker. She understood if I wanted to break up with her. I told her I didn’t and I love her and wouldn’t do it anymore.

Is she overreacting? How do other feel about this? Is it a common occurrence? I don’t think porn is a big deal. I would not mind if she watched it to get in the mood. While I have agreed not to watch it during sex anymore, I wanted to have other people’s perspective in it.

So, as such, I tend to spend a lot of time on my computer and tend to just skip dinner. So one day my mother knocks on my door and says let's go eat.

It's around 6PM, so I say ""I'm not hungry,"" and then my mother asks ""Can't we please just have a nice dinner?"" and i promptly respond ""But, I'm not hungry. My presence does not affect your ability to eat in any way.""

My mother then proceeds to flip her shit, starts crying, asks why she couldn't have a better son and that she'd be better off dying, she didn't ask for this, etc. Then my dad comes over and punches me in the stomach and tells me not eat because my mother was crying. I go downstairs to clear up the situation and only get more shit and see my mother crying over a table, with my father telling to ""Get the fuck out of here,"" so I leave.

What in God's holy fucking name did I even do wrong? I don't fucking get it. I've sort of concluded that acting myself doesn't really work and putting up an act is the only way to deal with people this emotional and fixated on family.

10,"To get this started I am a female currently in high school, just for some context.

The girl who lives next door to me, lets call her M, was my best friend since we were in about 3rd grade. We constantly hung out and were basically the same person. 

Once we entered junior high, things got shaky. We both liked the same boys and constantly fought. We were very off and on. In 9th grade I was suffering from severe anxiety and I was terrified to tell anyone. I eventually worked up the courage to tell my best friend in the whole world. 

She told me I was faking.

She told me I had no idea what real anxiety was and that I faked everything. She then told our other friends that I was faking anxiety. Some of them bullied me to the point where I was having multiple anxiety attacks in the bathroom everyday at school. It was one of the lowest points in my life. My best friend betrayed my trust and hurt me in ways that still haven't healed to this day.

We remained friends for nearly a year after that, she did eventually apologize and I reluctantly accepted. (She often said how if I wasn't friends with her she would kill herself, she suffered from depression). About halfway through 10th grade I cut ties off with her completely.

Recently, almost a year later, she has begun to sit with my new friends and I at lunch and on free periods. At first I was mad, and my new friends were too since I had told them what she had done to me. But I slowly began to realize, I missed her.

M and I are the still the same person. We listen to the same music, watch the same shows, have the same sense of humor, dress the same. We get years and years of inside jokes. It is so refreshing to feel comfortable joking with someone. 

But I don't know if I should be friends with her again. While what she did to me was wrong, I really did miss her and enjoy hanging out with her now. 

Do I keep her cut off so she doesn't manipulate and bully me again or do I let bygones be bygones? ",17Nov2017,0
12,"This happened basically 5-6 years ago but it still really bothers to me this day. I need a place to vent about it as well as get some thoughts on it. 

To start this off I know I am a total scum bag.

I was best friends with a girl in HS/college and basically took advantage of our relationship. She was a total bombshell and I was classically friend zoned. She would often fall asleep and I realized that she was a HEAVY sleeper and not many things would wake her up.

She often invited me over to her place and I would stay the night if we were doing things late. We would share the same bed and she would often not wear a bra and have on skimpy little shorts. One night while I was drunk I couldnt resist and basically groped her while she was sleeping. I did this several more times and it progressed to fingering her. This would happen atleast every week for over a year. Eventually we grew a part and are not friends any longer, but this still kills me to this day.

One other thing that really complicated it for me was atleast the fact that several years later (while she was on ecstasy) admitted that she knew I was doing it all along. This completely confused me as she would continually invite me over and ask me to sleep over with her all the time. She would even go as far as purposely sleeping next to me in cases where we had options. Also to mention she had a boyfriend for alot of this time. What do you guys make of this?",17Nov2017,1
13,"My husband relapsed on Monday. He then (finally) came home around 5 pm. He said he wasn't going into work the next day. I heard him call Tuesday morning and said he burned his hand badly and couldn't come in (a lie).  Later that day, he *deliberately* burned his own hand and produced a large blister.  It is a horrific burn.  This level of manipulating and ability to withstand pain scares me. How can someone do that? Is he a psychopath?

Add: We have been together for seven years. He was a recovering crack addict when we met. Two years ago, he relapsed and used for months. I said go to rehab or we are done. (Lots more to that story). So he went to rehab and was there for around a year.  Now he relapsed again, but he immediately spoke to his NA / AA contact. As far as staying with him...it is iffy right now. (Lots of water under the bridge.) I know addicts can be selfish, lie, and manipulate for their drugs, but what scares me, though, is the length he was willing to go to cover up a lie.  To me, this is a major eye opening to his character. I am just stunned, and saddened.",17Nov2017,10

I am in a relationship with this girl, over two years. We started as a LDR in the same country (Italy). Before being a couple, we have been friends for more than 3 years. 
So, it's not like I am afraid or something, but It bugs me. 

While were in bed, doing things young adults do in bed, an embarassing thing happened during It. I will not specify what (if it's so relevant for some us PM me. But not, It wasn't a really quick ejaculation, It only happened once and I was completely relaxed. Things happen).  I was reaaaaally embarassed that day, but not even 8 hours later the thing was never quoted or anything. Yet, It returned to my mine again.

21,"My roomate and I got to college a few months ago and since we've been good friends since hs , we got along pretty well and we're both super compatible with great chemistry. During the first week, we each developed crushes on 2 different girls on our floor. I had a crush on one girl (let's call her Susan)  and he had a crush on another girl (lets call her Pusan). Now he's an extrovert and I'm an introvert who's super awkward and bad with people and use memes and jokes to get people to like me while he actually talks to people and compliments them and stuff and takes initiatives wheras I'm completely reactive.  Our conflicting natures came into play hard when it came to our respective crushes (he followed her around like a puppy,  always wanting to help her with stuff and talk to her and I would like wait around a corner if I had a feeling my crush was gonna be around there and then ""accidentally "" run into her and try to strike up a conversation or ask if i could go along with her to get food at the dining hall because she usually goes alone (we're pretty similar in terms of social skills)). 



2 weeks go by and my roomate messes up with his crush big time. He has this awful habit of not respecting privacy and simply turning people's doorknobs to see if they're there instead of knocking like a normal person. He did this to his crush's room and saw her and her roomate sleeping and decided to take a video of them and send it to them with the caption ""you guys should really lock your door."" They understandably flipped out and didn't talk to him for a day and since he needs people's attention to thrive , he was bummed for the entire day. As me and him were heading back to our dorm room, he suggests stopping by my crush's room to hang out (he was trying to help me out,  but he knows i didn't want it due to my social anxiety). I didn't wanna bother her so i told him not to but he did it anyway and I followed him. We ended up having a fun time and swapped stories of our troubled pasts and all that good stuff before he tried to get rid of me by loudly reminding me of a prior commitment I'd made to meet a friend at a school club. I honestly wanted to spend more time with her but i didnt wanna flake so i went anyway and still had a fun time. When i came back they were still chatting and we all ended up going back to our (mine and my roomate's) room and swapping memes, watching monty python and the holy grail (she was a major fan and neither of us had seen it) and just talking in general. By the end of the night, after she left he told me that he thinks he likes her as well. 


Now everybody always told me I was too nice and I've never been one to prove someone wrong  (it's rude!!). I also saw that he was still bummed from blowing things with Pusan so I told him he could go for it (honestly thought nothing would come of it since she never had a bf and didn't look like the dating type, guess that'll teach me to assume stuff huh?) He asked her to get dinner with us literally the next night and then told her i would be staying home doing homework and went alone with her. They ended up swapping more stories and talking and he confessed to her that very same night, just 1 night after messing things up with his old crush who he was crazy about. She said yes and they started dating and they started spending time alone without me and since they were the 2 people i liked best and hung around with the most, i fell into a deep pit of depression and despair for like 2 weeks.


Now my crush (AKA my roomate's gf) is pretty much identical to me in terms of mannerisms and personality. She's way too nice, introverted, socially awkward,  clumsy and completely passive. My roomate noticed this and started feeling ridiculously guilty every time he tried to do sexual stuff with her because he felt like she was just going along with it to please him and he had an experience like that prior where one of his exes didn't wanna have sex but he went along with it anyway. She was fine afterwards but he tried to kill himself out of guilt. This led to him like having doubts about their relationship which he expressed to me (at this point I was reasonably over it and was friends with both of them and we all hung out pretty frequently) and I told him that I got the same sort of vibe from her (pure honesty) and told him that maybe he rushed into a relationship too quick. She was also becoming a little annoyed because my roomate is kind of a doofus and always got distracted by the most minute things whenever he was supposed to be doing other stuff and was super flaky as a result. He would also go out and party with his frat and his friends and come home drunk or high frequently and rely on us to take care of him (which we did, but it was still annoying). She never touched drugs or alcohol in her life, she was valedictorian in her old hs, so this stuff really scared her and I had to play the moral support for both of them. She also didn't like smoking and he'd gotten a vape because a friend told him it was cool. They'd started arguing over it a little bit which filled my roomate with even more doubts about them( this was like 2 months into the relationship). He also made up with Pusan and found himself having a crush on her again even though he was dating Susan (my crush). He also always felt guilty about dating her because he knew I liked her first. He ended up breaking up with her and confessing his feelings to Pusan which she did not reciprocate. 



Right after finding out she didn't like him back,  he started convincing himself he'd made a huge mistake and wanted to try to get Susan back. I tried to talk him out of it , but he wouldn't be swayed.  I ended up activating my trap card and told her I liked her again (which wasn't completely true) , which was the only thing that would stop him from making a big mistake and trying to rebound off of her. I was trying to protect both of their emotional health for the long term because they were both upset and heartbroken but getting back together after 2 days wouldn't be good for them so I had to keep up this facade for a few days. I already felt ridiculously guilty about being this manipulative and gross and my roomate only compounded onto it by guilting me and saying that he genuinely believes they belong together and asking me to put my feelings aside for the sake of his happiness again (he's not the most selfless guy). I stuck to my guns though and we were all just emotional wrecks for a few days until Pusan told me that my roomate had used me as one of the reasons why he broke up with Susan. 



I was furious and this ended up being our first fight as roomates and he ended up apologizing for telling her i liked her (I was bullied previously and this brought back hardcore memories) and I also ended up admitting I didn't actually like her anymore in the interests of pure transparency  (I explained my reasoning of course and he understood). He ended up going over to her room that night to ""do homework"" because he ""was always more focused in there"". It was a really thinly veiled attempt to get back together with her and the girl had just started coming out of her pit of despair and sadness so she was ridiculously vulnerable and he knew that, plus he also knew she's too nice to say no even if she's uncomfortable and took full advantage of that. He also actively tried to keep me away from her (ex: grabbing my arm and holding me under the guise of some stupid meme when I was gonna go get food at the same time as her and only letting go once she came back and also asking me to get him food so I'd be gone longer and they could be alone). They ended up getting back together a week after they broke up and also announced that they're planning on living together next year WOO. They both really like me and I really like them so they wanted me to live with them as well , but I worry too much about them and their relationship and their mental health and it has caused me to flip out and lose sleep and neglect my work in the past and I didn't think I could handle a whole year of doing that again, especially living with them right next to me. We were also planning on including a friend of ours (let's call him Joe) and Joe's gf (uhh molly?). Molly didn't go to college or work because she has a ton of mental issues due to her being raped and abused by her dad and molested by her boss at work and she needs Joe around constantly because of her anxiety. Joe is one of the most hardworking and caring guys i know and I wanna help them out by living with all 4 of them  (since molly isn't a student she's not allowed to stay in on campus housing, but it'd be a secret thing and I'm afraid of them possibly getting a shitty random roomate who might rat them out).

My other friend (Carl?) Offered me a spot in his house next year and it's with a few other friends who I really like and get along with and I'd absolutely enjoy living with them and it'd also be a lot better for my mental health because I don't have to deal with the stress of worrying about my roomate and his gf and Joe and Molly, but i feel ridiculously guilty about leaving them because I dont wanna leave their roomate to chance and possibly risk them getting busted and also I'll miss my roomate a lot.


What should I do?

Tldr: Roomate dating my crush, their relationship hasnt been the most stable thing and I worry about both of them and they want me to live with them and my other friend and his gf who are great but kinda unstable.

22,"I know this is either going to make me seem really selfish/ungrateful. But it's really been fucking with my heart and thoughts lately so I want to see if I'm just plain wrong about it.

In 2016 I had been planning to move from Texas to Wisconsin so I could attend school with my then girlfriend. In December I was all set, had a place there for me, and had been registered for classes. After New Years day my GF broke up with me. And a week later she contacted me and convinced me she'd give me a second chance if I went to school there and worked on the problems she had with me. (Really generous I know). My whole family was against it. So I used my stored up airline points and flew to the school.

I worked with the financial office to get a loan, and my grandparents helped pay for the semester as well. About 2 and a half months in I find out my Ex has a new BF. I was already severely depressed and contemplating suicide, this just pushed me over the edge. My roommate found me crying and took me to the hospital. I stayed in the mental section for a week, and at the advice of the doctors and my family, I dropped out of school and flew back home. 

Sadly I had stayed too long at the school for me to drop out without getting a refund or paying the whole stay. So my mom and dad decided to pay off the rest of the bill for me. ($4,000). I went to therapy, worked on myself, and took medication for my Bipolar disorder. My therapist and doctor recommended school for 2017 Fall, but said focus on that with no need to work. So here I am, in school and doing great!

Until my mother calls and says she wants to call my Wisconsin school. She wants to tell them they wont pay the rest and they should bill me instead, but also I don't have a job so they will have a hard time getting their money. I tried to explain that they were almost done paying off the school and that I was currently looking for a job. After a long call I only got them to reconsider by telling them I didn't want any Christmas money this year, and I did not want them paying for my medication. So that the money from those 3 things would go towards the school bill.

On top of all that my father makes really good money. And goes on crazy vacations and buys old mustangs all year round for fun. So when they complain about money being tight it really irks me. Especially since when my younger sister wanted to go to a religious supernatural ""school"" they gave her their new car to take with her. So she's off casting out demons and healing the sick with their car, but I can't be helped with my mistake. I dunno. Am I just a selfish idiot? ",17Nov2017,1

Obviously it's easy to say ""Just focus on you,"" but its a lot harder to genuinely take a break from dating. To stop caring about what people think about you (in a sexual/dating way). To stop wanting someone around.

So does anyone have any practical/tangible advice on how to do a better job of shutting off that part of me (not forever, but for a while) and focusing on myself? Maybe books that helped you do that or TV shows/movies that helped or honestly I'm open to anything.

They said that they didn't even read my last message and wished me luck and said that I could message them if things got worse or changed. 

I feel kinda mad. It just seems kinda rude to cut someone off like that. Not that I expect someone to message me or anything.

For example, today we were at the gym and I was trying to teach her how to play badminton and she felt so uncomfortable that people were watching her that she wouldn't move on the court. She felt as if she was not allowed to walk or run and only return the shuttlecock from where she was standing. 

Another example is when we're out running on the streets she will run around the neighboorhood the long way to avoid seeing anyone on our way back home. Knowing people certainly doesn't help. 

Sometimes she'll feel so uncomfortable around people that she wont allow me to hold her hand because she feels as if people are watching and getting ""grossed out"" because we're showing too much PDA. 

The thing is, she feels very comfortable when its only people she knows and she is expecting to see. She's very comfortable with me and spends most of her day with me. We make vlogs together and share them on youtube for thousands to see; that doesn't seem bother her. 

Does anyone have any advice for her?

Primarily one which I will be focusing on in this post. The first time I had seen her was in the hallway between classes and immediately was hooked by her looks. Then once a week or so I'd see her again in the hallway. There wasn't a consistency to it but whenever I did see her it was impossible to look away. A few months after this went on I accidentally came across her Instagram, which is a page that is frequently visit. I have to clarify that my attraction to her looks are not sexual in any way. I am just captivated by her beauty. I figured some people may assume it is a sex driven thought, but its not. I find myself different to most guys as I find the most attractive physical quality to be the face. As time goes by the feeling doesn't fade like it usually does when I find someone beautiful like the other girl mentioned at the beginning of this post. None of my friends were good friends with her or good friends with her good friends. I have never talked to her. I have had 0 classes with her. I don't exist to her. Yet when I hear her name a storm of emotions hit with no hesitation. She is fairly popular not extremely but still a considerable amount compared to me and my few friends. I was just wondering how weird it is to be obsessed like this with someone you've never met or talked too.

Back when I was 19, I was offered by my doctors to have a surgery done that would greatly improve my quality of life and help me become more independent and cut down on some heath issues arising from my condition. I agreed, knowing the severity of the surgery, how long it would take, and the recovery period (13 hours in the OR and at least a week in the hospital recovering). I get to the hospital and basically the whole night I was scared to death and there was a little voice in my head basically saying ""Get the hell out of here"". The next morning as they were coming in to do the final preparations (blood drawing, vitals, the whole 9 yards), I tell them to get my surgeon because I decided I couldn't do it. The doctor understood that I was terrified and wanted to go home but told me the offer was still on the table.

I've got an Associate's degree in Criminal Justice, and working on a second in the same program under a different focus, I've got a part-time temporary job (until the end of the year) that I'm hoping I can parlay into becoming a full-fledged employee, while I also have my name in the hat to work in a different department at the courthouse I work in, and have one class left until I graduate with my second Associate's.

Recently, I've started to kick myself for running out on the surgery all those years ago and am going to talk to my doctors about getting it done while I know I won't have to worry about getting a bill because I'm more than covered by insurance right now.

2. When the stars align and I finally do sit down to write, I lose inspiration almost immediately. Perhaps it's self-criticism, but the words just don't flow. Or I get 300 words in and decide it's stupid. Or I feel too rushed. Or, (and this one happens quit often) I get THE BEST IDEA EVER but decide I'm not ""ready"" to write about that yet.

58,"I work for a very small company that has no trained or experienced HR representative. In May, my husband found out he was deploying with 3 weeks notice and we have an infant with no childcare in place. I had to take a few weeks off to arrange childcare and then lived as a single parent for 6 months which included doctors appointments, sick days, and one vacation that had been planned in January. I recently asked for a day off in December and was denied with the reason of “low staffing” which is a complete load of shit. I talked to an employee who said my supervisor saw the request and told her, “there’s no way in hell I’m giving her any more time off.” I asked my supervisor about it and was told to, “lose my little attitude,” and then he proceeded to yell at me saying other people deserve time off too. I did some digging and found out that no one else needed time off that day, he was just being petty. After some other issues with the same supervisor earlier this year (he banged and rattled the door knob when I would breast pump), I decided to write down my grievances and go to the CEO. He told me that he would get down to the bottom of it and talk to me the next day. Today, he pulled me into his office and stated that my supervisor was just “bitchy” because of all of the time I had needed off earlier in the year and that I need to start “repaying” them for it. He told me that I can no longer take lunches or breaks and I need to work my solid 8 hours and bend over backwards to prove my gratefulness.

60,"So I’m in high school, currently in my junior year. I’m taking the IB program which to sum it up is hard globally focused classes that force you to do most every subject. 

So basically I’ve always been a relatively good student (Got a single C in Latin freshman year). My unweighted GPA at the end of last year was just under a 3.5. I’ve done quite well on the PSAT (I’ll take the official one soon) with a 1250. 

I feel like this year is just too hard. I’m struggling to get As and am at risk of getting a C in Chemistry but the worst is Math (SL if that means anything to you). I received a D last quarter and this quarter I currently have a D. I’ve had a tutor, 100% homework completion, and a decent quiz grade for this quarter. We received our tests today and I received a 33/100. I don’t know why, but I just can’t grasp some of these concepts. Everything, with a few exceptions, has always come easy to me. Now I’m not so sure. Even on the PSAT that I recently took, I simply didn’t feel confident and honestly expect a worse score. 

The only good news is that I’ll be able to complete the IB program I’m in because they’ll have an easier math class (math studies) next year. I don’t think I’ll be able to get this math class taken off my transcript though. Everything, all this work, doesn’t seem to be adding up. I can get a 4 on AP US, a 5 on AP GOV, a 790/800 on my US History subject test but none of it will matter. My grades are not adding up. Everything seems to be too much. I’m a disappointment and worse off I haven’t even told my parents yet (They know I got a D in math last quarter but that’s it). I don’t even know if I should keep it up with this whole IB thing.

but then i moved. two states away. we were both really sad about it. we agreed to try long distance and lasted only three months. he's really busy back at home because of class and his mental issues. i got upset because he would make a promise to have a phone call or to just talk and then at the end of the day would either say, ""i don't feel like talking"" or ""i'm tired, i'm sorry."" so when i brought up the problem on multiple occasions, he got overwhelmed and we broke up.

  **1 Incident** (7th Grade; Science Fair): My school nearly opted out of allowing me to go to Counties for Science Fair, on account that my teacher did not like that I did not hold meetings with him during lunch. Thankfully, however, I talked to my science teacher and principal, finally allowing myself to go. For the sake of showing the school's flaw, I'll let it be known that I ended up getting 1st place in states.

Essentially, the first instance was just to set a premise for my present issue as well as show this reoccurring theme.


*Current Issue*: Last year, I participated in National Pentathlon through my team (I did incredibly well). This year, however, they decided to not put me on the team, for a multitude of reasons. Nonetheless, to provide some background, I **1**have the highest GPA and Pentathlon Entrance Test Scores (which they claimed were the only factors for **not** being placed on the team which is obviously BULLSHIT. **2** Last year, I took part of Pentathlon and was the **highest** ranked scorer in the entire nation. 

Regardless of these feats and stats, my school decided to not place me on the team. **Their reason?** My GPA and Pentathlon Entrance Test Scores were too low. (I just found out today that I had the best GPA and Test Score.  

I would first like to say why they truly did not put me on the team. The principle of our school pulled me aside before they announced the pentathlon teams and said that many parents were pressuring him not to put the same students on the team. Also, he said all the teachers had personally came up to him to discuss why I (the student) was not placed on the team. In conclusion, parents complained that I should not be on the team even though I clearly deserved to be placed on the team.

Additionally, every single teacher of mine has pulled me aside today to let me know that there were some **other factors** beyond the GPA and Test Scores.

How the FUCK do I cope with this????? The last week has been a huge dent in my confidence and ego.  

Sorry it's kind of lengthy, but thank you.

Around night after we take baths etc, we usually play computer games together on our laptops. So we face each other usually so we can chat and talk about other things as well. So the thing is... my sister's breast are small. A bit close to a b-cup but still small, so when she wears tank tops or t-shirts and lay down like usual... I can see her breast/nipple.

I don't think she noticed it yet, my staring that is... but she may notice me hiding my boners occasionally. Usually I can't stop myself from looking at it when she's distracted and looking at her screen. And it's just like... I'm not crushing on her or anything. I'm just a desperate virgin that enjoys the sight of a girl's tits/nipples in person. But I can't lie and say that's it...

Lately, I've gotten pretty bold at looking at them and even got a picture that I masturbate(d) to. Yes. So that's why I'm making this... I have a problem... I even try to ignore it sometimes but my eyes refuse to look away. Even then I've looked at them so much now that I'm finding her sexy or hot... not that she isn't but who says that about their own siblings...

The past two days she came in... first with a tank top on and short shorts up to her thighs. Even after staring at her nipples, I started staring at her ass whenever she walked away. More pathetic I wished she would wear shorts shorter than that so I can see part of her ass. And even worse I wanted to snap a pic of her walking away as well... Then last night she wore a t-shirt that drooped so low when she was laying on her stomach that I can see her breast perfectly... which I also sadly took a pic of... 

I OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PROBLEM. I don't know what to do... I'm sure it has 80% to do with being a virgin but I definitely need advice. Anyone have any solutions or experiences that made them stop feeling the need to look at sexual things? Or just know what's best for the situation? I'll take anything.

78,"Sorry didn't know what to write for the title.

Okay, so I recently started working at a retirement home. This is my first ever job, weekends only and I'm in last year of highschool. So since I have no formation, I do small things around the building. No big deal, like one weekend I'll be doing the dishes (english isn't my first language so some things might be worded weirdly), another, I'd be at the reception with someone else. Stuff like that.

But the thing is... The general environment there is kind of weird. The first day, I come in, completely lost. Some woman helps me get settled and I wait for the guy that's supposed to give me my formation so I can do the dishes. He arrives and I follow him to the employees' dining room. We take the dirty dishes and I'm kind of flustered because the dishes are place a bit everywhere on the cupboard (not actually a cupboard but I don't know the word).

He starts explaining that people are mostly in a hurry so they just leave them there like that. Okay, fine, but then a white woman in her 40s (wait for it, the fact that she is white is important for later) sitting at a table just says: ""Yeah, those Haiti women (which are a high % of the workers in the building) don't know how to place their things correctly. I bet some of them can't even read."" First reaction: did she actually say that? (Can I mention that at that moment, I've just started my first ever shift 20 mins ago). The guy besides me kind of agrees but his answer was an inaudible 'yeah...'. I think we were both like wtf. The weirdest part is that when my coworker and I were alone in the kitchen he said that some people here were...and he left it there, cuz I understood what he meant.

Next day, something weird happened again. I'm cleaning the dishes and today I'm more confident in what I'm doing so I'm really in my bubble while working. 3 women are standing in the kitchen, just staring at me and I've walked by them like 2-3 times to put plates in the right places. So at some point, one of them grabs me by the arm and I'm pretty shocked (don't like being touched). She asks me how old I am, I answer 17. And then it begins.

She points at me and says really loudly: Cambodian?! I answer no, Chinese. And then she looks at me: ""CHING CHONG CHING CHING?"" I laughed it off but I was pretty angry and my coworker just had an awkward smile.

I'm left to believe that we're the only 2 people normal in this freaking retirement home. But even then, my coworker seems to have accepted the racist comments...

SO MY BIG PROBLEM RELATED TO THIS STORY: I don't feel really comfortable in this kind of environment, a lot due to the fact that I'm the youngest there and I felt a weird vibe everytime I was in the retirement home. I know it sounds like I'm complaining since it was my first weekend there. I'm going on my second weekend, but just thinking about the place doesn't give me the want to work. 

Can I get some advice on what I should do about this?

TLDR; I'm 17 y/o started working in a retirement home on the weekends. First day there, I'm in a formation at the dishes. Taking out dishes from the employee's dining room, some white woman makes racist comments about the Haitian women working here. Second day, woman in the kitchen grabs my arm, asks my age, asks if I'm Cambodian. I reply Chinese and then she says ""ching chong ching ching?"" in my face. I'm not very comfortable there even if this was a brief summary of my first weekend at the retirement home. What should I do?",17Nov2017,37

85,"*The short story*
How can I help her:
1. get back on her own feet,
2. become financially independent from family, and
3. not simultaneously destroy our relationship?

The only ideas I have are nuclear-option:
- have her move in with me (financially near-impossible for me)
- commit her to a psych ward (endless guilt w/ more certain outcome)
- join remainder of family in cutting ties (endless guilt w/ more uncertain outcome)

*The long story*
I recently found out that my unemployed mom (well below retirement age) has been borrowing money from family members (including retired parents) for years. In retrospect it makes sense because
- she reliably deflects any ""how are you"" or ""what are you up to"" questions to another subject, even from me
- an uncannily little amount of anything changes every time I go home to visit
- despite not having a job or (afaik) enormous savings, she's still able to fly across the U.S. to visit family reunions

The rest of my family is at a loss of how to help her and is preparing to cut ties. Their ultimatums and sit-downs haven't worked.

*The wild card*
As far as I know, my estranged father lives in the area. I don't know the relationship she has with him - is it worth reestablishing one toxic relationship in the hopes of saving another existing one?",17Nov2017,1
87,"Before I start this I just want to say that if this by any chance sounds pathetic, it is. Also, I have been dealing with many different problems this year, but this one just seems to sting. 
I was best friends with this girl and she was always the pretty one. The type of girl that says “ew” if she notices ketchup on your mouth, has a very “girlish” voice, and is narcissistic. She sounds like a very basic bitch (which I am not sure if she is or not). But, that is not the point. 
The story starts off one and a half years ago when me and her (lets call her jess) were stupid and overdosed on drugs. Keep in mind that it was when we were in 8th grade and were going through the “drugs are cool” phase (spoiler: they’re not). Long story short we ended up hospitalized. My parents lost their trust in me so my whole freshman year of high school was a lonesome time when I couldn’t hang out with friends, go to football games, they wouldn’t even let me stay home alone while they went out. Jess’ mom on the other hand, let her hang out with our friends (we have a circle of four friends me, jess, and two others) and I couldn’t. Eventually, after realizing I was on permanent lockdown, my two other friends asked me what was up. I told them about the drugs but didn’t mention Jess because her mom apparently didn’t want people knowing about it. The whole year they called me stupid (which is 27749373% true bc drugs are stupid btw) and made fun of me and had no idea Jess did the same thing. I had nobody to talk to that year about what was going on and at that point me and Jess barely conversed. That was when I started to get jealous. It was unfair that my friends could hangout and I couldn’t hang out with them. What’s worse is that my parents don’t want me around Jess, and my two friends didnt know that so I had no chance of hanging out with my other friends. It’s now my sophomore year, and my other two friends finally know about Jess. Jess doesn’t know that they know, but my friends are in a way more sympathetic towards me because everything opened up. Through my friends I learned that Jess’ mom hates me (even though Jess was the main influence) and I think Jess soley blames me for the incident to her mom. Despite the fact that I had been saving Jess’ ass for a year, she acts like it never happened and has only talked about it with me once (which wasn’t a satisfactory conversation). Basically now I’m always jealous of Jess and everytime I see her or hear her it makes me mad. Of course I don’t show it, but Jess has everything better than me. She’s pretty, can do whatever the hell she wants, and she got a main lead in a play in which I auditioned for and got put into the chorus (which makes no sense bc Jess has social anxiety but all of a sudden is okay with performing in front of a huge audience because shes a brat and gets the lead role). Summed up, I hate her because she acts superior to me (and everyone on this planet), acts like the incident never happened, gets to do whatever she wants because she most likely blamed me for something i was peer pressured into doing, and recently got a part in a play that I wanted a part in (although I think the other factors have led me to hate her for this). Okay i’m done. I know all that was rooted in anger and stupidity, but thats how I feel, angry and stupid. I guess what I’m asking for is advice on what to do about this Jess situation and my friends, and how I can stop these feelings from getting to my head. I rushed writing I will gladly specify/answer questions about any specific events or stuff relating to thr situation. An honest thank you to anyone who responds because I have nobody else to talk to.

90,"When I graduate I’ll need to find a residency somewhere in a hospital, with 45k to pay back. 

If I stay in my hometown, I’ll be able to put a dent in my debt, be where my friends and family are, and have a lot of stability. 
I want to go places, live off the grid, travel and live out of a backpack, etc. But with the timing of graduation and my responsibilities, I can’t do that yet. But I’m afraid if I don’t leave, I’ll get comfortable and never freaking leave. I’ve been here my whole life and I am so antsy to get out.

If I decide to do the adventurous thing, I’ll move somewhere new and exciting, and pay back my debt much more slowly, but be in a new place starting my adventures. I met some really cool people on my last trip out of state, and they offered me a place to live in a city that’s stupid expensive, but I love it and I see my friends moving away and making it work somehow. Hell, one of my friends is living in Brooklyn and he graduated recently, and he’s having a blast and making it somehow. I know financially, moving immediately is not the smart decision. I have so many safety nets here, cost of living is low, and there’s plenty for me to do. 

Half of me thinks, just give yourself ONE more year, and then you’ll get out.

And the other half thinks, what if you get hit by a bus and die within the next year? Just go live your life!

Secondly, I wasn’t off doing something, it was my other coworker. 

Not related, but this girl has lied and told various stories at her other branch.  While I can’t deny we weren’t talking about her and I’m not sure what she saw, I feel so awkward and wonder if I should say something to her or even what to say if she approaches me about it.

92,"I've been dating my girlfriend for a little over a year now. She was 17 at the time (is 18 now) so she obviously had to listen to her parents. They don't like me at all because I have a baby with my ex-girlfriend and think I'm just dating their daughter to get her pregnant and leave her because they think that's what I did with my ex. 

My girlfriend and I have tried multiple times to explain to them that that isn't the case. I left my ex because she cheated on me and am still very much involved in my own daughter's life, but they aren't understanding it or don't want to. At one point while my girlfriend was still 17, her father came to my work and threatened my life if I didn't break up with her. I tried to listen to him out of fear because I live with my sister and two of her kids and I didn't want to put them at risk too. 

After my girlfriend kept trying to convince me not to listen to her dad, I (rather foolishly) agreed with her to keep it a secret until she turned 18. It was working perfectly until about a week before her 18th birthday when they found out we were still together. Her mom dropped her off at my apartment screaming at her to have a nice life, so I took her in. Fast forward a couple days and her father shows up at my work AGAIN and threatens that he's going to break me in half and burn my house down when he gets ahold of me. Another day later and they call the police who come retrieve my girlfriend from my apartment.

She's now 18 and we thought that would be the end of things. They have no hold over her legally as soon as she moves out of that house, and that's what we were planning on doing soon. My sister and I were going to find a bigger place to live and my girlfriend would come with us to stay while my sister and I tried to get better jobs to move into our own homes. However, her parents decided to strike again.

They told her that if she tries to leave, they'll stop her. Her dad said if she leaves when they aren't home, they will come looking for her and if they find her with me, they're going to kill me and burn down whatever home we're living in. With the marks I've seen on my girlfriend (bruises) after she told me her parents have hit her when they found out she was still seeing me, and with her father harassing me at work twice, I'm getting to the point that I can't risk those things happening. I have a daughter to think about, as well as my sister and her two children that I live with. Her father is also trying to force her to leave her job so she won't be able to support moving out with me in the first place.

So, TL;DR I guess : Is there any action I, or my girlfriend, can take about my girlfriend's father threatening my life if she tries to move out of her house even though she's 18? Or does something actually need to happen first?",17Nov2017,0

99,"I recently realized I'd been struggling with depression for a long time.  After some time thinking about it, I also realized the only times I didn't feel that way were when I was throwing myself into something so hardcore that I didn't have time to really think about how I felt.  The happiest, and most stressed I'd ever felt was when I started taking college seriously, and filling my list with as many credits as my adviser would allow.  The only social life I'd have was a study group twice a week and what I could get during lunch, the rest was medical studies and essay writing.  But then after the semester ended, I fell right back into the same depression I had before.  I ended up not being able to go to school for the fall semester due to moving out of my apartment and some new additions in my life, but I started avoiding people and getting lethargic again.  Now I've gotten myself a new job and I'm getting every single hour I can.  I'm working 11 hour shifts 6 days a week, and again, I feel exhausted, but like I'm accomplishing something.  I have no social life and no real time for games aside from a game or two of hearthstone during my lunch break, but for some reason, I don't feel depressed.

Is this unhealthy behavior?  I feel like the lack of social life and free time should make me unhappy, but instead I'm just happy I don't have to think and that my time doesn't feel like its being wasted anymore.  Have I just found that I like to apply myself, or am I using work as an addictive escape?  I'm going back to school in spring and I'm going to try to start living healthier, I'd like to start by figuring out if I should be taking 15-18 credits, or 7-10.  Is it better to be lethargic, anti-social, and stay inside all day, or go out, smile while working, and spend every waking moment working?  Should I find a middle ground, and if so, how?",17Nov2017,2
101,"In my English class, I sit with thest two guys. I have known these two for quite some time and we're pretty good friends. My first friend (we'll call him A), has the same ambitions as me; we're hardworking students who want to succeed and get into university. Other friend (friend B), went to the same elementary school as me in grade 5. Now from what I have known and what B has told me, he suffers from depression, and he had a hard time fitting in at elementary school. He has anxiety and some emotional problems as well. Unlike me and A, he isn't planning to attend university; he said that he is undecided and might take a year off to consider his options.

Me and A are both honor roll students, however, B, while getting passable grades, never got honor roll and doesn't seem to care about grades that much. I didn't really pay much attention to B (I didn't have any classes with him until this year, although I talk with him on the bus) until he was in my English class this year. And things get pretty dicey.

We started off the year reading King Lear. Now we had an essay to do, as well as a quotes test. This essay and quiz is worth a huge chunk of our mark. B was too lazy to read the book (he claimed he couldn't write about Shakespeare, which if you ask me, is not excusable since we have been practically analyzing Shakespeare's works throughout high school) and he didn't do the essay and got 0 on it. Since he didn't read the book, he also flunked the quotes test (which was supposed to be a mark booster since it was quite easy if you read the book at least.) We also had an in class essay which he didn't do well in (on his phone during the work periods, and didn't finish it), and a non-fiction test. As of now, I don't know his mark, but I mentioned it to my teacher and he said that B was not doing well. Me and A are getting decent marks, surpassing the class average.

I know that B has the potential to do well in this class (my teacher is also a philosophy teacher, and B enjoys philosophy and history, and is a good writer.) However, I don't know if it is his depression that is affecting him, or that he doesn't really care about school, but B hasn't been completing his homework. Even my teacher has been asking him why he is doing this. His grades in his other courses aren't exactly the best either, and I feel that if he doesn't pick up the pace, he may flunk English. This is bad because English is a compulsory course and if he fails, he won't be able to graduate. Like I mentioned before, he can get passable marks, albeit not the best, but now, he's actually failing the course with only one more half of the semester to catch up. 

If you have read up to this point, I am very thankful you did. Frankly, me and A are extremely concerned, since this is quite abnormal of him to do. What should I do about this situation to help B? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

105,"I have chosen the university I want based on price, services, location, etc. I began studying for the entrance exam due in February. I live in Mexico.

I have narrowed it down to three options: medicine (surgery), translation and computer science. As you can see these are three very different fields with different lifestyles and job prospects. 

I like the subjects of medicine but not the life of a doctor or a med student. I thought since I was 12 that this is what I wanted to do and it's what I'm best at and most inclined. I enjoyed biological sciences in high school and graduated with that emphasis. I want to have free weekends, study japanese at the university, work in a international company or abroad and have time to dedicate to my personal commitments. 

I don't like about 10% of the subjects in translation but the job seems fine and pays really good. Working abroad seems very possible but I don't think I would have free time with all that reading and writing. 

Computer science allows me to study japanese and use it to get a job in a japanese company, perhaps. This one has the least subjects, less class hours and more flexibility. I figure I would have free time to do everything I want and I love computers. But it's also based on math and I was never good at it, it's not something I have enjoyed in the past. The pay is good and the field is huge.

Basically freshman year I became roomates with this girl and we really hit it off we had a lot of things in common, we were both music majors, both from new york, and both had similar political views. we're both pretty introverted and its been hard for us to make friends. we hang out with other people but they're really just casual friends no one that we have deep connections with.

lately i've been becoming really annoyed with her. she's insanely stubborn and thinks she's right about everything. she cannot tolerate any opinion thats different from hers whether its about politics or music. 

we never fight but recently we got into a fight because she loves taylor swift and i said i didn't like one taylor swift song. i asked her to check out this artist i really like named sza and she straight up refused and i got pissed because she makes me listen to so much music and i always am open minded and i can't believe she wouldn't even give this one artist a chance.

i hate hanging out with her around other people because whenever she meets someone knew she starts interrogating them on their political views and if they say one thing she doesn't agree with she says they're horrible and won't even listen to another side. 

she also obsesses about boys so much. whenever she hooks up with a guy she never stops talking about it. we still talk about guys she's hooked up with one time over a year ago who she hasn't talked to since then. and she claims she doesn't have feelings for them or anything and thinks she's this ""bad bitch"" because she's casually hooking up but WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT THEN??? we always talk about the guys in her life but never the guys in mine.

she always wants to go to parties with me so we can ""get guys"" but whenever a guy starts talking to me she pulls me away because she can't deal with being alone and she never wants to go to the parties that i get invited to and where my friends are (the black ones)

she is also very co-dependent on me. she has to do everything with me. and she's said multiple times that if i ever left her she would kill herself and she says it jokingly but she's said it multiple times.

114,"Hey /r/Advice,

Tomorrow I’m planning on telling my friend/coworker that her boyfriend has been cheating on her.

I’ll refer to my friend as Jen, her boyfriend as Matt, and the other girl as Charlotte.

Two days ago someone came to me and told me Charlotte has been confiding in her that she had been sleeping with Matt throughout the summer, and it has continued till as recently as a few weeks ago. Hearing this really floored me. I won’t go into the details of how, but I️ now know as a fact that these allegations are truthful. 

Jen and Matt have been dating for about a year. 

A little about Jen, which is the important context as to why I’ve been taking a few days to gather my thoughts before telling her. Jen is diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and although her and I are not the closest of friends, (she’s a bit socially awkward) she lived with my family and I for three months this summer to get away from her emotionally abusive and unsupportive parents (Jen is 20 years old).

She moved in with us for most of this past summer and really seemed to be turning over a new leaf and figuring things out before going off on her own for the first time in her life. She started seeking treatment around this time, she was free from the bounds of her strict and abusive household, and her relationship with Matt seemed to be thriving. 

In the past month, Jen and Matt have even begun looking at engagement rings, hopeful for an engagement sometime next year. I cannot overstate how love struck Jen is with Matt. In my view, this past year or so has been her first taste of the real world and a lot of new experiences, after being raised in a vehemently religious  household.

Basically I am asking for help because I am genuinely worried about what her emotional state will be after finding this out. I don’t want to see her fall back from all of the progress she’s made. But she needs to know, I need to tell her, I know that. 

All I’ve come up with is that I could share experiences from my own life if she’s open to hearing any advice from me. I’ve been down similar emotional roads that she has, and faced large setbacks that have threatened the state of my emotional health and the progress I had made in sobriety. Im a little older than her (23) and came out the other side of similar situations stronger all said and done. I’m hoping I can convey that in a way that might benefit her. But I’m prepared that she very well may simply need space to process after I tell her. It’s not about me after all, it’s about her.

I just want to go into this conversation equip with some sort of cohesive advice or helpful words if she does want it. I’m worried, to be quite blunt Jen has hurt herself before, and regardless of the fact that informing her of Matt’s infidelity is the right thing to do, I could not stand to be the catalyst in her causing herself harm because I broke it to her the wrong way, or could not find the words of support that she may or may not need.

Thank you so much for reading and for any advice you may have

116,"My husband and I moved into a nice apartment complex in March of this year. We love it here. However, we have (new?) neighbors that have been causing a problem over the past month or so.

They are noisy. I can handle the sounds of day-to-day living, but that's not what's happening here.

The main problem is that they consistently argue early in the morning. No exaggerations-- they are shouting profanity and yelling at one another starting around 6:00 AM most weekdays. I sometimes hear a young child cry out in the middle of it all, which is the worst feeling. I have tried knocking on the wall to alert them that ""hey, we all hear you, please stop"", but the woman just yells profanities directed at me through the wall. I am pretty damn confident there is not any actual physical violence, or I would have already called the police. It's just trashy arguing.

This being said, I have not met these people or exposed my irritation directly. I have contacted the ""courtesy officer"" on-site but this has not improved the situation at all. I don't know if the courtesy officer has even stopped by their apartment, and the officer has already said that they don't do ""domestic events"" (wtf isn't everything a domestic event here?)-- this was after I clarified 'no violence, just noise'.

I daydream about taking the passive aggressive route by leaving a note on their door or mailing them a glitter bomb (hah), but I know all of this would be silly or not effective.

What recourse do I have here? If I were to call the ACTUAL cops (non-emergency), what am I even reporting? What responsibility does the apartment complex have, if any?

Direct confrontation, no matter how polite, is not an option for me, as I don't think that would be smart with these people.

I have no experience with this type of thing. Please advise me, oh mighty advisers! :(",17Nov2017,4
117,"Hey guys and gals

Im 25 years old.  Last year, I tried to get life insurance and was turned down due to elevated liver enzymes.  After a biopsy, blood work, etc., it was determined that I have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver.

Im 5'10"", 230 lbs.  Im technically considered obese.  I have stage 2 fibrosis, which will eventually lead into cirrhosis, then possibly cancer/death.  The first year, I focused on changing my eating habits.  Its been a busy year, and frankly I didnt do so well.  I work 50-60 hours a week, and im lucky if I have more than 2 days off in a month.

Does anyone have any advice on what a good exercise routine is?  I find it hard to do much because i have about 3-4 hours a day outside of work/sleep.  I have no ambition on strengthening, so perhaps a cardio routine?

As for eating habits, I dont know how to cook, and I feel intimidated.  I dont even know where to start.  I tried focusing on salads, cooking from home, and stay away from fast food.  My enzymes went down, and my liver shrunk, but it wasnt good enough.

Does anyone have some good sites, where I can read and learn about cooking, eating healthy, and recipes?  I just need it layed out so i can understand the whole concept of it rather than just a single piece.

TL;DR:  Liver disease is ensuring an early death unless I lose a lot of weight.  I need to learn about cooking and find an exercise routine (cardio?), but I work a lot, so I dont have much time to invest.  Max is 2 hours a day to focus on this.

For the most part this doesn't affect his daily life much at all, except that he can't live just as his peers do. He shouldn't binge drink at parties, become dehydrated, avoid exercise, or eat very poorly. Denial is comfortable, so he does all of these things.

Down side; it was brought on by a move up at work, and I just can not handle it. I have already requested to step down, but have not heard back yet because I have called out the past few days.

Bit of background, this is a grocery store and I have been with them for over 7 years through various stores. I've been written up for small blunders in the past, but nothing crazy.

126,"Odd post. I just missed two weeks of school due to illness that basically had me bedridden. As a result, I missed a lot and have a lot of catching up to do. It seemed very intimidating at first but after zooming out I told myself that I can get this all done if everything is air tight and there's absolutely no slacking off. However, I'm finding that my biggest problem is that I work slow. This has always been a problem for me but it is now more than ever. What I mean is that I can spend a whole day doing something without even being distracted, but I get little work done. I'll do something that I predict will take 20 mins tops and it ends up taking me an hour. Today I started working at about 4pm and it is now 10:42 and I've only accomplished 4 things. Maybe that seems like a lot but in the scheme of things I have to get done, it's not. Most of this stuff was organization (brainstorming for papers, catching up on readings for these papers). I'm a slow reader and a slow writer and I just don't know how I'm gonna manage my time with this. 

At the same time, I don't want to stress myself out too much and have reserved some time to hang out with friends as I always think this is important. But because I have so much work to do and I work so slow, I'm feeling the panic. At the rate I'm going at, I'm starting to think that things won't actually be air tight like I was hoping.

There is another technician that got hired at the same time as me but two days  after me and the funny thing is the doctor treats this girl 100% better than me. For example, say if i made a mistake the doctor would be upset with me but if the other tech made the same mistake she wouldn't even  be upset with that girl. 
I often also get blamed for that tech's mistakes, but when I speak up and say it wasn't me that did that the doctor's response is always something like ""since you're in the room with me you have to take ownership of the mistake and fix it before I even get in the room"" ??? Which doesn't make any sense because the technician that brings the patient in the room is in charge of every thing before the doctor comes in.

December of 2016 my dad traded his old not driving TDI Jetta for a 2002 VW Golf TDI. He got ripped off really badly as the car had a lot of parts that held barely together to get it to sell, now it's slowly dying on me. The transmission needs replacing and I believe I hear an engine tick but I can't really tell as I'm not a car guy myself and mechanics aren't really in my budget at the moment. Summer (June-August) of 2017 I worked a job that paid me really wrll so I bought myself a fancy laptop, Dirtbike and a few other pricey gadgets that I have always wanted.

In comes September and my parent's divorce finally goes through and they are officially separated. At the same time, my mom developed a difficulty paying for bills, utilities and for a lawyer (she works a minimum wage job, knows little english and doesn't quite have time to go to college at the moment) to get spousal and child support from my dad (he makes around $130k a year on his own as a truck driver and owns his own company). I get a job that pays me bare minimum of $10/h so it's enough for me to pay for gas, attend school and help my mom financially. At this point I have sold the laptop, dirtbike and whatever else I could sell and I stashed $2000 in cash. At this same time I have also started to surf local seller sites for a ""newer"" car and found a good running car that I am picking up on the 18th from San Jose. Now the problem being, my mother is really controlling of me and my decisions (which I dont mind). The car I am getting is a 1991 Mazda Miata with 86k original miles, paid registration and smog, and it also comes with a load of replacement parts. My mom would never approve of such a ""small"" and ""impractical"" car, but I really don't need much space, and the small engine provides good mpg. She never knew I sold all these things as they were at my girlfriend's parents house so telling her I spent $2000 on a car older than mine will be difficult for her to understand as she is stubborn and gullible to what other people say.

So, how do I tell her that I got a ""newer"" car without her flipping her shit? I feel that telling her the truth will make things really bad as we haven't been on the best of terms about things lately.

I am 26 years old now. I just started work as a second year doctor. My parents do not have much money but they have supported me throughout uni. They spent a lot on my medical school fees. I have a younger brother. He is studying a different course. My parents were paying for him too. He failed three times in total, and lied to my parents each time, tricking my parents into paying fees for the following year thinking he progressed but it was actually for his repeat year. 


Over the last 12 months, I have been paying for my brothers rent and living expenses just to ease the burden on my parents. 

Two months ago we found out that he did not pay his tuition fees that my parents sent him. He spend USD 20,000.00 meant for his tuition fees away. Rather than stopping everything altogether, my parents decided to give him a fourth chance. 

My parents are very conservative. They do not know the real reason he failed - he has been in a relationship and his partner keeps distracting him from his studies. I have been keeping their relationship a secret from my parents for the last two years. His partner is inconsiderate, rude and horrible. I live with my brother and his boyfriend is over all the time. He does not pay rent, bills, or cleans up. I work 60-70 hours a week, and his partner tells me off for being messy. He lives in my house rent free. When I challenge him he says he is speaking on behalf of my brother as apparently I do not listen. Whatever it is, I pay the rent for the house. He is a mere guest. he has no right to tell me off for being messy especially when I am paying for the whole property. 

My dad is old now and has several health problems. I want to help him retire early by paying off the USD20000 my brother stole. At the same time, my parents still expect me to pay his rent and living expenses. They expect both. If my parents knew about his partner, they would have stopped paying for his tuition fees altogether and he would have to move home. I spent the last year lying to my parents whenever they asked what my brother was up to. 

I am in a difficult situation because I am not paying rent for my brother's partner to live here rent free. 

The other day I told my brother I will not be paying his rent and living expenses anymore. He says it is my duty to pay it all because 'dad has spent so much money on me, the USD20,000.00 is not HIS TIME TO SPEND.' 

So, he has no remorse for what he has done and does not realize the severity of his actions. 

I am in a difficult situation and it angers me every time I think of it. 

I need your advice. 

Thanks. ",17Nov2017,2

A good friend of mine recently confided in me that he felt depressed and possibly suicidal. According to him, it stems from his parents, particularly his mother being pretty overbearing, really emphasising his studies, preventing him from going out to meet friends, checking his phone, to name a few. 

I really want to help him get out this slump, but I can't really think of much that I, a 17 year old, can do for him. I've tried listening to his problems, letting him pour his feeling out, going out with him(on the rare off chance, his dad lets him), having a good laugh, but I don't think it's working.

I’ve tried asking her to please stop one of her behaviors and she did not take it well.
So when she started having sex talk with her bf over the phone while sitting across from me.

I reported it to the boss.

I tried to ignore it but after the 3rd day I was like fuck this.

Okay good.
Then 2 weeks ago she gets fired for something else. But was recently rehired.

165,"Just a little backstory, I'm a senior in University and I live on the 4th floor of one of my University's dorms. Mostly because I can't afford to live off-campus, scholarships are paying most of the dorm expenses.

All my life I've had terrible luck where people in general will report me for completely made-up reasons just because they don't like me, even if they don't know me. For example, as a child I've been reported to school principals for doing things that never happened and had no evidence to back them up, yet still punished for it. I was even accused of stalking at one point as a child for confessing my feelings to someone I liked, where they tried to get the police involved.

Whenever I voice chat online, I do tend to be loud, so I try to keep it really quiet. One night, however, I got too loud and I heard a really loud banging sound from... my wall? my floor? I can't really tell. Reason being that I felt impact from both below me and on the wall right next to my bed.

So all is fair, right? I was too loud, one unknown neighbor bangs on the wall/floor, and I quiet down out of respect. Apparently not. Recently, I've been hearing way more of this, presumably from the same neighbor, despite me not even making noise.

Even within the last week, the same banging noise happened despite me literally laying down in bed with my lights off doing absolutely nothing. Also, I don't listen to music when I sleep generally, so there was no noise whatsoever. Is it possible that they're just hearing something else and assuming it's me? I'm not sure because I don't hear anything at night when this happens other than the loud banging on my floors.

Sometimes, I'll even hear a banging noise outside of my door in the common ""living room"" of the apartment (there are 4 bedrooms connected by a living room in each dorm room), which makes me suspect that it's the neighbors below me. So what does this change? Well, the ceilings are really high up here, so it'd take intentionally using something like a broom to bang on the ceilings. Though, I'm not 100% certain it's the downstairs neighbors.

Also, December 1st marks the first day for 24/7 quiet hours, since that's the start of exams week here. So I'm really worried that I'll be getting a complaint for absolutely no reason and be kicked out. What should I do? Should I bring this up to the RA at all? Should I leave the neighbors downstairs a note? Or something else?",17Nov2017,2

169,"I liked this guy back in high school though I never really talked to him then. I ended up reconnecting with him at our local community college and we hit it off great. We got along really well to the point where we would talk and lose track of time because we were so engaged in conversaiton. Due to conflict issues I didn't get to hang out with him as much as I thought I would. 

To keep interest going I agreed to have sex with him after we tiptoed around the topic for a few days. It never happened since our schedules kept conflicting with parents, school and work etc., and he basically gave up on the idea and moved on. I realized after I definitely wasn't ready and was glad nothing came from it. I would have put myself in a pretty shitty predicament considering I liked the attention more than I considered my own feelings. 

Time passes, and I also move on. He reached out twice on separate occasions out of the blue. He apologized for how he acted and how he left things and wondered if I'd still be interested in smashing. I agreed at first because the idea of casual sex sounded appealing as I had just gone through a breakup, but it was too soon afterwards and I backed out.

Despite all of that BS, we still keep tabs on each other. Not really sure what to make of it either but it feels like we always just miss each other, and I know it's not just me.

171," So I started dating this girl in one of my classes a couple of weeks ago. Things are going alright except she seems distant. She always hides her phone when she looks through her pics to show me something. I mean she actually tells me to look away, but it's no big deal. We just started seeing each other so I get it. Or so I thought. She's also flaky/unresponsive most of the time, and is generally somewhat closed off. 
Out of curiosity I checked her social media today and I found an old Facebook account. It turns out she has a kid! Things start clicking now. But what I want to ask is where do I go from here? I like this girl but I feel like I just intruded on a personal, intimate secret that she obviously didn't want me to know. I really wish that I could just forget it. Do I tell her I know? Why didn't she say something before? Most young people I see with kids seem to be upfront about it. Maybe its just an early dating thing not to spring something like that on a guy?

EDIT: This account was found through the internet. I would never actually go into someone else's phone. I put 'snooping' in quotes because 'snooping' is overstating things by definition, but still depicts how I feel

I worked for the school as a custodian and the person who was staying in the room was an international student that that school couldn't get ahold of and the room was left full of garbage and stuff.

I put some things (game system, keyboard, some games and cables) into a plastic bag and put it out in a garbage bin where i could pick it up later. My supervisor figured it out and I admitted to taking them. My boss was called, i returned the items, the Peace Officers banned me from any school property for one year and i was fired.

I checked and I don't have a non-conviction record, and there was no follow up to this. 

What keeps me awake at night (its 2:45am) is the fear of the student being contacted and pressing charges, the guilt of doing it in the first place and the shame that i lied to my family about how i lost my job.

After this, i have had very little sleep, regularly contemplate suicide (walking from my former work, i had to be careful so that i didn't throw myself infront of a moving car.). I'm terrified of telling my parents the truth and of the international student pressing charges and my parents finding out that way that their child did what this.

190,"So I've recently started dating (using the term loosely, we mostly just confirmed we shared feelings for each other and decided to see where it goes) a girl I've known for a little over a year now. Initially, she seemed like one of my dreams, we liked the same stuff and personalities aligned very closely.

However, recently I've been noticing more and more things about her that rub me the wrong way - albeit things that aren't necessarily objectively bad or make her a bad person, and some qualities that we both share too so it seems a bit hypocritical for me to be annoyed, but I personally don't find then appealing nonetheless - things like:

- casually and unironically using ""retarded"" and ""gay"" as synonyms for ""bad"", i.e. ""*thing I don't like - that's retarded"". Brought it up with her, response was it's just words that don't mean anything, but I still don't feel good when she or her friends use it the way they do.

- getting (imo) unreasonably angry during video game sessions when things get bad. Like really getting in a bad mood, banging the table yelling and affecting how she feels about doing other things soon after.

- not having or keeping a good sleeping schedule so it's infrequent when we get to hang out because she stayed up late doing something and is too tired to do things when I'm awake.

- feeling the need to be right a lot of the time, needing to prove herself somehow, always ""for the record"" and feels compelled that her opinion *must* be heard - especially when it's a strongly negative one. Also feel like she doesn't hold others opinions very high, even mine sometimes.

- one time she thought it was funny that ""semi-famous person X that I'm somewhat a fan of"" had cancer because it was ""of the butt"", and according to her wouldn't otherwise be funny. I've confronted her if it was ""celebrity Y she was a fan of"" if she'd still feel that way. Obviously not, but retorted that I was blowing it out of proportion.

- she has a bad habit of not letting go sometimes, like in aforementioned ""for the record"" point. I run a D&amp;D campaign and she is in constant conflict with another player because of how they play - which is not detrimental to the group, it's simply not the way she'd like them to play - and has made it a primary part of how they see them *as a person* now because of it.

- using her OCD as an excuse. According to her (I don't ever want to undermine people with disorders so I'm taking her word on it) she has OCD. Like Actual diagnosed by a doctor. I deal with it, but I feel like she uses it as an excuse a lot of the time. ""My obsessive compulsiveness makes me feel like I HAVE to speak up on X thing that I just passionately dislike"". And maybe it does, I don't know the first thing about mental disorders other than it's a spectrum. So maybe I'm not being understanding enough, but it feels like she uses it a bit too often rather than trying to find a solution to it. (Again, maybe there isn't any, I'm no expert)


I want her to try to be better, but I also know that it's not the best thing to want your partner to change if they're happy with who they are. Idk but I'm very conflicted about this since we've been kind of together for a very short time - about a month - but I worry if I should just wait and see where things go or drop it with her or what.

197,"So recently, I got my class rank in high school, which was 99 out of 642. Honestly speaking, from a college standpoint it isn't bad, but to the standpoint of my asian parents, they're pretty mad right now lol.

So after thinking in the shower about this whole ""GPA Game"" situation, I've come up with a philosophy on the reaction to new events that are thrown at you in life: the difference between a reminder and an opportunity.

Most importantly then, what is an opportunity? An opportunity is a pathway to your goal or what you consider success, and that opportunity requires reaction by action. For example, an opportunity to play for your favorite soccer team, or even try out for it. Because that gateway has opened up, you are allowed to act upon it and if you are hardworking and successful, you will reach your goal. It's that simple.

But then...what is a reminder? A reminder is something that can help you notice new opportunities that you otherwise were unable to see or unwilling to explore. The biggest difference between a reminder and an opportunity is that when a reminder is given to you, you can do a very minimal and ambiguous amount to act upon it, if possible at all. The prime example of this reminder is my rank, which I mentioned before. This is one of life's biggest reminders that I have to work hard and not slack, but what exactly can I do with this reminder right after receiving it? Is it possible for me to instantly switch my current lifestyle of mediocre studying mixed for some leisure time to grinding away all night and day? Is it possible that I will turn my head away from all pleasures just to get good grades? Of course not, if you say you can, you are either underestimating the intensity of that commitment or you're a god, literally. The thing that humans are most afraid of is change, that's why theres a saying that goes: if one changes to suddenly, they can die. 

Now with that said, I believe that since my rank is just a reminder, I should continue with my lifestyle of mediocre studying while completing all tasks on time with good quality, but also have some leisure time to play games and whatnot. But in my daily life, this reminder will help me see opportunities or motivate me to try where in previous times I may not have wanted to try.

So what do you guys think of my approach? Am I an idiot that just doesn't want to work harder or is my philosophy on this whole opportunity and remind thing really a good way to approach my situation with the rank?",17Nov2017,2

The second time we almost bumped into each other. He stopped and politely took one step back, smiled and gestured with his hand that he ""road was clear"". I found it amusing, smiled and said sorry and thank you. He smiled back and looked lovely.
I didn't do anything else (because I'm shy as F and I've never asked someone out), which I now regret. He was perfect. Handsome, polite and charming.
I'm now afraid that I'll never see him again. I'm also afraid that I'll see him again, and not have the courage to say hi or something like that.

201,"I'm 20. I was on citalopram before for about 4 or 5 years until about 5 months ago under the impression it would be temporary. Now that I've finally decided I've it's been going on for long enough I have decided to come off. I definitely think my moods are more varied now, I cry or get upset much more easily. I do get more frustrated now when something causes me anxiety whereas before I mostly got scared and tried to hide.

My situation isn't great, me and my dad do not get along. He gets very angry with me for my OCD rituals and I don't like his constant shouting, talking very aggressively, taking possession of my stuff, etc. . He doesn't hit me, but he has raised his fists. I can get very defensive myself, when someone does something I don't like I'll push them away and try to run.

I feel like my situation doesn't help my anxiety at all, and I don't really like taking medication so I feel like instead of taking medication I need to find a way to be in a stable environment where I can really think about whether I need meds or not. 

My parents are getting extremely pushy about it now, they are telling me they are going to kick me out if I don't take them (something that really makes me anxious) and then are constantly saying things like I ""belong in a mental hospital"" or that I'm like ""a crazy person"".

207,"My husband is the oldest of her 6 kids (none of whom were raised by her for more than a couple years at a time). All of her kids were born methadone dependent, the first 4 fathered by an abusive addict. Needless to say all of her kids have had a very hard life and developed anxiety and depression.
 My husband was raised by his great aunt, who is a wonderful woman (also still raising/ caring for her adult daughter with severe CP). We live with her now and help care for her daughter. We have 2 kids of our own and are generally happy with our lives.
  Since I was pregnant with my baby she's been making my husband so depressed. We tried to help her get clean, let her live with us while she waited for a spot in a sober house. She started getting drunk and starting fights with everyone so we asked her to go. 
Since then she has thrown every chance at help in the trash. She leaves every program within a day or 2, takes taxis here and to distant family members houses without money and guilts people into paying, she got aids from prostituting or sharing needles but doesn't take her meds. It's torturing my husband who has been actively working on his own mental health. We have helped all we can and she won't leave us alone, she doesn't listen to anyone or anything. In her mind she's done nothing wrong. She showed up again last night and we found her in our basement.

209,"**EDIT: Title should be ""stay for a single exam resit""**


I'll try to keep it concise. If I pass all my exams, I have January off because that's retake period. I've been studying a lot and working a lot to save up for a trip I've been planning since last year. One of my exams was a total curveball that the majority of the class failed and is complaining (formally) about. Because of this fail, I have a resit in the middle of january that throws a wrench into my plans. The reprocussion for failing the exam is failing that part of the course and I would have to retake that module next year, but I wouldn't require me to drop out or anything drastic like that. The only other time when I have an entire month off is in July, so another half year. 


I'm conflicted, the obvious choice would be to cancel my plans and take the resit in the middle of January. The trip was across the world so going there for only 2 weeks instead of 4 wouldn't make much sense cost wise so I'd likely end up just staying here for my break.

214,"My roommate and I get along pretty well, and there's never issues between us but this one thing she does is really bugging me, and i don't know if i'm justified in how i feel. 
I'm more of a shy and reserved person, as is my roommate, so neither of us made a ton of friends initially when we moved in about 3 months ago. At a party about a month into school, we met this kid J. My roommate was super drunk so she didn't really talk to J much that night although she met him, but me and J talked for almost 2 hours and then we exchanged numbers/snapchats. He texted me shortly after asking if I wanted to hang out. I agreed, but felt badly that my roommate would be stuck home alone so I asked if she could come and he said yes. And every time he asked me to hangout I'd ask if she could come and he would say yes. (I think I should point out that J and I are strictly friends, he knows I have a bf so she's not cock blocking lol). Eventually, my roommate started to make good friends with these girls in our building, so she would frequently go to their room and hang out with them, and would never invite me. That didn't bother me at first. But then J would invite me to hangout and I wouldn't invite my roommate because she was with other people and now she has friends so I don't feel as bad leaving her behind. But then she started inviting herself which kind of irritated me. And she tells everyone how great her and J are and how he always asks to hangout even though she's kind of the tag a long whenever we do something. It annoys me bc she feels entitled to be invited when J and I do something, but never bothers to invite me to hang out with her friends. Occasionally I am invited to hang out with them, but that's only if either they're coming into our dorm room and I'm there by default, or they want to go somewhere bc I'm the only one w a car, which irritates me the most. 
I don't want my roommate tagging along every single time with me and J and our group of friends anymore now that she has her own, but i don't know how to go about telling her this. Is it wrong for me to tell her that anyways?

how do i ask roommate to stop inviting herself to hangout with me and my friends since she has her own group now?",17Nov2017,2

Our parents married when they were 18 (30 years ago) because it was so common back then (so so much common back then in the commie era of central europe.. that might also be why in my country **every second** marriage always ends in divorce). They have never been the couple marriage is supposed to create.. 

My mother is always so supportive and kind because having family life is the only thing she knows since she was just a kid and my father, fleeing away from his selfish and self-obsessed family (once even being thrown away on street by them) has sadly inherited their bad character (maybe because that was too all he ever experienced before marriage) and acts since accordingly. 

I know every family has its problems and that every parents argue sometimes but this is very different. In our family my mum is the one to go to sleep on the couch but that's just because my father just don't give a single fucking fuck.

He calls her the worst names imaginable when they argue. Mainly because of money - he wouldn't (and didn't) even pay for gas when we went to visit our granddad in hospital after a quite serious heart operation. Not that it would matter that much, buying stuff to children, but heck, just to illustrate, he never even bought me stupid ice cream or something. We never went on normal family holidays.. And as opposed to my mum he has a very decent paying job. He doesn't cook, doesn't help out at home, doesn't even drive my mother to go shopping for food she has to do all that alone now. Not even mentioning he admittedly cheated on her couple times in the past.. I don't know what else to say or in which order it's just too much to even think about.

If they divorced now they'd split all his debt and my mother could not even sustain a household for herself (rent, food etc.) with her paycheck.

Why am I writing this all now.. Today, my mother told me she feels like cancer is consuming her from the inside and that she will die soon that she can feel it.

225,"Throwaway as I don't want this to come full circle.

I was asked a little while back to change careers paths and come onboard at my in-laws company.  The plan was for me to help raise sales primarily and help with operations.  Things were going well for a while, but as time has dragged on, things have slowly decayed and become much more difficult.  My in-laws are also facing major setbacks in their company at the moment (nothing having to do with me), and it's putting a ton of stress on everything.  My role has been so undefined, I have been handling everything from basic house keeping stuff to full on operational details.  I feel as though the company has no set leadership and often times I'm here with no guidance.  

I was approached a couple of months back by an old manager about a new corporate position that's been opened up at his company.  I spoke multiple times with him and interviewed with 3-4 different people, and I was offered a job.  My new career job would offer me a significant increase in pay and benefits.  The offer for this job is set to hit my inbox any day now and I will start my role at the beginning of 2018.

Now all of this is complicated even more, by the fact that my father-in-law gifted me 30K under the table and no one knows anything about this.  The 30K was given to me as a gift for ""other"" things, but I know that this money was likely intended to grease me up a bit.

My questions are:

How should I approach breaking the news that I'm leaving the company?

and

What should I do about the 30K gifted to me?  Acknowledge it and offer to return it over time?  Not bring it up?  Acknowledge it and ask his feeling?

228,"Sorry, this will be long but I'll try to keep it short.

My husband has this group of friends who he went to highschool with. There's maybe about 6 of them or so. More than half of them have gf/spouse/fiancee. Since we have been together for about 9 years, we have all including the spouses have become friends too I'd say.

There's this one friend whose spouse doesn't like me. She would say horrible things about me when she hadn't even met me. She know of me because I went to school with her sister. My husband and I would ignore it, because I hadn't met her and it would a game of telephone, and since I was not seeing her it mattered less. Her spouse moved away for school and my husband never saw him either, so things quieted down on her end with her saying stuff.

Then 3 years ago, her husband had moved back. Our other friends invited them over to their house, and this is where I would meet her for the first time! I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed everything is starting fresh, and since things were 6 years prior to that, I shouldn't keep it against her.

Well, it started again. She started saying stuff about me. We continued to ignore it because it was never to our face. Then one day she took away her benefit of the doubt by saying EVERYTHING she's ever said about me to my husband to his face.

Things were weird, my husband tried to talk to his friend, who btw was not only his friend from grade 9 but also his college roommate. He backed her up, and basically wanted to ignore it and brush it off. Sounds like she does it to him (like loses her shit and just says things) so that's how he deals with it.

This started effecting me more because well the truth is women don't like me. They never have, and in his group of friends the spouses do like her more. And even tho they didn't say it, their actions started making me feel alienated. Not that the spouses not like me they just like her I believe. Then, when one of them was getting married they seated me with people I did not even know to keep us separated. My husband was the best man and he wasn't happy with them doing that. They apologized and fixed the seating.

Then after the wedding they felt since it's effecting everyone to actually ask us what's going on. We told them what happened. They agreed that it's not ok. And talking to her husband didn't work either which was their advice. No one knew how to deal with it but at least they knew the story from our side. But apparently, all the spouses knew the story, she told them the next day after freaking out at my husband and saying stuff about me to him. She called the other girls up and told them that we did that to her. But our friends knew it didn't sound right.

Well here we are now. We don't want to see them. But our friends are having this party, and they invited them. We said we're not coming and told them it's because of them. And they said ok, that's too bad you can't come. They've left it at that.

Our friends don't seem to want to choose right from wrong or choose a side at all. But it's affecting us, and they just don't seem to give a shit about how we feel. I'm mostly also upset that my husband is not seeing his friends because of her. How should we deal with this? We can't force a choice on them, but it seems like an easy choice to me.

Side note: My husband is the closest to this girl's spouse, and actually everyone, and I'm the only girl that gets along with all the guys.

Another Side Note: My husband was in this situation with another couple in the group, and he made the choice to be friends with the ones not being dicks.

BACKGROUND:
I took this course simply because I really had no idea what to take for college. It is a 5 yr course, in a good (or even considered prestigious) university known for having a high passing rate in the board for this course.

I simply thought when I was accepted ""If i fail, then this is not meant for me"". Then fast forward to almost 4yrs +, here I am! about to graduate! It was not easy, and I worked hard to pass, I don't stand out or anything like that but I have no plans to (although i think its good..). During these 4yrs, there are many times I thought to myself ""Why am I still doing this?"" but I didn't have a strong `want` to quit or shift. 

PROBLEM:
This is my last sem in architecture and my thesis is not doing good because of the topic chosen was too small of a scope for a partner job. My professors expressed their concern on this last sem and my partner and I thought we could pull it off somehow (we did pass last sem). We did came up with bigger scope topics but on the day it was submitted, the lady receiving it told us to remove it cause it was unfit for the course or someone have came up with something similar the sem before and the thought of discussing it with the teachers first rather than her deciding this came too late, so we ended up with this . its too late now to change topic or we could be held back a semester or two... all research have to be finished last semester, this sem would be application, and this time, I don't think we can pull it off... all of our classmates have not so complicated scopes but large application. ours is focused on green/sustainable design (is it a complicated scope?.. i think the teachers don't find it so) but on a small application (but not houses). we were called on the first few for the scheduled consultation, first also bec. this list are on the problematic side... I am so unsure of all this, the consultation have not yet happened though. I don't want to tell this to my partner yet because I might spread my negativity, but I have informed him that I'm having negative thoughts and need time to think. Am I afraid of failure? I don't think I am.. I am not new to that experience. its just.. this is the final step.",17Nov2017,2

Then, he told me it's casual day today (b/c he wasn't wearing his suit). and we smiled. and then he said he worked on m,w, f. and I asked if he was a student. and he told me he's a freshman. I'm a senior. fml. but I'd still like to be friends with him,because he seems really friendly. so after thanksgiving break, I'm gonna talk to him more, introduce myself and hopefully, we'll get to hang out :)

Next year in Jan, I will be doing an internship, and I'm unsure if I'll have time to write during that time.

239,"Hey Reddit,

I need a bit of help or direction of what to do with myself. Let me give you a bit of backstory of myself to explain. I'm a 22 year old who's currently in my third year of college. I have an incredibly nice job (both the pay and the work itself) and a great career path ahead of me. I absolutely love the work I do and the problems I help solve there.

My problem is (like many others) is my academics. My issue isn't with my major, as I enjoy what I'm studying (Computer Science) and I'm actually able to apply what I learn into my current job. The problem is studying/focusing in class. This is a problem I've had since as far as I can remember. All up to and through high school it wasn't really too much of an issue, as I could scrap by and pass my courses without really having to pay too much attention or really much studying at all. But with college it's a lot more difficult (if not impossible at times) to have that kind of habit and still pass the course.

I've always been a last-minuter when it comes to school as well. If something was due, it could wait until the last moment to do as other things were more ""important"". But the thing is, those other things weren't exactly pressing issues like curing cancer or saving the world. They were distractions (things like video games, videos, personal projects, etc) that I, for some reason, thought held more importance than my academic future. It's a frustrating (and honestly horrifying) feeling of sitting there actively wasting time while you know deep inside that you NEED to study or finish an assignment.

Sometimes my mind just actively ignores the deadlines of assignments and exams. I'll tell myself that I need to study, that I should do my homework way before the night it's due. It's like arguing to an empty room with no one there to listen. I guess put plainly: I know that ignoring my studying is wrong and harmful, but I actively do it anyway regardless of the consequences. It's like my brain just accepts that procrastinating is fine, that it's a tomorrow problem not a today problem. But when the next day comes and I'm sitting down blankly in front of exam, I wonder to myself: Am I lazy? Am I just dumb? Is there something wrong with me? Why is it that, knowing I NEED to study, I can't bring myself to do so?

I should mention that I have tried different methods of helping me focus. I've tried shutting myself off from electronic distractions, which is harder done than said but still doable, and that works a bit. But slowly but surely something else pops up in my head that is more important to do (cleaning up my room, getting groceries, etc) and I suddenly I'm okay with doing my studying ""later"". I mean after all, why study for something that isn't important until a few days from now when I could be doing something more ""important"" right now like working on another new time wasting project of mine? Or maybe I just should give myself a few minutes of a break, maybe catch up on a video or play a quick game? After all, it'd only be a few minutes and I'll probably just forget what I'm studying anyway. But those few minutes into hours, which in turn become days. Then suddenly deadline is there and I'm no more prepared then how I was before I started. There's like this mental wall somewhere in my head that just suddenly appears the moment I think about even doing anything relating to homework or studying. It readily blocks off any attempt to circumvent it and rebuffs my attempts to push through it, leaving me standing before it feeling ashamed of my laziness.

The reason I'm writing this post to begin with is because I've been getting worse, if you can believe that is even possible. Before, at the very least, I tried to study or do my academic work. Slowly however, I felt the desire to even do that slip away. I mean, why try to study when you know it'll just end up with you being distracted anyway? Why even focus in class? Is there even a point to showing up anymore? You can't even bring yourself to sit down for an hour to study something that should be simple. Thoughts like those go through my head on repeat and I just give myself up to it. I lose myself in my distractions, whatever they may be at the movement, and just forget about my tomorrow problems until they become today's problem.

I've mentioned my work beforehand and that I love it there. I brought it up because it brings in stark contrast to my academic life, which I don't myself understand why. Let me explain: I've been working at this job for over two years now. I work for a medium sized company and I do various programming work usually in the form of automating different tasks such as reporting, maintenance and analytics. My boss is always giving me new work projects to complete or problems to solve and I've never (in my two years of working there) have had an issue focusing and completing work in a timely manner. In fact it's a pride of mine to finish my work projects quickly and throughly. It's so bizarre to me that I've never had an issue at work while I have my current problem at school. It's not like they really are any different from each other right? I mean the things I'm learning and doing for my major is exactly the things I'm doing at work currently. So why is it that I can focus on work so easily but can't seem to bring myself to do so for school?

As a last side note, I talked about my own personal projects briefly. I think it's important for me to mention this, but one of main ways I always seem to deviate from focusing on studying is shifting my attention to a new or old hobby. I've picked up the nickname the 'hobbyist of hobbies' from friends and family due my habit of picking up new hobbies almost on a monthly (if not more frequently) basis. I lose interest in a lot these projects, usually after I pick up a new hobby, but not always. I bring this up because I find that, often when I know I should be doing academic work and don't have anything else to do, I'll start picking up a new or old thing to do instead. For some reason it's like my brain would rather invest time and money into something completely random just to avoid studying. I don't know if this is really relevant, but it's just something I've slowly noticed is a habit of mine when I procrastinate.

I should also mention why I'm posting all this here rather then telling someone I personally know like my parents or friends. The reason being is because ,truthfully, I feel embarrassed and ashamed. Everyone assumes that I'm doing perfectly fine in school, due mostly to the fact I don't even really talk about my academic life or problems at all. I feel like bringing it up at this point with anyone would make me look just as incompetent as I already feel. Honestly writing that makes me realize how silly that sounds, but it doesn't change that I still feel that way.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I just needed to write this all down. This is something I've kept to myself for too long and it's honestly relieving to just be able to put my thoughts and feelings into words. If you've read through this mess, thank you. I don't really know what I expect from posting this, but I needed to do it to get it off my chest after so long of keeping this to myself. Thanks again for taking the time to read this.",17Nov2017,2
240,"For the past few days I've been saying really insensitive things to my wife without really thinking them through which makes her understandably upset.

To give some context, I love my wife very much, she's more than I could've ever imagined as a partner in life but starting a couple of days ago I've been unusually rude.

The other day she was really excited and talking about how much she loves animals and feels like she knows an unusual amount information about caring for exotic pets(she does, it's something she's passionate about). She continued to explain that she thinks she could easily get a job at a pet store because she knows so much. I brushed her excitement off and told her that she could obviously get a job at a place like that because she would be competing with stupid 16 year olds. I told her that that doesn't really mean shit. She was obviously upset and I immediately understood and regretted what I said but regret doesn't take worlds back.

We got over this and moved on.

The next day we're talking and she says in what I thought was a sarcastic tone, ""That's so meta dude"". I'm not familiar with the term meta so she explained it to me. I followed up by saying, ""anybody who actually says that is a fucking idiot"". This was upsetting to her because apparently she speaks this way when she works with children. Again, we seemed to get over this. I apologized and told her that I didn't get it but again apologizing doesn't really change anything. The next day (which is today) we're talking about what we're going to do once we're both out of school with regards to saving for a house. Now my wife likes to spend money on things that she likes which is fine because she should be able to spend her own money on things that she wants. I mention that We'll have to cut back on spending and really focus on saving, especially if our income increases. She knows this, and says that she wants to work on that but that it's just the way she and her family are so it'll be a challenge. I respond to this by telling her that spending money because you have it is a poor person mentality.
To give a little context, her parents have been letting us live in their home for the past few months while we study. I can't believe I would tell my wife that she and her parents have a poor person mentality especially after everything they've done for us.
She again was understandably upset. I just dropped her off at school and I don't know what to say to her tonight. I don't know how to come back from this and I don't really feel like I deserve her forgiveness at this point.

I want to be the man she deserves but I'm starting to think that maybe I'm not.

241,"He's now paying himself twice as much as he's paying the majority of his employees and it's really bothering me.  I don't feel like he deserves that much money.  Just because the company is doing well doesn't mean he's the single reason for it.  I approached him about it and he acknowledged it and just said if need be he can lower his pay at any time, which he can not do for his employees. 

We have our ups and downs and I get that he can't just give everyone raises when things are going well because next year could be a bad year and then we can't afford everyones pay.  He believes this rule doesn't apply to him and if things are going we'll he's just gonna give himself a raise because he can.

I get that he started the business so he can do what he wants, but I feel like he's being quite selfish and not using the money to help better the company or to save it for the down months.  I can't help but look at my fellow employees and think to myself you are getting screwed over, but I don't feel like I can say anything without major consequences.

I'm debating on just looking for a new job so I don't have to think about it all the time.  Then I wonder...is it going to be any different at my new job?  Am I wrong about this?

249,"Hi Reddit, I am looking for advice on my dysfunctional family. To be clear, I am pretty sure I should just cut all ties with them after today’s conversation. I am 22 years old so there is obviously a lot of context that precedes this conversation that you would benefit from having. However, for the sake of brevity, we can keep things more general than that. The short of it is, our family is very toxic and it frustrates me to no end. I tried breaking ties a few years ago and was perfectly fine doing that but then my mom started dying from kidney failure. I remained distant at first but after a few drunken, self-loathing cry session, I put myself back in the picture. I thought “I will regret not trying to fix things, if she dies.” 

&amp;nbsp;

It didn’t take long after her getting a kidney and living through the situation for things to unravel again. Nothing was actually fixed from the previous fallout we had so it was of course doomed to fail. Read the conversation below that I had with them today and tell me that I shouldn’t end our relationship forever. If you think there is some reason not to, I am very curious what your advice for the situation is. I am especially curious of what it has been like for someone that has cut ties with their parents at my age and if it has been worth it, or regretful. Thanks, Reddit.

Me:
So I'm struggling here to create a clear and concise message to you two. It's funny because I have a million words that I need to say, yet I have zero that I want to say. That's the frustrating paradox that I've dealt with for years now. Ultimately there's no point in even trying to talk to either of you because I have tried and it got nowhere. Nothing has actually changed from a few years ago when shit blew up and I sent you guys my long emotional ramblings. There was no conversation or counsel had - just like the other 22 years of my life. We aren't a family that talks. We are one that ignores  reality and pretends like nothing happened. And with enough passing of time, everything is magically fine again. The fact of the matter is I can't and won't do that anymore. There is no fixing our relationship without professional counseling and I have absolutely no interest in doing that. It is physically unhealthy for me to be around you guys and to enable our toxic relationship. I am going back to excommunicating myself from our family. However, unlike last time, I am not breaking my vow of silence if one of you starts dying again. I have no more drunken tears to give to either of you. I am done feeling sorry for myself and our broken relationship. We can stop pretending like family ever mattered.

DeadpanHeart i have done nothing to you to be mad at me i understand you about dad i have endured his abuse as well i tried to be a great mom to u two even your sister thinks im to blame for her life as well you two make me feel unloved and unwanted these last 5 years if this is what you two want i will  stop reaching out just know you just broke my heart and so did she the other day your dad wanted to talk to you about that night but you dnt respond to us. So i really do hope you and (girlfriend) have a wonderful life I love you and always will

Well we can talk about this I want u in our life. U told me to fo I sure don't want to leave it like that. And u sure don't need to shit on ur mother we both love u and care about u so u don't need to just throw us away

&amp;nbsp;

Me:
OK for humor's sake, I'll dissect just the very first part of that to prove that you are a poor communicator and that you deny your shortcomings as a parent. You pretend like you want to talk to fix things but I don't think either of you are actually capable of that. To write out your thoughts in a meaningful and thought provoking manner is beyond you both. I won't even address what dad said for now because it's just more of the same lazy bullshit. I'm not ""shitting on mom"" by calling her and you out on your bullshit. No one is immune to criticism, no matter what their family title is. “DeadpanHeart i have done nothing to you to be mad at me”. You're right, in the 22 years of my life, you have been the perfect mother. There is absolutely nothing that I could resent you for. There has been no accumulation of questionable parenting decisions. We have always discussed every issue as it arises and settled it. You were not an alcoholic, cold, distant, verbally abusive mother. You did not enable your own shortcomings by staying with an equally cold, distant, verbally abusive husband. You do not make everything about you and deny you ever did anything wrong. You do not deflect real conversations and emotions by, for example, calling your brother a pussy for having a heart. You do not punch your son and call him a pussy out of frustration when you do not understand why he is the way he is. You do not make being drunk a convenient excuse for your inappropriate behavior. Fucking own up to your shit already. And also accept that fact that by simply admitting your faults and apologizing may not be enough to undo 22 years of abuse. Certainly not immediately and not without proper discussion.

Dad:
What abuse jesus fucking christ. Maybe I should have beat u u tell me to fuck off cause I told u (family friend) didn't want to hear that shit and u haven't tried to talk to me til now. U make all this about mom and me when uve been the one abusing us I'm done. Take care sorry we suck so bad. U kids suck too not sure professor of psychology what I can do I'm not afraid to talk r u.

22 years of abuse huh.

The ""talk all the time and do everything together"" type of friend. Of course things weren't perfect. After a while he started becoming more and more dishonest with me. Of course it hurt but I never thought it was specifically malicious. I used to lie to people close to me a lot, too, so I figured he deserved my forgiveness. He's genuinely a good person, I still think that.

The current problem stems back since about May if I'm thinking about it. He suddenly pulled away and stopped talking to me. He's always been kind of a flake, but not usually when it really mattered. My birthday came along and he promised to come visit me for a few days (he lives about a 45 minute drive away. Hard for a day trip but fine for weekends or whatever.). I took time off of work and used all the vacation time I had saved up in the few years of me working at this job. I just had an extremely close friend of mine force his way out of my life and I was already feeling really hurt by that. Then the day before Bryce was supposed to come down he told me he wasn't going to. He gave me some made up reason that I instantly saw through. That hurt a lot. And that was just the start.

For a while now I haven't been able to fully trust him, but I always try to give him the benefit of the doubt until I find out otherwise. Over the past few months he's altogether stopped talking to me, including blocking me from Facebook. I saw a post on a forum he made about being depressed and how things were constantly changing for him so I contacted his family to see if he was okay. That's when I was informed that he was happily okay. His girlfriend just moved in with him and he spends all his time playing games. 

He must have caught wind of that because he messaged me on a game client (never either of our first choice of contact) and said things had been hectic and he's working a lot and just forgot to call. Even asked what I was doing for thanksgiving. Making it seem like none of it was a big deal. But his words never match his actions. I know he knows I'm hurt. He knows that what's left of our friendship is crumbling fast. He just doesn't seem to care; which hurts the most. It seems like I'm always his last priority. I just want him to make any effort to show me that I matter to him. Should I keep trying, or follow everyone's advice and consider him dead to me? It's all I think about lately.

I do homework at school at every opportunity because I know it won't get done at home. I end up not getting great grades because I find it so hard to get homework done. 

When I have to do homework I end up staying up late or all night researching subjects of interest I don't need to know about, such as herbalism, pharmacology, botany, organic chemistry, psychology, anything it seems. I have a passion for linguistics but I also have social anxiety so I hope I won't have to do too much talking in my work, or will be able to get over it. I hardly like linguistics anymore because I'm either stressed out or apathetic, or a mix of the two, and I don't really like talking. It's very stressful to me. I'm more interested in the mechanics of language. 

I go through my day talking to as little people as possible because I really don't gain anything from the experience.

My father grew up in a time where all you had to do was be in be in the right place at the right time to land a decent career, so he thought it's still that easy, I guess.

My mother doesn't really like people, I think she fears them, so i never saw how adults socialized or made friends. We never had people over for dinner or anything like that.

My older sister died unexpectedly  before 20 so both of my parents retreated from the family. Basically all they did was made sure we had food to eat and the house was heated. Emotionally I was on my own. I was frustrated and alone and struggling for my whole life.

Just before my teenage years began my family decided to move us to a foreign country for several years which again threw off any sense of stability I had developed on my own as a child. And in this in foreign country they again offered no emotional support, so I felt lost and confused until I found some friends. We then moved back to the original country, i had to part with those friends and I never regained a sense of stability after that. This was 15 years ago.

They offered no advice dealing with these turbulent life experiences. They offered nothing in terms of preparing for college or for a career after high school. They didn't even make me go to school. They didn't talk to me about depression or my eating disorder that almost killed me. They never talked with me when i started drinking and blacking out and driving intoxicated. They never talked to me when I dropped out of college. They never talked to me when I went through an abusive relationship and a devastating breakup.

Anyway, so my question is, would it be wrong to cut ties with them now as an adult? Every time I see them i get incredibly enraged inside and it upsets me for days. My mother means well, it was not intentional but she didnt know how to be a mother and didnt enjoy parenting. But I feel like i can't forgive her for all this and I can't become emotionally healthy with them in my life still. It would hurt my mother incredibly, she is old and will probably only be alive for another 15 years and I don't want the rest of her life to be full of guilt because she failed me. But she did. 

What should I do? Protect her from pain and guilt or cut ties and try to repair my life.",17Nov2017,7
266,"I dislocated and fractured my elbow 13 days ago. Besides someone fracturing my nose, somehow this is the first broken bone/major injury I’ve had. 

Recovery so far has been a challenge- I’m in a splint/sling bent in a 90 degree angle (pretty uncomfortable), still in a substantial amount of pain and still can’t move my fingers. I took last week off work and school due to the fact that I was in severe pain if I was not laying down. I’m an introvert &amp; love my own space, so I truly appreciate time to myself, but after 3 days of laying in bed for 20 hours/day, I realized how stir crazy and underwhelmed I was becoming. I tried to get back in the swing of things this past Monday, but quickly realized my limits. Even for simple tasks, pain and exhaustion seem to be constant factors now and living one handed is a bigger challenge that it seems. I don’t want to jeopardize my recovery so I have limited myself to just going to campus and work, when necessary. 

On a good day, I have a lot going on and try to stay active, basically out of necessity. I’m usually going a thousand miles a minute, whether in my mind or my activities. I always stay present and engaged. As I’m not fully functioning, this really isn’t an option and that fact is causing me a lot of issues. I really don’t mind the pain from this injury, but can not seem to handle this slow paced lifestyle I find myself in.

I’ve tried to occupy my time and mind with photoshop, Netflix, exploring the depths of Reddit and other stationery things but I’ve officially met my quota on sedentary activities. 

I feel like I’m officially going crazy. I’ve tried to stay really positive up to this point, but it’s catching up to me. I’ve learned my recovery is going to be a lot longer and  worse than I initially expected and that has triggered some serious dread. The idea of not having full function of my arm a year from now is contributing to my discontent, even though I know it’s irrational to concern myself with something so far down the line. I already feel like I am crawling through my life and if I try to ramp it up, there are physical repercussions.

I’d seriously appreciate any advice/input y’all have to share. 

- If you have had a similar injury, what was your incident/recovery like? Is there anything I can do to promote a full/quick recovery? Any tips are helpful. 
- What can I do to feel less useless at this point? Without over exerting myself physically. 
- Any suggestions on time consuming activities? Preferably something active, something that doesn’t just turn my brain to mush. 

TL;DR: broken arm, going stir crazy, need hope ",17Nov2017,4
267,"A few months  ago I learned a very close friend, of about 12 years,  was diagnosed with cancer.  Obviously this was upsetting but the doctors were optimistic and I thought he’d go through treatments and be ok. I spoke to him about two weeks ago and he didn’t have too many updates on the situation, and was still in hospital. It’s been difficult to communicate with him, as he is so medicated his texts don’t make much sense. Yesterday I logged on to Facebook and was shocked to see a post from his mother letting everyone know he is now terminally ill and will be transferred to hospice. I’m crushed and devastated. He lives in another state, and while I am hopeful I will get a chance to visit, everything is so unknown right now. So back to the point of my question.... I know I want to get a tattoo for him. His initials on my wrist. My regular artist/friend  has moved to the other side of the country but is home for the holidays and has offered to do it. My question is, is it morbid or weird for me to get the tattoo possibly before he is even gone? I don’t want to seem brash. Thoughts and opinions are greatly appreciated. ",17Nov2017,7
268,"Hey, guys! I'm really struggling and I really need your help. This is going to be long, but please bear with me.

OK, story time!

Half a year ago I(20M) met a girl(20). We started talking about general stuff at first. Then we started sharing things and found out we have a lot in common(although as it turned out it's mostly superficial things and we fundamentally different). Later I told her things I never shared with anyone else ever and she is currently the only person in the world who has had a peek in my mind and knows anything of significance about me. She quickly became the most important person I'v ever met. Of course, I love my family but that's different.

Naturally, I started falling for her. At first I really tried to keep my feelings in check because I've ruined friendships because of it before. But I couldn't keep that up for long. I told her how I feel about her some weeks later, but not before I did something really stupid that really strained our connection.

Regardless, she put me down gently. Said she still has a thing for her ex. I respect that decision and decided to take it as a man. The first day wasn't that bad and I thought we can remain friends. But the following days reality hit me like a freight train and I had a huge mental breakdown. I couldn't get out of my bed for weeks. It came as a complete shock to my family because I've always seemed aloof and I do actually have big trouble expressing my emotions. Anyway, I cut ALL contact with her. I avoided her social networks and talking to her, although she never tried to talk to me after that, understandably. With my third semester just around the corner, I had to put myself back together and thought that going back to university will get my mind off stuff and allow me to meet other girls. I tried exercising, watching movies, anything to get keep my mind busy. I did all the stuff people advise you to do to get over rejection. But that was always temporary. She always found her way back into my mind.

Things didn't get much better. I rarely went to my lectures. I just missed her so much and couldn't stop thinking about her. She was there when I got up in the morning and when I went to bed at night. I was a complete mess. But I persevered. No contact!

That brings us to last week. We met because we share friends. I knew she would be there and I knew going out would be a mistake, but I really needed to get out after doing a bunch of assignments. It was awkward at first but then I loosened up and it was... fun, I guess. I maintained a cold attitude during that time. Like, nothing is happening.

We parted ways after that and... I broke down again after I got home. Listen, I understand it's pathetic for a man to have a mental breakdown. But I've been keeping different feelings bottled up for years on end.

Today, I'm literally a ruin. I cry for her before going to bed. I have this lump in my throat and my stomach. It's also like there is a huge empty void inside me. My entire body hurts. It's been 3 months and NOTHING has changed. I never imagined it's possible for a human being to feel so intensely. I purposefully avoid calling it love. But I keep the no contact thing.

Now I'm not going to be killing myself but I can't keep going on like this. This is affecting my entire life. Nothing feels fulfilling anymore, nothing brings me joy, nothing gets my mind off of her. I no longer live. I just exist but barely.

We are supposed to get together for New Year's Eve and the only way I see that ending is in a disaster of legendary proportions. In addition to that, I have exams coming soon after that and I will 100% fail everything in my current condition, which I don't see getting better in 2 months.

Please, help me. I have no one else to talk about this, please. I don't know what to do. I probably sound a pathetic and I'm, but I'm completely lost.",17Nov2017,3
270,"My father was not good in any way, shape or form. He has never had a job in his entire life and has just mooched off my mother. He would often get drunk and say some pretty evil things. I won't repeat them, but I guarantee you that their level of wickedness would shock you quite a bit (they included statements about wanting to physically hurt my cousins, who were only 8 and 10 and had done absolutely nothing to him). I don't recall him ever hitting my mother, but he did slap my brother (for no reason) when he was like 6 years old. I do have some fond memories with him, such as watching television and playing video games.

In December of 2013 (when I was 14), he had one of his outbursts while my mother's friend was at the house. He threatened to attack my (then) 23 year old half- brother (who isn't related to him) even though my half-brother wasn't there.  My mother's friend then called the police and my grandparents came to take me to their house. My father apparently got pepper sprayed by the cops and then was not allowed back into the house by my mother. I then continued to live with my grandparents, and I have lived with them ever since. I haven't seen my father ever since then, but I still see my mother every few weeks. My mother and father still live together in some kind of shitty apartment or something. I have no intentions of ever seeing my father again and I have basically decided that he will never be a part of my life again. He has attempted to call me, but I have refused each time and he hasn't tried to call me since early 2015. When people have asked me about my father, I have said things along the lines of ""I hope he dies"". I no longer say things like this because it makes me sound like a lunatic and it's just not a good thing to say.

This is what confuses me: I hate him with a burning passion and I don't think anything could persuade me to see him again, but I have begun to question myself why I hate him so much. I definitely understand why I hate him, but I have talked about him as if he's Adolf Hitler. He's definitely a very bad guy and I think me not wanting to see him again is justified, but am I a piece of shit for wishing death upon him? I can't believe I'm feeling even a slight amount of guilt about this, but I must admit that I am. My older half-brother (who is a therapist at a school) agrees with me and says that he also hopes that my father died. This has added to my own view that my father is EXTREMELY evil, because I feel like my brother is pretty qualified to judge a father's level of evilness. He speaks to kids with evil fathers every day. However, I am still a bit confused as to whether I have overreacted about this and I have begun to question myself about how evil my father actually is. 

What do you all think? Do you think I'm a piece of shit for saying those things and acting the way that I have?",17Nov2017,1

I feel so embarrassed and humiliated. I found out that someone told him I liked him and he said "" I dont date weird people"" and he also claims I threatened him I tried apologizing multiple times for making him uncomfortable.

272,"To clarify this question a little bit further, i am a 23 year old aspie who in the past few years has had some trouble with his mental state.

shortly told,this was because:
I was(stil am) living with my abusive parents,
started smoking sigarets shortly after becoming 18 because i was not able to handle the stress, 
got depressed,
failed a couple of educations because of that,
started working for a while,
started smoking a decent amount of wheed,
lived a somewhat irregular life,
little bit unhealthy eating paterns, and unhealthy foods,
and a load of cafeïne from coffee and energy drinks.

Nothing that much out of the ordinary, but eventually i started having anxiety attacks, and was starting to fear for my life most of the day. Because i was so scared, i radically changed my life, started sleeping 8 hours a day, eating healthy and regular, quit energy drink,smoking, blowing, drinking and went back to school.
this helped a little bit with the mental state, but soon after my mom died suddenly which didn't make things much better.

anyway a few years have passed, and after a lot of therapy and other help made things somewhat stable, but i keep strugling with this question:

is it really worth giving those things up, to live (in my opinion) a somewhat boring life, to have more certainty of living longer, and in good health. Seeing the sun come up for a lot more years then i would most likely see if i didn't do so.

edit: i also mean worth it in more then just the medical sense, when hanging with friends, and everybody is drinking a bear, or smoking, or getting fastfood its hard to just sit there, decline, and not do anything.
its really feels like missing out on an experience",17Nov2017,2
273,"I’m 19 F and my boyfriend is 31 M, we’ve been dating for a year. I moved in with him recently because my parents were abusive and toxic and he was gracious enough to let me move in with him and help me get back on my feet. Like apply for school, get a job, a car etc.
He had always told me that he wanted me to come live with him. He is very sweet, smart, giving, and caring.

I’m 19 and he is my first boyfriend, his age has never been an issue for me and I actually liked it because his maturity level (at first) was very attractive and I appreciated that he wasn’t a guy in his mid 20’s who was into drinking, partying, and spending money carelessly. we have a lot in common and love listening to music together and watching movies and shows. We also are both reserved people and like to keep to ourselves so we compliment each other very well. Things used to be pretty great between us. 

He was very romantic and loving and touchy. Now he just does his thing and hopes I do the same.

Lately he’s been a different man. He has a video game addiction and he chooses video games over me. He his glued to his xbox and plays it every second that he’s not at work. I enjoy video games too so I would watch him play, cheer him on, help him if he’s stuck or even take turns. I realized that this was probably a bad idea because it made him feel like his video game addiction was okay. Personally, I never want to be the crazy girlfriend but when I finally said something rational to him, he made me feel like I was crazy, annoying, and judgmental.
We went from having a great bond to now feeling very disconnected. I am sure that he thought he would be ready to move in with me but now I feel like it’s getting too much for him and he can’t handle it and is regretting it.

The thing is, we love each other and he asked me to be his girlfriend but he doesn’t really take me out and we don’t really do things that nourish our relationship. He makes plans with me then cancels or forgets. He has never taken me out on a dinner. Maybe once. He didn’t do anything for our anniversary, when I got him a goyard wallet (which aren’t cheap nor easy to get) and on my birthday he didn’t even get me a card or write me anything. I just feel like the love is dead, the romance is dead. 

He just doesn’t want to put in effort anymore? He just wants to sit back and play video games. He’s 31, I want a family and stuff with this guy when I finish school but I really don’t know if there’s any hope for him changing? He hasn’t showered in like two weeks, has the diet of an 11 year old (mcdonald’s, fast food, soda 24/7) he doesn’t exercise with me because he hates the sun, he doesn’t like the gym, he basically dislikes anything healthy. I asked him to take me to the park and he did it once and never again. it’s like what am I even doing am I this guys roommate or is he my boyfriend? I feel like i’m crazy for feeling this way, whenever I talk to him he gets annoyed and doesn’t want to talk about anything.

I love this guy but am I just blind? Is this how relationships are supposed to be? He's never cursed at me or disrespected me unless we were arguing but other than that, am I in love with someone who isn't in love with me?

279,"So I get a lot of attention from men which gives me high expectations. The perfect guy that I was after is actually popular with woman. He has everything a girl wants, so I wanted him to myself.

Over the past 2 months we became friends and hung out but never till last night did he show many interested signs. It was probably because I invited him over we had a few shots. Not wasted though, more tipsy, so I told him how I felt and things actually got sexual. I kissed him so he went in stripping me...

The bad part was I did not expect any of this to happen so I forgot to shave/trim... but I tried to make this the best sex he ever had so I gave him head... which I feel like he was unsatisfied with since I could only get like an inch past the tip and he was trying to push my head down a bit more.

After that he pulled off my panties like he was about to eat me out but the hair... I actually didn't bathe because I didn't expect it. He stopped, but he kept going with the sex. I was so nervous and was sweating like a pig but everything...  the first few thrust and I already came on his dick... he kept going and I was literally queefing the entire time. Not only that but after changing multiple positions he let me ride him and I was so fucking wet it sounded like I was bouncing on fucking water.... not to mention my hair was soaked with my coochie juice...

Eventually he put me back down finished off and like an idiot I was holding his neck while he was like let go and he came inside trying to pull out... Then as I cumfarted out because things was couldn't get worse he said he was going to buy after pills asap...

He woke me up at 7 this morning bringing them and then left. Hasn't answered my calls or text since.... I'm positive I ruined it and now I feel so lame. Is it over? Have I completely fucked up my chances? Is there any possible way to save this? I need advice soon af...

My wife and I ordered a new king sized mattress a few weeks ago and when it was marked as delivered it was not at our house. We called fedex and they acknowledged that they left it at the wrong house. They said they would pick it up and bring it to us. After about 5 days they said they werent able to pick it up so they let the company know and ordered a new bed for us.

We got the new bed a couple days ago and as we were leaving the house today we saw a box from the same company on a neighbor's porch. We checked and sure enough it had our information on the shipping label. We knocked on the door and the lady let us know it has been sitting there since she got it and no one has contacted her about picking it up so we took it back to our house.

My question is, since fedex has admitted they lost the package and the company has already marked it as lost and sent us a new one what should we do? Do we have options to sell it or give it to friends or family or will the company or fedex be looking for it?

286,"Hi! Thanks for reading! 

As you’ve gathered from the title, I’m having an internal struggle with myself and decided to get more opinions.

This affair has been going on for a long time. In all transparency, I have no definitive proof. But, when I first started the job, said manager and employee were always very flirtatious with each other. They’d always go on breaks together, go to the beach during lunch, leave work together even though they lived in completely opposite directions, etc.
What I bore witness to with my own eyes was the young female employee, who I’m gonna nickname Spice, would always give the manger whom I’ll nickname Sporty, massages, hugs, bend over jokingly, talk sexually and was just always around him. Sporty does not act like this towards any other employees and Spice is really touchy-feely only with him, so it’s not the type of situation where you could just brush it off as, “(name here) is just like that!”.

I thought nothing of it originally because the job atmosphere was really chill and I’m all about people being happy. It’s always inappropriate for leadership to date people they manage, but hey, they weren’t harming anyone and work was getting done, so I didn’t give shit that they were dating...

Then one day, after working at the job for 3-4 months, during a meeting, Sporty brought up his wife and it totally threw me. I knew Spice wasn’t married to Sporty sooooo it became very awkward for me. When I asked some other people who worked there about it (trying to find out if it was an open marriage or something), those who I spoke with started telling me the marriage wasn’t open and filled me in on events that took place before I got there that confirmed that Sporty was indeed having an affair, doing horribly at keeping it on the DL, and that Spice would talk mad shit about Sporty’s wife, thus also confirming that she is not innocent and is fully aware that she’s the side chick.


I no longer work at this company and I recently moved, so I’m not worried about retaliation or getting fired. I’m just genuinely conflicted. I try to convince myself that it’s not my place and to mind my damn business, but the thought, “wouldn’t you want to know if it were your husband cheating on you,?” just keeps creeping up in the back of my mind. And the answer to that is yeah, I would want someone to tell me! I mean, because of the hours, Sporty sees Spice more during the week than his own wife and it’s just so awful to think that his wife doesn’t know...

If you read all that, thank you! I’ve bottled it up for awhile now.

TL;DR : To tell or not to tell? That is literally the question. 

Anyone wanna share how they might’ve handled a similar situation?

He also looks super fine in his uniform but I don't talk about that.

Ever since we have texted each other and spoken to each other in class, we have been getting closer. He stood up to another guy my age who has been calling me mean things. He also asks about my life, my interests, and has been frequently texting me. He has been giving me his jackets to wear for three days in a row and I leave a little note in the jacket pocket with a bit of chocolate to say thanks. 

Today, we were studying in class together and playing cards, and he asked me about religion so I told him I was a nihilist atheist. He told me that my view seemed kind of depressing so I asked what he was and he told me that he is Baptist. I thought that was interesting, so I told him that it sounds pretty cool, but he seemed a little distant. I kept trying to justify my thoughts, so I said ""I don't push my beliefs on people so I'd hope others wouldn't do it to me,"" and ""I think it's amazing that people can have these beliefs and hope, it's optimistic."" I think I just dug a deeper hole. After I said these things, we watched religious educational videos, if you will, about the Bible and whatnot and I told him I liked them, but after a while I was getting kind of bored honestly (I didn't say that though). I don't know if atheists and baptists usually get along. My mom is Catholic and her boyfriend is atheist but they get along like two peas in a pod. I even started to read up about Baptist Christian stuff later. I truly am interested. 

I don't want him to think differently of me because of my beliefs. I want to hope that he thinks of me the same as before. I've not had as much experience in relationships as adults and stuff, but I've never ever liked someone like this before. I'm head over heels. I don't know what to do.

I know I'm probably overreacting, but to me this is something I've never experienced. 
Thanks. :)

289,"There's a guy who really likes me. I liked him back, so we started dating. 

But as soon as we started dating, I lost interest in him. I preferred the time when we were just friends. I preferred the time when he tried so hard to chase after me. I preferred the time when we weren't together. I feel like I made the decision to date him too quickly.

I don't know what to tell him. I don't know how my feelings can change so quickly. I am usually a person who changes their interests very quickly, so maybe it's just a habit of mine and my interest will return. Also, he really, really, really likes me. So telling him this will hurt him a lot.

I'm planning on telling him that we should take the relationship slowly. Or we should go back to being friends and slowly start dating. Or should I just break up with him? I don't know what to do.

293,"hi :)

i'm a lot happier than i have been in a long time, but i'm still trying to figure my life out at age 30.  academics interest me, and i have 70ish credits in very random things at a local community college.  philosophy, microbiology, computer science, english literature, psychology, etc etc.  part of my problem is still that i jump around from subject to subject and get excited about different majors a lot.

my dad is a college professor himself, and i live with him still.  he's starting to get tired of me being there i can tell, and i don't really seem to understand how to move on with my life.

goals: save several 10s of thousands of dollars for surgery, complete college (really want to transfer to the state university), get a decent paying job, move out, focus on bettering myself (exercise, diet, other self-care), finish transition other than surgeries (learn clothes, makeup, hair)

how do i make any of this happen?  i've been saving money for surgeries, but working my very stressful job making $12.30/hour isn't making this fast work.  i only have $2.5k saved up so far, and i'll need $10k minimum just for the trachea shave.  school is a mess, and the path of least resistance looks like an english major.  even going that route i'd need to take another 10 classes just to finish up at the community college, and working full time i find that i get super overwhelmed with life and can't really do school if i'm taking 3+ courses at once.  i don't know how to move out while making so little money, and if i do i feel like my surgeries will end up taking that much longer to achieve.  already it feels like my life hasn't even started yet, as i need to work hard to complete my transition.  i don't know how to dress myself still, and clothes are very expensive.  computer science seems like a good major but i feel like it would take me another 15 years to complete, as the courses are much more difficult than things like english.  should i become a nurse?  i work with a number of nurses and they're so stressed out all of the time.  maybe everyone is living in a constant state of debilitating stress, i guess.  it worries me some that i'll pick a career and find that i can't really get ahead in the field, being trans and all.  i live in a deep red trump state and things aren't very LGBT-friendly here.

sorry i'm so all over the place with this post.  this is how i feel about life all of the time now.  i could write for hours and hours about all the uncertainty.  hopefully the goals help direct the advice a little.",17Nov2017,2

296,"I have no direction. I'm 17 I am enrolled in online schooling which I haven't even logged into since July I've just been floating. I've been in public school most of my life and have always had a terrible time my teachers always said how talented and smart I was but I had terrible grades from poor attendance I've had poor attendance for as long as I can remember I've lied and done every trick to not go I don't know why I pushed myself and did everything to not go. It was almost like I didn't have control I couldn't make myself go but that's bullshit I knew I could but its like something that stopped me from moving made me freeze. My parents both had really strict parents themselves and they wanted to take the opposite approach with me and I think it had a boomerang effect. I've never tried at anything, I've talked and talked and talked about changing but its in short bursts. For most of my life I've played video games or drowned and sedated myself in media and entertainment, that I think I have conditioned myself to spend all waking hours drowning everything out with anything I can from games, youtube, or movies. Most of my real friends are online, I was popular in high school as a clown that everybody liked but I had no true friends there, my entire life I have probably only been to someones house 20 times. I was isolated and I couldn't find anyone in school who shared my interests and I think I've known since I started school and felt the stress and the depression and how often I would make myself absent that I was on a downward spiral where I would go so low that I either have to come out an adult or float in purgatory forever, and now I am here. I switched to online schooling in February last year and I essentially haven't touched it since I've just been sitting 8-10 hours every day. When I was school I was stressed and depressed all the time I couldn't sleep cause I feared the mornings so much. Now I am just numb, I've taken the time to study I guess, study film and writing and read about other things and I have always wanted to be a story teller in some form and I always toy with ideas of a movie or a book or a game in my head and I want to write but I suffer the same problem I'm well informed I know where to start but I don't know how to break out of the way I have conditioned myself, I always take the path of least resistance no matter what I tell myself to change everyday and every night but I don't know what it means anymore.

297,"Okay, here’s some backstory. A few months ago I started dating a guy, for the sake of this story we’ll call him J. We’ve been friends for 4 years and honestly it’s early doors but so far, I’ve felt so understood and comfortable  in a relationship, especially this early on; the only catch is we decided it was best not to tell anyone except close friends. A few months ago I also got cast in a play and have been doing rehearsals twice a week, I knew a guy in the play who I’ll call B, before and we’ve become pretty good friends since rehearsals started. It was great for the first few months, we joked around and became pretty close; but recently he’s been getting very… cosy. (Obviously he’s unaware that I’m dating J, but he does know him, and they’re friends, even though they aren’t that close) he does things like hug me randomly, ext me all the time, make constant innuendos, follow me around and basically get any physical contact available (including asking if i’d like to feel him muscles), and he does this all in front of J. Needless to say, J is not a happy about this. And I do express that I’m uncomfortable when he does these things, but he doesn’t stop. I spoke to J today and it really seems to be getting to him, to the point where J said if he didn’t stop he was going to have to step in, which would be very unusual for someone as mild mannered as J. 
Point being, how do I get him to stop without telling him about me and J?",17Nov2017,2
299,"So here's a story of my last few months:

I rent a house with 3 other people(we're all guys). We have all known each other of a long time, and have lots of mutual friends. Because of this, people are at our house constantly, and the people who are there regularly(like several times a week) are my main friend group. 

Earlier this year, someone new met some of us, and started coming over too. Let's call her Rachel(not her name). Her and I had previously been set up on a super awkward date with some friends me and her share. I did not want things to be awkward, so I made a serious effort to become her friend. 

After a couple months, she's thoroughly part of the squad(I hate myself for calling it that). She's probably, at this point, closest to one of my roommates, we'll call him Jim I guess. But me and her start talking more and more. It's getting kind of flirtatious. 

But I also see that Jim is flirting with her a lot too. I decide that I don't want to really get involved. Over the next couple of weeks, I try to keep my distance, but she's still flirting with me a lot.

This leads to one day, Jim confronts me in the laundry room. He says ""Are you interested in Rachel?""

I say ""I am, but I don't want to get involved if you are too, I don't want things to be weird""

He says ""no, I don't see her that way at all, I really want to see you too together, because she told me that she likes you""

I get a weird vibe from him, but I decide, this is great, let's do this. So her and I start more actively being a thing. 
But I wasn't sure about it, it felt weird some times. Like, a couple weeks in, I went on vacation. I hung out with this girl on a tuesday, left on wednesday, came back on sunday night. Everyone was over(they always are), and when I sat down I heard her whisper to Jim ""I'm so glad he's back""

That freaked me out a little, so I figure me and her decide to go slower. 

Then people start mentioning how much time Jim and Rachel spend together, and I'm like ""okay, I'm not a very jealous person."" But I guess they went to him too, because he brings it up one day. He tells me, ""hey, I don't like Rachel that way, I just am close to her because I told her I could be like the go-between for you two, and give her advice on being with you""

I did not think this was really necessary or appropriate, and I told him that. So he stopped mentioning it to me. However, I later learned, = it didn't stop. 

After a couple of months, things seem to be going well. Except for Jim making a point of nearly every day mentioning ""I don't like Rachel that way, you have nothing to worry about"" which only made me kinda weirded out. It’s at this point I me and her sit down, and call things off. What was weird is that she mentioned that we were “going too fast,” which I assure you, we weren’t.

Then a different friend tells me ""Jim says that him am Rachel talked about how they are into each other, and they want to be together""

I wasn't super surprised, but I went to confront Jim on his lies. So here is the timeline from his perspective. He likes a girl, this girl likes me. He rejects my offer to not get involved (seriously, why though?). He then convinces her to go to him for advice on me. He is very manipulative. It gets to the point where she is asking him for permission for anything that happens with me. And then whenever we were all together, he would give her the silent treatment any time she was too affectionate with me(I realize I should have seen that red flag earlier). Then, at one point, when everyone is mentioning their friendship being weird, she freaks out. She asks him what they will be like if she dates me. He tells her that they can be friends, but they won't be able to talk as much, and they probably will never be as close as they were before(In my mind this is kind of like holding his friendship hostage). And then after a couple of weeks of things fizzling out between me and her, Jim tells her that he likes her, and she realizes she does too.

This was a couple of months ago. And I see them way too much still. And most of my friend group thinks he didn't do anything wrong, and that their situation is fine. Am I overreacting to still be upset with him?",17Nov2017,2

TLDR: I’m bisexual and a freshman in college and I like this boy (I know he’s gay) but he’s super busy and I’m not sure if I can deal with taking a long time to get to know him only to deal with potential heartbreak

So I met this boy at a football game and we started talking and were getting along pretty well. It took nearly 3 weeks to hang out with him after that but I finally did last night. We went to a movie and it was really good and I’m glad I went, but now I’m in a weird spot

(Also I should mention the reason it took so long to hang out with him is it turns out he’s dealing with a number of physical and mental health problems that make it hard for him to hang out with people. Also he’s a theatre major so his academic schedule can be hectic)

We had this conversation after the movie where he said I should try to find some other friends so I don’t get disappointed if he’s flaky. He’s got no clue I’ve got feelings for him. But at the same time, I’m not sure if I can spend the time it takes to become really good friends and then drop the bombshell that I like him only to get rejected (I’m a virgin and I’ve never been in a relationship before and now I’m really starting to feel like I’m missing out)

I’m only gonna be able to hang out with him 1 or 2 more times this year (winter break is in early December and he’s flying home for break) and so it’d probably be March at the earliest before I’d be ready. But should I really set myself up for heartbreak like this?

I’m confused what should I do?",17Nov2017,2

310,"For the past few months, I (21m) have been seeing this guy, we’ll call him Drew (23m), and I have fallen absolutely head over heels in love with him. I’ve never felt this way about anyone before, at least not this strongly. 

We aren’t officially boyfriends just yet, but I care for him so much. Our friendship started out pretty casually but we both instantly liked each other when we met and a lot of the time, we do treat each other like we are boyfriends. We told each other that we’re falling in love with each other, and just taking it day by day. And I really do believe him.

Earlier this week Drew’s cat passed away. He’s going through hell right now because this cat was his baby and meant so much to him. I feel awful and wish there was more I could do to help.

Today Drew told me he needs space, and he wants us to take a break for a week, so that he can focus on reconnecting with himself and healing from his cat’s death. I do understand where he’s coming from, but as someone with anxiety and trust issues, it makes me feel extremely scared and unwanted. I know it’s not about me - but that’s where my mind goes.

I’m the type of person who really wants to help when a loved one is going through something, so for him to shut me out really hurts me.

He is constantly picked up or dropped off, during the day and once very early in the morning.

I walk outside at 5:40 in the morning and see a car sitting where he is usually dropped off/picked up. It's pitch black out and the car had its lights on.

She said that she had just gotten out of a bad relationship with an abusive guy who didn't treat her right and she was still hurting because of it. She claimed that she was broken inside and she would rather have some time for herself than rush back into dating. We ended on good terms and just decided to remain friends for the time being, though we never actively partook in being friends. It was just one of those things you typically say after a break up/separation.

Jump ahead to ten months later in this past September and she ends up leaving the job we worked together. She had been accepted into our state's police academy and she was leaving our job to pursue her career as a police officer. When she left the job, I took that as a sign that she was moving on from me and no longer wished to pursue anything with me.

Now a couple months later and she just recently texted me and asked me out for lunch this weekend. I'm not necessarily expecting her to come straight out and ask to try at a relationship again, but it's in the back of my mind. The question I have is this: Should I take her up on her offer? I admittedly still have feelings for her and I'd like to give things another chance, but this whole situation feels weird to me. Is it normal for people to reconnect after long periods of time? It's been a full year since our first date and I honestly feel weird about us just getting back together after such little progress between us. Also, why would she leave our job if she's clearly still interested in me? Wouldn't it be easier for her to stay at the job, try to reconnect with me and THEN apply for a police job?

I, however, have found out that whenever I come in close contact with them (in order to change their bedding, feed them, take them out of their cage, etc.), I get rashes and sneeze uncontrollably for an hour, leading me to believe I am either allergic to either them or their food. This means either I put off coming near them for as long as I can, or interact  normally and face the consequences. I usually choose the latter, though it's absolutely miserable. My parents already dislike them for their tendency to smell and that they're expensive, but I am torn. Should I take them back? I don't want to seem like one of those ignorant pet owners who buy animals on a whim only to neglect them and give them away after two days. I researched, I begged, I loved those pigs. I am already very emotionally and financially invested in these pigs. My parents are probably not candidates to help and I don't want those pigs to suffer just because I selfishly put my own needs before theirs. What do I do?",17Nov2017,4

335,"Hi guys, I'm a male. I have OCD, can anyone tell me what's going on with me and how to heal? A male touched my butt, I did not want him to. Now I have the thought of his hand on my butt all day. It's like he's basically touching my butt all day. It gives me groinal sensations. I hate it very badly. I can't look at a womens butt because all I can do is feel the hand on my butt.

337,"I wear jeans to my job, which is essentially a porting position at a bar. Involves manual labor, mostly picking stuff up and putting it down elsewhere. However, it feels like I'm constantly tearing the crotch of my jeans.

My family and friends tease me about it so I'm not sure if it's something I'm doing differently? Maybe walking like a weirdo or buying terrible jeans?

Getting incredibly sick of buying new, fairly expensive jeans and having them ruined within a month or two. 

Is there a good place or brand for cheaper jeans that look half decent and will last me? The durability is the main problem, I'd spend the extra money to get a good long lasting pair or two. Or, alternatively, am I doing something wrong that I'm constantly ruining these jeans?

338,"A woman sent her picture to my uncle's phone number out of the blue two months ago, and he's been texting her all this time thinking it's genuine and that she's interested in him. He is now inviting her to come live with him because she claims she is homeless and has been in a shelter for 2 years, though, apparently, she accidentally implied that she'd been staying at her uncle's house all this time.

He's been wiring her hundreds of dollars. She was apparently coming all the way from Dallas, Texas to here in southeast Virginia by bus, but stepped off at one stop a couple hundred miles away and ""missed"" getting back on. Now she says she's coming the rest of the way by car with her uncle's friend.

My mom and I live on the property behind my uncle's in a very rural area, no neighbors. We don't have guns or anything and I'm worried about our safety and belongings.

We've tried intervening, but he's idiotically steadfast even knowing all the things that are wrong with this picture, and says he wants to meet her anyway to ""question her"". He's recently separated from his wife and apparently very lonely, and we're thinking he realizes she's a scammer but wants to ""fix"" her or something.

But he won't even meet her at a restaurant in public, he's just bringing potentially dangerous people off the internet- they've never even video or voice chatted- into his home, and ours. They're going to arrive tomorrow afternoon.",17Nov2017,7
340,"I'm about to get out of the military and I'm trying to decide what I'm doing after I get out. I have an opportunity to persue an apprenticeship for welding/pipefitting. Which isn't a terrible job, since I have some welding experience already and I can get into it. But my real passion is music. Now I know the idea of me making my living as a performer is unrealistic, but I have had gigs as a sound tech and absolutely loved it. And with the army paying for my education I could attend a great school for music production and recording tech. I just worry about how easy it would be to get a job. I'm just super unsure if it's a good idea to take this kind of risk if it means I might get my dream job. ",17Nov2017,3
341,"I talked to the girl I said was in my chemistry class from an earlier post I had here. She didn’t talk a whole lot, and sadly I didn’t get her number. 

I have a feeling she’s a bit shell shocked that I finally noticed her, because she’s sat by me often, so hopefully the weekend gives her time to think about whether she likes me or not. I should add that her friends made her show up to lecture today, and that they were going to skip, and with the plethora of open seats, she still chose to sit by me (literally by me, not spacing a seat between us). 

What should I do if she’s not that talkative? Should I ask if she’d be interested in a study date? ",17Nov2017,8

343,"I just got hired for an entry level office job for a large international company. During the many steps of the interview process I was asked multiple times ""do you have any vacation planned in the next 6-12 months?"" I answered no, figuring that my vacation plans would disqualify me from getting hired in the first place. My partner and I have already booked and paid for a month long trip abroad in February. Clearly my lying was half baked because now that I'm hired I don't know how to manage the situation. I am 100% going on this trip because it is all paid for, but I would really like to somehow keep this job too. Their policy on no vacation time for new hires is very explicit and I will be under a probationary period until March. There will be a month of paid training to start so I'm hoping that once they have sunk that time into me they will be less likely to can my dumb ass. I know I've dug my own hole here, but any creative ideas for how to get the time off and keep the job? Many thanks good people!",17Nov2017,3
344,"Okay, so... I'm close to giving up on the whole dating thing and just embrace the fact that my life partner is going to be my right arm.


For two years, I've going out, meeting people, completely ignored my normal shyness, and the result so far has been meeting about 18-19 girls I liked, and become their ""best friend"" within a week. No exceptions. I end up being their go-to guy for psychological advice, because medical school, their go-to coffee guy, relationship advice guy, car repair guy, and the list goes on, but you see where this is going. Never got past that friend/acquaintance phase, and can only dream of actually having a relationship until next year. 


Two years ago I was a chipper young lad with a sense of humor. Now I'm a cynical, sarcastic young lad who leanred two things in those two years. How to play guitar, and how to come up with some suprisingly creative curses. Second one can also be attributed to Red Cross work though


So whats the fuck-up here, being too nice, not being distant enough, being too interested, not interested enough, not friendly, or just being an under-average cynical dickwad?",17Nov2017,2

346,"So my friends and I started planning a trip to Germany next year (we're from the US) just for the fun of it. We're getting everything figured out and so far most of my friends can go/afford it/parents will let them. 

I just talked to my mom tonight about it and she was instantly super unsure about it and said she'd really have to think about it. (but it really sounded like a no) I'm 19 years old (20 in about 6 months) and all of my friends ages range from 20-22. 

I will be paying for the trip with my own money that I've saved up from work. One of the friends coming has traveled to many countries before and knows her way around. (her sister has also lived in the area of Germany we want to stay and can help us get to know the area) This friend is also someone I've been friends with since I was a kid, there for my mom knows her and her family really well. 

Also, another plus is that we're meeting a good friend of mine who has lived in Germany his whole life so he will be able to guide us and help us with language barriers and such. 

She basically told me that she trusts me and my friends but doesn't know the type of 'environment' in another country. (She has never traveled outside of the US before and I've only been out of my state twice in my life, so I think the lack of experience is what worries her) But that's why I'm going with other people who are experienced! 

Is there anyway I could convince her into letting me go? ",17Nov2017,2
347,"I am a college junior and I can't seem to get a job even though I feel like I am doing everything right. I have a super high GPA at one of the best schools in the country, I'm an eagle scout, I am doing a double major in math and computer science. I have done several projects outside of school. I am active on GitHub and LinkedIn. I often even know people at the companies I apply to. 

On top of that, every technical interview I have I do great at. I have read books and went to talks on how to handle technical interviews and I almost always get the questions right quickly and am able to explain them well and ask good questions. I send a thank you email the day after the interview to the interviewer and recruiter. I send a custom cover letter to each job and have had my resume reviewed professionally. I have applied to over a 100 jobs and have had over a dozen technical interviews this semester and nothing. How am I so lackluster, what is wrong with me...

I really want to give up. Stop applying and just graduate and go work at my old job at a camping store. People that I feel I am way more qualified than are getting jobs all around me. My job last summer was in a tiny office where my boss was a racist, homophobic monster who constantly blamed everything that went wrong on me, and it wasn't even in the field I am looking for.
