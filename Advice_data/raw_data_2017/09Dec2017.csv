1,"So these past few years I have been very depressed even to the point where i think about suicide every day. I’m a loser at school with no friends, my existence is pathetic, i have nothing going on with the girls at school, i suck at pretty much everything, and my life is a fucking joke. I thought i would be better off killing myself to end this misery. Everyone else around me is having fun and enjoying their lives with friends, relationships and a meaning in life and i feel like I’m trying to just live day to day waiting for it all to be over.

But then i saw the new south park episode where heidi and cartman go to memorable places, such as the bridge where heidi quit Twitter for good (threw her phone away), the cabin where cartman got assaulted last season( the Twitter homicide) and the forest where cartman dressed heidi up so she could be captured by the witch. At the end she realized that after thinking cartman turned her into him (fat, manipulative, sociopathic, always being the victim and blaming others) it was her that did it to herself. She victimized herself for everything and blamed everyone else but then realized doing that can excuse doing horrible things. It’s her fault she finally saw it. She saw that cartmans abuse doesn’t excuse the fact that she turned into him. 

Anyways am I heidi? Am i always playing the victim? Do i let being the victim get away with doing shitty things ( in my case being overall kind of negative, having horrible thoughts about other people around me, thinking about taking my own life)? Did i turn myself into the pathetic piece of trash i am now? Do i even deserve feeling sorry for myself? Or am i an actual victim? Please someone help me through this. I don’t even know my own existence anymore and I’m only 15. Is it my fault that I’m horribly depressed? ",09Dec2017,4
2,"I'm 21 years old never come close to a girl in my life and its pretty obvious I never will. It really hurts me a lot. I wish and fantasize so much for a girl to go out with me. I got all these good things going on in life, but I'd trade everything to just have a girlfriend. My therapist has tried to help me with getting a girlfriend, she said I could for sure get a date. Well a year in and I'm still at the same spot we started in. I get horny then masturbate to porn then cry after that all I can do give myself a hand job and watch someone else get laid. I have so many good things in life, and not having a girlfriend like ruins everything for me.

So if I castrate myself will it get rid of the desire for a woman? Or is there some sort of procedure that will do it? I just wanna be non sexual so I wont care anymore and I can focus on the good things.",09Dec2017,1
3,"We are all women just to clarify. We live in Los Angeles. 

Roommate and I got a one bedroom. RM got the living room because that’s what she wanted even though I insisted on 2 bedroom. Months later RM’s Significant Other moves in and doesn’t want to pay a portion of the rent as a whole but only a portion of RM’s. SO seems that I should pay more for the bedroom. I offered 1/3 + $100. SO still says no. No matter who is wrong or right. (SO says that even if we had gotten a 2 bedroom, she would insist I would be paying half because of space. Something I’ve never done with roommates before.) 

In the last two days, SO has started personally attacking me and my physical features, calling me fat, bitch, and more. I have not return these gestures.  Last night when this happened again, SO was also drunk and have been high, not just weed,  the day prior. SO seemed like they  were going to lounge at me. RM blocked SO’s way. 

This started because I did call the management company and see if I can get off the lease. I have told the company SO stays with us too much, she wants me out, and I don’t know what to do. They said I can file a legal notice of her being there and it will be posted.

I cannot get off the lease even if the RM agrees, she cannot either. 

I’m physically dreading going home after work tonight. Home has always been my sanctuary. It took a lot to get out of bed this morning because for some reason they were up at 4am when I woke up 3 hrs later after the altercation.

I just got a second job to be able to save and move but I’m honestly willing to move before I get an eviction or thrown out. I currently can pay a prorated month and deposit. I rather get an eviction before I try to get my own place.

6,"In 2018 I will be going to university to do a game development course. This is basically 100% decided. On this course you do actually make games it's more of a do course then just learning (or so I have been told). Anyway on this course there are six paths you can go down at the start of the three years. But you need to choose one and stick to it. The six paths are as follows:

Writing for games, 
Sound for games, 
Animation for games, 
Programming for games, 
Game Design for games and 
Art for games.

The issue I have is I don't know which to choose. You see I love games. I love storytelling for games (writing) I love character design and animation (animation) and I love level design and world building (game design?). But the main two I am stuck between is game design and animation. I want to build world's. Design level layouts and plan the places that people will journey through. I have a passion for world building and visual storytelling. That's my ultimate goal. But my second passion is animation. 

I would of thought that the guy who does level layouts and all that is the game designer, however when I went to the uni and asked about this they said that the game designer is very vague and kind of gets involved in everything. Animation is more straightforward in terms of I know what I would be doing. I have tried looking online about this but I'm struggling to come up with a finalised answer. 

If you know a better place to ask this please let me know. I basically just want help on which I should choose because I can't find an answer on what a game designer actually does. 

Also I have played games of all kinds. From little big planet, to civ 5 to rainbow 6 siege.

7,"My dad died last week and I came home for the funeral and to spend the rest of the time with my mom. She will now live alone in a house and I live in another state so I want to help her and keep her company before I go back.

As much as I want to be there for her, she has a very abrasive personality. My siblings and I have always kept our distance from her because she has a way of driving people crazy with anger. She will say extremely hurtful thing and has little respect for others. I can only stand it for a couple of days at a time.

I still have another week of paid time off I can spend with her but I just want to go back to my apartment. I consider that more of a home than the one I lived in for 15 years because my mom has made it so hostile. I feel guilty though about leaving my mom when I still have more ""free time"" I can spend with her before I need to fly back though. I want to help her and support her but she is driving me crazy.",09Dec2017,2

10,"Hey everyone! 

So, the title says it all. It's pretty annoying.
It mostly happens with my SOs. With my ex I would start crying whenever I could feel even the tiniest of conflict was about to happen (same with my current SO but we haven't really fought yet). I'll give an example to show how ridiculous it is; once I answered my phone in class before the teacher had started teaching, and my bf (at the time) said 'wow why are you answering? we're in a classroom this is disrespectful' and I had to go to the bathroom because I couldn't hold back tears. I also feel tears coming whenever I'm having a light hearted conversation with my SO about things I'm passionate about and he disagrees with me about things I view as very important (politics etc). OR when I talk about my feelings, or when I feel strong emotions, good or bad. 

In those situations I wish I could just answer, talk about it, either agree or disagree with him, but actually engage in the conversation instead of having to deal with my tears, trying to hide them or letting then flow, and making the person be like 'wtf is going on we were literally just talking'. Like I know none of those things that make me cry are a big deal and it makes things awkward and overdramatic.

Does anyone have this problem? What should I do? Thanks everyone :)",09Dec2017,2
11,"I’ve had this best friend for 7 years, she is the most amazing, funny, talented, and beautiful girl I’ve ever met. We dated for 4 months last year, we never got very intimate but it was the happiest relationship I’ve ever been in.
When we were dating, I liked her a lot, and she was actually the first one to say she liked me, so that’s why we started dating. The relationship was absolutely awesome, we had tons of fun but I didn’t truly loved her at the time.
After the four months she said she’s sorry, I didn’t do anything wrong, but she doesn’t think she can handle a relationship right now because she’s really trying to focus on her singing/acting career.
I thought, ok, that’s fine, really nothing much will change, we’ll just go back to being best friends like we were before right? Then maybe in like a few months or a year or something we might start going out again
But only a month after we broke up she got a new boyfriend and dated him for a while
They broke up two months ago
I finally thought it was time I confess that I love her and want to talk to her about it.
We were on a FaceTime call a week ago as we usually are a few nights a week and she was complaining about how two of her friends are always so demeaning of her and stuff
And she talked for about 15 minutes about how I’m the longest friendship she’s ever had, I’m always there for her to support her no matter what, I make her laugh harder than anybody she’s ever met, and I’m the best friend she’s ever had

Last night she was having a performance, I was going to talk to her on the drive home, or when we were there about it
We never had the chance to talk there because there were just tons of people and I never got alone time with her.
I watched her performance (she killed it), and we started driving home.
When I was about to start talking, she started talking saying how she and one of the guys she performed with almost kissed back stage
And she proceeded to spend the rest of the car ride texting him
I glanced over for just a second and saw many texts with many heart emojis and stuff like that in their messages

I don’t know what to do
I don’t want to lose her
I’m absolutely heart broken
Sometimes I think “screw her I don’t need her in my life to play with my emotions like that”
Other times i think “she’s awesome, I think it’d just be really cool if we continued being best friends”
And then other times I think “I’ve never felt this way about anybody before, I love her, I need to have her”

I talked to a guy friend about it and he said “don’t say anything, she said you’re her best friend, you don’t want to risk losing that”
Then I talked to a girl friend about it and she said “if you really love her, you better tell her before it’s too late, then (like a movie quote) you might spend the rest of your life wondering about what could’ve happened”

What do you think I should do?

12,"I have a crush on a guy at work, and I am feeling so confused about him at the moment for a number of reasons. To cut a long story short, I liked him as soon as I spoke to him, and we used to be really chatty and friendly with one another, almost to the point where I thought he was flirting with me. 

However, I noticed a sudden change in his behaviour towards me, which I don't think is my imagination. He suddenly started acting very awkward and quiet around me, whenever I try and talk to him he will act flustered and like he wants to quickly leave the conversation, and if we are in a group, he'll completely ignore me. He seems aloof and cold all of a sudden, which is such a shame because he didn't start off like this. He also acts a little clumsy when I'm around, knocking things over, tripping, 
etc. 

Some of these actions made me wonder if he liked me too, but he has other behaviours which makes me think he definitely doesn't. For example, he never initiates conversations on social media, and sometimes he sees messages and doesn't respond to them at all. I've always thought this was a huge indicator that someone wasn't interested, so naturally I'm rather confused, but I don't understand why he seems very nervous around me.

To cap it all, a couple of days ago, I noticed that he has hidden his entire FB profile from me. All posts/statuses and photos are now hidden, but I haven't been deleted or blocked. I wondered if he might have hidden his information from everyone, but I asked a friend to check his profile and she said she could see more stuff on his profile than I could, yet she's not even a friend. This has made me feel so bad and so confused because I don't ever interact with his FB profile, I have never once liked a comment or a photo and I have only ever messaged him on the odd occasion, usually about work. 

Could it be that somehow he's picked up on the fact that I like him romantically and it's making him nervous? Do guys get nervous around girls they DON'T like? If he had been like this all the way along I would just put it down to him being a shy and nervous person anyway, but it's the sudden U-turn of behaviour which has thrown me off guard and is making me feel so confused about it all.

14,"I work a part time job that I've put on a pedestal since I started several months ago but I don't think it has really come to matter much at all. It is NOT a good job, it's more or less shitty low level work. However, it is good experience for leadership and improving social skills. This is a job where I've worked hard and always aim to do my best, to show I'm capable. I really just want to be promoted. That effort hasn't amounted to anything. Someone else actually got promoted before me (Who started after I did) so that basically broke my heart for the job. That being said, a big reason why I'm here/still here is because of my boss.. I love working with them, they have sort of kept me coming back. 

It's been tough, I show up consistently but I often dread (this is not entirely because of my job specifically though) the mornings I have to head in. I work the max part time hours every week. I feel guilty as fuck wanting to work less or call out on days I really need the mental break. Truthfully I DON'T need to be spending all my time there, I am not relying on the money. The big issue to me is that as soon as I ask for less than max hours or time off I'm shooting down any chance of promotion, and I would feel like I'm letting down my boss.

How much should I care. How do I come to some kind of understanding with these problems? If I walk away from it I feel like I am going to be left with a pointless resume entry (supervisor/manager is always going to outweigh some random entry level job title).

15,"I'm thinking ahead of myself but I've been saving money ever since I was a child and it's been under my parents savings since then. It's been stolen once because of my dad. But I got t back.
But anyways, I feel like I might have to give my parents an ultimatum because they always expect my SO to pay everything and pay 10g dowry if we ever get married and then pay off everything of the wedding, which will ultimately leave me and my SO in debt especially my SO since he doesn't come from a ""rich"" background (neither does my family but we've been working since the day your born!) So my parents making it even harder for us to be together.
And I feel like because of this tradition it'll scare him away and possibly others too.
Does anyone know how to get your saving moneys from your parents account? (I'm 21 btw) one time around a year ago my dad couldn't deposit money without my ID so I think they made a separate account for me but I've been told it's been under their name/account.

In all he just doesn't have 50g let alone 10g yet since he bought a new (used) car after his old one broke down. If we ever plan to get married I'll probably be fucking 30 and he'll be maybe around 40yrs old. Just saving up money to freaking live off without our parents. 
I really can't understand old Gs and their traditions.
I have a cousin whose been with my other cousin for couple years now but can't propose because his family is dead beat because his father being abused by his wife and sent to the hospital maybe ten times by now. So he doesn't have the money or his family doesn't have the money to give him for the proposal/ wedding.

16,"Hi, 

I'm a long time lurker (without an account), but I need help. I recently got a phone call offering me a position as an intern at a small firm (company A), but I told them that I had another interview and couldn't cancel it. I learned that it was a big mistake to tell them that I had another interview, and i'm really beating myself up because of this. I don't have a great track record with interviews, but this was my first offer. 

I didn't know the etiquette on accepting/delaying offers.  I'm the first in my immediate family to attend college for a white collar job, so i'm super inexperienced. 

The company that I'm interviewing with is a much larger company, so I didn't want to cancel the interview. I don't want to lose the offer, but I want to explore this option with company B. Company A gave me the weekend to think about it and didn't seem pleased when I told them about interviewing with company B. I didn't want to lie to him, but now I know I should've asked for time to think about it.

Any advice would be helpful. I'm really feeling down on this. ",09Dec2017,5

18,"I'm from the U.S., I was born and raised here. Despite this, will leave the U.S. and renounce my citizenship as soon as it is possible for me to do so with another form of citizenship from another country. It is a long story to explain why I am in the disposition I am in now but I must leave and renounce citizenship. This not just simply something I have to do, but something that I want to do.

I have an education to complete first before I leave. But I am not always feeling so well. The fact is that I have so much to do and I feel so overwhelmed at times. I want to do this, I have to do this. But even so, I feel like I have so much at stake at times. I'm progressing very well, but I personally just wish all of it could end now so that way I wouldn't have to think about it. I know that I want this, but I know that it will take time for me to get there. I have to wait until my education is done and other things in my life are sorted out as I planned.

I'm making a lot of sacrifices. I'm leaving home, my family, the life I once had, my connections there, and I'm going to renounce my citizenship when it is the right time to do so. The fact is, I'm throwing my life away and I know that I can't afford to screw this up. I don't want to live with my family anymore at a certain point as I planned, I don't want to live where I live now, I want to leave all of this behind me.

What should I do? I seriously need your help here because I'm making a big life decision that I will have to live with for the rest of my life. Once I accomplish this, there's no turning back.

Edit: I will explain how I came to this decision. This is very uncomfortable for me to explain, but I don't have a choice in the matter. I won't cover everything that happened in my life, but I will explain only

I was born into the educated class in the U.S. and I got to have a very privileged life in comparison to quite a few other kids. Unlike most other kids, both my my parents hold P.h.D.s and had worked in academia. However, both of my parents came from poor backgrounds. When I was five years old, I turned on the TV one day when I was getting ready for school. CNN just happened to be on at the time and this was when 9/11 had just begun. I was shocked as a kid watching what happened but I did something very unusual. Because I was such a curious boy, my mom gave me a dictionary so I could look up any word I don't know. Because of this, I read word after word in a dictionary until I understood what was going on. This was my introduction to the many problems the world is in now.

I kept all of this a secret all of my life because I knew people would worry about me because I was just a kid at the time. I still was a kid and had a relatively normal life. I was (and still am) very extroverted, outgoing, and had a lot of friends. Despite this, I had watched as the world situation continue to deteriorate and as the economy collapsed I knew friends and neighbors of mine that lost everything. I began to ask a lot of questions growing up such as why are things the way they are? Why is the world so full of problems? What can I actually do about this?

So when I was about 14 or 15, I thought I would join the U.S. Marine Corps because I was concerned about the destabilization in the Middle East and knew that I had to do something about the problems over there. One day, my mom forced me to go to the library and I walked through the aisles and stumbled upon a book. This book, entitled *War is a Racket* by Smedley Butler who was a general of the U.S. Marine Corps changed my life forever. It was a short book, but it denounced war as an imperialist profit-making system by which the ruling class profits at the expense of everyone as opposed to an honorable just cause. I read through that book alone while mom was busy with other things and I realized that I had been lied to all of my life about everything and truthfully I was very angry about it. I was going to put up my life for something so immoral and I still to this day wonder where I would be now had I not read that book. I realized I was ignorant, so I checked out so many books on history, economics, philosophy, politics, humanities, science, and various other topics from the library and purchased my share of books as well and started reading. I read so much to a point where I knew too much about the world to accept living in the U.S. and keeping my citizenship. The U.S. is nothing but a capitalist imperialist neoliberal corrupt state that is the very reason why we are in so many of the problems we're in now. The real problem to me however is capitalism itself, not simply the U.S. as a country.

The internet also exposed me to alternative viewpoints of the world and got me to become extremely open-minded to new ideas and to a new way of thinking. This led me to learn just how rotten to the core not only the West is, but the system of capitalism as a whole is. Although there are many people that influenced and inspired me to my disposition, Ken O'Keefe was truthfully the person that got me to where I am now. Ken O'Keefe was a U.S. Marine that served in the Gulf War and had learned during his time there after he was punished for calling out on actual abuse that was going on in his barracks. He realized he had been lied to and much like myself ended up reading many books to a point where he found out he was lied to all of his life. He eventually renounced his citizenship and left the U.S. never to return again. I didn't even know I could renounce citizenship and not just leave the U.S. until I learned about what O'Keefe did.

As I've watched things continue to get worse, it is blatantly obvious to me that I have no future in the U.S. and must leave not only for my own sake but for the sake of my future. My political views are very uncommon for an American (or a Westerner in general) so I really just keep my mouth shut about them because I have to. I can't leave just yet because I must finish my education first. There are plenty of opportunities for that and I must make sure that I leave the nest as soon as possible. This was an easy decision for me to make, but I know that I want this. It has to be done not just for myself, but for the rest of the world. I'm doing the entire world, humans that are living and dead, and myself a favor by doing all of this. That is how I came to this decision. I hope I haven't offended anyone. All of what I'm doing is what I think is morally right and needs to be done. If that means I must throw away everything for the sake of doing what's right, so be it.",09Dec2017,10

21,"We've known each other for almost a decade and we recently reconnected after her relationship of 4 years ended, she had been ghosting me for the last 3 years. We went on a ""not date"", but both treated it as if it were a date. After a fun filled evening she drops the bomb and says she's seeing someone, and that it might get serious once he gets back. I was heart broken to say the least. Later the next day, I spoke to her about everything and she tried playing it off as if she was just excited to see me because we're old friends, but later admitted she definitely saw us as a couple.

I ended up telling her I couldn't accept being just friends and told her that it'd probably be best if we didn't talk again unless she was in a situation to date me, because I felt it was the only way I could respect not only my feelings, but also hers and the guy she was seeing. We ended up not cutting contact though and I said that maybe we could stay in contact, but distance ourselves.

Fast forward to Tuesday, I was talking to her and asked if she would be up for hanging out, I wanted to see to what degree I could have her in my life without it overstepping any boundaries, to which she said she definitely wanted to see me, but worried it might be something that would make me uncomfortable. I told her not to worry and we agreed to hangout Thursday, and that she'd find a place for us to go. I contacted her Wednesday evening to see where and what time she wanted to hangout, which she responded asking what time I'd be free and I told her, she saw the message, but never responded. Then yesterday, the day we were supposed to hangout, I message her to see if we were still good, but she ignored my message and left me hanging. She was the first one to view my snapchat story though, which I posted two hours later.

Should I tell her that what she did was disrespectful to me and that it hurt my feelings? I don't want to give her anymore of my time, when clearly she doesn't value it. I'm thinking that maybe I just wait till she reaches out to me and tell her not to worry about it, that she can make it up to me in person sometime.

33,"I was obese. Upon tipping the BMI scale at 31, I ended up losing 20kg  (45lbs). Now, at my current weight, I only have 20 more lbs to lose. But things are so bad. When I am on a strict diet, my weight drops too slowly. Also, due to decreased leptin from my weight loss, I get very strong cravings. These cravings are ruining my life, because I get depressed from giving in, as they're too strong. My depression results in me imagining my dream body, but then losing that, due to my fat man food mentality. 

I am still 20lbs away from my goal weight, but I want to quit junk food forever. I want my palate to reject these foods, like it already does with sugary drinks. 

I never want another craving again, or even if I do, to have power over them, because I'm so tired of this. I'm worried that this mounting frustration will lead me to become bulimic.

34,"I don't know where to turn for help anymore.. for context, two years ago it began with seemingly harmless symptoms, burning mouth, weight loss, elevated blood sugar, low potassium, sleep problems, wound healing problems and a whole list of more..

A month later my stomach also started acting up, in the matter of a few days I was bedridden, I was barely able to walk and constantly nauseaus, dizzy, headaches and got a fever after trying to walk to a nearby doctor. 

After a gastroscopy it turned out my stomach lining was very inflamed, I was put on medication, but nothing got better... the other symptoms got worse too, even new ones were added to the list, like incontinence.

My doctor can't find a cause for any of the symptoms.. so I was sent to a psychotherapist, but after 7 months, it hasn't gotten a bit better, if not even worse. I felt mentally great before my health started declining and stayed positive until just a few months ago, but I reached my limit..

A few days ago my mother got the idea to buy baby food for me as it shouldn't irritate my stomach.. some of the jars are alright, but two of them... made me feel just terrible, the first one I ate 3 days ago, it hat lemon and orange juice in it which I thought wouldn't be that much... the stabbing pain in my ribs came back and I got nauseaus for two days.. yesterday I ate a jar with ureed carrots, peas and potatos and it made my stomach feel so full... it was nothing but pressure on my stomach, then the nausea set in and I almost had to throw up.
Today, my stomach still felt like shit, I get nauseaus after everything I eat again, I mean, that is kind of normal since two years, but not that fast and that much...  sometimes I feel like throwing up and already feel the food coming back up...

I already am very underweight by now and now I can eat even less..  My mother still pushes me to eat more of them but this pain, stomach pressure and nausea is killing me.. she says I will get used to it, before I ate my veggies steamed, potatos and carrots like that with a little olive oil, gruel, bananas, egg with flour baked, dry toast, joghurt with oatmeal and applesauce.... stuff like that... 

I just feel so terrible and I don't know what to do anymore... this morning I already woke up with slight nausea...  My mother says that she will kick me out if I don't co-operate, she says I simply have to eat it, but she won't understand that I don't want this either, I don't know why this has happened to me, whatever it is, but she keeps thinking I had an eating disorder...

I jut want to be able to eat and live properly again, I want to eat something and not feel nauseaus or be in pain afterwards... even after eating plain bland stuff like gruel..",09Dec2017,2

All from hidden or masked #s (so we can not block the stalker). Stalker has begun to mail packages to SO's work place. 20+ gifts / packages (none of them have been opened / all returned)

The stalker has somehow found my info and has begun to tweet and make instagram posts w. my information. Stalker created a fundraiser on an online platform, to raise money to visit the city we live in so the stalker can ""save"" my partner from me, so that they can finally be married. 

Today's social media posts from the stalker seem to suggest that the stalker is suicidal and potential have attempted to kill themselves. There have been hundreds of posts over a 3 day time period. They may be in a hospital. Its escalating very quick and getting real scary.

42,"Hi everyone,

I don't understand how the insurance/provider/patient deal work. It just seem all sketchy and both insurances and providers are abusing the patients.

Anyways, here is what happened to me. A while ago I needed to get some x-ray work done as requested by my Dr. I was given a list of places to go. I called some of them and asked how much it would cost yo me. ""One step diagnostics"" told me that it would cost $170 if selfpaid and probably more if thru insurance (assuming the deductible wasn't met for the year). I didn't meet the annual deductible so I decided to self pay and just finish it clean, since you never know how bills follow after an insurance claim. I told them i wanna do selfpay and made an appointment.

For my appointment, I made to the facility, when I was signing in, I was asked about my insurance. I told them that I was going to self pay. They said ok. I was given some forms to fill out. I did fill out the forms and I didn't give them my insurance information. I was asked again to fill out the parts regarding the insurance info, when I returned the forms to the front desk. I told them again, I am doing a selfpay and I don't want to share my insurance info. They said ok again.

Here it gets interesting. A few weeks after, I received a notification from my insurance company that a claim had been processed. I checked my account. And it was ""one step diagnostics"". Despite what they told me and charged me at the selfpay rate, they still went ahead and claimed the service to my insurance without my authorization of using my insurance information. And the most interesting part, I paid less than $200 (selfpay rate), but they asked $2000 from the insurance company and settled on that.

Sorry keeping this post long. My questions are:

1) Can a medical facility use my insurance information without my authorization? If it cant, what can I do to protect my rights, bring this up with the department of health care, or bbb.org, or what?

2) How come a f.cking 5 minute x-ray work can be $2000 thru insurance. Don't tell me it is not the actual money they get from the insurance. it looks like insurance companies or medical facilities are laundering money by showing overpriced bills or saving tax?

And a comment : the healthcare is a corrupt system. It does not care about the health of people. All it cares is money and money and money. E.g. your provider tells you things like, or hey, look! you met all of your deductibles this year why don't we do a surgery on you. It is free.

Is it necessary? Or Is it mandatory? Or is it recommended? Nooo, it is just free.

I appreciate any insights on this subject or any suggestion on how to proceed.

43,"   This was not me but I was physically present to witness it. My friend and I are hanging out at his girlfriend's place, suddenly we get this weird vibe from her and she starts to look visibly upset. She walks off into her room and locks herself in there for about an hour and a half while we quietly wait outside for her to be ready to come out and talk. Now she's been known to have these random emotional episodes, usually triggered by the smallest thing, but this is the first time I was physically present to witness it.

   After about an hour and a half, she comes out, and begins to storm off with a duffle bag full of clothes, like she planned on moving out somewhere but we know that she doesn't have anywhere to go. So my friend chases after her, he puts a hand on her shoulder and tells her to wait up and she very angrily turns around and shouts ""let me go!"", being loud and causing a scene (it's 10 PM in a quiet suburban neighborhood). So we don't know what to do since she doesn't want to talk so he continues to follow her as she continues to angrily storm off towards the entrance of the neighborhood. Currently I'm staying back at the house while my friend is out chasing after her, they dont have their keys so someone needed to stay back. 

My question is, what would be the best course of action in this situation? Do we follow her? Let her be? Forcefully restrain her and bring her back to the house? If we follow her, for how long? We don't even know where she's walking.",09Dec2017,1

57,"This is a pretty detailed story, if i posted all of it it’d take forever to read lol. So here’s the (still kinda long) rundown:
I’ve been friends with this girl for around 3, almost 4 years. During the beginning year or so of the friendship, she was really sweet and just a nice person to me (and the others in our friend group). We were pretty close. 
Then she got a crush on my best friend, who i had been best friends with for a very long time, over 10 years. At first nothing came of it, but then they did start dating. It was really awkward at first. They are still dating which makes me an awkward third wheel quite frequently. (especially when they argue)

Anyway, i noticed this friend had been involved in quite a bit of ‘drama’ at school and was losing lots of other people she was previously friends with. This should’ve been a warning sign...

I did a lot for her, the biggest being starting a new job at the place she works. Because she “didn’t wanna work alone.” I needed a job, so i figured why not (i actually hate my job. oh well) 

She did a lot for me as well, which i do appreciate, dont get me wrong. 

She told us she was moving away and i cried because i didn’t want her to go. Come to find out, she wasn’t moving. It was just a prank. I was pissed at first but i figured, its just a joke, no big deal. 

Soon she started telling me sad stories about her life. About really REALLY serious stuff. And these made me feel sorry for her.
Come to find out, all of these were made up by her to get our attention. Even my mom started saying she seemed like a bad friend (thats when you know it’s serious 😂). And these were topics that shouldn’t be lied about. 

Anyway, i was dumb and forgave her even though i was mad and knew what she did was wrong. She had sent a long apology note which i fell for. 

A couple weeks ago, she posted a picture of me while we were at work. I had told her before to please not post any more, as i wasn’t particularly fond of it. She said she understood and she’d stop. Then she refused to delete the one she’d posted! She also said she’d never agreed to stop. She swore at me and my girlfriend (who was trying to help me) and told us to eff off, then blocked me on snapchat. 

We haven’t been talking at school or work because i’m mad at her. 

Now she keeps begging me to talk to her and is acting all nice (over text, not face to face.) and her girlfriend (still my best friend) is asking me to also. I don’t even want to be friends with her after all this, but now she’s saying (through her gf) she’ll save a spot for me at work tomorrow and that she just wants to talk. 
I don’t want to.

58,"So, I'm going to get a job soon to be able to pay for a plane ticket and other expenses to Europe this summer. However there's a problem; my parents won't let me.

When I'll be on my planned trip I'll be 16, but my parents think this is too young to travel alone. Though where I'd like to go we have quite a large number of family and friends, so I wouldn't be alone without them, just for the flight there and back.

Now, my dad's offered to take me there for a few weeks with him, but there's a problem with that. We fight very often, and us having to be together so much would only increase the amount we fight, thus ruining the trip. As well, he's also controlling when it comes to this stuff, he'd force me to be with him pretty much the entire time and dictate where I can go and what I can do (I'm not saying I don't want him to be there so I can party and stuff like that, just go to certain attractions and so on).

That would only be for about two weeks, not the two months I'd like. So I proposed I go there with him on his vacation, then he'd fly back and I spend the rest of the summer there before flying back too, but he shit this down as well.

Spending that amount of time in the culture and language would help me so much when it comes to learning it, and it'd just be a great experience overall for me. I'd get to meet my family, some friends, and see lots of cool stuff.

However there's another reason I want to go, and probably the largest: my girlfriend lives there. LDRs where you're 7500km away from eachother suck, and I mean *really* suck. As students we'd only get the summers to see each other, so I want to make the most out of this one with her before I don't get to see her for another year afterwards. I love this girl so much, she's extremely kind, caring, funny, and we have extremely similar interests. It just hurts to be away from her.

Of course, because of this my parents think I'm just going to go to her city for the entire time and have sex, but that's not what either of us want. Sure, I'd like to go visit her city and see stuff there, but there's so much more to see in my family's city that we'd both like to see. As for their second concern, neither of us are ready for sex, we just want to be *close* to each other for once (We'd be with my family, so supervision wouldn't be a problem if they need that extra sense of security).

So, is there anything I could possibly do to at least make my parents more open to the idea?

TLDR: I'm willing to pay for my own trip to Europe, parents think I'm too young and will just have sex with my girlfriend.

I hated high school and a lot of people say it gets better in college. Frankly, this was not much better. The work is very overwhelming for me and I have a hard time focusing and sitting still in class among other problems. 

College was not even my first choice of things to do. I wanted to join the Army but was disqualified because I have Asperger's and mental health issues and it still bothers me to this day that I can't join. Before that, I wanted to move to Europe but found out that I couldn't. It seems like all the things I want to do, I'm not allowed to do and college was a half-assed last resort. 

I'm not even entirely sure about what I want to do with my life. I know this sounds crazy, but I want to do something that involves being famous and having a legacy, something that is adventurous, and something that keeps the lights on. I moved to Florida from North Carolina a little over a year ago and I did not really have much of a choice in the matter because my parents would not let me stay in North Carolina by myself even though I didn't want to move.

Because of this, it feels like it's gonna take forever to progress, if I even can progress. I'm going to vent my shit-list of problems here, idk it's probably gonna be long but I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried everything. 

Sometimes I feel like my friends disrespect me

Sometimes I just break and start crying, feels really helpless and stress and horrible thoughts going through my head

thoughts of suicide, which I'm just not willing to tell my therapist for fear of my dad being told or me getting put in a mental hospital 

I've got this borderline inability to socialize, I can't talk to people unless they've made a first move in some way or if I met them while with people who already broke that ""shell"" for lack of a better word 

Did I mention I might be trans? Oof well now I did. Not that it matters, as most people probably won't accept me anyways, and my self hate kinda makes me feel being misgendered/misunderstood 24/7 is right. I deserve to feel like shit. 

I keep having reoccurring dreams where I'm back living with my abusive mother. 
They're so realistic and horrible, I've actually cried upon waking up before because I'm so glad it wasn't real and yet so upset that my own brain keeps making me go through this- and I'm not the type of person that cries easily 

Was I even abused. Who's to blame, maybe this is all my fault and I deserve it 

Probably some mysoginistic feelings, my theory is it could relate to my childhood, but also how I am uncomfortable that people group me with them when I know I am not 

Or maybe I'm just delusional? 

I feel like my life isn't going how I wish it could, but I don't know what I want. It's just not this. So much of what I'm learning feels forced and meaningless. 

Actually, living in general feels meaningless. I don't care about future generations enough to care if I go down in history, but just living a short 100 years and being forgotten feels meaningless. Meaning is what you make it, purpose is what you want it to be, but I don't feel anything worth considering it as a ""purpose"" or anything thing valuable enough to have ""meaning"" 

Sometimes i like the idea of false realities. It's nice to pretend things like people who really don't know you are as close to you as you feel, and in the end, even if it's fake, the feelings are real 

I hate myself and care too much about what others think. Yeah, you can say ""well stop caring"", but i wish it was so simple. 

I wanna accept I have stuff like depression etc (if I actually have it), but the idea of that seems overused/cliche, and I also don't wanna sound like I have a victim mentality 

No one cares unless you conform to the way they like to hear you talk,  but by doing this you only become one of them 

I'm short and I hate how effeminate it makes me appear. Hate my body in other ways too ofc. 
&gt;sometimes I feel like I might need surgery and it scares me 

My stepmom can set me off. I don't show it ofc. I hate when she blasts the same 11 songs over and over, when she's on edge yet pretends she isn't, sometimes even her humming makes me feel stressed-like. Agitated maybe? It's not as bad as when she said things like ""your dad picked me"" and ""you're like your mom"" but it still is stressful 

My ex is a whole another issue. I wish it wasn't, but if I'm being honest, I guess trivial stuff like relationships are upsetting me too. 
I miss them. 

Sometimes I wonder if the pills are worth it or not

Procrastination sucks too. 

I can't even fall asleep till 10 pm, sometime later, like 2am

I overthink things that probably have no solution anyways. With this many problems, it feel like there's really no point in trying to save myself

--

I don't know what to do anymore, there's too many problems. I tried being optimistic and forcing myself to get ""help"" but it's bullshit. No matter how much I talk about things, nothing changes. I still barely talk, I still am stressed almost every second, I still cope with the stress by imagining myself dead, and I can't forget anything. 
I just want it to stop. I'm sorry this is so long and edgy sounding but what the hell am I supposed to do? I'm powerless 


TLDR; I'm a piece of shit with lot of issues, but if I'm being honest, there's probably nothing anyone can do to help me. I just want to write this to pretend there is I guess. ",09Dec2017,7
63,"My mom was admitted two days ago to Headwaters Hospital in Orangeville Ontario Canada, with a resting heart rate of over 160bpm and o2 sat of 91%.

They discharged her and she had to call my grandpatents *to help walk her to her car* becase even after being on oxygen for two days, she *still* isnt strong enough to stand on her own two feet.

My Mom is 45 years old, physicaly fit (ex boxer), with a history of heart problems, blood clotting, immuno compromise, she even had a brief bout with cancer. 

These fucks couldnt even GUESS as to what went wrong and after being on o2 for two days they go ""well you're okay now"". In what world is an otherwise healthy, physicaly fit woman not being able to muster the strength to stand ""okay"". 

To me, this screams ""not okay"". If it was your mom who suddenly couldn't breathe, couldn't stand and felt like her heart was going to explode, would you feel comfortable with her being discharged still showing some of the same symptoms?

Guys I feel helpless. What can I do? I feel like going on a rampage. I wish I was strong enough to scream down every one of those doctors and make them keep her until they had at least SOME idea of what went wrong and how to fix it.

64,"My girlfriend is diagnosed with depression, but seems to have a lot more going on than that. My guess is BPD, but I am not in a position to speculate. She regularly has bouts of extreme emotional distress where she cannot control herself, and has hated her (single) mother for a very long time for various reasons that I find to be fairly invalid (aligning with the view that everyone hates her, nobody wants her around, etc.). Recently she had a fight with her mother that escalated to a physical altercation (started by her, not her mother), and her mother has said she is not allowed to come back to her home, knowing full well that she has basically nowhere to go and has a mental disorder.

She is living with me currently, but has no job, no money, and no one else that will take her in, as well as basically no plans for the future, or the present for that matter. She will be safe here for awhile, but my parents are not in a position to take in another adult for an indefinite period of time. I initially suggested that she be temporarily admitted to a mental rehabilitation facility, and that maybe she would be able to return home if she did so, but she responded to that very negatively and has assured me that she will do no such thing.

She is relatively stable most of the time, though she does have her fits of irrational behavior and extremely magnified emotional distress, as well as suicidal thoughts and self-harm, though she has said she would never commit suicide as long as I am still around. She has never been in therapy, except for a few appointments with a school therapist that she feels she cannot reveal all to because he would be obligated to report her suicidal thoughts to the police.

She has been looking for a job for a long time, applying to places online, but has never gotten anything back from any of her potential employers, and has not actually went around in person to apply to places. And when I say she has no money, I mean none. $0.

I really have no idea how I can sufficiently help her in this situation, or how she can help herself. Becoming mentally healthy is a priority, as I don't think she will be able to stick around here for long or hold a job if her state does not improve. Also, her mental state has an effect on mine as well, and I am becoming increasingly worried that she will not get a job and not leave my house anytime soon.

I am not ready to be living with a significant other full-time, yet here I am. 

I apologize for the length and disorganization of this post, but we are in a very tight situation and for both of our sakes, we must figure out what we are going to do.

Any advice is very much appreciated.",09Dec2017,1

He also at random times turns the internet off because he feels like it (only when im in a competitive match of CS:GO, his passive agressive way of telling me not to play video games). Im never tired at 10pm and just lie in bed angry. This is the main problem. Ive tried countless times to convince him but nothing helps. another thing. nothing is ever good enough and its so frustrating. I work 4 nights a week at my local hockey rink, and do a shit ton of chores,  I cook most of my own meals, and stuff like that. But yet I still have my internet censored (it blocks porn which sucks so much) and I have my internet cut off every night. Then theres my mom. I love my mom. She works a lot and makes all the money for us. My dad just stays at home. I know they will divorce once I graduate because they clearly dont like eachother. Thats not the issue though. My dad is mean to my mom and completely unsupportive. He yells at her for not doing enough even though shes sick (wageners disease). It makes me sad because she doesnt deserve this. My mom would get fucked in the divorce, and i just feel stuck. I hate complaining because I know people who have it way worse and I think to myself that I should just shut up but I need help.

72,"Before I begin I just want to thank anyone who takes the time to read all of this. I'm going to start from the beginning, so please bear with me.

It all started one day when my mom came running into the house, not accompanied by my step-dad, after going out with him for a few drinks at their favorite bar. I was playing video games when she came in, and didnt think anything of it. Then, about 15 minutes later, my step-dad comes barreling in accusing my mother of cheating on him. My mother scooped up all of my siblings and I, 7 of us (im the oldest), and we got in the car and drove away. We had no shoes or money. My mother has done this before, hence the reasoning behind my parent's divorce. She does not work; child support and my step-dad's credit card is her only source of income. Naturally, I assumed she really messed up this time due to the fact that she now potentially has to raise 7 kids on just child support, but only recieves money for 6 of us being that my youngest brother is my mom's and step-dad's child. I was infurated, and in my opinion and many others, rightfully so. When we pulled into the Chilles parking lot for my mother to text my step-father to reason with him, about 20 minutes from our house, i immediately messaged my girlfriend to pick me up. I regret this, because i feel as though I abandoned my family. I did leave my mother my debit card so she can get my siblings dinner that night. After I had to walk through the parking lot barefoot, i recieved a text from my mother calling me a ""loser drug addict whos not welcomed in her home ever again"".

I should clarify what my mother meant by, ""drug addict"". I do smoke weed. I have never brought weed into my parents home, and have never came home high. At that point in time, I had only smoked a few times in my life. They would search my phone every single night for the past 4 years, thats how they found out.

I stayed at my girlfriends house for 3 days until my school got involved and made me go back home. While at my girlfriends, my parents accused me of smoking crack, completely drained my bank account like they've done in the past to spend the money on themselves, and threatened to call the police on my girlfriends parents for kidnapping me, using the fact that my step-dad's a police officer as a scare tactic e.g. he has pull in the police department and could get my girlfriends parents in a lot of trouble. All they did was feed me, dive me to school, gave me shoes to wear, and a place to sleep. I should also clarify that the situatuon between my mother and step-father was a misunderstanding; she didn't cheat on him. I jumped the gun and I regret that with all my heart.

I went back home the following Wednesday. While home i was ignored, and clearly the whole house resented me.

That following Friday, after a screaming match with my mother, i was told i'd be living with my father, 30 minutes away from my school. I've been here since.

I've had zero contact with my mother, and only a few messages to my step-dad.

It's been two months. They refuse to give me any of my belongings or any of my money back.

My step-dad has even messaged my girlfriend on several occasions just to tell her how much of a loser I am and that she can do so much better than me.

They've locked me out of my bank account and have even made it so I can not cash my checks from work anymore.

I've been told by several adult figures that what they did, and are still continuing to do, is illegal. I'm a minor, they can't kick me out. They have no right to keep my belongings and I should go back home with a police officer to get said belongings. Or, being that I'm a minor and by law that's my home, just walk in and get my belongings and walk out. 

I love my family, despite all that they've done to me. Getting the police involved is the last thing i want to do, even though they've threatened to call the police on me numerous times. But it has gotten to a point where I feel as though I have no other option. I'm even about to be kicked out of school because i'm required to have a phsyical every year and my mother snd step-father refuse to give my father my insurance information.

Please, if anyone can shed light onto what exactly i can do please tell me. And if more information is needed, do not hesitate to ask.

Thank you all so much,

Dominic

78,"I found my SO’s alternate reddit account they used for viewing porn. I found it when they forgot to log out of it and commented on one of my comments. I found out the kinds of things they are into and it has made me feel self conscious and slightly disgusted. It is nothing morally wrong though, it just bothers me because I am far from what that stuff is.  

When I confronted them about it they flat out lied to my face and gave me a weak excuse as to how it wasn’t theirs (“don’t remember doing any of that stuff”) They admitted to everything eventually and even admitted to talking to some of the people who post in the NSFW subs, like speaking sexually to them. All of this went on behind my back since our relationship started.

We have a very specific problem in our sex life where we both agreed to stop masturbating so sex would be more satisfying for the both of us, but all of this means that they have been masturbating behind my back. 

With our agreement, the lying, the talking sexually to people that are not me, I find it hard to move forward and not hold any resentment. When I am reminded of it all I get a sinking feeling in my stomach and my chest tightens. I just want to learn how to move past this so I can be happy again.

81,"I work for a staffing company through a Jewish catering business. We do all kinds of parties, but yesterday we assisted with an office holiday party. We had an open bar set up, and throughout the night, the owner of the company was pounding back drinks. I kept hearing how the owner was harassing the 2 female bartenders so eventually they just left the party. My boss put me on the bar for the final 2 hours of the party. There were about 6 people still downing drinks at this point, including the owner. This guy didn't want it to go unknown that he was a billionaire so he kept flashing his money. He proceeded to grab my chin and call me beautiful and i just smiled and made him his drink. He then kept asking me if I like to sleep with billionaires and that I look like the type of girl that likes to. He was also telling me what he liked to do sexually for the next 2 hours and would motion himself (sorry I don't know how to make this sound tasteful) but cumming* on me. I just kind of smiled and didn't respond but I would change the subject and ask him questions about his company.

84,"I’m the biggest asshole you will ever meet. I make fun of everyone, even my friends. I act like I don’t care, by taking 2 hours to respond, or ignoring the things around me and staring at my phone.

Deep down I’m just an awkward kid, a kid that doesn’t know how to behave normal. A kid that can’t to talk to people normally. A kid that likes weird things, like learning about space, mythology, and jazz.

By the way, I’m a 15 year old Sophomore boy.

I have sort of built up this defensive personality shield to defend against my awkwardness and insecurities. I think it has worked, as no one makes fun of me anymore. I don’t know what I’d do without this shield. I can’t function without it. I’d just be an awkward kid with no confidence.

With my shield on, if someone tries to make conversation with me, I make fun of them or give little response. Around my friends, we all just screw around and make fun of each other. I’ve lost a lot of my friends with weirder, more unique personalities. I’ve either distanced myself because I don’t want to be made fun of for hanging around them, or have bullied them away from me.

In middle school, I was just an awkward boy with very little friends. I started hanging out with this group of people and all they did was make fun of each other, ruthlessly. They made me feel insecure about everything. One time I told them that I liked listening to jazz music and they were ruthless. They mocked me every day and made me feel like shit. I never told them anymore things that seemed out of the ordinary after that. I slowly became one of them, and by the beginning of high school, I was the asshole I am now.

As you can see, I’m really confused. I’m slowly losing more and more of my friends. I fear that soon, all I’ll have left is my asshole friend group, and I fear that only having them left to hang out with will make it all worse.",09Dec2017,1

Before I got married I was self sufficient, 2 jobs, own place/car, no kids etc. once we got married we pcs’d to ft hood very far away from home state of nc. It didnt take long before we were miserable we argued alot, we had alot of issues I think they came from not really being ready to get married like we thought we were and all the new pressure we both were under. My husband eventually decided we should take a break from living together, he wanted me to move back home  so he could get his self in a better head space because he does have ptsd. I was extremely upset and reluctant to go, But i had nobody in texas and I didnt know my rights. We argued and I was extremely hurt and upset and I honestly still am. I gave up everything to be with him where was I suppose to live? What was I suppose to do for money? I felt like you were kicking me out but didn’t offer me a dollar and still hasn’t to this day. 

But I missed home I was miserable there so I left. I was able to stay with family and was able to eventually get both jobs back. My life eventually went pretty much back to normal. We are still married, I saw no improvements at first, but I am starting to after 5 months. I believe he love me in his own selfish way. I do think he tries sometimes. I dont think he is cheating on me even thought I cant see him. We began to discuss me moving back but i was very apprehensive about it. I already gave up my life once for you, im angry I have to do it again. But I was still willing to consider it. We planned on getting me back there during Christmas break. Then last week we found out about a deployment for April. Im not mad at him I know he can’t control that at all, but theres almost no point in going back now. Im so frustrated with this whole situation. I feel like to much is getting thrown at me in such a short period of time. I dont know if we can survive another year of this. I never wanted to be long distance thats why we got married in the first place. Im tried of being married and feeling alone. Im tired of sleeping alone I’m tired of feeling single. And im tired of not getting any marriage perks lol. I feel like its over before we ever had a change to try. 

I figured there would be times we would be apart but not so soon and not this long. I don’t know if I should go back to texas. I dont know if I should stay in nc and try to make it threw this deployment. Should I just accept this is my marriage even thought im unhappy. Is this really marriage? Husband maintains he wants to make it work, and hes trying. But he also had not and still hasn’t given up anything for it to work either.

95,"Recently, my dad has set the router to disconnect at night. He just unplugs it out of
pure spite if he hears me Skyping. (I'm using Mobile Hot-spot right now)
I had tried to believe so many times that his controlling behavior was just to
""look out"" for me. 

But for years now, he has been helicopter-""parenting"" me and he yells that it's 
always for my ""own good"".
He's called me so many names....

he's called me a bitch, a leech (even though he told me *not* to get a job in the past and now he's mad that I did what he said), he's looked through all of my boxes 
when I wasn't looking, he's looked through my things and re-arranged my room when I wasn't looking, he put spyware on my computer when I was 17, ....the list.goes.on.

""He's ruining my life"" is a very cliche ""teen quote"". That quote also feels like a fucking understatement.
 But, it's so crippling to feel that your parents are a major setback.
I hate it.
I know they mean well but...

When my dad dropped me off to college, he just looked at me when I got out of the car and said ""Oh man, I wish I was you.. I wanna take classes""

Then, I decided to go into a modeling audition. I thought it'd be fun. Just something for myself, not too serious. The manager loved me and said he wanted me back.
I was hesitant to go because I knew I had to get my dad to drive me there. And he always acts 'over-involved'. He either critizises everything, or comments on everything I do.
After that audition, he was so happy and said ""HEY I LOOKED UP ALL OF THE POSES FOR MODELS AND RUNWAYS SO I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO WALK."" (like, who tf asked you?)
It was supposed to involve me only.
It felt...like....""what's the point in doing this anymore. I feel so much hatred, I can't even enjoy this anymore. Just because he got involved.""

I cried for so long after that.

So from then, I just chose to do what I liked in secret. If I like something, I keep it a secret. I put on a poker-face when he's around since he doesn't like me 
expressing something negative. If I roll my eyes or frown, he takes it as an offense and threatens to kick me out (I wish I was exaggerating).

I wear headphones almost all the time, because he can't critizise what he can't hear. So if I wear headphones, at least he won't ruin music for me.

Then, my mom said that the pianist in the church saw that I had interest in piano, and told my mom to ask me if I wanted to learn for free.
I've always had a knack for (and loved) music and art, so I said yes. 
My dad had to drive me there and he saw the pianist's studio and everything. The pianist was focused on me, and my dad was focused on how I talked to the pianist
(he likes to contro- I mean, ""comment"" on how I talk to people as well).

*When my dad was driving me back home, he told me the story of how, ""When I was 6 years old, my dad wanted to win a big organ in a raffle but he didn't win. So he
bought me a a toy one instead. I wanted to learn so badly but couldn't. All these years I wanted to learn piano but couldn't.""....he is 53 now. I'm pretty sure if he really
wanted to learn *that* seriously all of those years, he would have bought at least a keyboard piano instead of a big-screen TV, spyware (not sure if he bought that
or not), and other things. He just suddenly remembered his huge interest in piano when *I* went to take classes for it.

So when he knocked on my door to ask, ""Hey...I have a question. I decided to do something for myself for once. And practice the piano. Because when I'm 70 and go blind,
I want to play the piano in churches and get payed. So I was wondering if you found the adapter for the piano so I can borrow it meanwhile I'm not at work.""
(The keyboard piano needs the adapter in order to work). I was mildly in shock but then annoyed. Then majorly disturbed. I didn't know what to think. And I still don't know


""I think it's time that I look out for myself for once."" I feel so digsusting and selfish for thinking that. 
I know it's a good thing to think about myself for once, but it's been so ingrained in my mind that it's supposed to be a bad thing.

But hearing him ruin something I love, feels like 
It feels like the piano isn't even something that's mine anymore. Or if I played any piano. I just feel guilty when I press the keys. I hate it.

I feel like I want to fucking cut myself or hurt myself really badly. Or do something violent (of course I won't , jail isn't worth going into for a lilb!tch)
Because my main two outlets (music and the internet) have been taken away from me.


I love modeling, playing the piano, drawing, singing, 

but....
on the modeling..whenever I think about it. I get flashbacks and an impulse that feels like rage. (I don't express it, of course. I've gotten used to not expressing anything..only in my writing)
I desperately don't want the same thing to happen with the piano just by hearing him practice. He mentally tortured me and now he wants to learn what I have been

""Can't you move with your mom?""- I'd rather not move in with someone who used to hit me.

I just want to find ways on how to cope a little better in this hurricane.
I just want to know that I'm not crazy for
not wanting to lend my dad the piano.
Or selfish, or bad..I've already been guilt-tripped almost all my life for petty shit. But this feels more than personal. I don't want the piano ruined for me just by hearing him play (I hate him that much).
This is someone I hate, messing with something I love. 
He suddenly wants to do the thing that he bitched at me for, and asked to borrow my piano after recently setting the router to disconnect at night.
(And no, he won't bargain. If I ask if he can bring the wifi back in exchange, he'll have a fit.)

Should I feel guilty for playing the piano in secret and pretending I haven't found the adapter, for my own personal sanity?",09Dec2017,2
96,"I'm wanting to get in contact with my dad. I haven't met him before and I'm not sure if he knows I exist. From the information my mum has given me I've been able to find his address, phone number and place of work (not sure if his workplace is current). When I was around 15 I called his house and his wife picked up, when I told her I thought her husband was my dad she hung up. This encounter has stopped me from getting in contact with him because I'm worried if I write or call, she'll hear/see it first and may not pass anything on to him. I'd prefer to contact maybe an aunt or uncle on his side but my mum said he changed his first and last name by deed poll before I was born so it's hard to find anything about him other than his address and what my mum has told me. What would be the best way to get in contact with him?",09Dec2017,2

98,"My dog, Shotzie, is a pomeranian and 10 years old. I've pretty much grown up with the little guy. He has horrible separation anxiety with both me and my mom. He goes crazy when either of us are gone for just an *hour*. 

When I move (next month) I'm not sure when I'm even going to see him again. This won't be his first time being without me for a long time, though... Last year my mom moved off to Texas with him while I stayed with a friend to graduate high school... and that was about 5 months. Apparently he would constantly howl at the doors and go apeshit. When I finally moved out here, he acted like he didn't even recognize me.

I know it seems kinda weird, having a moral dilemma over an old pomeranian, but this dude has always been there for me and it sucks to feel like I'm about to abandon him. I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm asking for honestly. This is something I really want to do - my brother is going to film school and opportunity is literally falling at his feet.

99,"So naturally this would sound like the typical “Oh no my parents are evil and they never let me have fun!” On the contrary my parents are very fair and fairly chill often times. They have their “old people” moments, but I’ve learned to not question stubborn people anymore.

The problem I have is we have an extremely tight knit family, and I really love that and how close we are. But it’s also like they expect me to be home 24/7. Like I can’t even imagine living a life outside of home which I honestly have been really craving these past couple years.

Not because I’m trying to get out, but I want to start to build outside of my family and that requires time outside with people. 
And once that happens they just ask me a shit ton of questions and it just feels like I’ll forever have a tracker on my back. 

I’ve just gotten used to rarely going out at all because I’m so exhausted of all the suspiciousness. I just play my instruments and keep up with my hobbies and occasionally will see a friend.

It’s gotten to the point where I genuinely feel a disconnect from certain friends because they’re able to just go out and BE, they don’t have parents breathing down their necks every second. And even if they do, their parents actually have stuff to do.

Mine just stay at home or do their personal family interests, not much friend time.

It’s just that all my friends are out having fun and asking me to come out. At like times of around 7-8 at night which is fine for me but I would get a fucking headache just from them being like “oh my god it’s so late” “that’s so stupid” “you’re wasting your time” “do something productive instead”. I just can’t win.

And I know you guys are gonna be like “Act more mature to prove yourself”. 
Yea that’s what I’ve been doing for three years straight. All it did was bring us closer but they’re still as close minded, almost more.

What do I do? I want to balance the two because I definitely don’t want to ruin what I have with my parents.

How do I make them realize I need to be part of the community.

103,"I'm a 14 year old male. My mind is a mess and I have no idea how to possibly help myself. I have low self esteem, no motivation to do anything, crippling depression and anxiety, am overweight, obsessive, have no shame and I'm just kind of a prick. I spend most of my time alone doing absolutely nothing, I don't bother trying academically, I don't feel as though I have any proper friends, I can't bring myself to trust anyone, I both underemine myself and inflate my own ego spontaneously, and I certainly don't fit in with anybody. I almost always refuse help whenever it's offered, and as I write this I feel like I'm asking too much of anyone here, because I want to try to turn my life around.  

My main problem is that I don't care really. The main difference between me and other people with similar issues, is that others issues stem from other peoples opinions of them. I just realised I can't live up to what my own thoughts of myself. My ego was always inflated as I child, because I was at a much higher level academically. Which then caused me to stop trying, so I kind of stayed at said level, and that causes problems for me now. I just hate what I turned myself into, and I can't fix it myself. I try meditation and such, but I can't focus on anything. I'm always distracted by something, so everything I do now is either incomplete or half assed. I know that this will ruin my future, but there is still time for me, which is why I'm seeking advice, because god knows I can't just think of it by myself. Thank you in advance.",09Dec2017,3
105,"Hey guys! So, I'm a young guy who's now a third year in college. I've been doing fairly well, failed some classes in the past but retook them. However, I was in a huge slump this year. I've had depression since high school, and have managed to do okay until now, but this semester it hit me hard, and I've failed three out of my five classes. I was at a cumulative GPA of 2.6, but with my calculations after this semester it'll drop down below 2.0: I'll be on academic probation. At my school it won't affect my financial aid unless I'm on probation for more than two semesters, so it's not too huge of a problem unless I don't get good grades next semester. 

Now, I'm going to visit my parents during the winter break soon, and usually they ask me how my grades are and how my semester went. They know that I've failed classes in the past, but they don't know anything about my depression. The school won't tell them about my academic probation and they never send my grades to them, though I know they're going to ask me how my semester went. How should I go about this? If they ask me how my semester went, should I tell them the truth, even if they won't hear about my grades from the school? I was planning on seeing a therapist once I'm back from break. I'm handling my depression a lot better now, and I don't want them to worry about me and I don't want to kill the mood when I'm there. I'm sorry if this isn't entirely coherent.",09Dec2017,2
106,"I haven’t talked to them in about 5 years. We used to be super close, but I was a terrible friend. I treated them like crap, I was super needy, and very selfish amongst other shitty tendencies towards them.

When they got with their SO, I was jealous and took it out on them, and continued to treat them even more poorly, along with a constant complaint of how shitty my life was. Basically without consciously doing so, because I was miserable I wanted to drag them down and make them as miserable as me. I was definitely the crab at the bottom of the bucket. After a while my jealousy got too bad, and decided I didn’t want to be friends with them(I still wanted to be friends, but I also didn’t want them to have anybody else besides me), which really upset them. Even though I was so shitty to them, they still valued my friendship, while I didn’t value theirs. I knew this would happen, and at the time I wanted to try and hurt them.

A couple years ago, I tried to contact them again and my message was read, but they didn’t respond. The message I sent was a basic “what’s up, how are you” like message, didn’t really put any effort into it. After growing up over the years, getting in a better place mentally and hearing stories from people on the other side of the same kind of situation, I have come to the conclusion, I really owe this person an apology.

One problem in my head is, I would really like them back in my life, but I am not sure if that will ever be possible again. Did I mention I was pretty shitty to them? Now I think I still owe them an apology, but I am not sure how I would feel, if they don’t respond again, or even worse(maybe not) they flat out tell me to leave them alone, which would be fair, but not what I am hoping for.

They now have a family, and have their own thing going on. I know the friendship will never be what it used to be, so do I just leave them alone? Or do I send the apology?(the apology is already written out) I have anxiety about what may happen. I am trying not to be too concerned about my own feelings in this(but am still worried) but I am just not sure if I should interrupt their life like this. Maybe they have moved on, and I’ll just bring back bad memories for them. Maybe they will want to know I am sorry, maybe they won’t care.

I have been typing this out for the last few hours, trying to figure out what to say here, now it’s a lot later than expected, I am not sure if I’ll get any response, might repost in the am, might not lol

107,"I need advice. I love my boyfriend very much but he is an alcoholic it exhausts me. I have asked him to change, many times. We have had the conversation and almost broke up about it many times. I would also consider myself an alcoholic but not to the extent he is as I want to change, and often I just drink to cope with his drinking. You can always find him at a bar, I feel like I hardly get to be around him not drinking. He leaves work early to drink. He gets sloppy drunk often, and is not a pleasure to deal with. Earlier this month, I came home and found him passed out drunk but cords cut up and all over that he later tells me he tried to hang himself with. After a long talk, he said he didn't want to do it again and didn't seem to be a risk to himself. 
 Today, he jumped out of bed this morning and said he was going to get some gatorades from the store and would be back in ten minutes. He leaves for hours and I know he exactly where he's at-the bar. I message him after a couple hours and no response. Feeling so frustrated, my mind returns back to breaking up with him. Not long ago, I tried to break up with him because the Alcohol and he begged me to give him another chance. Feeling completely exhausted because this whole week he has been on a bender and been a pain to deal with as I try to study for my finals... leaving me depressed and exhausted. Anyway, so he returns from the bar and I'm pissed at him because I've been messaging about telling him to come home so I can have my car back that he took so I can go somewhere. I hardly say anything and get in the car to leave. I come back, he is passed out drunk, and then I notice it again, cut up wires and a stool. I wake him up and he tells me he tried but the wire broke... I am sick and I freak out and I call in sick to work for both of us for the evening and tell him I am taking him in to the hospital. He refuses to go and said we will go in the morning. We continue to have a conversation about where he is at mentally and he pretty much says he will never be happy and wants to be alone. There are arguments about me leaving him alone (I want to keep an eye on him) and me threatening to call an ambulance to take him in. He tells me if I call an ambulance that he will tell them that I'm lying and I threatened to kill him. I tell him he's crazy. He keeps asking me to leave to go buy and bring him alcohol so he can relax and sleep. Basically things get heated and I say that I give up if he's not going to let me help him and that I can't be responsible for him and I can't be with him if he refuses to be happy and how tired of the alcohol I am. He is also saying how we should break up and it's mutual. I keep telling him how he needs to get help.... I can't stand around while he kills himself slowly with alcohol or walking in on a bunch of cords. It's fucking aweful. But at the same time, how can I leave someone who is going through awful depression and alcoholism? I feel awful as I got upset and maybe didn't say the right things. I don't know what to do. At all.

117,"Hi! I'm an 18-year-old girl in my first year at an art college, and my family isn't doing well financially. I wanted to get a job so that I could help them out so that they don't have to keep giving me money every week. 

I love anime and Japanese culture, and I have ever since I was in middle school. Recently, going to an anime convention, I noticed a ""maid cafe"" advertising their company and I decided to check it out. If you don't know what a maid cafe is, it's basically a cafe where cute girls in maid dresses serve you food and socialize with you, call you ""master"" or ""princess"", and they also sing, dance, and generally entertain. I got the job, and was super happy about it.
 
The maid cafe does livestreams to promote the job, and somehow during today's, my first one, my mom found out and watched the entire thing. She doesn't like the sexual connotations of the maid outfits, the use of the word ""master"", and the fact that some of the maids were acting flirty or making sexual jokes to be funny or cute, or just get more money out of the viewers. She wants me to quit, and threatened to stop paying my college tuition if I don't. She's stubborn, and won't listen to a word I say about how the job has safety precautions to prevent anything bad happening, how it's not explicitly sexual, and how I enjoy the job and I'd rather be doing this than any ""normal"" college job, like retail or waiting tables. 
She's talking to the manager and the main maid of the cafe tomorrow, and they will be trying to convince her that this job is safe, but I don't know what else to do.

Thank you for reading. Please give any suggestions on what I can say to potentially change her mind.",09Dec2017,6

122,"💐 Tl;dr (Short story) 💐  16 living in emotionally/mentally abusive household. Want to stay with dad (abuser) to get him to pay for uni, but desperate to leave and live somewhere else (with boyfriend's family). Don't know what to do. Either go through another couple years of abuse or possibly be in a bad financial situation and be in debt (due to hex?? Uni fees program) from a very young age...

💐 The long story 💐
Hello everyone, I'm 16 F from Australia and in desperate need of advice. I live in an abusive household. My dad is emotionally and mentally abusive, and my mum refuses to leave because she wants to be with me AND she does nothing to stop the abuse. Although she cops the worst of it, I get it too. Not only that, but when my dad goes after her I feel the pain from it as well... Anyway... Usually the household is good, but when it turns bad, that's when I remember that I absolutely HAVE to leave!! And now, here is my problem.

Obviously dad doesn't want me to leave, he's always saying I can stay and what not but because of how horrible he is I want to leave. Need to. I have an amazing, supportive boyfriend and his family have offered, practically BEGGED for me to stay at their place (they know about the abuse). It's a great offer, but here is why I always shut it down and what I need advice for!! 

I want to go into uni and my dad has a stack of money that could pay for that. I want to stay with him until I get him to pay for my university fees, however the way he treats me has a toll on my emotional well-being and strains my relationship with my boyfriend. 
OR I can save my mentality and have a happy, healthy life with my boyfriend and just  leave in 2019 (Gap year) or you know, 2020 (In uni course) or even 2018! (Year  12) however, I'm not sure if this is the best financial decision, because I really don't have to be in debt.

An other question! My dad always tells me the horror stories of renting, share houses, debt ECT... But could anyone tell me what it's like for them, what being in debt it, how you got out? What it's like to rent for uni, or you know, someone tell me about the hex??? Program and how you're dealing with it. 

Any advice for things I could do would help! Also a little information below just in case y'all ask for it in comments.

No, I don't have a job. Have been looking for one. Hopefully getting one in year 12 and working through gap year. 

I can definitely see my boyfriend and I lasting... It's going to be two years in May next year. 

I'm terrified of the thought of renting and having debt at such a young age. (Although a share house sounds alright.) This idea was drilled into my head by my dad so I don't know what else to think or do. 

Please tell me your stories of how you got into uni, thank you.

So we sent an email to the leasing office. They returned an email to let us know that my girlfriends room was filled 30 minutes after she put in her intent to vacate. 

No problem right? They dropped the ball and my friend is in a double room. So just let my friend into my room and send this third kid to my friends old room.

Nope they won’t do that. They said I have to contact this kid and ask him if he’s fine moving into the room. 

Okay..... so I email this kid. He says no problem moving to the other room he just wants an email from the Roomate of my friend to see if they’d be a good match. 

Bitch what? First of all you never emailed me to see if we’d be a good match. I didn’t even know of your existence until I had to contact the leasing office because they couldn’t handle their shit. 

Okay so my friend and I talk to my friends Roomate. We let him know neither way does my friend plan to reside their next semester and that he’s going to get a new Roomate either way but he can help everyone out if he just emails this new resident who was assigned my room. 

Nope my friends current Roomate won’t send the email and is under the impression my friend is going to reside with him next semester since he can’t break the lease. 

Furthermore what very much pisses me off is that the leasing office has a period to renew your room before General applications for next year. 

If you’d like to keep your room you can request to keep it and they let you keep it. My girlfriend and I have lived in this room for 2 years now no issue.  With this kid coming in he however can request to keep this room. Since he is a current resident the leasing office said he has priority over my girlfriend who is studying abroad. 

If he chooses to keep this room then I will be forced out of priority application since I will have to apply with my girlfriend to keep her as a Roomate. Thus giving up our apartment of two years. This wouldn’t be a problem with my friend moving here as he is not living in these apartments next year and will not be requesting to keep the same room. 

I am so pissed off at this incident I consider moving however that’s not a possibility. Aid and Scholarships can pay for school housing so to go to school and live here my girlfriend and I pay 4K each a year. If we found an apartment cost would jump up to 16K a year per person. 

Even though my aid covers these apartments they are still getting $900 a month from me. It is ridiculous I pay them handsomely and cannot chose my Roomate. I am forced to live with someone who doesn’t match my life style with no cares from the leasing office. 


Thanks for listening to my vent I needed to get that off my chest. I’m on mobile sorry for any spelling or grammar. ",09Dec2017,6
134,"I've noticed this trend since I've been taking public transport, and every so often you get some shitty people. 

In a normal situation, you could just remove yourself and be the better person, but on a bus, you're stuck in a confined space and forced to endure the abuse until you get to your destination. 

The other day I had a middle-aged sober man lose his temper with a twenty-something young man who snuck onto the bus without paying. I could understand his frustration, but he kept on confronting the younger guy who clearly had no intention of never sneaking onto buses again. This led to a fight between the two of them that resulted in the bus driver stopping at the nearest bus stop and refusing to drive until they resolved their differences and calmed down (which pretty much collectively fucked every other passenger over). I had some women run down to me and sit beside me because they felt safe near me. Nobody actually cared that the middle-aged man had merit to his frustration, they were all pissed off that he was ''making a big deal over nothing''. 

Another time, there was an abusive middle-aged woman who was being outright racist and verbally assaulting anyone who wasn't white. All the passengers seemed clearly confused on what their rights were. Should we kick her out?... Should we politely reason with her?... Should we fight fire with fire? 

There seems to be no clear answer. When someone steps in, it usually escalates the issue. People would rather put up with the verbal abuse so that they can get to their destination on time than step in and potentially escalate the issue to the point of having the bus driver pull over (leaving you to become the villain in everyone's eyes as you shouldn't have gotten involved). 


Yesterday, three drunk guys boarded the bus asking the driver if he was heading somewhere. When he said yes, they just walked on without paying. 

*''Oi, get off, this is for paying customers only''* the driver said. But they just laughed at him and said, calm down old man. 

I would have dismissed this issue if they had left it at that, but they they started verbally assaulting innocent passengers with things like, *''You stupid woman, stop talking to the bus driver or we're going to be late. SHUT UP OLD WOMAN''*, or *''What stinks, did someone spray Axe deodorant on themselves... It's probably that guy down there he smells like shit''*. 

I just feel like I'm at a breaking point here. But what's the approriate way to deal with these things? 

I don't want people to get away with being shitty people, but I also don't want to obstruct other passenger's commutes (they all seem more than happy to take abuse until it gets physical). Meaning if you intervene before it gets physical you're seen as the dick.

139,"I am a Junior. I am ready to be done with school. I am so close I feel. I am currently majoring in English. I *love* this degree. I don't want to change it. I love to write especially, but I also like reading. I wanted to be an English professor at first but I have changed my mind. I wanted to teach creative writing, but I have heard that is extremely competitive, and it seems like so much time and money to get a doctorate when the outcome is so uncertain. I wouldn't really want to teach any other English subject. I could I suppose. Maybe American Literature would be interesting to teach. I sometimes wish I could write for NOLS or Deer Hill (outdoor adventure organizations) or WWF (a conservation organization) and have more adventures since I'll probably have to be wherever I'm at for the rest of my life. Part of this is also that I want a job right away if I can get one. I live with my parents and want to move out on my own sometimes.  
So, I realized that I love outdoor writing and environmental writing and am very interested in sustainability. I added a biology minor. I am feeling quite overwhelmed with the biology minor and the accounting minor and know I'll have to take four summer courses, which I really don't feel like doing. Another issue is that the biology minor conflicts with most of my classes in the upcoming semester. I thought perhaps a Forestry Management minor would be a better idea, and none of the classes conflict so I would definitely finish on time? My questions are here. I want to o continue the English major no matter what since I am 3 classes away from being done, and I'm only considering the other options as minors.  I might go back to school for a major in biology or forestry if I really want to, but for now I am only considering them as minors. I would like to be a writer for a magazine about the outdoors ideally. I currently double minor in Accounting and Biology.
SHOULD I DROP MY MINOR IN ACCOUNTING OR WOULD THAT HELP ME GET A FEW FINANCE JOBS (MAJOR IS ENGLISH)? 
SHOULD I JUST KEEP THE TWO MINORS AND TAKE THE SUMMER COURSES? 
SHOULD I ONLY MINOR IN BIOLOGY? 
SHOULD I ONLY MINOR IN FORESTRY? 
IS A DOUBLE MINOR IN BIOLOGY AND ACCOUNTING A GOOD IDEA?
SHOULD I JUST MINOR IN ENGLISH WRITING? 
SHOULD I CONTINUE MY EDUCATION TO BE AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR?

141,"im (19; f) very poor at writing things out like a story, so I'm going to bullet point the important things.
- i split finances with (21 y/o) bf
- rent is $100 a week, internet is $50 a month, we owe our family around $400
- lost my job at walmart for calling in for a fourth time. every job I get I constantly call in because my (doctor diagnosed) depression and anxiety gets the best of me and medicine does not work for me. i am unable to hold a job for longer than a month. i have had no source of income for the past two weeks.
- i cannot work fast food because i cannot keep up and i can no longer work at any walmart. 
- bf works at gamestop but the hours are horrible. last week he only had 8 and this week he has had none. keep in mind we both have completely open schedules and reliable transportation.
- neither of us can pass a drug test. we both occasionally smoke weed; not an everyday thing.
- we have resorted to selling our Xbox, Playstation, an old iPhone, and 3 laptops to buy food and pay rent.
- i barely even leave the house because my depression is so bad right now.
- important note: i am bipolar. i have extreme highs and lows that last months. my low started about a month ago.
- we need $100 for rent and $30 for internet this friday. we have no way of making money. we have $3 to our name.
- my family does not know that i have no job. they believe i still work at walmart. this is because they do not believe in mental illness; keeping it from them is much easier than telling them.
- Bf is HORRIBLE with money. he lets me handle the money but he spends most of it before he gives it to me. this is something we are working on. example: we had $25 a few days ago. we needed $36 to pay for his license. we needed food, so i told him to go to walmart to buy grapes. he buys a $6 bag of grapes. $6 is way too much for grapes. and also we had to save as much as we could for HIS license. we resorted to asking my mother for money. she loaned us $30. 
- i will not have insurance at all after this year.

I have no money, I can't hold a job, my mental health is ruining my life by screwing up my job life and my relationships with my family and friends, and i just don't know what to do.

145,"Hello!
I have a Staffordshire Bullterrier girl that lives with me in my 50m2 apartment. My best friend has lost her apartment and are struggling both financially and socially right now and I want to take care of her during December. She is going to live with me for a few weeks, the only problem is that she is extremely allergic to animals, especially dogs. She loves dogs, but will get a rash anywhere she touches a dog, and being in the same room as one makes her have a pretty bad reaction.

I thought I'd ask here in case someone has any good tips or tricks that I have not thought of. My question is, **what can I do to make this livable for her?** My dog does not shed a lot of hair, but I think the skin cells are just as bad. I will keep my dog out of the couch and her room these weeks, I will vacuum every day and make sure my dog gets a bath regularly. She does use anti histamines of course, but they only help so much sadly. She knows my dog well and I have told her I will do my best to alleviate any reaction so we have agreed to just try and see how it goes. She doesn't swell up in throat or anything like that so it isn't dangerous, just significant discomfort..


Is there anything I can give my dog to make her more ""allergy friendly""? Anything I can wash her with that helps? Anything my friend can take other than her usual meds that might help? You get the idea.
Any input is greatly appreciated!

157,"I'm a 16 year old male in my junior year of high school. I don't have my driver's license yet or a car. My dad takes me to school in the morning before he goes to work, and my mom picks me up after I get out. I have to be at school before 7:35am. My dad has to be at work at 8:00am. My high school and his job is quite a distance. We usually leave out the house around 6:50am-7:00am. On Wednesday this past week, we were getting ready to leave. My dad tells me ""Kyle let's go I'm ready"" and gets in his car. I was still in the house getting ready. It was around 6:55am so I thought we still had a few minutes. I believe my father wanted to make a few stops after he dropped me off before he goes to work. I was getting ready to leave the house, but I just wanted to make sure I had everything I needed before I left. Then all of a sudden, my dad walks in the house and yells at the top of his lungs, ""KYLE LET'S GO!!!!!"". That really startled me.

So I got in the car and we left. On our way to my dad dropping me off at school he was yelling at me and angry with me during the entire car ride. He told me ""SOMETIMES AFTER I DROP YOU OFF I'M LATE FOR WORK!!! AND I MAKE STOPS!!"" I then calmly told him ""I assumed that after you drop me off you just go straight to work because you only have so much time to get to work on time."" He then yells at me while slamming his hand on the steering wheel and says, ""THAT'S NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!!! IT'S NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS WHAT I DO AFTER I DROP YOU OFF!!!"". I wasn't trying to get into his business. I said that because I simply thought he goes straight to work after he drops me off so he can get there on time. He then proceeds to tell me, ""I'VE BEEN AT MY JOB FOR TOO LONG TO BE GETTING FIRED!!!"". 

I started crying during this car ride. I didn't mean to make my father upset. I had no idea that my dad was late to work sometimes after dropping me off. I wasn't trying to get into his business. When my dad gets angry like that it is very scary and upsetting. I also remember him saying during this car ride ""IF YOU ACT LIKE A BITCH, YOU'LL GET TREATED LIKE A BITCH!!!"". This upset me because I feel like my own father was indirectly calling me a bitch. I can't help that I'm sensitive.

During the entire car ride with him, I never raised my voice, I didn't talk back, I wasn't disrespectful. I tried to hold my composure. Even once he dropped me off I even told him ""Bye dad, see you later"", after the huge tirade he gave me. When my mom picked me up that day she told me, ""You owe your dad an apology."" This really pissed me off. If anything I feel like I deserve an apology. I feel like I didn't do anything wrong. I wasn't intentionally trying to make my dad late for work and I wasn't being disrespectful at all. It was my dad who was getting very angry and hostile towards me. It was a misunderstanding. I feel like if my dad was late to work sometimes after dropping me off he should've came up to me and say ""Hey son, sometimes after I drop you off I'm late for work so we have to leave out at such and such time."" Okay fine. But when I have no idea that you're late sometimes and then all of a sudden you're screaming at me at the top of your lungs telling me ""LET'S GO!!!, I'M LATE SOMETIMES!!!!, MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS!!!!, etc.  I feel like that's not right. I didn't apologize to my dad because I feel like I didn't do anything wrong. I feel like I deserve an apology. I feel like he was just mad, and wants me to apologize for making him mad.

When my dad gets angry like that I get very upset. I feel like I deserve an apology because he could've came up to me and calmly told me, ""Hey son we have to leave at this time so I can get to work on time"", instead of me being clueless that he's late sometimes and giving me shit for it.

158,"Alright so this will be a little bit of a rant so I apologise in advance. 

I started a job a few months ago and it was great. I made lots of friends, usually got 5 shifts a week and it was a positive environment to work in.

Then they needed more people so I got my best friend a job there (big mistake I know). At the same time the owner's sister in law came back from her holiday. The sister in law is extremely hostile towards me. She blames me for literally everything that's done wrong, even if it wasn't done by me. If something isn't done it's my fault regardless of how many people are currently working. She got angry at me for leaving a few grains of salt in the tray I was cleaning but when I told her there were earwigs in the dish cloths she said it doesn't matter. (Priorities?) She's extremely rude to me and speaks down to me at all times. 

After she returned and my friend started working there I went from working most days to getting one three hour shift a week. My friend meanwhile gets all the shifts I used to. She's given very obvious preferential treatment. I didn't get the full (non-trainee) wage for 3 months but she got it after a couple of weeks. She gets to make herself pizzas to eat. The owner and his sister in law treat her with respect and like... well a human being. I also get sent home half an hour before close while everyone else gets to stay for some inexplicable reason. 

Now people may be jumping to three conclusion that I'm a slacker which is why I get treated this way. I have a strong work ethic, and this treatment only started after those two events occurred.

The obvious thing to do would be quit, but I'm 19 and still at home and my parents went ballistic at the idea. The 45 dollars I earn from my one shift means more to them than my wellbeing (we are hardly poor either). I've been looking for a new job but living in a small Australian town makes that hard. 

So I'm wondering what I should do and what causes this woman to be so hostile to me.

to cut the story short she didn't make the cut.

So a few months go by and she seems relatively fine, but then she starts doing stuff that shes never done before like listen to music with very loud volume and drink much more and always double check the locks.

I don't want to drag this post for too long and I don't really know how to explain how it got to this point but after my country introduced 8 number license plates she started saying how cars with those numbers are part of like a cult that's trying to kill her.
Every time she sees someone she doesn't know in the building she asks them what floor they live in and what apartment they stay at, she has also started doing this in public, she thinks some of her sisters are part of a conspiracy trying to kill her and has stopped going to family reunions and picnics.
She also talks to herself in front of the mirror and I can hear it from my room.
My brother and my dad also agree there is something going on with her, my dad thinks she's schizophrenic and she also started latching at us whenever we critique her about this and she has developed a very short fuse.

167,"There was a girl I wanted to get together with, my friend who is one of my closest friends decides to get together with her knowing how I feel about her. I am so resentful of both of them right now. I'm really torn up by this, but I'm torn on how do I react.

One part of me says fuck them, I should cut that guy out of my life and then I wont have to see the girl either. What he did was cruel and selfish. I rejected the offer to go on my first date with one of his ex's, and I said no when I really wanted to go on the date because he told me that would hurt him.

The other part of me thinks I'm the selfish one here. It's not their fault that I didn't make that girl's standards and my friend did. I should just let my friend be happy since the girl didn't like me anyway.

I don't know how to react to this. My instincts are telling me to say fuck this guy but I really don't want overreact and ultimately do something dumb I regret.",09Dec2017,2

172,"Throw away account because anon reasons.

My sister ""Carol"" is 48 and she is mentally challenged. She is about mentally 8 years old and has other mental challenges (no physical ones). Carol talks to things/people that aren't there, constantly has conversations with herself, and babbles incessantly about whatever is on her mind at the moment. My parents have never shared her actual diagnosis with me, despite my asking. A friend in the psychology field who has met her says she's probably suffering from schitzoaffective disorder, but can't make a formal diagnosis.

Carol had a 40 hour a week office job about 10 years ago, but my mother insisted on ""taking her out of work"" to attend various events and vacations. As a result of Carol's bad attendance at work and her awful behavior there (trying to cast Harry Potter spells on her supervisor and chasing someone with a ruler) her department was ""reorganized"" and she was let go. After that, my parents did not try to find her another job or put her in job placement.

My mother is delusional and thinks that Carol is a star athlete and musician and dedicates a lot of time and money to Carol's leisure pursuits. Carol hasn't been on medication for her psychosis since she was in high school. My mother says her activities are her medication. 

Now, my parents are in their 70s and not in the best of health. My sister lives with them and my mother spends all of her time shuttling Carol to her ""activities."" My father does not deal with any of this. I have tried to talk to my parents about getting them and my sister into therapy. They refuse, telling me they don't need and that my sister is ""fine.""

A year ago, my sister pushed my younger son down a flight of stairs during one of her ""episodes"" while my parents were watching the kids. My wife now refuses to let the kids go over there unless she or I are with them. (I agree with her) My parents claim that ""nothing happened"" and that my son made up the story. I fully believe my son, and my sister still babbles and giggles about the event under her breath when the kids are around.

I need advice. I don't know what it will take for my parents to wake up and see that my sister needs a psychiatrist and should be transitioning into assisted living. I have told them flat out I will NOT allow her to live with my wife and I. My father is fine with that, but my mother keeps trying to work on my soft-hearted wife. (Although after our kid was hurt, my wife has nothing but dislike for my sister)

I don't know what to do. Is there anyone else out there in this situation? Delusional parents and a mentally ill adult sibling?

173,"So it all started on a few days ago, I was doing my Maths exam and my calculator went out of power, so I used my friend's calculator in front of me but the teacher saw it and thought we were cheating. So my maths exam is kinda ruined. 

Then today I lost my whole wallet while out for a family dinner, I had lost it a lot of times before, so many it has become an annual thing. But before I usually lose it in a school bus or somewhere that I can get it back, but now I don't even know where or when I lost it while going out. I got like 500 HKD in my wallet and all of my student IDs and personal stuff, I feel so bad since I had so many chances to change my habits of losing things but I didn't even bother to change them.
Coupled with the maths stuff, I can't really take this anymore. I just feel like I wanna disappear, I don't think I can take this anymore.",09Dec2017,2
176,"My story (quite long, sorry):

I've had quite severe social anxiety for the past 6 years or so. In that time, while I have talked to people every now and then I really only really had one friend that I regularly hang out with. This has had a big impact on my self esteem. I know it's my fault for not being more confidence but I feel that no one one wants to be friends with me.

I also have not spoken to girls regularly. I get extremely anxious and care so much of what they think of me. I've never had a girlfriend and am a virgin at 25 years old. The last time I spoke to girls regularly and flirted with them was when I was 16.

 I went to university (which my one friend did not go to) and had a few chances to make friends,people invited me out but I rejected them due to my severe anxiety. So throughout the time I was there mainly on my own for 4 years. A lot of the time I obviously spent in my room. My schedule was go to uni, go gym, grocery shopping then come back to my room and watch tv shows and yes...porn. I've watched a lot of it and progressed from watching mainstream stuff to gonewild to amateur and so on. At first it was just because I was horny but a lot was also due to loneliness, when and home or at uni. I very much doubt I would have watched as much porn as I did if I had friends.
 
In my 4th year at uni I couldn't take the loneliness any more, depression hit me hard, I had no fear of failure, didn't hand in any work and felt complete apathy. It was in this time where I developed an addiction to porn, especially during  end of year exams where there were no lectures. I watched porn all day, left tabs open all day.
It was this year where I got into cuckold porn. Before, I never in my life would have watched cuckold porn. I thought it was very messed up and not an act of love ( I'm apologise for everyone that is into it). I think if you love someone that you only want to be with that one person and no one else.

Anyway I failed university and my self esteem completely shattered. I felt weak and extremely undesirable. I got addicted to porn more than ever, watching it every day throughout the day, cuckold porn being the thing I was most turned on by.

I envisioned myself as the ""bull"" in this fetish. I'm not well endowed but got turned on by the fact that a girlfriend/wife would want to sleep with me. It is now what turns me on the most. 

I have thought about this a lot and feel that it is due to me feeling extremely alone/unloved and undesirable/low self esteem. I think that I am desperate for love and intimacy but since my self esteem is so low and I don't socialise with people (girls) my brain thinks that the only way for me to receive love and be physically intimate with a girl is for some guy to share their gf/wife with me. 

I've always wanted to be with a nice/good girl but having failed uni and having no friends or confidence I felt that this type of girl will never want to be with me so the only type I can go for are the ones that don't care about how successful you are or how many friends you have or how confident you are. They only care about your body, which is all I have that makes me desirable ( eventhough I'm not well endowed, but go gym regularly and am in decent shape).

Obviously not having friends for so long and then failing university made me so feel worthless, that no girl wants to be with because I'm a loser without any confidence. You need confidence to make friends,  to succeed in your career and to get girls right?. Confidence is what girls are attracted to and I have next to none. 

My life is kind of on track now, I'm back at uni but still struggling with anxiety and depression from my past and past failures.

Anyway... I really need advice please,  not for the anxiety and depression part but more for the porn addiction. I'm scared that when my life gets better; depression goes and my self esteem goes up, when I do make friends, and especially get a girlfriend that I will still be into cuckold porn. I want to stop watching it and think it's so wrong ( again I'm so sorry) but I keep going back to it.

Is there anyone else that has gone through the same thing and come out ok?

187,"Let's start with some background. I've been married to the same woman for almost 10 years. We got married really young and immediately started a family. I never graduated college and since then I've worked my way up into a decent job working in IT. My wife worked some during the early years in our marriage but then eventually became a stay at home mom for our 4 kids. 

About a year and a half ago she decided she wanted to go to school again and get her degree. She eventually earned it (with a ton of help from me), graduated in May, and then started looking for jobs. In the beginning, the job market was not kind to her and she kept getting rejected over and over. She finally got an entry-level job at a call center making barely anything with some tough working conditions. This situation eventually caused her to get very depressed and question where her life was going. 

Fast forward to a couple of months later I found out she was texting other guys behind my back. We got into a fight over this and other things and she filed for divorce. ONE week later she regretted it all and wanted to mend things with me and stop the divorce. I accepted her back and we began to mend our relationship. 

About 2 weeks ago she had an interview for a job in another town about 2 hours away and the next day they offered her the job. She was ecstatic over it and so happy she finally got a really good job so she accepted. They asked her to start immediately and so the next monday she began her job. Since the drive is so very far away she found an apartment in that area. Our plan was always to move there eventually but I just could never get going on that plan with 4 needy kids and the demanding job I have so she moved without us. 

Anyhow since our fight last month I feel like I cannot trust her, and I am constantly worrying about if she's messing around behind my back. I have friends that tell me shes being selfish and I need to divorce her unless she comes back since she left me with the kids for now and its obvious shes cheating (even though she says she isn't). I have other friends that tell me to let it go and deal with any infidelity if I come across it and not to worry at this time since nothing is going on, to my knowledge. 

I ask her about it, she reassures me, but sometimes she wont answer my texts or calls within a decent amount of time and that REALLY gets to me as the thoughts pour in. Ever since I found out she was talking to other guys I've really lost a lot of confidence in myself and it's hard for me to deal with anything in a positive way. 

I'm sick of constantly feeling like she's stringing me along only to have her dump my heart in the gutter again as she betrays me once more. At this time she could be doing nothing as she says yet my thoughts won't allow me to believe this, I constantly have nightmares over it as well. Has anyone else gone through this? I really don't know what to do other than try and move there with her but with my kids and school and trying to find a job and my current financial responsibilities its nearly impossible at this time.

190,"So before I go in to detail I will say I have posted this on r/relationship_advice but I have not gotten any response so forgive me if this is the wrong place. Mods feel free to remove if you see fit =)
Now onto the actual post 


So, I have a friend (F21) who has recently been asking me (M25) to come out so she can rant/talk to someone. She has told me a lot about her life, things that have happened to her that she has told no one else. Each of the last 3 times I have learnt something new, sometimes some of the things she has told me have been quite shocking but none of it has changed my opinion of her.

Lets fast forward to the most recent time she needed to talk to me. She told me about her current partner, how she still has very storong feelings for her but how he no longer has those feelings for her and that he in a way maybe has never really felt the same way for her. She is stuck and isn't sure of what to do. I gave her the best advice I can given what she told me.

Later in the night she starts acting ""strangely"" towards me, sitting further away, not really looking at me. I knew something was up but decided to let her be as to not push her. So we start to walk home, conversation switches back on to her ""partner"" as she would say, quotation marks and all given that she has kinda accepted the best thing to do is split but it isn't quite so easy.

We sit down on a curb and talk more, next thing I know I am being told to stand up and she kisses me and I kiss back, we both enjoyed it this much I know. I can see after that she feels guilt that she did this and is unsure on what she s to do next. We continue walking home and talking.

We get back to mine, I make us something to drink and I ask her how long she has had feeling for me, she tells me it has been only a couple of months, she asks the same of me and I tell her it has been a similar amount of time, which is true. We talk more about how she has been acting when she has come to visit my parents (where I live atm due to circumstances) and that she has been leaving the room more often than she would as I make her nervous which I think is cute..

I walk her home, we hug and say our goodnights. I get a text not long after saying that we should really talk sometime soon and I agree. the next day I get another text saying what happened needs to go no further for the time being, I agree to keep things as they were. Fast forward to the next day I get another text asking to just stay friends, for the time being while she processes what to do and that she needs space for now, again I agree to it as I feel i is the best course of action.

So I am conflicted, I just needed to speak with someone, anyone and just need to get this out of my system and get some advice back. I do care for her and I know she does for me but given the situation mentioned above it is complicated. I am going to give her the space and time needed to come to a decision that will be best for her.",09Dec2017,2

Since telling him I don't want to he has threatened to fight for sole custody over the child if I choose to have it and is being very horrible like he hates every inch of my being. 
When I asked him what we would do about my three year old and Christmas prior to this he told me it's not his problem it's mine. There's nothing he can do and we are over and I need to leave. 
What do I do in this situation?
I want to keep the baby and I wouldn't refuse him contact however he would fight to refuse me. 
He would also probably get his friends and mother involved to back his statements in court and make up lies about me in order to win. 
I'm very confused and scared.
Any advice is appreciated.
I don't know who he is anymore. ",09Dec2017,2
207,"Hello r/advice,

I have a coworker that is REALLY annoying - he's not very bright, he's toxic, and he just all around really sucks. Sometimes, he texts me on the weekends and after hours, nothing creepy or weird just asking or commenting about the few common interests we have (beer, certain movies). It really, really irritates me because I truly don't like this person and certainly don't want to talk to him when I'm not at the office, but can I tell him not to text me without making it big office drama? If so how can I go about that? My strategy has been not responding to a single one (lol) but he apparently isn't getting the memo! I would block his number, but unfortunately the nature of our job requires that we be able to reach each other. 

On a similar note, my department of 5 people (including the guy above, ugh) has a group chat, mainly so we can let each other know if we will be out of the office or whatever. My other colleagues are all awesome and I consider them actual friends, but the group chat kills me because they text all the time, about work and non-work stuff. The most annoying thing is when one coworker will text the group addressing another coworker about a matter that has nothing to do with anyone else. Why not just text that person directly?? It's Saturday for Christ's sake, I don't want to hear from you about work! 

I once brought this up, just the part about including me on texts that don't have anything to do with me, and they told me I was just being cranky and to get over it. Then anytime I responded to the group chat's non-work messages it was ""oh look, u/kittymrrow wants to be in the group chat!"" and it was even more annoying. 

Am I being too irritable or would these things bother you too? Is there a way I can address the coworker I hate, or do I just have to deal? Is it terrible to ask them to make a new chat without me for non-work stuff? I don't think it's unreasonable that I want a break from them, considering we sit like five feet apart all day, but I have a feeling it won't be taken well. 

For context, the guy I hate is young, like 23 (probably part of why he annoys me so much), I'm 28 and the oldest person in my department is 32.

Thank you Reddit!

So basically, my problem is that I have no more motivation for things I need/want/love: job/MtF transition/music. (that's kind of a **TL;DR**)  

It all started 3 years ago, after 12th grade I've gone to a university institute of technology in electrical engineering and industrial computing.  
My first plan was to do something music-related since it's all my life, but my father got in the way and sent me there instead, saying that I won't succeed in anything in life because I'm shit, so I better do something ""simple"". Moreover, me doing electrical engineering was more interesting to him than me. He fucked up with my brain, so I kind of said yes without saying it really (yeah, he's that kind of person: narcissistic pervert).  
It was cool at first, then, because I worked too hard, I get a burn-out. At first I didn't notice, so I kept working hard despite that I feel tired all the time, I couldn't sleep, I lost joy, and more... and because of the pressure from my father.  
It's only a year later when I need to do an internship to graduate, that I realise that I was not that well. I forced myself to finish the intership and then I took a year off to rest myself. It was really needed.  

So this year was about to begin, school year I mean, so it was august, I pre-applied to a university's communication program months before, since I thought it could help me build a career in the music industry. But after weeks and weeks on the waiting list, I was not accepted: there were still 3 persons before me when it closed.  
Once again and by default, I found myself in electrical engineering... Of course, with the aftermath of my burn-out, a few weeks in and I wasn't able to follow the course without having anxiety. So I left. It was too hard for me.  

I then said to myself that I have to find a job, to do something, and because it's been more than a year that I realised that I was trans, and if I want to be able to transition I have to be financially independent because I don't think that my father will react well to my coming out, being the anti-LGBT and racist that he is. My mom and my brother and sister will be ok with it, but not my father, and as he's the ""head of the family"", all his decisions apply, we can't say anything, we don't have the ""right"" to do so...  
But I can't find the motivation to look for a job, and when I do, everything seems uninteresting. The only thing that interest me in life is music. And yet I can't find the motivation to restart making music since I want good result immediately, I wasn't like that before. So I can't earn money making music because I don't make any, and I don't even talk about the fact that it's hard to make money with music! And because I'm not financially independent, I don't make an appointment with a psychiatrist for my transition, which I need.  
So everything is kind of intimately related.  

Meanwhile, all my friends say to me that thanks to me, they find the motivation to do new things in their life. It's really cool for them, but why can't I motivate myself if I motivate everyone around me? It feels like I'm trapped and that I can't escape the shitty life I built for myself.  

I don't know what to do? I need advices.  
Thank you in advance to everyone, any help is highly appreciated!

211,"This is so embarrassing and I don't know where else to turn. Throwaway for reasons.

I am a 22 yo college student. I've begun to self sabotage to an extreme extent and I just can't stop. I used to primarily do it in relationships, where it was just a minor inconvenience, not something that was affecting my future.

I am a model student. I love doing homework, writing essays, even answering questions in class. For the past three semesters, however, I've just gave up about two weeks before finals. Stopped attending class, didn't show up to the final. Ultimately, I fail the class at the last second. *And I cannot stop doing this.*

I know it's wrong. But I tell myself that it's fine, everything is fine and I continue to do it (or not do it, I guess). My parents would have a coronary if they knew. I have wasted three semesters by doing stellar in the beginning and then shirking away from the last two weeks or so. I have been known to do this with jobs as well, although the repercussions aren't nearly as dire.

I have really big dreams that are getting further and further away and I just cannot stop. I'm not on drugs, (I do smoke a little weed), I'm not a lazy person by any means. For some reason, I'm just determined to ruin my life. I have been to therapists before but between school and rent, the cost of one might not be manageable for me right now. 

How do I stop? What the hell is wrong with me? I feel so lost right now. ",09Dec2017,4
212,"So where to begin on this story?

I guess I’ll go back to my sophomore year (note, I’m going off credit hours) of college, I made Dean’s list with a 3.75 GPA, at the end of the spring semester. I caught the attention of a recruiter of this specific fraternity. He kept asking what my thoughts were on joining, and he’d eventually start acting like a friend. I eventually signed the “bid card” during summer break, and mailed it to the fraternity. 

Fall semester of my junior year eventually rolled around, and the fraternity had the usual Monday night meetings, and I’ve been good at attended those for the most part. The troubles started when the scholastic chairman said that I had to do “grade checks, and proctored study hours”, I tried to tell them that I’m in bed by 10:30 pm (study hours were at 11) I know, it’s lame for a college student to go to bed at that time, but I had a T/TR class (calculus) at 7:30 in the morning. The scholastic chair didn’t care, and so I eventually ignored attended these study hours, I’m now on probation, where I can’t attend socials, which are lame anyways. 

Remember that recruiter earlier on? Yea he barely even talks to me, hasn’t since I turned in the bid card. 

Another problem that fairly recently popped up are these payments called “parlor fees”, and it’s essentially to pay for the use frat house (including the tv package, the Xbox live subscription, the games for the Xbox, for eating, and use of utilities/internet). I don’t use any of these, so I’ve been delinquent on payments, and money is an issue for me right now.  

Here’s when problems really start to happen: we had to do a Christmas card picture after one of the meetings, and after the card shoot, I told the sergeant-at-arms that next semester I have to take a class that’s required for my field of study, it’s only offered in the spring, and it’s an evening class. He got really pissed about that, and demanded I do a “enrollment search” in front of him on our university’s website. When he was proven wrong, he asked if I could defer it to next year. I told him “no, it’s not happening” he was infuriated to say the least. 

Then let’s fast forward to Friday night, I was supposed to cook for the active members of the fraternity, as a pledge per tradition, and I decided not to do it (the other pledges were ok with it, not me), so I went to the Christmas party being thrown by my wildlife club, I stayed the night at the club presidents house because I got too drunk, and she didn’t want people drinking and driving. I woke up this morning to my phone ringing, and I answered, it was the sergeant-at-arms. He was wanting to know where I was, and why I didn’t show up to help cook, or participate in their gift exchange. I told him that “my club has treated me more like family than this fraternity”, and hung up on him. 

Look, please save your breath if you’re going to say I’m also to blame, I’m still learning about myself, and the world. I think I understand now that Greek society is all about “if the shoe fits”, and I don’t think it fits me. Should I leave the fraternity? I’m starting to feel more that way after what happened this morning. 

I also should mention that my years in school are based on credit hours (I transferred), and I’m a couple years older than the others in the fraternity, so this is also something where I dislike being forced to submit to the fraternity’s traditions, and being told what to do by kids younger than me.",09Dec2017,1

217,"As the title states, I had a friend at my job and she would give me head in the family restrooms. Now the way this is so easy is because we're both girls and as much as I wish she was eating me out, she's not. I have a penis... which is plenty reason why I'm so ""desperate"" for the blowjobs she gives me.

Really, we've actually done a lot together at the job, even in the public restroom we've done the same thing. We had sex at least twice this week in the family bathroom. And really I always paranoid about doing it at the job like this but she always insisted it was fine since late hours the store is very empty. Even most of the managers of that time just take breaks every half hour.

Anyways, we were in the family bathroom and she was giving me a blowjob. The thing is, most employee's use the family restroom so we actually forgot to lock the door and one of them walked in... they saw my dick, testicles... what we were doing... and it blew the fuck up!

Everyone is talking about us and me, they know I have a penis and it's so fucking embarrassing. Worse is I hid it so damn well, I don't act like a damn tomboy, I'm normal like any other female and now I can't even make eye contact without feeling like a freak. Not only this, but I could be fired for what we have been doing. Because with bullying the managers eventually have to look at the cameras and they will see us going in together.

218,"Not sure how to format this, but I’d basically like some input. My sister lives at home and spends the majority of her time there, playing video games or on the internet. She’s had some difficulty through school due to ADHD, repeating years and flunking out of college (I basically attribute the latter to laziness, partly due to her personality and the fact she never took advantage of the services provided to her). She has a high-school diploma and found work at a part-time job that pays minimum wage doing something she loves to do. However, when I encourage her to apply to full-time jobs (in order to leave the house and sustain herself, something she’s been commenting on for a while), she is either unresponsive or gives a very vague answer like she is comfortable here. A lot of what she wants in life (a dog, bigger space, less restrictions, etc) are only attainable if she were to leave. 
Basically most of the money she earns goes to her gaming set-up, and she saves close to nothing. Since this is her own money I couldn’t care less, but again, encouragements to save go by unnoticed. Because of this my mother is in control of her account, among other things such as cleaning after her and the like. 
When I talk to my parents over this, they are indifferent to her leaving and would rather her be home for as long as she’d like (one of my aunt’s stayed at her mother’s house until she was 38). I think this is also due to the fact I have a younger sibling at home, and they are still in the mindset that there will still be children at the house for a while (if this makes sense). I just want her to be self-sufficient, but I’m afraid I’m also making a big deal out of nothing or I’m being unfair.

220,"hello!

so with normal ideas I feel very cool with mentioning them to my bosses. like ideas that affects my work or their work immediately, something that might make it easier for me or so on. 

But this idea I have now is more like something that I think might be more on the owner-side of decisions.

Basically right now at my work we hire a third party company to do a very crucial service for us (call operator). What my suggestion/idea would entail would be for us to open our own call operator that would be led by me. It would mean hiring people for this since it would require 24/7 attendance. And I thought about opening a company just for this purpose that would be in the same concern as our company in a way to get other clients within the same industry or even clients who just has the demand for an on-call call operator that can call out security in case there's a burglary or something. 

Now, this idea I had is a bit dreamy I know. This is something maybe I would've done if I was the owner/boss. But I am not. And even though my bosses are cool it feels like a weird thing to prupose.

229,"**The backstory before the fight**:

My brother is married for 5 years and after 2-3 years of their married, My sister in law (SiL) start liking me and wanted to start an affair with me, I think? She starts doing her personal intimacy talk with me, starts showing me her boobs, willingly changing her dress in front of me, talk about how she got arouse if I sit close to her or touch her. Which is not fine for me so I start disclosing this to my Sister and Mom which irritate her so she started doing it more when they are not present. I thought of sharing this with my brother but knowing that if I share her behavior, He might divorce her and they have 2 children who will ultimately suffer. Also, she threatens to sue me with various accusation and said that my future will get ruined.  So I stop talking to her.

**The day of the fight:**  
That day my parents weren't home and I was going for a bath, she said let's go together in the bathroom at that point I threaten her that I will complain this with my brother, and I went taking bath during that time she told my brother/Mom/Sister that I was making a video of her taking a piss in the toilet and I was harassing her, even molesting her and touching her inappropriately in the past. To which my mom/sis/brother didn't believe her and let that go. A few days later, I left my home and started living with my sis at rent home.

**Now Today:**  
3-4 months back she had a fight with my dad, mom, and brother so she went back to her mother's home. Today she came back with the same issue that I did all that to her and nobody did anything to that issue. Now I left with 2 options that are:  
1) If I speak all the truth that likely means Divorce of them and my niece and nephew grew up with one parent or.  
2) If I accept those false accusations that mean My brother or even whole family might get upset or stop talking to me. 

I'm willing to sacrifice myself if it means my brother and sister-in-law stay married and those 2 children get to live with both the parents.

I'd like to get some advice and this is very urgent and important.

I felt a little uncomfortable and wanted to confront both of them because I was sure they were saying something about me. Sadly I did not because I was out with my little brother and one of my best friends. I didn't want to make a scene. 

I wanted to confront the two of them because I didn't really get any closure when I ended my friendship with the two of them. 

Friend 1 forced me to go through a toll lane and assured me that it wouldn't cost anything if we were carpooling. He even said he'd pay for my ticket if I ever received one. My fears came true when a month later I received a toll violation ticket in the mailbox. When I told friend 1 about it he said he would pay me when he had the money. Funny thing is he never did. Friend 1 also asked me to pay for his meal when we went out for his ""best friend's"" birthday because he felt it was unfair he had to pay for his ""best friend's"" meal. No one wanted to do it, but I wanted to be a good guy and help him out. Plus I still thought he would pay me back eventually for the ticket at the time. After 2 months of debating, I decided to cut off my friendship with friend 1 through a conversation. My only problem with friend 1 is I want to know if he ever would have paid me back because I never got a clear answer. 

Friend 2 wasn't going anywhere in life and college was basically ruled out as an option for him. I was tired of surrounding myself with people who were going nowhere, so I decided to cut him out too. The real reason why I cut him out though was because he was still really good friends with friend 1 and favored the guy who screwed me over. He even knew about the incident, but decided to turn a blind eye to it all. I never really confronted friend 2 about how he feels towards me though, so I can't say for sure we aren't really friends anymore. It just feels that way. 

The other friend hanging out with the two I am deciding to leave alone because I wasn't good enough friends with him anyways to care about who he hangs out with. 

What should I do? Should I just forget I saw them yesterday and move on? It just feels wrong to leave it without a sense of closure.

233,"Hey. So I’m a sophomore in HS. Let me give you some background on my love life before I give my current situation. In middle school..... I was very awkward. My first “relationship” was in sixth grade. I broke it off within a week because the pet names made me want to Kurt Cobain myself.  My seventh grade year I was trying to get together with this really cute girl who had some really screwed up stuff happen to her that year so I played friend. She moved to Texas and I didn’t really talk to her for about a year. Oh yeah she liked me a little bit too. Then that same year after that girl moved another girl asked me out I said yes. She and I dated (if you could call it that when it’s only the middle school cafeteria) for a few months. but at the end of the year I figured something out. You see she told me that she was poor. That her mom was a bitch, that she’d been raped in elementary school (long story) and that her cousin who was staying with them was a psycho. Now I usually an tell when someone is lying. But I was still depressed and sad from that other girl that had moved. And I believed everything. But on field day I was talking to one of her exes (he and her ended it  mutually) and he said he had no idea what I was talking about. He said he knew her family, her mother was nice and her cousin wasn’t there and she had never been raped. I confronted her and she admitted to it. I didn’t get the last laugh though. She broke up with me. As I looked through our texts, I saw a pattern of inconsistency and and something else. She was trying to turn me against my best friends. She moved that summer and I wouldn’t hear from her for years. This messed me up. I know it was middle school but at the time it really hurt me. The summer between 7th and 8th grade during summer school PE (you can get it out of the way to take an extra elective. ) I met a girl who was really cute and awesome. But as summer school ended we drifted apart. But I remembered her. 8th grade year I started texting the girl who had moved through Kik. And I ended up fucking it up because I was so used to clingy relationships. And then the latter half of eighth grade I did the same thing with another girl who was in school with me (because I didn’t learn my lesson the first time)  and ended up getting humiliated by her and having rumors spread that I was a creepy weirdo.  This broke me for a while. I was angry, but not vengeful. I made sure my best friend didn’t murder the girl in her sleep (inside joke) and then the year ended. Summer school of 8- 9 th grade year I got into a relationship with a girl. And it ended within a week because the girl said that I “ needed to learn to love myself to love someone else” and that I needed to be friends with a girl before boyfriend. Last year was good. Me and the girl from 7-8th grade summer school met up. But she was in and out of a relationship. I tried asking her to the dance, but I ended up changing the subject because I was nervous. As the year went on me and her got really close and we soon realized that we both liked each other. But we didn’t want to screw up what we had. So a just/friends pact was established. This year I started talking to a girl who I had met in a class last year but wasn’t really close to. I asked her for her number through graphing calculator. We talked for a little while, but I was slipping back into my clingy tendencies. I heard from a friend that she wasn’t wanting a relationship yet so I didn’t make to big of moves. I asked her to the dance. She said yes. We went. We slow danced, no kissing, just danced. But I felt like I bored her. I can’t dance really well. And I was really awkward sometimes. So I texted her asking if I was awkward was really apologetic. I have anxiety so I get really screwed up about this stuff. And she said it was ok. And then we talked a little more but then my friend said she thought I was a wee bit clingy. So what did my anxious self do. I stopped texting her for about a month. And then she got in a relationship with someone who was also friend of mine and I kinda encouraged it. Idk I just wanted to support my friends. And now they are broken up and me and her are texting and talking on an ok basis. I’m trying not to be clingy. But how does one with anxiety and with my track record do this stuff.

She stayed the night with me, without telling her parents or anything. 

She doesn't have the greatest home life; Her stepdad is a piece of shit, who treats her like a slave. Wakes her up early to Iron his clothes, and then whoops her with a belt if it's not done properly. Her mother doesn't give a rat's sphincter about her, and even told her that if it came to choosing between her or her husband, she would choose her husband.

My main question is what is the best course of action for us. I'm not sure if her parents will believe her. or do anything about it, and I don't know anything about whether the police would be a good idea.

239,"Hi,
I guess I'm here because I'm all out of ideas and ways to try and resolve this issue on my own. I'l be a pretty long read so I don't expect many replies, I understand.

&amp;nbsp;

I currently live together with my siblings and my mother in the family home. An elder brother of 25 and a younger sister aged 18. We are all very impulsive when it comes to conversation, I must admit that me, my brother and sister have always been rather aggressive in nature and tend to escalate things without a cause. I have been trying to work on this bad quality of mine for the past couple of years, and while I'm still easily triggered I do tend to remain calm and open to conversation. My sister had been staying in a boarding school for the last 3 years, mainly because the situation was getting too heated at home and her school was quite a distance away. Things remained rather calm at home, the relationship between me and my brother got better if anything, we don't argue much and are both grown up enough to realise the futility of it. This all changed when my sister left boarding school. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know how to describe this without portraying her as pure evil but it comes close. My sister has been insufferable in all possible regards. I know many families deal with sibling fueds but I am convinced this brings it one step further. She is 18, yet acts nothing like one expects of her age. She yells at everyone without reason, steals/borrows money from my mother without ever showing any gratitude or even the understanding that it has value. Her room is destroyed, filth is everywhere to the point where you can't walk in the room without possibly twisting your ankle. She has now claimed my elder brother's room without permission, demanding he leaves the house because he's old enough. She invites people over into his room, disrespects his privacy completely and turns into a raging demon when politely asked to leave. My brother pays rent for the little he has. She disregards her own health, coughing every weekend without end after nights out, gained a significant amount of weight through a bad diet. She absolutely refuses to eat what everyone else is eating.

&amp;nbsp;

The way she communicates with us is probably the hardest thing to deal with. It's always a one way street where you can't get anything through. Every reasonable argument you lay forth gets completely denied and thrown back at you, even if it makes no sense. I noticed over the years that she has never ever in her life admitted to being wrong or guilty to something. No matter how clear something is, it's never her fault and she's always the victim. She has been having shouting verbal fights with everyone in the house for months on end without any sign of change in behaviour, no matter how you approach her to try and explain that what she's doing is wrong and uncalled for. I've had periods where I had sworn to myself I wouldn't talk to her anymore, no matter the reason. But I usually budge because I notice that she doesn't even recognise the reason I'm doing it for. In her arguments she has wished both me and my brother dead. Earlier today she yelled at my brother that she hoped he'd be killed by a car running him over, simply because he wanted her out of his room to change clothing. Both me and my mother have to deal with similar verbal attacks, she ' hates ' us and wishes us dead for the smallest of reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

And then sometimes she'l be the nicest girl I know, she'l be kind and you can actually talk to her. She'l become very emotional at the idea of losing us. But it's as if she can switch her personality in a blink of an eye and turn into an absolute vile creature. It's because of this that I'm so conflicted, I don't know if she means it or not. But it doesn't matter, she's toxic and ruining our family without end in sight.

&amp;nbsp;

I can't just tell her to go see a psychiatrist because she doesn't believe the problem lays with her. She's old enough that we can't force her to either. My mother is lost, I feel like she has accepted that her daughter is the way she is, although it saddens her deeply. She has no daughter that she can talk to and do things with together.

&amp;nbsp;

My brother just wants to leave home but is financially not there yet. I'm in a similar situation, but I'd rather have this resolved then to run from it. I know this will affect our relationship for the rest of our lives if we don't make a change now.

&amp;nbsp;

Has anyone been in a similar situation, and if so what have you done to take action?

241,"I always did well in school. Never well enough to compete in any national competitions, say, but enough to become valedictorian (I believe you call it in America) at my high school, and enough to always have been labelled the ""smart kid"" by peers and teachers alike. I was also moderately engaged in music, that's my big hobby, and the story is more or less the same there.

On the other hand I never had a particularly healthy social life, I was bullied a bit in middle school, that sort of thing, and I think I used academic performance in particular to give myself and my life some sort of value. If nobody liked me, I needed to do better than everyone else at everything.

I'm now at university studying science, and I'm surrounded by incredibly talented and driven people, people that outperform me in every way, and I am having trouble dealing with that. Rationally I know that it is ridiculous to expect to be the best at anything, and I know it doesn't matter. I have friends now, people that won't think any less of me for not being the best, and I *know* that, but I still somehow expect that of myself. I beat myself up for not understanding everything immediately, for being anything but absolutely perfect. And I don't know how not to.

So my roll in the department has recently changed and I'm now responsible for coordinating the flow of the daily tasks. I receive all the documents and emails and hand off certain ones to my coworker to take care of. In a day I find she has a difficult time prioritizing what comes her way in the day and I find myself literally reorganizing her stuff in order that needs to be done. She has worked for the company in her role for almost a year now and I feel as though I shouldn't have to still be doing this. 

Sometimes the things we do aren't always black and white. Trial and error is often a way of progressing and making improvements and sometimes requires a little extra time and often revisions. She always complains about have to redo things and the time involved. I understand her frustrations because I have been there, I wouldn't have been spending the past year trying to teach her if I already didn't understand. It is part of the position and problem solving and finding resolutions comes with that as well. She asks me questions on things I've told her the answers to on many occasions and I try to gently remind her we've discussed it previously and to refer to her notes or take notes. Should after a year I still be reminding someone of that? I want her to grow and I'm having a hard time in finding the confidence that it'll happen. I moved positions took on more work and have not been able to pass much down to her. If I do, the tasks won't be done in time. I just like myself with more work instead and somehow make time to get it done.

But this past summer we had spent a great deal of time together, and just before she left we went on a very romantic night out until around 3 AM where we ended up falling asleep together.  She had been really touchy feely the whole time, but we we’re pretty drunk and I didn’t want ot take advantage of her like that.  She always gets like that when she’s drunk so I didn’t read anything into it.

But after that night we made plans to go out more, but then nothing ever happened.  She asked me out to dinner when she got back but it was really awkward.  Our conversation was stilted, she acted like she didn’t want to be around me.  Just so you all know I never pushed anything with her because she was a very confusing woman and couldn’t seem to make up her mind as to what she wanted.  

Since then we’ve only dealt with each other professionally at school, a couple late-night coffees.  I tried to ask her out to dinner because she always made an effort, she seemed really excited and said yes, and let’s celebrate.  But then she only wanted to get drinks, and then I called it off…nothing more awkward then going out with someone who doesn’t want to go.  Now the last couple times we’ve run into each other she’s brought up the act we should go to dinner, along with a few other things.

We’re finished in a few days with school/work and I was thinking of trying one last time, but being upfront about everything.  Hey Emily you said you wanted to have dinner, I’d love to have dinner with you. But if you brought it up simply to save-face don’t worry about.

TL:DR:  Things have gotten awkward between my friend and me.  We’ve drifted apart She’s trying occasionally to make an effort again, but I don’t know that it’s even worth it for me to try anymore.

268,"I suspect this is going to be a long entry so apologies in advance and congrats if you make it to the end.

I'm a geologist who works in the mining industry. I've been contracting with a major company since May. In September they suggested I apply for one of their full-time positions and, despite my hesitations about the job requiring relocation, I did. The friends I talked to about it said it was better to have the choice of taking the job or not instead of having no choice because I didn't apply.

Fast forward to now and they've made me an offer and I have to give them an answer on Monday (although there may be some leeway of a few days because I'm waiting for HR to get back to me on some points). I'm still not OK with relocating to this town and having to uproot myself again so I keep flipping between taking the job and turning it down.

My major concerns are:

- I'm 34, female, and want stability. My job has a lot of fieldwork that sends me away from home for long periods of time. If I take this job, I'll be continuing this theme of lots of travel.
- my finances aren't great after some hard crashes in mining and O&amp;G. I have almost no savings (about $4,000) from trying to survive over the last few years, although I also don't have any debts. This job is offering me $95,000 for definite, although I'm waiting to hear back about my negotiation to $105,000. So taking the job would be great for building my savings back up.
- all my friends are in the city that I'm based out of. I'm an introvert so making good friends is hard for me. Additionally, making friends when you travel a lot for work (I'm away more than I'm home) is a problem. In the past when I've been doing this type of work, I've spent 99% of my time on my own and it was extremely lonely. I'm reluctant to uproot myself away from my friends by taking this job.
- related to the above, I want to be able to meet someone and settle down. I think that's harder to do if I'm always going away. Past experience shows that absence makes the heart grow fonder up to a certain point; beyond that they start to forget about you and/or cheat. Taking this job means I'll be going away a lot, making future relationships very difficult.
- my city is a mecca for mining but I was initially having trouble breaking in because networking etc takes time and I want an office-based position instead of a field-based position. I didn't move to this city properly until March and obviously by May I was travelling a lot. I'm confident that if I stayed in my city, I could have a job offer within 5 months or less but obviously there's no guarantees and I have no idea if it would be a job offering comparable salary, experiences, etc.
- just for my own personal thing, I want to be able to join clubs and be able to attend all the sessions. I want to be able to pick a fitness plan and complete it (because when I'm in the field, I work 84 hours/week in a very physical job). I can't do those things when I'm travelling.
- and in general, my city has everything I could possibly want: world foods, every club I can think of, milder winter weather, etc. This mining town is very northern and thus more limited in its opportunities.
- but the northern town is much cheaper to live in. I can rent a 3-bedroom house for the same price as a bachelor apartment in my city. My dream of being a homeowner is far more do-able in the northern town, even by myself; in my city I would need to buy with a partner for sure.
- I considered taking the job for 12 months and then quitting. I have to repay the relocation expenses on a pro-rata basis if I work for less than 24 months. I've asked a few current employees and after a year I would likely be facing a $20,000 bill.

So I guess on the surface, it looks like I shouldn't take the job because it doesn't fit into my life plans? Am I missing something about this situation? And if I don't take the job, how do I tell the company that I don't want it? I was very clear with my manager from the start and on multiple occasions that relocation was the sticky point for me. I guess I'm worried that I'll burn a bridge with the company and I won't have a contract anymore. Am I too late to turn it down given that they want my answer on Monday???",09Dec2017,1
269,"without getting to crazy into the details, someone I work with had a heart attack last night and supposedly is clinging to life support. I was told there was someone I could reach out to if I wanted information on which hospital he is at if I wanted to say my final goodbyes and what not. 

While I feel awful about the situation and offered my condolences, I was not particularly close to this person, and I feel personally it would be inappropriate for me to visit him in such a setting. 

I am having conflicting concerns in my mind that I don't want to come off as insensitive to others by not making an attempt to visit him, but at the same time feeling that me visiting him on his deathbed seems almost inappropriate considering we were not particularly close.",09Dec2017,1
270,"So recently I noticed I'm emotionally muted or even dead when just being me or when thinking about my own situation. This in itself is somewhat of a problem, however the strange part is this: I have tons of empathy for others and it is through this empathy that I gain some sort of emotions in relation to myself. However, this also means that all my emotions about myself aren't really about me at all, but in relation to other people. 

An example: My grandad recently died, and I was not really sad, I just was. However when I think about the loss my mom, my dad, my sister, my grandmother and others have gone through, I am moved to tears and can weep for them. 

Does this make sense to anyone? What the hell is wrong with me? Does this kind of thing have a name or anything where I can read up on it or something? What can I do?",09Dec2017,1
273,"Hello, r/advice, I was wondering if there’s any hope for me to become more physically fit and if I could get advice to do so, if that is possible. 

I don’t know if this is the best place to post this but I don’t know where else to turn. Ever since I was younger I have always been physically weak and I was always behind everyone physically. I would get bullied a lot for being weaker, especially during gym class in my younger years. I’ve tried to work out before to fix myself but it’s never worked. I was always behind everyone. It’s humiliating for me to go to the gym due to the fact that I’m 16 and my maximum curl weight is 30 pounds and my maximum benchpress is 20 pounds on either side. I have never been able to do 100 push ups consecutively and I’ve always been stuck like this. I can’t even go to my local gym anymore because I get ridiculed there all the time and someone who beat me up goes there. I feel sad all the time since I look like a fucking goblin. Please help me.

However, whenever we text each other, I can strangely feel MORE love but then whenever I see her in person it kinda fades away . 

She never puts any effort in conversations anymore (i just get one word answers) , is always snappy whenever I ask her normal everyday questions , doesn’t ever want to kiss/hug.. I just feel my energy being taken away from my body when I’m with her these days. But then there are moments of hope when I go away and she texts me saying she loves me.... I’m so conflicted.

278,"This is a bit odd but I really need advice. For my high school graduation in 2016 my mom's aunt and cousin spent at least 100 hours making a handmade quilt for me that contained my childhood school shirts and such. It was a huge amount of work and it is HUGELY important to my mom and to her aunt. 
I recently moved states and realized that the quilt never made it here. I am 95% certain I left it in the closet at my old place but the landlord said everything was empty when I left. 
Yet I searched my entire house and it's not here. 
What do I do? Do I tell my mom? It's possible that I could get away with her never knowing by just never bringing it up (it's always in storage anyways) but there's always a small chance she might want to look at it at some point in the rest of my life. 
If I tell her, it will break her heart. She will be so angry and disappointed in me, I can't even describe to you guys. It would be a complete and total disaster. 
But keeping it from her feels wrong? I don't know what to do.  I feel so guilty and sad about this. ",09Dec2017,2

283,"So here is the situation. My parents don't want me living with them any longer. I graduated from a top public university with an advertising degree in July. Currently work part-time at a real estate office making 15 an hour and 30 hours a week. Right now I make 400 weekly and I have 3k saved up from working the past 4 months. I live in a smaller south florida town (suburbs)

My friend has a place that he could get me a job at in Orlando florida, making not a ton, but full time with health insurance. Potentially taking home 2k a month. Advertising is very much who you know and at the moment I don't know anyone. I think that living in a bigger city would expose me to more career prospects.


So, the things I need help with are as follows.

-Do I take this gig with him?

-If that doesn't work out, what other stable jobs would I be able to get as someone with a college degree and 8 months of a real estate marketing job experience? 

-How much needs to be saved up before I move out? (Currently I can fit everything I own into my car and move at the drop of a hat.)",09Dec2017,1
284,"I posted an add on Craigslist looking for side work like babysitting, house sitting, dog walking/sitting and errands for money because I’m currently unemployed and desperately looking for a job as I have some bills coming up. 
This morning I get a messages from a guy and so far everything seems legit but he does need some account info for direct deposit as he is overseas. His phone number has a +1 in front of it. I really need a job and I don’t know if it’s okay to provide him the info he needs I don’t want to get my account swiped and be flat broke? 
I need some advice of things to ask to make sure this is legit. 

Here is our conversation: 

Him: Hi, your ad caught my eye and I've got a good job proposition for you that might convince you to work for me

Me: yes? 

Him: I am looking for someone who can handle my errands at his/her spare time and I'm willing to pay well for the services offered.

Me: I’m definitely interested 

Him: I would love to meet and discuss with you about this job but I am currently away on business. I am in Lower Hutt, New Zealand so there will be no interview. I'm always busy down here and when you're out of the country it's hard to inspect the goods to know if they are in good shape or not and to track the exact locations. I will also have my mails and paintings forwarded to your address. If you will be unable to stay at your house to get them, I can have it shipped to a post office near you and then you can pick it up at your convenience. I will be paying for all the expenses including gas money,you won't be working more than 8-9 hours per week for $450 per week. Is that okay with you?

Me: Okay, thank you! that sounds good. So I will be picking up your paintings and your mail and taking them to you home here in Arkansas? 

Him: When you get my paintings; you check and confirm they are in good shape and  you are expected to send them to where I want them sent to. You won't be taking money out of your pocket, all you have to do is to have my paintings shipped to your house and do some shopping once in while when we need to get the customers gift alongside the paintings. You are allowed to open them to reveal its content.

Me: Okay, would a post office near me work?  my mail box is no bigger than a few inches. So I wouldn’t want anything being damaged 

Him: Yes. Please fill out the following details to find the closest UPS store to you
Name: Address: City: State: Zip Code: Email:

Me: (sends address of closest UPS near me, I don’t give him my exact address yet.) 

Him: I will provide you my personal UPS account number for Shipping. All you have to do is provide my UPS number and shipping charges will be applied into the account. I will provide clear set of instructions for each task I need done as well as the funds to cover them. I will also send you the list and pictures of each paintings involved.

Me: Okay sounds great. When will I start? 

Him: Well I want us to first finalize the payment procedure and everything that has to do with it, then we can move on, I wouldn't want you working for me and I find it hard to pay you. I will be making payment available for you through direct deposit, I hope you do have an actual bank account where payment can be made to? And No. The $450 will be yours only. And another fund will be made available for the tasks

Me: I currently do not have a job and to open my bank account would require a deposit. I can call today to figure everything today. But if I can’t open one today once I start making some Income that is the the first thing I can do. (I’m struggling atm &amp; maybe I shouldn’t  said that?)

Him: Ok

Me: If that does not work for you I understand.

Him: Ok

Me: I have a bank account set up if you’re still wanting to work with me

285,"Hi! So,

I'm a 20yo guy.
I have a full-time job, live with my parents and I have a very good relationship with them. I work 10h/day, and I have the rest of the day almost entirely free. That's basically my life right now.

Yeah, I do have my hobbies. Actually, only one: Play videogames. I've always been a huge fan of them.

My days basically consist in: wake up, go to work, get back to home, do random stuff and sleep. Then, the cycle restarts. Every. Single. Day. For the past years.

This is a very boring life and I'm so tired of it. I don't even know if I'm depressed or not. I just think everything is boring. 

I've been trying to change this. But everything I start to do something, I drop it in the next day. I've tried to learn guitar, learn other languages, hanging out with my friends more often, applying for courses, watching TV series, anime, movies, and a lot of other things... But I just can't do the same thing for more than 5 minutes. I can't even listen to a song anymore, cuz I get tired of it in the middle.

So, basically: I'm lacking of motivation to live.

Don't get me wrong. I want to study. I want to work. I want to hit the gym. I want to hangout with my friends. And I have more time than anyone to do it! But at the same time, I don't want to do any of these. All I do is sit in my room and surf the net all day. And it doesn't matter how hard I try, I just can't change this. What do I do?

289,"I do something called matched betting, which is risk-free betting.

Whenever I make money off it, I have an itch to spend those earnings and I think of it as getting something for free pretty much, since I didn't pay or work really to get them (just sit at my PC which I do anyway). However, I wouldn't really spend that money if it was my own money - not that I couldn't afford it, I'm just a bit tight.

How can I get out of the mindset of wanting to spend my earnings, and not treating it like money I earned at work?",09Dec2017,2

But some days, like today, I wake up pissed off for no reason I can figure out.  And every little thing, positive or negative, makes it worse. Even someone just talking makes me want to explode. 

Like, my chest hurts I'm so furious. I want to just go on a rampage and destroy everything. I want to verbally eviscerate people. I'm not going to do these things, because I know better, but I still want to.

Any tips on how to calm down and avoid the rage?

294,"(21M) I have been in and out of many specialist and the ER on multiple occasions which all amounted to nothing. I have gotten so many test done and I feel like my life is in ruins especially my social life.

I have been having the most extensive brain fog imaginable and I feel like I'm losing small pieces of my self day by day and there nothing I can do to stop it.

I wake up every morning and I just feel blank and I fall asleep at night I feel blank and normally don't even dream. I have gotten a multiple test done but still nothing.

I feel like my life has ended before it ever really began. I have gotten a CT, MRI, and an EEG and every doctor in the ER has told me that they don't really know what to do.

I have had loud popping in my ears and pretty intense sinus pressure which i also got checked at an ENT I was diagnosed with enlarged adenoids, eustachian tube dysfunction, and tinnitus.

I was given steroid medications such as fluticasone, certizine, and azelastine yeah it did subside some of my breathing issues and pressure in my forehead. But my thinking is just as messy.

I have had blood work done as well as allergy test to no avail. My dad has a had messed up sinuses, and my mom has an auto immune disease.

Everyday I miss I begin to wonder more and more wether or not my life is every going to get back to normal. I have no one to lean on my mom is to sick to help and my dad doesn't really take it seriously.

I have had these issues for 3 years and my PCP referred me to a psychiatrist because they think I might have an inattentive type of add.

I just don't know if I'm buying it. If It was add I would have to think the problems would have persisted since childhood unless they somehow worsened with age.

I feel like I can speak through text fine but feel like I'm to slow in a in-person conversation. I also go to the gym and do a lot of powerlifting. I bring this up because I don't know if back issues could contribute somehow?

I feel like hopes running out and I'm running out of time and I feel stupid and my recollection is awful feels non existent. Its like I'm just living in the moment with no prior knowledge. I feel blank all the time and I could never see any future of a social life of any sort under these circumstances.

If anyone can relate or help me out in anyway I could use it. I don't have a car and my insurance isn't great its blue cross and blue shield community. All I want is to feel normal and will never be satisfied until that day comes so if anyone can help me get there I would be grateful.
