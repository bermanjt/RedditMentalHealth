i'm a senior in highschool, i have a 2.97 gpa and 1340 out of 1600 sat score, always had trouble with english and history but had As in math and science.
Today I just found out that i've failed my english and history class and have to retake them this next semester. I wanted to go to a ny state school but i dont think i have any chance at all.

8,"I just recently started university and I have no friends. I've made 2 friends in total. The only problem is that they're roommates who live on the other side of campus from me. They once invited me out but one of the girls had me take a photo of them and she subsequently edited and posted the photo, without even asking me if I would like one. Then, the girl whom I had thought was a better friend, did the exact same. I think there's something wrong with me. Even in high school I couldn't make any friends. I'm not going to lie--I'm an 18 year old female who is relatively fit and I do not find any gripes in my appearance. I literally didn't stop talking during the first couple days of orientation, I was incredibly outgoing. I thought college would be different but it's just as cliquey as ever. Ugh. I could really use some words of wisdom right now if anyone sees this.",31Jan2017,2
10,"Hey all, controls engineer here. My company got involved with a big tobacco firm and I've been put on a project. It's a small role,  but my wife is livid. She is now saying I work for murderers and I'm not in disagreement. Her dad is on the downward spiral of COPD. In an effort to hurt this company more than I'll help them, we tossed around the idea of donating the money I would be paid for the installation period to an organization that opposes tobacco use. I want to find the most efficient one. This can be a legal fund for lawsuits, a cessation advocacy group, legal action to limit market expansion or &lt;other&gt;. I'm open to ideas. Help me get the most bang for my buck. I'm specifically working with a smokeless tobacco subsidiary.

Before the question comes, yes, I did ask to be taken off this. It's such a fast project, there isn't time to vet another engineer by the Big Tob company. Going forward though, I'll be exempt from this customer.

11,"I started working for Amazon last November during their high volume ""peak"" season for xmas.

I was doing good as a picker and 2 weeks ago I could get 160 ""picks"" per hour without even putting in a lot of physical effort. Keep in mind that I was walking throughout all of this.

Now two weeks ago they layed off almost all the temp employees at one warehouse and transferred a small number to another warehouse where they mostly ride ""[order pickers](http://i.imgur.com/J4Id6Kc.jpg)"" to grab items off the shelves.

In Dec 2015, I sprained my ankle really badly. It has been okay during my heavy walking throughout amazon as a picker.

However, to drive an order picker, you need to put your foot on a deadman's switch, which is a circular area that doesn't have much padding and isn't 100% level with the rest of the platform. It is positioned on the left side, which is also the side of my previously hurt ankle.

This has aggravated my sprained ankle and it feels like it is sprained again. It's only been two weeks and I can't really walk on it without pain. I've tried using a brace and putting my foot on the switch at different position. Next week I'm going to try to position my right foot and see if I can drive it as well as I can now.

Anyways, if that works I can last a few more weeks and get hired on full time to put in a transfer back to the other facility I was originally at.

Here's where I want advice. What if I can't make it? What do I do about my lease? I've been saving my money, but only can pay rent for 3 more months.

My ankle is shit and needs like two weeks of rest. I couldn't go back to the other warehouse and walk for 10 hours because of the state of my ankle. I'm scared to be honest. I don't know what to do. If I let amazon know as a temp that my ankle hurts and I can't really work on it, my ass will be out the door faster than I can type this sentence.

14,"Hi everyone, I am looking for advice on this situation regarding Amazon charging me because of a friend.
A while back my friend had Amazon student prime so I asked if I could order something with my debit card on his account and he said yes. So I used it, and I guess my card stayed on record in his account. (I agree that it was foolish of me not to delete my card, I must have forgot.) Later on he rents a textbook with HIS card and recently I saw amazon charged $375 on MY card. I called customer support and they said since his card was declined and he did not return the textbook, the next card on his account would be charged. They said the best thing to do would be to file a dispute and say something along the lines of ""I never authorized the transaction.""
I called my bank and asked for advice and they said I could either talk to the friend who rented it to pay me back or file a dispute and see if it holds up so I can get my money back and that if I wanted to, to go up there tomorrow and file one.
So I talked to my friend and he said he could pay me back in a month. 
Basically what I am asking is, would it be quicker to get the money back if I file a dispute or would it even hold up because I did leave my card on his account? Or should I accept my friend's word and let him pay me back in a month. 
I've never filed a dispute so I have no idea what would happen or how long it would take.",31Jan2017,1
16,"My SO was a virgin prior to meeting me. The best way to describe her is as innocent. She took great pride in keeping virginity for someone special. I am someone with a dark past, that had sex with 5 people, 4 of them strangers, 2 times unprotected prior to meeting SO.(I only checked for hiv then, but am in the process of checking for every other std) I lied about it and my SO thought I had sex with just 1 person, protected.Â  Why did I lie? I was a coward and knew she would be very hurt. I finally told her the truth, and it absolutely broke her heart, since by this point we were also having protected sex. She thought I was the dirtiest person she ever knew, and that she never had seen such lies. All the more I am the one she gave her life long valued virginity to. The other thing that has been heavily depressing her has been the physical part of our sex was not better than my previous sex with strangers. She said she forgives me for what I did and who I was, but can not deal with being the same or worse as my other sexual encounters. I am not sure how to proceed. A part of me just wanted to keep her happy with the lies, and she was. But a part of me also could not lie to this person that considered me their soulmate anymore. I realize I am a selfish coward. I need advice on what steps to take from now in order to take care of her the best way I can. Please help me. I feel very guilty, and she will never jus9t forget about this.",31Jan2017,6
18,"In continuation of my earlier post ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5qq365/18fthis_girl_lied_to_me_the_entire_time/ ) ...

She even admitted that she was ONLY my friend because I was friends with someone more successful than her.  She said a bunch of other horrible stuff including calling my friend ""worthless"" and she commented something nasty on the comments. Here's essentially what she said:

19,"

I apologize before hand because this may be a little bit long, I also apologize for the severe amount of grammatical errors.  I am seeking advice for my non blood brother, let's call him Tom.  By non blood brother I mean, I was basically taken in by his family when I was 12, after my grandmother passed away,  my parents were never really in the picture.  So tom's family accepted me to their family with open hearts and arms.  

About myself,  when I was 18 I went to school to become an automotive technician at my local community college, during my schooling I landed an entry level job, and was quite happy.  After getting associates I moved from a coastal town in southern Cali to Portland, Oregon for a tech position at a dealership.  A few years goes by and I became privy to how dirty the automotive repair industry was.  So I quit and opened up a small business in a completely different field.  My business did so well I was able to pay off my mortgage completely in 3 years.  Still to this day it is doing quite well, and I attribute that to my strong work ethic.  I love what I do, and am very thankful to be met with this much success at the age of 28.

My brother Tom on the other hand also 28, dropped out high school, with out getting a GED.  Over the past 12 years he has been employed for 3 months!!!!! He for lack of a better word, mooches off his very wealthy father as well as his mother.  He has been with same girl for the past 13 years, and they live in a condo bought by her parents, also very wealthy.  Tom has the work ethic of a dead moth, much like his gf, who collects disability, but also work at a part time job in retail.  Tom has no history of addiction or substance abuse, but all he does is sleep and play video games (possible video game addiction), rinse and repeat.  Tom knows that he is approaching 30 and has very little to show for the past 10 years.  Here are a few bullet points about Tom to make the situation a little more clear.

-very lacking in common sense
-poor driving record 
-not very mechanically inclined 
-does not work well under pressure 
-when faced with confrontation he isolates himself 
-possibly an over thinker 
-horrible with computers
-very shy with people
-conditions of the condo, disgusting at best
-personal hygiene is fair to poor

The relationship between him and his GF is alright, but I believe they both fuel each others laziness.  Let's call her Amanda, she is far worse off than him even though she works 8 hours a week, she for lack of a better word is  unintelligent, and has found that the stupider she is, the more handouts she gets.  I would tell Tom to break up with Amanda, but that's hard to do after 13 years.

I am much like Tom when it came to school.  We both really struggled deeply all throughout school, even with more than adequate tutoring, and being placed in remedial classes.  I suffered from a learning disorder, but found that I was really good with working with my hands, as well as working with people when it comes to customer service.  Tom just gave up during his junior year of high school, and has been stagnant ever since.  Toms parents divorced in 2007 and he claims he still struggles with that, I believe that is a cop out.  I talk with his mother frequently, and she is very well read, educated, and an all around great person.  She tired of dealing with his stagnant lifestyle and wants me to do something about it, and with a quickness.  He will be visiting me soon and I'm supposed help him at least get going in some direction.  I plan on teaching him how to write a resume and cover letter, how to fill out a job application, and tips for interviewing.  

Here is where I ask for advice.  How do you build a resume at 28 years old with very minimal almost no work experience as a high school drop out????  Also what should he say during the interview? Should he be honest about what has happened?  Or should we fabricate some bullshit story where he had a family obligation to care for ""aunt Mary"" for the past 10 years, making money doing side jobs, because most employers aren't really going to like the answer ""For the past 10 years I've been a lazy piece of shit"".  Thanks for your advice.

TL;DR:  my 28 year old brother is a lazy POS, same with his gf that he's been also lazy and very stupid.  Mom wants to shop him up to me try and get him a job.  Need help and advice.",31Jan2017,1

He romanticized it from my point of view. At the end of high school everything seemed ""OK"". He was taking advanced classes but didn't do very well.

The police showed up at his dorm this night looking for him. He sent some very worrying texts to his sisters and apparently bought a rope coil online. There also seems to be a bit of confusion as to when he went missing, either three hours ago or over the weekend.

He took some very elementary courses his first semester. He took BC Calculus in high school and took an introductory algebra course last semester. He bragged to my little brother about getting all A's and my brother gave him shit for taking easy classes. He hid this from everyone (he lied about the classes he was taking).

38,"I live in a fairly affluent neighborhood that is surrounded by lower income areas.  We have our occasional problems, but it's mostly a very decent place to live.  Over the last few years we've had a few run ins with a group of teens who are now escalating and I genuinely don't know what to do.  It's to the point where I come home from work every single day actually surprised that windows aren't broken or the entire place is burned to the ground.

These kids attend the high school up the street.  Our home is on their direct route home and they pass by at least twice every day.  Because of an after school group, their times passing on the way home are pretty random.  It started innocently enough with pens and things being thrown on our property.  Nothing to make a fuss over.  Then a few things being stolen like a bulldog statue and a few bushes trampled on.  Again, it's the price of living where we do.

Eventually, a BB was shot at our cat sitting in the front window.  We heard it hit the window and the cat jumped.  We saw the group of kids running away and found the BB below the window.  Called the cops and were told there wasn't much to be done about it.

Last year, a brick was pulled from our landscaping, broken on the side walk, and thrown at our house and that of our neighbors.  Again, we called the cops, but not much they could do.

In the last few months, they have thrown rocks at our doors and windows.  Before Halloween, they came on to the porch and grabbed pumpkins to throw them at the house.  The siding was damaged and we got pictures of them.  A few days ago, I was pulling up to the house and saw them.  I had my car window down and overheard them talking about how they were going to ""get us"".  Tonight I heard them outside planning to break a particular window in the house and I know something was thrown at the house, but it's dark and I can't find it.

Every time we call the cops, we're told there's nothing they can do because they're juveniles.  I've had a cop state he knows who they are and they're still powerless.  Evidently, the kids know their records get wiped clean at 18, so why not rack up the charges?  We've caught them in video and in pictures, upped the security measures, I bought protective film to put over the windows in case of breakage, they know we're watching, but they don't care and I'm on edge.

I'm really wanting to move at this point, because really, what's to stop them from burning the place down?  They know they have the upper hand and I feel like the more I watch for them, the more they escalate, but I can't be here to watch all the time and I can't just stop being vigilant.  Moving really isn't an option at this time and I just don't know what to do.

He is very socially awkward and basically keeps to himself. He makes good money and most of the people who know him frequently ask for loans or some sort of financial help, which makes him distance himself from people that much more. He is very depressed and thinks the only reason people care at all is because he has money. He has changed to the point that spending a couple hundred dollars really stresses him out even though it's no big deal as far as what he needs. Basically, he is a tightwad. He lets money rule his life to an extent. He is very smart, he knows that he needs to get out of his comfort zone, but he doesn't really try very hard. He is constantly down on himself and always telling me how much better I have it than him, which bums me out pretty bad.

They tell me I'm a great friend, I'm kind, intelligent, creative, funny, helpful, Yada Yada Yada... But at the end of the day, no one wants to have sex with me or become emotionally intimate. I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm tired of torturing myself with hopes and fantasies that have without fail been nothing more than the prelude to another round of misery and hopelessness.

I don't need to hear that ""you'll find someone, just give it time, there's someone out there for you."" maybe there is, but I'm 29, have never even cuddled or had my first kiss, let alone been in a relationship, and not for lack of trying. I don't want to hear that ""you need to learn to love yourself and love being single"", well maybe that's true for people coming out of a relationship, but as someone who has never not been single, I think I know the pros and cons tyvm. And I can't wait until I'm in my 50s for someone to finally want to be with me. I'm extremely lonely and it just gets harder and harder to cope.

I could turn to drugs and alcohol, but I'd rather not, I'd rather just kill myself now than drown and numb the pain for a decade, only to end it then. So I'm looking for a way to just stop having these feelings. I want to kill my lust and longing before I just kill them and everything else about me.

I'm gay, but I hate being gay, there's nothing good about it and it's only ever made my life harder. I wish I could be straight, or at this point I'd settle for asexual. But, despite what some fools believe, you just can't consciously change your desires no matter how hard you try, and I have tried many many times. I don't want to change my desires anymore, I want to kill them.

I know there are drugs which can affect libido, a few years back I intentionally took drugs for that single purpose, despite the objections of my friends, family, and psychiatrist. They actually worked, my libido was gone, I had no sexual desire, and felt free. Unfortunately those meds had other effects which almost killed me, so my psychiatrist refused to give me any more. 

Even with my libido gone, the longing for emotional intimacy never went away. And I suspect that it's a much harder feeling to mute.

But anyways, there you have it, my pathetic life. I'm not looking for sympathy, not looking for a hug, I'm looking for solutions to a problem. If you guys have any, I'd love to hear them. 

However, if you think I should let Jesus into my heart and accept God's endless love, if that's your solution, it won't work. I tried that too, but deluding myself with a pleasant fiction doesn't last long before my critical thinking rips it to shreds.

Thanks,

43,"Okay, so I need someone to tell me what to do. I'm a 17 year old heterosexual male, and I'm stuck. This last Summer I fell in love. I became addicted to this girl I met at nationals for speech and debate. I met her, and the girl I had been with for 13 months at the time became nothing to me. Everything felt like it clicked, I broke up with my girlfriend for her, and we spent everyday together adventuring, or laying around, or fucking, or watching netflix, just having fun. I fell so quickly it was shocking, I was absolutely head over heels, lovingly giving foot rubs and back massages for hours on end just to provide an example. She left for college, out of nowhere blocked me on everything, posted a few messages like she was sad about having to let me go, then never talking to me again. I suppose that may have been the best thing for her to do, trying not to be attached to home or whatever, but that whole cut off everything idea didn't work for me. I have layed in bed literally every single night since the night she blocked me on everything thinking about her. Dreaming about her. It's been eight months and things have not changed. I've lost my mind. Trying to get over her I tried getting new hobbies, staying busy, getting a job (working 70 hour weeks), trying a harder class-lode (taking six college courses junior year), throwing myself into extra curriculars (working so hard in drama and debate that I would qualify to three more national tournaments and break into finals at all three of them, as well as make history in mocktrial making it to nationals for the first time ever for my school and first time for my city in 30 years), I tried dating girls, random flings, more romantic stuff, I tried sleeping around, running (cardio), eating a lot  (gained 20 pounds), starving myself (lost 60 pounds), drinking, drugs, smoking, cutting, therapy, antidepressants, prostitution (selling and buying), meditation, moving out of my mother's house, and everything else I could think of. Nothing has helped. I still think of her LITERALLY every day. No exaggeration. Please... someone tell me what I am supposed to do. I fell in love with her, and she took my heart with her. I have no way to get in touch to get it back. Please give me ideas on what to do, because I'm falling apart.

TLDR: I fell in love with a girl, she moved away blocking me from all contact and I cannot get over her.",31Jan2017,1

Right now I'm not able to stand on my own two feet so I want to save up and before I leave him but I also feel like crap for prolonged this for my daughter. The only reason I think he's hanging around so I don't tell the other girl. The reason I think that's because when I asked him to show me he ended it with her he told me he deleted the message and when I told him that I was going to talk to her he got mad and said it our relationship shit and we need to work through it together.

Day or night she's there. I don't know why. I've asked her before and she says shes ""waiting for a friend"" and then leaves but she clearly isn't. I wouldn't really mind but it kind of creeps my son out when I'm putting him to bed and he notices someone outside. I would talk to her parents but I don't know who she is or where she lives but it must be close since she is always here. Anytime I try to come out to say anything to her she runs away.

49,"Throwaway for obvious reasons:

I work in a public school as a specialist and I supervise some personnel if I am in the building at the time (I am a step under director). One such person came to me Friday and reported a pretty serious case of abuse that involved a student and another educator. What it involved was pinning a kid against the wall and pushing their head into said wall, which alone is not permitted. The other part is that the person in question yelled at the person designated to help this student that they can just be their reward and that they can handle this situation.

It was reported to the principal of the school, myself, and the director. The director and principal feel as if this is a witch hunt against this person due to the classroom she is in not really getting along with her (she's negative, yells at kids, etc... but I am putting that aside professionally). They ""investigated"" today by interviewing the accuser and persona accused. They just said that the team should have monthly meetings to go over issues. I don't necessarily agree with this since I have always been taught to report any suspicion. I went to the head of the union to make her aware of this situation, but the principal did not like that so now he is trying to get us to not discuss anything anymore. I figured that if a person in the union is involved, the district should be prepared to activate an attorney.

This morning I met with the director to see if I should report it and she said that I didn't directly see it so we are going on hearsay. She said to not report it and they would take care of it, but from the sounds of it they are just dismissing it on the grounds that they believe it is a witch hunt (which they did say to me). 

I was just looking for advice on what I should do about this situation. It's kept me up at night... I called the DCF hotline without going into detail and they said I should get the person who saw it to report it, but she doesn't feel like it fits the abuse definition. I have the report filled out ready to mail if need be, but I am fearing going against my director's decision. Any advice would be great.

To clarify: I am a licensed psychologist (BCBA) in Massachusetts. The director also is named in an abuse lawsuit in her last district.",31Jan2017,1
51,"What's up, r/advice?

Hopefully some of you intelligent people can help me out. I'm a 20 year old American Male, high school graduate, completed 3 semesters at a mediocre university, then dropped out after realizing that I probably wasn't on a beneficial path. I've basically had my head stuck in the sand, though I hope to pull it out- at the risk of facing the starkness of reality. It wasn't until this past semester that I realized the vast importance of education, especially in regards to the preservation of democracy, which I've neglected my entire life. I've been watching a lot of videos and reading recently from intellectuals who stress the importance of living an authentic life, which is marked by the ability to articulate (a domain in which I'm quite lacking) and being able to make informed decisions. As a person who tends to be naturally submissive, I worry immensely about being subjected to living a life relegated to dumbly following orders. One of the classes that really opened my eyes to the richness of the world of thought was philosophy, and consequently, I think that I'd like to study that, or the liberal arts in general. However! Pragmatically, that may not be the best option- possibly putting myself in substantial debt which might be ironically helping me attain a free mind at the cost of slavery to debt. There's also the fact that being more intellectually oriented can bring great suffering and frustration. My other option is to study nursing, which (hopefully) would assure a safe career option looking forward, and the opportunity to travel. At this point in my life, I'd like to have both, but it doesn't seem like I'll be able to have my cake and eat it too. Advice? Suggestions?",31Jan2017,1
52,"Not a native speaker. I would like some evaluations on my behavior and attitude please.

I had some traumatizing memories during my childhood, which led to me being introverted and desensitized me heavily starting from 4th grade (apparently I was energetic before then). I have turned apathetic and stone cold according to my peers in primary school, and I didn't care but ended up starting to produce fake responses (laugh, sad face, etc.) in order to fit in more since 7th grade. 

I would be open to do anyone who wasn't an asshole to me a favor with an ""Eh, sure, why not."" and that was my response to almost everything I was asked to do/participate in, that I had no opposing opinions to. Now I'm close to stepping into university, I want to know if this is messed up or an acceptable way of living (and does that response discourage other people/carry a negative connotation?).

Perhaps a better question would be: Does apathy translate to confidence, recklessness or negativity?

Some personal input:

Faking emotion doesn't tire me in any way. I'm not depressed or have anxiety (at least I tend to think so). I'm perfectly comfortable with my life except how I'm living it (which I'm now questioning myself about). It seems that apathy has pinned me in the neutral part of the emotional spectrum, where it is difficult to experience happiness but also I couldn't shed a tear when I heard a relative pass away. It also appeared to make me much more straightforward in delivery because my response to that was : ""Aw, that's a shame. When's the funeral?"" which is why I wanted some opinions.

Of course, open to constructive criticism, and somewhere, a small part deep down in my heart would be thrilled to do something new if my lifestyle really needs to change.

56,"So I am after a little feedback/advice/ideas? My IndieSelection.com site is due to be renewed on the 14th of Feb (oh how sweet...)
It has unfortunately only made 1 sale in the last 6 months.
I don't care about paying a few hundred a year to have a site that people use, however it is difficult to justify renewing it for another year, when it gets NO visitors or sales, even the FREE content is rarely viewed... Can't even justify paying to keep it as a not for profit archive, as it just gets soooo little traffic.
I could advertise on the site and use it as a place where artists only distribute free content or samples to generate interest for their own sites? I don't know...I'm open though :)
It has been years of work for me at this point, but it is hard to justify spending any more time/life on it, if no-one is ever going to benefit from what I have tried to do. I had hoped that it would gather momentum, artists would be exited to promote it, it would grow organically and customers would be interested in trying something new...

65,"So last year, I became friends with someone with similar likes and hobbies to me. She is also similar to me in appearance as well. It wasn't a problem then, and we just talked about various things. Overtime, (this year) I realized that we were almost too similar, and she was trying to sync up with me even more, doing practically everything I did. This made me feel kinda uncomfortable, and I wanted to branch out because of this and figure out what I really wanted to do. So I've spaced myself away from her as much as I can, and as I have, I've realized something.

She's way better than me on all fronts. [well...](/s ""she's got really bad acne breakout on her face, but I don't hold that against her. plus, you get used to it after a while so I've never really thought or cared about it much"")

She's getting A's in all of her classes and incredibly diligent with her classwork, she has a healthy social life with over 10+ friends, she is very attentive in class, she's kind enough to hold the door for anybody and everybody to the point where she's become a permanent door holder in some cases, pays for people's food or whatever if they don't appear to have the money, insistently URGES that she can handle the cost, whatever it is, can make people laugh with her jokes and commentary, is extremely sympathetic towards others and peppers them with hugs and compliments when they're feeling down, is very skilled at video games and can accomplish things leagues faster than I ever could, (ex: completing an entire Pokedex and beating a main Pokemon story in under a week) always thanks people and apologizes when passing by them. 
Meanwhile, I...

Sometimes I just wonder if my friends (who many are mutuals with her too) would just rather be with her than me. I've never brought that up, and they've never said so, but I've been feeling so negative lately that I feel like I'm bringing them down with me. Like, obviously you don't want to hang around a really depressed and not fun person, so you'll see this other, more positive person that's kinda similar, and automatically like them more. And this is all because I keep pitting myself against her and getting really bummed out because of it. Like obviously, she's the better version of me, and is actively more considerate and caring than I could ever be. And it isn't even a contest, like it's all just probably me thinking too much or something. I really want to do something different with my life, but everything I even attempt something, she's one step ahead of me and already succeding at it.

Examples of why I want my retail manager replaced:

My coworker was very sick and was on antibiotics. She came into work anyway. Into her shift, she broke out in hives from the antibiotics. She looked like a tomato... And my manager refused to let her go home early. Would you say that my coworker could've been contagious, for one thing? 

Another time, a coworker found out her dad was in the hospital, dying from cancer. She asked my manager if she could be with him in the hospital and she told her something like ""People die from cancer all the time. I have and lot of family members who've died from cancer. There'll be more to come so it's not a big deal.""

I'll probably think of more examples later, but that's all I have for now! 

I've told my coworkers to go to the district manager about their problems with our manager. But everyone's afraid that the district manager won't keep things confidential.. And that he'll end up talking to our manager about the problems. Nobody wants to get fired. :(

And are these examples enough reason to get my manager replaced? Or is this normal shit in the retail world?

68,"Hi, I am a 26 year old ex chef based in Brisbane Australia,  who is in need of some  solid sound advice. I guess the best way to go about this is to give you guys some context. I also apologise in advance for the length of this post and many thanks to the people who put up with my terrible grammar. 

My parents were divorced when I was 10 years old and being a male I lucked out on a strong father figure. My dad was great growing up but the booze and work always got the best of him. Hence why Mum left.

Mum was great she always tried so hard to get by. However now being an adult I kind of realise hoe flawed she was. Could never really stick to anything more than 18 months at a time. I feel that rubbed off on me when I was in my teenage years.

Growing up I had a moderate case of depression and anxiety which caused me to make some very stupid decisions. For some reason I moved to my Dad's (I think lack of father figure waa a big contributor to that). That only made matters worse I suffered a great deal of mental and physical trauma and eventually moved back after just barely passing year 11. (Prior to that I actually did really well at school solid B+  averages in IT , Math and Science, B- to B in English based  Subjects)

After suffering a broken arm by the hands of my Father I moved back home broken and emotional, a bit more so than a standard 16 year old. So for some reason I decided to repeat year 11. That didn't end, bad grades and my depression / anxiety was pretty bad. All my old friends or most of them had exiled me. I made my first attempt at sucide when I was 17, I stopped myself when I found out my sister had a miscarriage and it earthed me.

Things were better for awhile but I had quit school and was working fulltime at a deli. It wasn't healthy for me to be around at school. I evetually moved to Brisbane and worked at another deli fulltime while living with one of the few friends I still had.

I decided that enough was enough. I enrolled in Tafe to complete my highschool. (which  for people in USA and other regions it is a type of college for technical skills). I did really well but I couldnt complete it there were a few deaths in the family and I ended up being the emotional rock / punching bag.

I became an apprentice chef. Which I was doing really well nominated for a few awards but being in the hospitality industry I couldnt get the time off to compete. Then when all was well I was involved in a pretty bad accident. I had been pushed off the side of the road while riding my bicycle and fractured my spine in 5 places. (Don't worry I can still walk no damage to my spinal cord) 12 months of physical therapy and I was back on the line. 

The injury I sustained had a huge mental effect on my self worth. Could no longer move as fast, work as long etc. Determined to actually finished something I persevered. Then one day I snapped. Made a noose and tried to hang myself, Rope snapped go figure. I checked myself into a hospital and got assigned a shrink.

The shrink helped quite a bit a lot more than the one beforehand and not before too long, I had a girlfriend  completed my apprenticeship, had a decent job. All was well, then being somewhat of an introverted emotional cripple I drifted away from her. Mainly because I loved her and I didnt want to let the crazy out. For some reason she took that as me cheating on her went through my phone while asleep only to find text messages to friends asking for advice on how do I say those 3 words. Huge fight broke out. I quit my Chef de Partie job, moved in with her and got a job doing tech support for a call centre.


Now this starting to leave me at the present..

When we moved in she didnt really have much of a job and was very damaged due to serperate mental health issues. so I became her rock both financially and mentally. (I had already been through a lot so what was a little more) not having a lot of money we needed furniture bond etc being a young couple is hard these days especially when your parents can't help you out. So i saved and got a loan. I made a deal with girlfriend at the time I buy the furniture she pays for bond which would be cheaper.

Things were going well but I didnt realise how little she actually earned so I quickly accrued a lot of debt in supporting the both of us. Eventually the finaces and me not opening up broke us up and she cheated on me and took all the furniture and 2 weeks later moved in with the person she had an affair with. I was left with paying rent, handling the bond cleaning, rent and paying all the disconnection fees.

So now I am stuck in position where:

- I have never completed my highschool
- Have a wealth of experience in customer service and the workforce
- In a job that I detest due to types of calls I handle
- Never completed my highschooling
- About to be consumed by bills and debt from a breakup (about 12k, 5.5k on credit card and 5.5k on a personal loan and the rest on bills repays are $300 a fortnight)
- Nor do I have a license due to my chaotic childhood  I never had a chance to get past my leaners ( I know how to drive, just never had a chance to take the test)

I think the debt is the biggest thing that is waning on me right now. All I want to do is have some meaning back into my life. I would honstly love to study and conplete my highschooling go to university and become a social worker / physical therapist. However, I have done the math several times over and I just simply cannot afford it.

I have looked into government sponsored debt loans however my bank keeps insisting that I am making the repayments just fine (which is one of the conditions)

I have prided myself on ""making it on my own"" and by no means am I looking for sympathy I am just looking for some sound advice. I have dealt with my demons as best as I can.

Also, sorry for the long post I have only actually told this much to my shrink. Even my family doesn't know this much about me. We are close but I have had to lool after them for so long I have never really had a chance to vent unless I was paying  $120/h.",31Jan2017,1
69,"So, prepare yourself for a complicated story. I have two older brothers, I'll call them Jack and Joe. Well, they both have a lot of problems, and they defineltely struggle. So I'll start with jack. Jack has always been quiet, and he's always had a big heart but his mind has always seem clouded/affected by something else, something that's bigger than him. Well, a year or so ago, after countless times of him losing jobs, getting new girlfriends, having crazy scary dreams, moving schools trying to graduate highschool but never actually graduating, moving in and out of our house, bringing three dogs into our house that we never wanted but he somehow found, wrecking 12+ cars, and making horrible decisions relating to drugs and such, we've found out that he's got schizophrenia, and his brain is damaged from concussions from highschool football. This hit us all hard, but it all kind of made sense because of how he'd been acting over the years. The doctor told us that it effects his decision making and he sees things sometimes of course, and he hears his own voice in his head telling him to do certain things. Also, jack doesn't want to take doctor prescribed medication for it, he thinks that marijuana does the job for it and we have been obviously shown that it does not. Also, he has this crazy girlfriend named Shyann that currently lives with us and she throws temper tantrums, treats him like crap, and just acts like an overall brat, but she has a job and that helps him take care of himself so he doesn't want to break up with her. My parents don't think he'll stay sane if they kick her out, but they don't want her living with us because she's a negative influence on me and my sister, she causes a bunch of commotion all the time, and she's just not helping jacks situation at all. I personally really need her out because of the way she treats my brother and takes advantage of my parents, she uses my stuff all the time without asking me first, and she acts so entitled and cusses everyone out all the time. So yeah, that's jacks situation. Am I overdramatizing for being so effected by this situation? It makes me mad, sad, frustrated, depressed, anxious. Overall it just makes me a mess. 
Then for joe.. he's very successful in life. He graduated high school no problem, cooperated with my parents, and protected me and my sister like a big brother should. Now he's in college studying and holding a job as well. But, then girls came into his life. They effect him in bad ways, like they make him have bad panic attacks all the time, and he's just not himself anymore. I have a theory that he just worries what they think about him a lot. Well more than one time he's stayed at our house in my room for a night to get away from college  while I sleep with my sister. Well recently he had a horrible one, and he punched a brick wall and split his fists up badly and destroyed his dorm room. And he almost harmed himself, bad. So my mom sent my dad over to his college (if you haven't caught on his college is like 25 mins from our house) and brought him home and he calmed down, but I had to wash blood from my bed sheets because of his fists. 
So in conclusion, jack and joe both have a buch of problems. And I shouldn't be complaining because I dont have problems like that, but it stresses me out and effects me a lot.",31Jan2017,1

I'm to the point where I want to cut him off completely and it's honestly really sad that it has gotten to this point but I'm at my wits end.",31Jan2017,1
74,"Long story short, Her(17F) and I(20M) started working together around November and a few weeks later we started talking..we've hanged out a couple times. So its been almost 3 weeks since we started talking and New Year's Eve was near, I was planning to hang out with her but before New Year's Eve, the night we were suppose to hang out and drive around she said she was tired and then told me she hooked up with another guy because apparently she didn't think we we're ""talking"". Ofc I was really furious but she wanted to meet me in person and talk about it..and ofc I'm dumb enough to say yes(because I really really like her). Long story short we talked and made it official we were talking but it didn't last long and her excuse for not wanting to talk anymore was really stupid, like really stupid. Since we work together I didn't know what to do so I tried avoiding her but she flirts to me like we are a couple, literally. I can't read her. A week passed and she is still flirting with me like she's drinking off of my drink, etc. I thought I was getting the vibe that she want to talk again or something. I asked her if she wants to go to the movies and she said yes(in person) and we talked for a bit that day and then the movie day came in and I told her when the movie was and if she was fine with it but I never got a reply.(When we used to talk, she always flakes on me) so I figured she's just leading me on and keeping me as a second hand guy to give her feels when nobody is able to give it to her. I've talked to my friends and they gave me different ways to approach. They told me to just play along and possibly have sex with her(I'm gonna be honest and I'm not this kind of guy) and the other is just dont flirt back and keep the convo with her as minimum as possible because I still have a strong feelings for her and its hard when I see her.

EDIT: I texted her that day when the movie was and she texted me the next day and said ""why did u text me and never replied back"" (99.99% sure this is her excuse and I haven't replied to her ever since)",31Jan2017,1

82,"I am a ride share driver so part of my job is having conversations with my passengers.  Sometimes I encounter passengers who ask me a lot of questions and I naturally respond to them and answer them truthfully to be polite but then they sometimes offer advice and I feel like shit afterwards.  For instance, people will probe me about work, ""what else do you do?"" (Nothing) ""Do you drive for Uber too?"" (No) Or they will ask me about my education (B.A. in Geography) which leads to them asking ""Oh why don't you teach?"" (I don't want to teach, it doesn't interest me) and they feel sorry for me and try to offer me advice on trying to go back to school or doing x y and z in order to get back on track. 

 Tonight I talked to someone about going out and I just let it slip that I don't go out much anymore because my best friends moved away so they tried to convince me to get on fb groups to make friends.  Honestly I am too poor to hang out with friends right now.  I barely have enough to cover myself just living because Lyft doesn't pay as well as it used to be.

Anyways these people all are just trying to be helpful but just make me self conscious as hell.  How do I avoid this situation in the future without pissing off my passengers.  I don't want to be rude because they might give me a low rating but I can't think of a polite way to get them to not offer me unsolicitated advice.

Obviously I am welcome to any advice here, it is unsolicitated advice I want to avoid.",31Jan2017,1
83,"I know this is a HUGE submission, but these events have unfolded over a large part of my life and I feel like it must be explained honestly and in full.

Let us begin with a little history. I met my so called âbest friendâ around 4 years ago during my freshman year of high school. Weâll call him Mac. Mac and I met in an art class and began collaborating on film projects together. Our weird, creative, and adventurous personalities paired well together. We got along really well for a while and became best friends during the summer after freshman year. The next year, he started hanging out with another kid who Iâll call Shane. Throughout sophomore year, Mac didnât talk to me as much as he began hanging out with Shane and a couple other people. At the time I wasnât too concerned considering I was dealing with a few of my own personal issues, although I did find it quite odd. However our friendship continued the following summer and school year. Around this time he started dating a girl that Iâll call Layla. Towards the end of that school year, Laylaâs insecurities and emotional breakdowns became a bearing on Mac. He came to me for advice, and I told him he should break it off with Layla. After he broke it off, I assumed our friendship would go back to the way it was, but in hindsight this was the point where things began to get strange.

That summer, Mac had still been having sex with Layla after he broke up with her without telling me. It was blatantly obvious, but he denied it for a while, getting angered when confronted about it. His personality began to change: he became obsessed with his image and what other people thought of him and became manipulative. We still had moments where we felt close, but by the end of senior year things had changed quite a bit. Mac had still been having sex with Layla, and he was terrible at hiding it. He also became the biggest drama queen Iâve ever known, finding himself tangled up in some pretty ridiculous high school drama and trying to drag me into it as well. He got in a riff with one of our former friends, Jason, when Mac was spending a lot of time around Jasonâs girlfriend. Although Jason was emotionally unstable and a little unreasonable, I found it incredibly stupid of Mac to not understand Jasonâs disgust with Mac, especially knowing that Mac did in fact try to get with his girlfriend.

I went through quite a few changes as well: I completely stopped caring what other people think about me, became a stoner, and took on a much more avant-garde approach to my filmmaking. He shed little light on his true self, and most conversations from there on out turned into him bragging about his car and all the girls he gets. He has also become a player, dating several girls at once without telling them. This definitely drove a giant wedge between us as I strongly despise of people who lead other people on. I confronted him about it several times, yet he continued his cheating activities. He became so superficial that I felt like it was hardly even him I was talking to. Mac would constantly make fun of me and my stoner lifestyle, still bragging for ages about himself. He wanted to continue making corporate videos for clients with my support until he suggested things like taking down short films we had made on our YouTube channel, insisting it would be âembarrassingâ to clients. It only went downhill from there. Toward the end of the summer, I had pretty much come to the conclusion that he was no longer my best friend as I found I enjoyed spending more time with other friends and I eventually stopped making the initiative to hang out with him.

I now write this as I embark on my second semester at school studying Film Production. Mac goes to a community College down the road. He started to become very meddlesome during my new life in college, wanting to be a part of every activity I was involved in. This is the point at which I began debating whether or not our friendship had any chance of saving. To this day, I still never initiate hanging out with him and have avoided him on several occasions, yet he has become obsessively clingy. Itâs gotten to the point where heâll come to my house when I donât answer the phone, and passive aggressively says things like âYou canât get rid of me.â In fact there have been several times where he has come to my house unannounced to wake me up to hang out. Mac often canât accept it when Iâm busy and will do anything he can to hang out with me at the most inconvenient of times. He guilt trips me whenever Iâm not available to hang out. His sense of taste and morals have grown apart from mine as he enjoys a much more superficial lifestyle. I know he still has been secretly getting around with several girls such as Layla, but I donât care anymore. I just hate how he constantly brags about his sex life and other things and he really is kind of an asshole at times. 

Any time I try to confront him about our differences, a slew of incoherent bullshit spills out of his mouth in an attempt to confuse me into submission. He has become so narcissistic and thinks he is above everyone else in my friend group. I couldnât possibly express my disinterest in hanging out with him more, yet for some inexplicable reason he pretends as if Iâm still his âbest friend,â clinging to his obsessive behavior. Our conversations are the furthest thing from genuine. Heâs always insisted that heâs an honest and confrontational person, yet Iâve come to realize this is just a deflection of his superficial ego.

Last weekend, my new friend group and I went on a last minute camping trip to Malibu where we tried LSD. I didnât invite Mac for obvious reasons, and he was very offended by this. Knowing he isnât much into stoner activities, itâs obvious he wouldnât have even had fun on the trip anyway. During my trip, one of the conclusions I came to was that I absolutely need to get Mac out of my life.

 I havenât seen him since then, but I know that the next time I do Iâm going to tell him that Iâm calling it quits. I've tried to let the friendship phase out naturally, but as you can see this has come to no avail. Iâve never formally ended a friendship like this and would appreciate any advice you could offer. How do I explain to such a clingy friend that I canât see him any more? The only other complications that may unfold are that certain friends in my friend group like him, although most of my close friends feel the same way about him, so I guess Iâll just have to deal with the collateral damage. Should I meet him in person for this? If anyoneâs ever found themselves in a similar situation, please share any advice you have as Iâd greatly appreciate it. Thanks.",31Jan2017,1

I donât know what wrong with me, do I have a bad group of friends? am I wired wrong? I donât know.

85,"I am pretty scared. I decided to go back to school for something I'm passionate about and there is at least a dim prospect of employment for -- computer programming. its been a hobby since I was ten or eleven. but I always pick up way too ambitious of a game project and give up because I don't have the right education and only tutorials. 

I know some people learn better on their own, but for me, I need problems to solve and solidify basic concepts before rushing on to try to program an RPG lols.

I think I can do really good in my computer related courses. but math scares me to death. I'm a good year and a half(at least) ahead of my programming class even if I am terribly rusty.

but precalc is terrifying me. I haven't even begun yet but I am scared they are going to spring all sorts of things from high school at me that I haven't taken in a decade.

I took my colleges intro to algebra class and got a B+ and still understand 90% of what I was taught there. but I have absolutely zero memory of geometry aside from sohcahtoa, I read the words ""proofs and deriviatives"" in precalc algebra and became terrified, because If I get hit with a geometric proof, I am doomed and might as well give up unless there is youtube vids that can teach me from scratch like a high schooler in under a week.

I haven't done a proof in like 12 or 13 years even maybe! some things I can look up, like formulas, and try to remember them or use online resources to teach myself.

but sometimes the problems are too complicated and specific, and I cant teach myself what I need to know.

there is math tutors and I am not afraid to use them, but they don't want to teach people concepts only help with homework, so if I am missing large gaps of math required for this I am doomed and its hopeless unless I can pull off some herculean effort of self-education.

So I pretty much need to know now before class begins if theres anything I need to pay a private tutor to teach me, or any books I need to invest in pronto to do hours of extra work (maybe quit my job) and dedicate 100% to it.

I'm just really afraid the one class I took I can remember really wont have prepared me for this. I feel like I am wandering into a dungeon filled with monsters alone when I think about even looking at simple first day homework assignments.

so far its easy as all hell, but it was the first day. everyone else is so much younger than me, probably just out of high school and I'm almost 30. I have the benefit of having made my mistakes young and actually knowing I'm interested in my major for sure.

but I was terrified of math when I was just out of high school. I told myself, nope, not doing it and wasted my time with useless majors, and now its even scarier going back in a decade later, not even having any simple classes because I already graduated in everything else lol.

I just have straight math and comp sci courses. and I love the comp sci courses. I even love the math courses when I actually know what I am doing.

I just get scared they wont really teach me and just will throw assignments at me I have no idea how to do. I don't want reddit to do my homework, although I will probably ask on here for help. I need to know what I'm doing to pass these tests.

If my algebra teacher wasn't overly kind and allowed me to have as much extra time as I wanted against the rules Id have not done as well on the tests. I got lucky with this, even on the final, which wasn't even half finished in time :(

I try really hard. I don't have a life, I don't party anymore. I just work on this. I just want to get through calculus I. if I can do that, then I'm sure calc II will be feasible to do.

I just feel like there is going to be a steep incline in difficulty that might include concepts I have not seen in the algebra class that I will be expected to know from high school (I don't even remember a single day of high school anymore lols -- ive been to college like three times already wasting time finally getting liberal arts a.s.) 

I'm very vindicated about trying to do this. I'm just so scared I'm going to let myself down really hard, and maybe paying thousands of dollars (and then some) to retake these classes over and over when financial aid cuts me off if I fail. I also don't really have the time I used to as I'm older. I have to pass.

is this less terrifying in reality then it seems to me? do I actually have a shot at doing this, or am I legit screwed and just lying to myself?",31Jan2017,1
89,"TLDR: I'm stressed and venting. My mom is a severe alcoholic and i fear she may die soon. 

I'm emotionally drained. My mother lives on her own and keeps to herself. She has severe depression and addiction problems with anti depression meds, that she occasionally mixes with vodka. 

She has always been very secretive about it and had always denied having a problem while I was growing up. She would go through phases where for a few weeks, she would be shut off from the world, living only in her bedroom. After the two or so weeks she would be back to normal and everything on the surface would seem fine, and we all pretended nothing happened. 

Lately now that I'm older (22) it has become more blatant. She has been arrested 3 times in a 1 week period for drunk in public, nearly getting a DUI. In one of the circumstances the police were called because she was drunk throwing all of her possessions off her 3rd story balcony. The next day she claimed she was at the hospital and a woman gave birth but the high priest drowned the baby; she was in cells.

 I've always known and tried to get her help but I could never fully convince her; she knew there was a problem but couldn't find it within herself to want to solve it. She was rushed to the hospital in novemeber because I checked up on her and noticed she wasn't herself, and had very yellow skin (jaundice). She nearly died from liver failure in the following week at the hospital. She thankfully recovered and now we had a game plan on how to tackle the problem, with doctors, addictions councillors, psychiatrists, the works.

However as soon as she left the doctors, the onus was on her to seek this help. Truthfully it makes sense but I had hoped that these people would be keeping tabs on her, not her having to track them down to get anything done. She did a great job up until Christmas. She was supposed to watch my sisters animals while she left on a vacation christmas day. We noticed on Christmas eve she was acting different  and quickly realized it was the beginning signs of one of her episodes. We had other commitments we had to attend but reassured her that if there are any issues, that we are there to help no matter what. She reassured us everything would be fine. I wanted to believe her. 

I travel an hour away. We keep constant tabs to make sure she's fine. No answers. 10 hours goes by with no contact so I return to check up on her. I arrive to find one of my Christmas gifts in the hallway, my laundry in the kitchen sink, and the animals uncared for. Mother was absolutely out cold snoring. Next day she is talking jibberish, thinking it's the 70s and not following any conversations. Back to the hospital. 

They monitor her for a week, run tests but Chalk it up to alcoholism. No real answers or remedies. They release her same as last time. Now cue the last 6 days. She has been openly drunk and refusing any help. She gets furious with me and my sister when  we try to help. She ignores me, and sarcastically rolling her eyes acting like a 15 year old and I find myself resenting her when I know I should be helping. 

This is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. I feel like there are signs of early on set dementia or alzheimers with all of the hallucinations, but the doctors disagree.  I feel like any day I'll get the call that she has passed and there isn't anything I can do. I can't be with her much lately due to getting a new job and being in training away from her city and my sister is further taking university. We are stressed and looking for any advice. Also I'm equally looking to vent, since I only have my sister to talk to this about.",31Jan2017,1

Suffered from anxiety and depression mixed with multiple other disorders that affected my school attendance, although I had ""friends"" during my 10 years there, they've never acted like what I'd expect friends to be like, at least not all of them.

Here's a little background. I started my bachelor in Information Techology in 2012 but ended up withdrawing in 2013. In that time my anxiety became so unbearable I went to
the campus doc who prescribed my paroxetine and a dose of counselling. I took the meds but ended up withdrawing from my classes anyway. At the time I thought it was because the meds caused me to lose any drive to continue with the work .. but now that I'm all signed up to continue with my degree I'm feeling pretty indifferent about it. I've been given some material to revise but I'm struggling to get through it because
it just doesn't hold my interest, that said I've no idea what else I could be doing. I'm 25 already and all I know is I don't want some mundane minimum wage job. People skills aren't my forte so I feel like I have to have a degree behind me to get anywhere in the careers department. I don't have a lot of interests beyond video games and computers.
Currently I'm feeling pretty blase about life in general so maybe I should go back on them IF my anxiety flares up again because I don't think It's possible to feel anymore indifferent than I do presently. Thoughts anyone?

113,"Hi, I'm 15 years old and I really need your help. Okay so, last year I got close to this guy, and we became really close friends. He started to open up to me and tell me everything and always asked me for advice. I started to develop feelings towards him, and I knew I shouldn't because we were best friends..but I couldn't help it. As months went by, I fell deeper for him, and by now I honestly think I'm in love with him. But, before the summer started, I confessed my feelings to him..he didn't feel the same way. But he still wanted to be best friends, he still wanted me in his life. So during the summer, we stopped talking as much, we barely talked at all, and things got a little awkward. I don't know if the awkward vibe was coming from me or from him, but it was there. Anyways, we started talking again before school started, but it didn't feel the same, like there was still tension. When school started, we barely talked, I tried avoiding him, but I still ended up talking to him. My birthday came around, and we talked about how there's tension between us, and he said that I never talk to him, and that I always break eye contact, or I leave whenever he's around. So I tried to stop doing that, but as months went by, there was still tension. We talked about it again, and he said I still do those things. And now, I'm trying my best to avoid him completely, mainly because I feel like I'm always the first to initiate a conversation, and I'm always the first to bring up the 'tension' conversation. So I'm avoiding him, hoping that he'll come and initiate the conversation with me. And I've heard from multiple people, that he also wants to fix our friendship and that he misses me,but he never does anything about it. And because I'm trying to avoid him, I come off as angry, so he now thinks I'm angry at him. My best friend talked to him, and he told her that he wants to come and talk to me about this and fix it, but he feels like something's stopping him. And my best friend told me I'm being way too hard on him and that I should just give him time.

116,"Hi,

I'm 30 years old and can't stand my job. It makes me really unhappy. 

I made a list of what I care about and want to spend my time on day-to-day, but I'm having trouble identifying jobs that match up with all or some of it. Can you think of any? 

Thanks for your help.

***

What I care about:

-Everyone being heard.

-Everyone having equal opportunities.

-Accuracy.

-Making people feel welcome and taken care of.

-Playful banter and chit-chat with co-workers.

-Hearing other people's stories and empathizing with them or learning something new.

-Learning what people do and how they do it.

-Sharing in the moment what I've learned about other people or things in order to keep discussions or written material accurate.

-Being seen.

-Reducing or eliminating frustrations.

117,"Five months ago, I severely sprained my ankle while walking down the stairs. I sustained two torn ligaments and a bone contusion. I haven't been able to walk at all for the past four months and I've been feeling extremely depressed. 

I'm 21, F, and a senior in college. Because of my injury, I had to take a health leave during my last semester of college so I'll be graduating in December instead of in May 

My parents moved back to their motherland after I started college, so for winter break I went to live with them. They live in a 250 sq. ft. studio on the fourth floor with insufficient heating and no elevator. There's heavy internet censorship, so it's been difficult to use social media. I know no one in this unfamiliar country, and this isolation is compounded by my mom's bipolar disorder which has frightened my relatives so much that I haven't seen them yet. 

I'm terrified that I won't get better. I went from an active, happy, and motivated young woman who was on the verge of graduating and working at a top consulting firm to someone who cries everyday and feels hopeless. My mom constantly yells at me for having been stupid enough to get injured. I'm always in tears because I'm still in a lot of pain and I feel hopeless. My family doesn't have a car and we live on the top floor of an apartment that doesn't have an elevator, so I rarely go out. I haven't been outside in 19 days. 

;Tldr: I injured my ankle and haven't walked without crutches/knee scooter for five months. I'm in chronic pain and the doctors have been unhelpful. I feel like it'll be another year before I can walk again. I live with a mentally unstable mother in a studio that's located in an unfamiliar city. I'm lonely and depressed about my injury. My mom makes me cry everyday. I want to get better asap so that I can leave my dysfunctional family for good. How do I stay optimistic?",31Jan2017,1

I would open the bag and check all the books and then check again a minute later and again after. Sometimes this would make me miss the bus to school.

132,"I was going out with this girl from school and things were going pretty well for the first year and I fell pretty hard for her. I told her I loved her way too young to know what I was talking about. We weren't the most popular people at school so we spent a lot of time together in and out of school. I always had a sneaking suspicion that maybe I liked her more than she did me. Anywhatsitis We really fucking got into that whole relationship shit buying each other crap we didn't need and getting (in retrospect) far too touchy in public but after she and I left School she went to England for University and I stayed closer to home. In fact she said that she wanted to stay near home too so she could see me more to which I said ""No there's no point throwing away your future because of me"" so she got a flight to England and we tried making a long distance relationship work by calling each other and trying our best to keep it going. 

I saw her at Christmas when she came home for holidays and things were going great still. However when she got back to England I noticed a change in her. She was acting a lot more distant than usual. She's definitely not the cheating type. After Bowie died it made it worse because she was a huge fan. A day or two after this she starts asking if we would be better off as friends which I knew wasn't going to happen but I said yes anyway because I'm not going to force her to make it work even if I would fight tooth and nail to keep it going (I'm pretty sentimental). So I try just being her friend and I still accidentally call her 'sweetie' and 'dear' and the likes. This makes her uncomfortable and I apologise ad nauseum because I'm just so used to saying those sorts of things. My friends notice how sad I am that she left me (may I add also she sent me Facebook messages to breakup essentially). She's blocked my number, Facebook, snapchat, and about every social media we used etc. I thought it best to block her on whatever she missed so she didn't have the time wasted blocking it herself (Because I'm dead on like that). 

It's over a year since then now and I still think about her everyday. Iv'e written her letters only to get pissed off at what happened and burn them (admittedly not my most cool headed approach to solving problems) so I don't know how to fully get over her without talking it out with her which I know is off the cards at this point. I still sometime lay awake at night thinking about our time together (luckily I have quite possibly the best friends a guy could ask for who know that I think about her a lot and always seem to be distracting me from it for my own good)

Moreover I realise this is a one sided story but I genuinely have no idea why she decided to break it off. Yes we had problems but it was never anything serious. One political debate might have kicked it off though (we all know how divisive politics can be these days).

Finally I still have a few small things that used to belong to her in my apartment and I don't know what I should do with them. Most of the time I just look at them and remember what she looked like when she wore them. Throw them out? give them to her friend? and most importantly how do get over this woman? ",31Jan2017,2
133,"Uni student, computing class right.
This girl, a mate, ""D"" took pity on this geeky kid- and as we walked the same way. She kept inviting him to walk with us and hang out with us and stuff ""Until he found his own friendship group"". D decided the course wasn't for her and changed over to a new, more preferred course (I was like great she can get down to what she wants to do independent stuff).

But suddenly this kid latched onto me, and therefore my friends- he fallowed me and my mates around everywhere. Which we thought was a bit annoying but- ya know can't leave him by himself.
Then suddenly he kept sitting next to me, running to catch up with me, ""escort me home"", I don't need to be escorted home.

I told a classmate I was going out to get a coffee with my mate, he found this out fallowed me turned up and sat down with my girlfriends acting as if we were best mates. I've barely had a convo with this guy.
He did this again at a party, he did this again when going out to dinner with my flatmates.

So after class, I had a ""talk"". Basically said dispute classes and walking with me and my mates to and from uni to not at all contact me again he was making me and my friends uncomfortable and feeling unsafe etc.

It's been a month and he's acting up again- legit running over a square to come over and ""hang out with me"" when he was uninvited. He's even timed when I go out to do shopping or my coffee break with my mates etc. It's like he's completely forgotten my conversation. 

What the hell do I do? All my mates and tutors etc are on my same course? I don't want to embarrass him and make him known as a stalker or anything. I told my tutor and he said just note it all down etc and to contact him if I felt unsafe at uni etc.

The thing is I'm running out of patience with the guy- I don't wanna flip out in a public place and rip into him.
I wanna go out and not worry about this- I haven't even been friendly to him just polite like everyone else in my friendship group the last month I've been as neutral as anything whenever he talked I went on my phone etc. 

This what makes me question being nice to your neighbor and all that- we were nice now we have this guy who none of us have anything in common with that only talks about his diabetes, I've had to stop the guys trying to fight him time to time because he annoys them so much particularly my best mate and they don't even know what other crap he's doing .___.

Yet heres the story on that. I served 5 1/2 years in the army and was medically discharged for  PTSD and other mental issues.  I am a stay at home dad. My wife works but I raise our 2 kids alone without anyones help to do it. I have worked jobs but our kids cannot be trusted with anyone for they keep getting hurt. So we decided I should stay home. 

Im great with my kids. I gave up smoking, playing video games, drinking and partying.  everything else. I spend all my time with my kids. Im like a dad/mom. I havent bought something for myself in a long time. Im like a poster child for stay at home dads

So this rude ass decided to call my wife a dumbass and says she should leave me, says Im a bad dad, harassing my wife on facebook over it saying I need a job to be a man and she needs to be at home with the kids. They work together too so I cant attack him at work. 

Now I am beyond fighting over childish reasons because Im a responsible adult. Yet he presses on with it. He is this way because he didnt have a job for 3 years and now that he has a job he thinks he better than  everyone else.


TLDR: Immature guy wants to fight yet I dont because Im too busy being a responsible father and I cant afford to go to jail. Yet if I fight my wife will get fired because he wont fight me anywhere else. What do I do?

There was a car in front of me as I approached a roundabout about 10 metres away when someone cut across causing the car in front to abruptly stop, I hit the brakes to but was unfortunate enough to clip the back of their car. We pulled off to the side of the road to check the damage, luckily I suffered only a broken license plate and the plastic cap of their tow bar had came off too, other than this there was no visible damage. I offered to cover the costs there and then to replace the cap but they wanted to inform their insurance company and get back to me, that's fine I don't blame them. We exchanged details and I thought nothing more of it. However today I was called back by the couple themselves, not the insurance, saying that if I gave them Â£1000 to cover the repairs then that would be it otherwise they will be getting the insurers involved. They told me that I hadn't only cracked the tow bar damage but caused damage to the full rear end of the car meaning the bumper and boot need replacing.

147,"So here's the story. Big surprise, it starts with a girl. She and I have always been flirty with one another, but she has always been in a relationship with someone else. I literally never considered that we would ever be in a position to actually get together. Several months ago, however, she and her boyfriend broke up. I asked her out, she said yes, we went on a date! The date was awesome, and we set up another one. The day of that date, she didn't answer any calls or texts. Seeing as how I had no idea when or where we were meeting, the date never happened. The same thing happened the following week, and the week after that, and the week after that. This trend has been happening since August. 

Normally I could accept this as a girl who's just rude and loves dragging guys along, but she works a job where she constantly gets called away from whatever she is doing. More frustratingly, whenever I interact with her at work (oh yeah, we occasionally work together) she seems genuinely interested in me and going out with me. Then ""something"" happens, but for whatever reason I can't stop asking her out.

She stood me up on Friday, and I literally haven't heard anything since. Would it be ok to ask why she stood me up? Is it alright that I'm angry about this, both at myself and her? How do I break out of this cycle without ending all contact (I still have to work with her)?

151,"Iâve always had problems with my sleep but things are getting progressively worse. I used to have sleepwalking* episodes every so often, maybe four times a year at most, but this past month Iâm having them almost every night. Sometimes I do really strange and random things and sometimes I injure myself, and sometimes my sleepwalking* is genuinely terrifying and I scare myself.

When I say sleepwalking, Iâm not entirely sure itâs sleepwalking because I can remember everything that happens. Iâm aware of what Iâm doing and I know what Iâm doing, I just canât figure out that itâs not real, if that makes any sense?

The most recent one, last night, was one of the scary ones. I saw a rotting corpse laying in bed next to me, so I jumped out of bed and held the door open and told it to leave. When I turned the light on I realised there was nothing there, so I just went back to sleep. So at the time Iâm sure that what Iâm doing is normal, but I usually snap out of it.

Other things that have happened:

- A crowd of people surrounded me as I ran to the kitchen, all screaming at me.

- My brother told me that âwe need to hide the bourbon biscuitâ, which lead me to pulling the headboard off my bed and hiding it, injuring my wrist.

- My room was flooding with lemonade, so I put all of my possessions on my bed to stop them from getting wet, I slept on top of my mirror.

- My dog was curious about what happens at night, so I took her to the front door and stared out for a while.

- I convinced myself I was late for work, got dressed, realised it was 4am, got back into bed, and then repeated a few times.

I noticed her change in tone on her facebook posts and her expressions in person at work (I am a regular at her store) so I sent her a message offering my support and what not. 

She got me a free drink, as a way of saying like ""thank you"" for listening to her, being there for her, and letting her vent and offering my advice and that was that. I didn't think anything else of it. 

I do think she is attractive, and would like to pursue but not right away as I obviously don't want to be the rebound. 

Anyway, after she got me drink, I thanked her and what not and then we just started talking. Most of it is playful. She let me know the day she was closing again, and told me ""I'm not sure if you come on Sundays but you better not mobile order :p"" - in which she comped my drink again.

Yesterday, we were messaging and she told me she was going to SB in a little bit. I told her luck you as I was in still in class for another hour. Ironically, an hour passes and I am on my way home she messages me saying ""Oops I'm late to starbucks"" so I offered to buy her a drink in order to repay her for the two she got me. I showed up to SB and she had already bought my drink, again. In which we sat there for about 2 hours just talking and conversing. 

My question is ... I cannot tell if she is interested or just genuinely being nice.

For some reason, I stayed around, I wrote her letters as that was the only way to contact her and that lasted for over a year.

If read much on testosterone boosters and am concerned about their side effects or even if they will work. I am really self conscious about my lack of body hair. I have also started working out in an effort to try and slim down which i heard can help boost testosterone and get rid of estrogen.

I told her that my place is messed up and she said it doesn't matter but I don't think she understands how fucked up it is. And just this morning the toilet is broken and water doesn't come out when it needs to flush. I am thinking to call the landlord to fix it but he wanted us out so I am not sure if he is gonna fix it or not.

There are molds on the ceiling of the toilet and some tiles fell down because of the moisture.

In my room there is no wall paper and the wall is just exposed like that and harsh to look at.

I am scared that when she comes to mine she is gonna get turned off by the scene that she sees before her and I just can't help to hate my parents being so ""wonderful"" and give me a place like this to live in.

190,"Dearest Redditors, 

I would like you to help me word my graduation accouncement. Let me give you a brief background to help in that task.

I am the black sheep of the family. As a kid, I was constantly tossed from relative to relative, and very often called a ""lost cause"". Several family members had stated that I would never graduate high school, that I would end up pregnant by 15, that I was going to end up in a gang, etc... My biological father ""gave up on me"", and sent me to live with said various relatives so that he could ""give his new wife and baby a normal life"". Last time I saw that dipshit, I was about 15. My mother left the family when I was 8, but came around when I was about 15. She has been an ok mother since that age, although I see her more as an aunt than as a mother. I did graduate high school on time, back in 2003.

I am a Hispanic 31 year old woman, who is graduating with a bachelors degree in Microbiology this May. Not only did I pick a pretty hard major, I am also one of the few people in my family to graduate college. I sat in classrooms and labs with people more than 10 years younger than me, but I still made it. How do I announce the graduation of the black-sheep that was given up on, and proved everyone wrong? I should mention the only reason I was able to get this far was because my wonderful husband has held my hand, and encouraged me to get this far. Apparently he saw something in me that I didn't see. (It's hard to see yourself as anything other than scum when it's what you have been told your whole life.) I'm not asking for sympathy, I just really want to word this announcement really well (and in a funny way). 

TL;DR: Help the black-sheep announce to all the doubters that I made it without their help. I'm a biologist, not a witty writer. ",31Jan2017,1

192,"So I go to a top high school in South Africa (One that has only allowed non-white people to study in it post 1990). The majority of the staff are white (~45/50) and the majority of the students are non-white. A lot of the  non-white students at the school feel that they are overlooked when it comes to recognition or handing out awards. For example the Student executive Council at the school has 12 members of which 9 are white, despite the fact that only 30/150 learners in the grade are white. The same type of bias is evident when sports colours(Awards/recognition) are handed out. There are individuals who play certain sports such as soccer -- which is a predominantly non-white sport -- at a National level and are completely overlooked when colours are handed out, while white guys who play sports like hockey are given the top honours/awards available at the school just because they have participated in all the sports fixtures in that particular season. 

This brings us to my case. Today, we had a special awards assembly where one of the awards to be handed out  was an award for the individual who showed the most academic and sporting excellence in the 2016. I finished 3rd in the grade out of 150 learners, I have rowed in the school's 1st 8, reached the provincial final in the U19 fours race (for rowing which called crew in the US) and I am the only individual in the top 30 students to have colours/honours for sports. I received my sports colours for Track and Field (Specifically track). At the end of the year I decided to leave rowing and focus more on track, since I felt that I had reached my full potential in rowing and I had much more at track, since I had never been coached in my life before and I was running times not far off of the recruitment standards for Ivy league institutions in the US (which happen to be my goal). This brings us back to the award. The award was given to an individual who is 10th in the grade, and only plays 2 second team sports. Despite the citation on the award being "" This award instituted by.... is awarded in recognition of the learner who has shown the most Academic and Sporting Excellence in the grade"". After it was handed out a lot of people came and told me that I was unfairly overlooked (Including the guy who the award was given to).

I then spoke to one of the teachers who was a part of the committee that handed the award out and he told me that it was not given to me because I stopped rowing at the end of the year, and the teacher who was in charge of rowing said that I showed a lack of commitment to the sport. This was despite me rowing up until the end of the year, even during our Grade 11 final exams which are used to apply to university in South Africa. I also told the teacher who was in charge of rowing that I was going to stop in 2017 so I could focus more on track even before I left. The teacher from the committee told me that he understands and the committee didn't know the specific reason I left when they were deciding upon the recipient of the award. I then asked him who would be the most appropriate person to send an email to regarding my query and he told me not to send one because it would only build animosity for me within the staff and it could lead to obstacles in my way while I try and become the first non-white person in the 95 year history of the school to recieve the honours blazer (which is full colours for Academics, sports and Culture : so far only 5 people have ever recieved it and I currently have full colours for Academics and Culture, but half colours for sport. I met the full colours standards for Track last year but was only awarded half). The teacher on the committee told me that sending an email or complaining would gain me nothing. 

When I got home I told my mom what had happened and she was fuming, telling me that she was going to the department of education and to the media because similar ""racial"" bias had occurred in another school nearby and the government changed the entire school governing body, and got a few members of staff fired. I told her not to, explaining what the teacher from the committee had told me and that I would be requiring testimonials from the school when I apply to universities both in South Africa and in the United States . She then said that I have nothing to lose and the fact that I have been overlooked for awards numerous times is an indication of the type of testimonials that I will be getting. 

I know that this is life and I should learn to deal with it, but this is one to many times I have been overlooked. For example a few other awards that weren't handed out to me today at the assembly were 2 subject awards despite the fact that I and the learners in the grade who received them had the same exact mark. 

Who's advice should I follow: the teacher from the committee's or my moms? Or are there any other alternatives I have? If I really have nothing to lose what will I do with regards to my testimonials. My mom wants to arrange a meeting with the headmaster early tomorrow morning

But anyway...

Why do I feel terrified? She just broke the news to me and I was both instantly happy for her and hit with an enormous wave of anxiety... 

I'm 24, she's 22. Been dating for almost 5 years now and I basically plan on marrying her.

 She's been trying to get accepted for a few years now and it finally happened. She's going to vet school. I'm so happy for her because this is truly her passion and calling and I want nothing more than to support her... but, it's overseas. UK to be exact. I so desperately want to go with her and experience a whole new environment, culture, etc, because travelling is a love of mine as well as hers. I want to go, I really do. But I have major issues going into this...

1. My family. They're not going to want me to go. At all. I know they are going to so heavily object to my desire to leave. But honestly, I hate it where I'm at right now. I hate the job I'm working, I hate the mundane routines I go through on a daily basis, I hate the BS I have to deal with because of my family...and just overall it really takes a toll on me mentally. How could I convince them? 

2. If I could go, what would I even do? How does one even transition from America to the UK? Obviously passport, visa, etc, but what truly goes into it? I know I'm completely ignorant to this but I've never really had the pleasure of leaving the country except for once when I was a small child and that has been it. 

So, I just ask anyone with an open ear, with experience with these kinds of things, what advice can you give me? I don't think I've ever felt so anxious in my life. I basically have until July to get my shit together... ",31Jan2017,1

Then, we started dating. It was hard because she lives in another state but we still made an effort to see each other once a month. We dated for 6 months and were truly in love with each other but then I started thinking about the potential for us to stay together in the long run. She wouldn't be able to move here any time soon and moving would be just as hard for me too. I wanted to spend my life with her but I'm too young to raise kids. 

We broke up earlier this month and the past few weeks have been some of the worst I've ever felt. All I want is to get back together with her but I don't know how to make that work. A part of me says the only thing that matters is the love we have for each other but the rest of me doesn't know if I could handle a long distance relationship for who knows how long.

202,"Guys, I really need some light in here... I've been working in this company for the past 3 years, and things went on like this: started from the bottom, moved to a management position, then, after less than a year in the company, they've offered me a higher management position. This higher management position required training, which I told them from the beginning I do not have, and that I will take the position as long as they will train me. They said ok. This management team that I am now supposed to lead, has now a number of 5 total managers, including myself. First 10 days after they put me in this position, my assistant quit ( long story short, he worked there for longer, wanted the job, they didn't give it - he had no training either, so he sent a resignation email, which stated that those are his last 2 weeks, out of which he only showed up for 2 days ) basically with no notice. We are now 4. Out of these 4, 2 had visa and working rights issues, so they had to go. The remaining one is now moving into another city, and cannot commute. At this point, I am on my own. I am forced to move someone else into management, who did have the training done previously, but was never put into management, due to visa issues. Redoing his training, everything seems fine. In the meantime, I keep on asking them to send in more people for our management team. First one they've sent had no knowledge, would come in late all the time, or not at all, or even he would come in and say ""I wanna take the day off is sunny outside"". He eventually got laid off, after I kept on explaining to my senior management for weeks that he's not showing up and so on. A few months after that, after I was again on my own in the team, as the guy that was there had visa issues as well, I get these 2 guys who are supposedly ultra mega trained, as opposed to myself ( make no mistake, they made sure to rub the fact that I am not trained in my face with each chance they got ), only to find out after having them on shift for a couple of weeks, that they had no idea of management, and not to mention that one of them used to show up drunk as well. Now, after one year of this shite, they're moving me to another branch, on a lower position, in order to complete my training. I am now treated as a fucking noob, pardon my french, and they have given my position to someone of which I heard will replace me a few months ago. Bare in mind, at no point was I told about this, I was told I will be moved by my employees, even the garbage man knew before I did.
My husband is also in the same company. We were both hired in the branch I am now forced to leave, left, and when he came back, hired him in this branch where I'm moving, only to move him back out again, because they're moving me there. This was never an issue when we were hired. Even the owner of the business works with his wife and his daughter, so how can they actually say it's an issue for us working together, when we've never had an issue working together. Also, there is no stipulation in the contract that we are not allowed to work together as a couple.

now the last time cps was called on her, she viciously beat up her neighbors for calling (I dont even think they called, shes nuts). the children's mother is crazy and sociopathic.

209,"So a quick backstory, I left my mom's apartment (where I had my own room) when I was 18 because of the tension her alcoholism was creating between us. My best friend's parents invited me to live with them, and my friend and I began sharing her bedroom which is small. That was my living situation for about two years until my boyfriend and I moved into an apartment together while we were going to college (his mom has a well paying job and insisted on paying our rent, and I'm not complaining although part of me always felt guilty about that). I'm back at my friend's parents house with her and her dad now (her mom recently left him...long story, and its a pretty sad one). A few weeks ago I was scrambling to find an apartment to move into because we were all afraid that she might be returning, which would add a lot of tension to home life. She recently said she won't be coming back but I have some doubts, and even besides that, I'm kind of over sharing a bedroom space even if it's with one of my best friends. I'm 22 years old going on 23 (not that age really matters I guess) and I think the independence would be good for me. My boyfriend also said he would help with rent and the apartment is in a safe area and so close to work. I feel like the universe is screaming at me to go there but I'm afraid. The biggest change would be that I would be alone sometimes, but I think I could get used to that again, seeing as I used to cherish solitude. I guess I just need advice on how to calm my nerves.

I'm a twenty five year old male, and find that I am not very relatable to other human beings. I've certainly got the ""god complex"" at times, as well a bit of self-deprecation thrown in there too, which is more prominent. I'm pretty much designed to be intolerable to be around for extended periods of times, and yet, people flock to me. Whether it's to use, befriend, ask advice, even laugh at, or with; someone has some use for me. I have difficulty seeing that I am in fact quite a ""nice person"", or a ""sweetheart"" to be around, but still. I don't understand it. My problem, is that I am bipolar, and have difficulty managing all these people, their needs, and my own needs. My moods work off of absolutes, buy my logic feeds off of gray areas.

220,"To understand this relationship we need some backstory... a lot of backstory... My best friend since high school, henceforth referred to as $MrFriend, has had a history of bad relationships. When we were in college he started dating a new girl, who we will refer to as $TheLoco. $TheLoco had a lot of mental problems which ultimately ended in her threatening to kill herself if $MrFriend left her. In the end he managed to make it out with what was left of his sanity. He was pretty sad that another relationship fell apart but all of his friends were there to help him through it.   

After a while he took some class where they talked about abusive relationships and was surprised to learn ""Hey apparently me and $TheLoco were in an abusive relationship"" to which I responded ""I've been telling you this for months...""   
 
And then in 2012 he met his current girlfriend... We'll call her $TheCrazy. $MrFriend met $TheCrazy through $TheLoco. She at one point was $TheLoco's best friend but they had a falling out. I remember when I first met $TheCrazy. $MrFriend asked me what I thought of her...   

&gt;$Me: She's the asian version of $TheLoco.    
&gt;$MrFriend: What?   
&gt;$Me: She reminds me of ex-girlfriend... but asian.   
&gt;$MrFriend: You mean like... she looks like her?   
&gt;$Me: ...sure let's go with that...    

I've always regretted that response...   

Fast forward a bit and I've already started to notice problems in $MrFriend and $TheLoco's relationship. It started with small things and weird comments like her saying ""I have a saying. What's his is mine and what's mine is more mine!"" Of course this meant she would always take his phone or laptop but god forbid he touched her stuff. Then there was this time where they found another one of those abusive relationship tests and laughed along as they read it and pointed out all of the things they do and ""WOW WHAT A STUPID TEST HAHAHA.""   

The most telling part to me though was when he effectively had to act as her chauffeur since she had no license. Now that in itself wasn't bad but what I noticed was that whenever he had to go pick her up (as I often was in the car on these trips) is he would get more and more stressed the closer we got to the pickup time because if he was even one minute late, no matter what the reason was, she wouldn't talk to him for hours afterwards, and next time he had somewhere to be she would passive aggressively take her time getting ready and say thing like ""Oh I thought it wasn't important to be on time."" My friends and I also started noticing that when $TheCrazy was around everything always had to go her way. If we made plans as a group they were subject to change based on her availability or what she wanted to do. There was also more than one time where they broke up for a day or so before getting back together again.   

Now around this time (2013) I was busy making relationship mistakes of my own in the form of my new ""that's a whole other story"" who we'll call $SpecialK. I met $SpecialK through $MrFriend. I would often vent to $SpecialK about $MrFriend and $TheCrazy. She was also not a fan of $TheCrazy so we would go back and forth like this for hours.   

Then in March of 2014 $SpecialK decided to tell $MrFriend what I thought about his relationship.   

Understandably he was mad that I was talking about him and his girlfriend behind their backs. We had a very long talk where I told him my concerns about his relationship and that I wan't trying to be a dick and that of course I still love him and everything. He was very understanding and told me that he was happy with $TheCrazy and that the things I noticed weren't really big issues but more isolated incidents and that she did a lot of stuff for him and he loved her. We agreed that $SpecialK probably said a lot of things out of context and it was probably best for both of us if we cut her out of any conversation about anything private... Since this wasn't the first time she did something like this.    

For a while things returned to some degree of normalcy. I started dating my wonderful new girlfriend, $MrFriend and $TheCrazy continued their relationship as they had before, and everything was fine.   

Then $TheCrazy got kicked out of her house by her family for reasons that remain unclear to me.   

With nowhere else to go $MrFriend somehow convinced his mom, $MamaFriend, to let $TheCrazy move in with them. $MrFriend and $TheCrazy now lived together. This is where things started to go south. $MrFriend and $TheCrazy started to fight a lot more now that they had no time apart. It eventually got to the point where $MrFriend would come to my house and stay there all day. I remember one instance went something like this, $MrFriend and I were sitting together playing video games when his phone rang and he got up to answer it.   

&gt;$MrFriend: Hey baby... yea I'm with Throwaway, he's fixing my computer. It'll probably be a while, lot of problems. Love you too bye.  
&gt;Me: Why did you lie to her about me fixing your computer? ...are you hiding from her?   
&gt;$MrFriend: I just need some time to relax... I can't deal with it right now...   

The conversation basically ended there and we went back to playing video games.  

Over the next year or so my friends and I noticed $MrFriend growing more stressed. Everything he did was on $TheCrazy's schedule. He woke up every morning to drive her to work, then he'd have a few hours to go to class or go on some day trip but he had to be in the parking lot of her work at 4:59 to get her or else. This meant he was pretty limited on what he could do during the day. He would also play video games with us at night but he had to be ready to drop it at a moments notice if she needed him for something. I talked to him again a few times about this but nothing really came of it.   

Then in June of 2015, in spite of the fact that I had largely cut her out of my life, $SpecialK decided she wasn't done causing problems... so she told $TheCrazy that everyone had a problem with her and $MrFriend's relationship.   

This unleashed the shitshow. It started with me getting a bunch of midnight texts from $TheCrazy calling me a fat mama's boy who was jealous of her relationship with $MrFriend and sorry he wasn't allowed to play video games for 18 hours a day anymore like I did and I should grow up and get a real job blah blah blah crazy. There was also a Facebook rant about everyone bashing her relationship but I didn't see it since she blocked me immediately after the texting incident.    

I didn't text $MrFriend because I didn't want $TheCrazy to interfere with any text conversation I had with him. I did talk to several other of my friends, one of whom we'll call $Grunt. $Grunt was dating $SpecialK at the time and also got a tirade from $TheCrazy but wouldn't tell anyone what it said. $SpecialK soon cut all ties with $MrFriend.   

So now $MrFriend knows that everyone hates his girlfriend. I finally get to talk to him in person and he says that $TheCrazy was mad that everyone was bad mouthing her. I tell him that I never talked behind his back and that everything I had ever said about his relationship was stuff that I said to him. He's not mad at me but I'm kind of mad that he defended $TheCrazy's rants.   

$Grunt was mad at $SpecialK for talking to $TheCrazy and causing all of these problems but ultimately he was angrier with $MrFriend for defending $TheCrazy so he also cut ties too.  

Then $MrFriend and $TheCrazy announced that they were moving to Iowa so $MrFriend could go to school there. We were all sad to see him go but sadder that he was going to a place where he would have only her.  

Shortly before their move I checked his Facebook and found another surprise. Relationship Status: Engaged. I texted him immediately and asked when he got engaged. He told me it'd been a few weeks but they were waiting to make an announcement. He asked how I found out and was surprised it was on his Facebook. I did my best to pretend to congratulate him.  

The engagement didn't last very long. About two weeks after I found out apparently she got mad about something and broke it off. But this didn't last long either because they were back together again before most of us could even realize they broke up.  

Fast forward again to December. They're living in Iowa and issues abound. $TheCrazy quit a decent paying job with no notice because it was too stressful. $MrFriend goes through her phone and finds that sheâs been flirting with other guys on Tinder. He has considered breaking up with her several times and has been taking to a therapist who also told him basically dump $TheCrazy and GTFO. He tells me that $TheCrazy has destroyed his self esteem but he still loves her and can't leave her.  

$MamaFriend told $MrFriend she is going to stop paying for school unless he breaks up with $TheCrazy and comes home. So they finally break up and $TheCrazy decides she will move in with her uncle in Florida... Just as it looks like $MrFriend will be home for Christmas, $TheCrazy tries to kill herself. Plans are canceled and $MrFriend stays where he is to help her. $MamaFriend won't help $MrFriend move home if $TheCrazy comes with him and $TheCrazy's family wants nothing to do with her after the attempt. After she's released from the hospital she apologizes to him and begs him to take her back and promises to seek counseling. She never does.  

Come the new year, $MrFriend has dropped out of school and is working a full time job that he hates to support him and $TheCrazy. $TheCrazy took a shittier job that pays less. Things seem to return to normal...  

Then in April they break up again. This time $MrFriend was planning a trip home which wasn't canceled. I went to meet him at his momâs house. Her and I got to talking in the kitchen. She told me that $TheCrazy was the reason that she wanted $MrFriend to move out. $TheCrazy was super disrespectful to both $MrFriend and $MamaFriend. She told me and our other friend to get $MrFriend to come back home.  

When he was home my friends and I were pretty vocal about how we thought he shouldnât get back together with $TheCrazy. He agreed but seemed pretty depressed about losing her. He felt like he would never be able to replace herâ¦ he did sleep with someone else that weekend though so I donât think thatâs true.   

Then he went back to Iowa and they got back togetherâ¦ again. He stopped talking to us about his relationship and frankly seemed embarrassed by it. Everything was fine and dandy until that summer when they broke upâ¦ againâ¦ She made this whole big deal about moving out to go live with her uncle again and told $MrFriend that he wasnât acting like a partner and had lost all of his confidence. $MrFriend prepared to move home again.   

Then she tried to kill herselfâ¦ againâ¦ This time the wonderful hospital wanted $MrFriend to sign her out and take legal responsibility for her. We all told him not to and were actually surprised when he didnât. We thought he would be free but then the hospital decided to declare her sane and release her on her own. He felt responsible for her and still loved her so he started taking care of her again. She came back, they got back together, she agreed to seek counseling (she never did) and everything was fine and dandyâ¦ againâ¦   

Fast forward again to January of this year. $MrFriend tells me that he hasnât had sex in four months and before that it was also four to five months. When he brings it up to her she gets mad and yells at him because âthatâs all he ever wants.â Whenever he brings up relationship trouble or couples counseling he gets shot down. She complains that he wonât compromise for her when he bends over backwards for her. She also quite vocally wonât change for him saying âaccept who I am or break up.â He does all of the shopping, all of the cooking, takes care of their dogs, runs to the store at 2am to get her whatever she wants, and basically waits on her hand and foot. She goes off on him for every little mistake he makes or thing he does calling him irresponsible or childish and questioning why sheâs with him.   
 
Now $MrFriend has been occasionally posting on various subs on Reddit asking for relationship advice for the last year or so. Last week, $TheCrazy finally found his Reddit account and went ballistic on him for âbashing her to everyoneâ online. She left the apartment and disappeared for three days before she comes back. They break up and she says sheâs moving out. Heâs devastated. Heâs been avoiding her and tries to spend as little time at home as possible. A group of friends and I have been trying to get him to come home. He says he wants to but doesnât know how.  

He tells me he knows sheâs not good for him and mistreats him but he still loves her and canât leave her. Iâve tried asking him what he loves about her but he couldnât name anything beyond âsheâs nice when sheâs not crazy.â Iâve tried pointing out that weâve had this discussion seven times before and he keeps going back. Iâve tried pointing out her manipulation tactics and the abuse cycle. I even offered to buy him a plane ticket home. He keeps making excuses like âwhat if she apologizes and wants to come back?â âWhat if I never find anyone like her again?â âWhat if I canât find a job back home?â   

  ---   
TL;DR   

My best friend has been in this relationship for 4 years and 7 breakups. Each progressive breakup is getting worse and he has lost all of his self confidence. He does all of the shopping, all of the cooking, takes care of their dogs, runs to the store at 2am to get her whatever she wants, and basically waits on her hand and foot. She goes off on him for every little mistake he makes or thing he does calling him irresponsible or childish and questioning why sheâs with him.   The most recent breakup is over him venting about his relationship on Reddit. He canât seem to break away from her and she keeps pulling him back in. As long as he thinks he has a chance he wonât leave. None of us are sure what to tell him anymore.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, however...
I live in a small town in the UK where for most of 2016 our community has been raising money for a little boy called Freddie who has an inoperable tumour. The money is going to pay for Freddie to have proton treatment in the US , as doctors have stated he is a 'ticking time bomb'. Through the year as a community we raised Â£225,000. 

The parents are due to fly out to Phoenix, Arizona tomorrow. Last night they received a call from the doctors saying they've changed how they want to do the treatment, and they now need Â£330,000 to pay for just the procedure. This doesn't include the aftercare, family's flights, accommodation or anything. They don't know how long they will have to stay in the US either. 

What I am asking here is does anyone know the best places to stay in Phoenix, best people/celebrities to tweet to spread the word about Freddie, or any help at all.

244,"Hello! I'm here to just get some insight as to what I can do with my life right now. I've made previous posts on my financial aid situation because recently, it was taken away from me. I am currently a senior in college and aside from my aunt and uncle and my current job I have no income nor do I have anyone to turn to. I have reached a state emotionally where I just can't handle all of this stress anymore. I've been living with my aunt and uncle my entire life because my mother abandoned me as an infant and my dad ended up getting deported when u was about 7. Even before then I was living with my aunt and uncle because my dad has just been incredibly unreliable as a parent. He has jumped from one girlfriend to another and his last wife was awful to me. Dad didn't do anything so I chose to live with my aunt instead. Now, living with my aunt and uncle wasn't too bad but they're illegally here (at least from what I have picked up) little to no information has been given to me because everyone thinks I'm too young to understand what's going on or they think I'm just not ready. I am 21 and turning 22 years old. I've had to deal with everything financial from a young age because every adult that has ever taken care of me has left me or just used me for convenience-sake because they are not English speakers. I did not have a childhood. I have been abused for years by my aunt and things are continually getting worse. I tried to stop all contact with her but like I said before I don't have any income other than a part-time job. I'm a full time student and the bills ended up getting pretty high by the time I called my aunt and talked to her. She's just... so incredibly toxic to be around. She controls every part of my life with fear and paranoia and everything I do is just another fuck up to her. I'm tired of feeling so unsafe and I'm tired of being treated like an animal. I just don't know what to do. There's so many things going on that needs to be addressed and they refuse to acknowledge these problems. I really don't care if they get deported, the only concern to me is that I won't have financial support anymore which is also the only reason why I started talking to them again. But I've realized that in this ""mother-daughter"" relationship with my aunt my emotions and mental state shouldn't be sacrificed in order for me to ask for help. I've asked for help everywhere I could find resources and I've just been give answers of, ""You're an adult. Figure it out yourself.""

247,"Hey there

I'm 17 years old and right now in the middle of my last year of high school.

There's quite a lot of factors involved in it, such as a large distance to my home and horribly means of transport, but I can't change anything about them so I'll keep it short. On 3 days of the week I leave my place at 07:00 and return around 14:45 at best. On the other 2 days I leave at 07:00 and only come home at 18:45 or later. All in all that's already almost 47 hours per week.

Additionally, nearly all of my teachers ~~are sadist assholes~~ just love to test a third or even half of the class every lesson and supply us with plenty of homework. If you want to do everything and be prepared, you spend another 2 hours per day. Together with additional learning for actual tests we're already at a total of 60 hours per week.

Now we also have scientific papers to write and will soon have to learn the entire crap from the last 4 years for the finals. With that I'll easily get beyond 65 or even 70 hours per week.

As of now I only manage to do half of the work. My grades go down the drain and failing this entire year is a lot more probable than I'd like to admit *(we need 68% to pass, btw, 87% for a good grade)*. My entire social life has vanished because I'm either at school or completely exhausted.

During the last few years I had to sacrifice more and more of my leisure time to pass school, but not having time to relax made me depressed, so I had to sacrifice sleep instead. It's not rare that I only sleep 4 hours a night.

Is this normal? Why is there a legal maximum of 38 hours a week on my mum's job as a cashier, but I need to work my ass off for school almost twice as long without anybody giving a shit?

248,"Hey all,

So I'm an adult college student, and recently a friend I grew up with in elementary school through freshman year of high school reached out and asked me to be his best man. We graduated 10 years ago, and I had only talked to him twice in that time period. I agreed to be his best man because I thought I could make it, but it's looking like that's not the case. 

I originally thought I was only going to miss one class, but it turns out because of the limited flights I'm going to have to miss 4 classes. Also because of the times that I'm flying, the flights are about $400 more than any of the other flights. He's agreed to the pay for the flights, but I don't think he was planning on it being that much. His brother is also paying for my hotel room. I'm only mentioning those parts because they are obviously going to great lengths for me to be there, but at this point, I'm afraid it's affecting my life just to even show up. 

Basically, I'm wondering if I should honor the commitment I made to him as best man and suffer the consequences, or if I should honor the commitment I made to school and let down/lose a friend.

Right after we started dating, he and I both came out to his mom at the same time...and that did *not* go well.  She was very upset, and there was a lot of crying and arguing.  His dad reacted similarly when the BF's mom told him.  His whole family is devoutly Catholic, so it is an understandably tough idea for them to come to terms with.  This continued for several months, and then started to get a bit less tense.  

Over the past few years, things have gotten better, overall.  I get invited to some family things (but not everything), and his parents talk to me and treat me politely when we are around each other.  They have us over for dinner once or twice a month, and even got me some small Christmas gifts the past two years.  However, they still introduce me to other friends and family as my BF's ""friend.""  They never talk about our relationship directly, so I get the feeling that they're in some sort of denial, where they just pretend that I'm his best friend, and ignore the fact that we have been dating for 3 years.

Recently, the BF and I have decided that we want to get married.  Neither of us have proposed yet, but we picked out rings together and we're just waiting for the right moments to actually pop the question.  He wants to let his parents know in a respectful way so that they don't hear it from somewhere else, but he wants to make it clear that he is not asking for permission.  We are both terrified that his parents are going to react poorly to the news, since it will be a lot more difficult to pretend that we're ""just friends"" once we are legally married.  

He is having dinner with them (without me) tonight, and plans on telling them.  I want to be supportive for my BF, but I have no idea what he should do.  Do you guys have any advice on how to approach the topic, or how to deal with a potential negative reaction to the subject?  ",31Jan2017,1

On this archive link. Do they disclose the archivist's IP address or not? I am not familiar with some of the terms. It sounds like they do disclose the IP but why are they saying that they do not? Do they record the IP address or not?",31Jan2017,1
257,"I go to a community college and a lot of people don't spend four years there, they just float in and out depending on whats going on in their life. I met a girl there that I liked, but before the semester let out I didn't ask her out or anything. Next semester I don't have any classes with her and I haven't seen her around. 

We're only about two weeks into the semester, and I did think I saw her once pulling out of the parking lot.

My question is how do I message her and ask her if she still goes there without sounding like a concerned stalker?

What I mean is, when I went to message her I was going to say something to the effect of ""Did you transfer I haven't seen you around?"" 
but somehow I couldn't help but read it as ""Did you transfer!? I haven't seen you around!!? (Where can I find you next!)""",31Jan2017,2
260,"IMPORTANT: In this post, I did not have much time so I didn't go into detail about how stressed I am, and i didn't even scratch the surface on how bad the teacher is.

I am a straight a student, and I went into this school program called IB. It is pretty nice but my Spanish teacher is the worst, most mean, and the harshest teacher I have ever had. This whole quarter I have been trying really hard but I keep on getting F's. She just expects way too much out of us and I am not the only one failing, I just don't feel like stressing myself out much longer. I recently had a stroke and have been behind but that is not the reason I am doing bad. I don't feel like I should stress myself out anymore, and I feel like I should focus on getting A's in my other classes. What do you guys think I should do?",31Jan2017,1
261,"so basically what i wrote in the title.
The laptop ended up with a hole due to a shortcut in the board. I wanted to do some subtle shit but things didn't go as planned. My Innocence is going to be a tough sell, but who knows. Now I wonder if I can get away with it if I just play cool. What shouldn't I do to blow my cover?

263,"So I broke up with her 3 months ago, reasoning was that it was an emotionally abusive relationship where I had no friends no time to myself and she'd say and do things to make me feel shit so I'd stay with her, I'd tried to broke up before but this time I had to get out so after a few hours of massive arguing we were done. I managed to get friends back, been going out with them lots and I've been happier in myself since then.

Today she wanted to meet up at the pub for a drink just to catch up and I stupidly agreed. So we were there and it was all going fine talking about work and then out of nowhere she decides to just tell me she's seeing someone else, tells me details about him and everything. And I just, I dunno, it hurt. A lot. Like I made an excuse, went out for a cigarette and then we left soon after. She said she didn't meet up just to tell me that but I don't know, why would she go out of her way just to tell me that? It doesn't really make sense to me, and the fact that I'm feeling so shit about it doesn't either. I just don't really know where to go from here and was hoping that someone has had something similar or could point me straight. ",31Jan2017,1

I keep wimping out last second or putting it off. I don't even especially need this job so the fact that I'm too scared of talking to people to get anything done is pissing me off. I can talk to other people fine but I guess I'm just inherently scared of people in authority.

275,"I just recently started working at a little mom and pop IT shop right before Christmas, so its only been a month since I've started working,  a little background before I get to the questions, I previously worked for a big business IT company which was suit and tie kinda job, I left due to personal reasons and found this place through a family friend who got with the owner to hire me yadda yadda, now when I was interviewed by the owner it was very straight forward ""Youll work these hours, don't steal anything"" type of thing, didn't have any paperwork to it, just showed up on Monday and got right into it. Now the fun bits, I know what I'm doing and have experience in the field of working on work and home machines along with servers and such, the ""Manager"" that works there is a kid right out of high school and has been there a year and didn't have any previous training in this field before this job, now I still see him as my manager since he has seniority due to the length of which he's worked here.  Since I've started working there I have noticed that he has stopped doing his job all together, he would get to work at 10:30 and help me out with what machines were there (Also first full day I started I had to open the shop by myself and still do, no one else works until he gets in, so I work from 8 to 10 by myself most of the time) now he gets in later like 2 hours later than he normally does and from the time he arrives to the time I leave all he does is sit at his desk and watch game of thrones. doesn't do any work, makes me take all the phone calls, I have to greet every customer, and he additionally tells me that I have to do these things. And when I do ask for his help he says he's busy, as in sitting there watching something download. now this guy is like I said, young about 20 and is going to college, I know how stressed and tired a college kid can be. but this is down right bad work practice. And to boo,t the owner of this place treats him with more intelligence than I, as in if there's an issue he'll go to him, and in turn, the guy gives it to me to deal with and he gets the praise. Now How do I confront the owner (my boss) about this? because I sure as hell am not getting paid enough to run an entire shop by myself, my previous job I was getting paid more to do less. so help me out r/advice. what should I do?
