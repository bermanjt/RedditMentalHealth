0,"On a throw away bc I don't have an account, I just browse usually.  Hey, I'm 16, I'm 3/4 Korean.  My whole life I've grown up in a predominantly white town, the only other asians I've met were Japanese exchange students.  I don't know anything about my own culture and it's beginning to bother me.  My father was adopted by white parents and wasn't allowed to learn his own culture, and my mothers Korean family are self hating and have completely disowned their culture.  It's been really difficult being the only asian at my school other than the exchange students who come and go.  I've grown up listening to the me-Chinese-me-so-dumb rhyme and having kids pull their eyes up at me.  My parents aren't bad, my mom is nothing like her Korean family, they just don't know.

So I've become really interested in Korean stuff recently.  Now that K-pop is growing in popularity with the girls in my class, it's not quite as hard.  I mostly just deal with assumptions that I know the language or was born in Korea.  Some girl told me that she loves my accent lmao, what accent?...  I'm rambling, sorry.

I'd like to know how I can learn more about Korea while I'm living in a predominantly white area.  Like I said, I don't have any relatives I can go to.  I've started trying to learn Korean with some apps on my phone.  I know I could probably just research, but I'm really bad at researching.  I never know what to look for.  Are there any apps that would help me learn about Korea?  Any specific websites I should look for or avoid?  Idk, just how can I learn when I have no one to teach me?",25Dec2017,3
1,"Not only this year, but since I was about 15 I've always struggled to get into the Christmas spirit. I listen to countless Christmas songs, watch festive movies, walk through the town, give and receive presents but no matter what I do, I can't seem to get into the Christmas spirit and if I do, it's only for a short period of time.

Does anyone know why this is? I sometimes get emotional around this time too about numerous things at this time too such as friendships, relationships and family. Any advice will be great and how to get into the mood just before Christmas begins?  ",25Dec2017,2
2,"I’m in my mid twenties with a child in pre-K. Her dad lives in another state and has very little to do with her. I’ve learned a lot about myself from dating (&amp; almost marrying) her father. 
I’m a fairly independent woman and I don’t want to become a housewife with a lot of children (not that there’s anything wrong with people who do). In fact, I don’t want anymore kids. I love my little one, but I don’t think I want to raise a child all alone again if things don’t work out with the next guy. 

I’m awful at online dating. I love talking in person, but messaging is just not something I can do very well without things getting boring. 

How can I find someone who doesn’t mind not having another child? How do I find someone at all without being on tinder or bumble? 

Additional info:
The 2 guys that showed mutual interest in me this year turned out to be involved in relationships. 1 married and the other had a long term girlfriend. I’m a magnet for guys in relationships and I don’t know why. ",25Dec2017,2

However, I'm already finding myself slacking off and playing games and eating all day long on the first day. I don't want to keep doing this for the rest of winter break, as things will go really downhill when I come back to school again. Any help on how to get motivation and studying done over the break?

4,"I'm not sure how to handle what's going on with my mom. I would not out-right call her toxic, but she's highly needy/dependent on others and has been for a while. She never abused my brother or I growing up, fed and clothed us, more than less supported our life choices. I live several states away and see her about 2 times a year. I'm at her apartment now.

Starting in middle school, she became what my friends called ""bed mom"". She wasn't depressed or anything, but would just...stay in bed all day. She stopped going out much, wasn't working or volunteering... No exercise and poor eating habits, too. Eventually she started feeling depressed (obviously).

Immediately after we noticed her losing interest in things, and for almost 2 decades now, my family has BEGGED her to make lifestyle changes. To volunteer or work part time, to start going outside, join a book club or bible study, to see a therapist, take art classes, to start eating vegetables or doing yoga. She's done, oh, 2% of any of this, never for long. Her excuse for giving up or not even trying is the same -- ""I can't, I'm depressed.""

She's been on every anti-depressant under the sun. The last one she said was working for her made her gain 10lbs so she stopped taking it (she's still taking Klonopin). She's under 130lbs. The only thing I've ever known her to be passionate about, is her hatred of fat people. By the grace of god my brother and I aren't fat so we never got any heat from her, but her scorn for fat people runs deep. She cares more about staying slim than being mentally stable/happy because ""Men don't like fat women.""

Her being thin didn't stop my dad from leaving her about 6 years ago. He was tired of waiting hand and foot on a woman who brought no joy into his life and refused to take care of herself. (He's no angel either and tbh I think my mom should have left HIM ages ago, but this is how the cookie crumbled.) The only effort my mom has put anything into during the periods where she could drag herself out of her room was  dating, so she could sucker someone into being her caretaker. Hence her main priority being to stay thin. All she cares about is being skinny and taken care of by a man.

She's been living with my brother for a few years. He has Asperger's, is a college student and works part time at home. He does all the shopping, runs her errands, and pays most of the bills. He's not mentally equipped to be particularly sympathetic, so he's basically a live-in butler and can't provide her with social interaction. She's very lonely, has no local friends, hates her life/living situation, but still expects other people to make her life comfortable for her.

Just last week, she was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer. My first thought was, ""Oh, no :(,"" and my second, ""This is going to fucking suck.""

Sure enough, it sucks. (Note: we don't yet know the aggressiveness as she doesn't have an appointment with the oncologist until the 8th of Jan, which leads be to believe it's not alarming, and her only physical complaint is stomach ache which mysteriously manifested right after the diagnoses.) Same excuse as always: ""I can't take care of myself, I'm depressed."" 

Yesterday I suggested she move to the beachside condo in a nice retirement community in south Florida she inherited. She could easily be involved in social activities, be by the beach which she loves, not have to worry about losing her home, have access to a myriad of healthcare services, and of course we'd visit. She could live however long she has left in the sun and sand with a community. Sounds great right!? Well, she absolutely lost her mind and outright refused to even consider it because, her words, she needs my brother to live with her and the condo is a 1br.

I feel terrible for my brother, who feels trapped and used. I'm only here for another week, but I have no idea how to best treat her to protect myself and my brother from an increasingly dependent and toxic situation. I know she'll get more and more needy and will expect me to drop everything for her, long before real physical symptoms manifest. I've tried many times in the past to set boundaries and such but that lasts like a month before it's back to the same shit. On more than one occasion, before the cancer, she threatened to call my place of work and tell them I need to leave to move in with her just because she's depressed. I'm worried she is going to dial this behavior to 11.

So...I guess i'm looking for anecdotes from people who have been in similar situations and some considerations i perhaps haven't thought of. Feeling pretty helpless about her helplessness, unsure of where to go from here. On one hand I think i should be as nice as possible because she'll never change, who knows how long she has left, so might as well be kind. On the other, I want to throw her in a home and call it a day because you can't help people who won't help themselves, and I need to protect myself from an increasingly unhealthy relationship.

tl;dr depressed and dependent mother who refused to help herself for 20 years recently diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer; has been using my brother/family as a crutch and is only getting worse with new diagnoses. not sure how to process this/treat my mom while protecting myself.",25Dec2017,8
5,"Hello, just yesterday, a day before Christmas eve I wrecked and probably totalled my car. I did buy gap insurance, and do have full coverage. I didn't expect this to happen and was not ready for it at all.

Called my insurer. Said they'll get back to me Tuesday.
Towed car and left it at the towing facility.

9,"My apologies for the strange title and for the sort of dumb question.

I own a lot of things I have collected over the years that I don't even use anymore but I have difficult time throwing it out or donating it because I have sentimental feelings attached to the item. 

An example: I have a jacket that no longer fits me. I had it for 10 years and had many good memories with it. But I can't bring myself to donate it or throw it out.

Question: How do I learn to let go of sentimental items? How do I justify it to myself?

19,"I got into personality tests while I was first trying to sort my life out. I didn't realize I had depression at the time just didn't know it. Going through personality tests..I realized that self knowledge is really the only way I can truly navigate life the best I possibly can. So I'm looking for passion, and meaning, and excitement...and I'm obsessed with understanding the exact way my brain works. It's terrible for me though because you can't observe your own brain work naturally...it's paradoxical. Yet at the same time, I can't stop. I feel a pull to pin it down...to know. But thinking about it exhausts me now, so much so that it is depressing me to think about it and yet I can't stop still. I try to get out of my head, but I never make any progress on what I enjoy...or what I find meaningful. Those are precisely the things I need though to move on with my life. It's a practical catch 22. I'm hopelessly stuck in this god damn loop of needing to know how my brain works and it making me even more depressed and that leading back into the exact thing which makes me self analyze.

At the same time, I feel I am becoming more and more tired of my brain. When self analysis even comes up in my brain I just want to go lay down and sleep. I'm EXHAUSTED. I just want to know what I'm good for and what is meaningful to me.",25Dec2017,2

25,"We broke up but for some reason I still think we’re going to get back together. She’s been hooking up with other guys (one of which she told me not to worry about while we were dating), leaving me on read, and texing me one word answers. She only facetimes me when she’s in the mood to talk to me, usually before bed. If she isn’t in the mood to talk to me she’ll just give one word answers until the conversation can’t continue or she’ll just leave me on read.

But she always facetimes me before bed to flirt with me and tell me about her day and for me to tell her about mine. She says we’re friends but anytime I do anything friendly she says “what are u doing we aren’t dating anymore” making it impossibly hard to be her friend. 

What pisses me off is if the situation was reversed, if i broke up with her and did all this to hed, she would never talk to me again. But I just keep coming back, keep messaging first, keep making excuses for every fucked up thing she does. She does some fucked up things too. But I make excuses for it because i’m crazy in love with her. 

She’ll be a bitch to me all the time, then once she hooks up with a guy (not sex though), she tells me about it then just kisses my ass the rest of the night then becomes a bitch again until the next time she does something 

She did something overly fucked up a few weeks ago. While we were dating almost all our fights were about this one guy she had a history with that always flirts with her and tries to get her to hang so they can hook up, this dude has even told her to leave me for him, and she still stays friends with him (while we were dating). Then when we stopped dating she told me i had nothing to worry about, that they established they are only friends, and that she could never do that to me. Then a month later she hooks up with him and goes further with him (a douche she never dated) than she did with me (serious boyfriend that she talked about the future with). I stopped talking to her for a week, then she facetimes me and wants to be my friend again and of course I give in. Then start making excuses for what she did. And now she’s back to her bitchy self. She’s actually mad at me for having stopped talking to her and she tells me she doesn’t trust me because of it

Idk why I keep making excuses for her, keep giving her chances, keep opening myself up to get hurt when I know she’s really just stringing me along. This guy she hooked up with tried to date her and she was too nervous to say she isn’t interested so she said “i don’t know the future but i’m not feeling it right now, maybe we can in the future”. That’s the same shit she told me after i asked her if she thinks we’re getting back together. Idk fuck

34,"So I'm on Christmas break relaxing and decompressing. I reflect on my current position and it's not good. I am unbelievably stressed out because of work. And when I say unbelievably stressed out, I mean I can't seem to work through the simplest tasks any more and feel constantly drowned by day to day activities. 

What I am used to when it comes to work, is being able to identify very low hanging fruit, easy wins and impressing my boss through resolving those problems with hard work and dedication. However, I've been through 5 bosses over the past 2 years at my current job.

I haven't really looked because really this job for a long while has been much better than a lot of my recent jobs. But my newest boss seems to be out to get me. He's hushed me during meetings, he's been highly critical of my work, given me lots of busy work, has taken me out of the lime light of my own projects.

Now, here's the kicker, I know someone who has worked with individual before, he says he's extremely difficult to work with, and he pities anyone who has to work under him (Harvard grad who thinks dirty work is beneath him) this person reports to our ceo and has advised me to bite my tongue and let things play out.

My problem has been is building some mental bubble to protect myself from the stressors he has introduced to my day. I have recently even cried on my way to work because of the stress.

Now mind you, I'm no stranger to hard work,  I am very often the first person at work and the last to leave, that stress is fine as long as my efforts are recognized. What has me down is all this hard work I'm putting in, while also seemingly being attacked by my employer.

How can I protect myself mentally? I love doing a good job, I love the satisfaction of hard work when it's recognized, but right now it's not. How do I at the very least protect my mental sanity until I find a new job or until this thing plays itself out?",25Dec2017,2

They're mostly unwrapped and only she knew who they were for. How are we meant to be? Part of me wants to fall asleep right now so I can stop thinking about it all but I'm also terrified for the time when everybody else wakes up and we have to start the day.

Then one day my friend tells me they found a job through this ""mentor"" figure and everything they were saying threw up red flags: Amway, Robert Kiyosaki, ""I get a recruitment bonus"" etc. I tried my best to bring to their attention about MLM and pyramid schemes, but they weren't having any of it and stopped talking to me for a bit because I wasn't being ""supportive"". Over the next couple of months, they have decided to drop out of school and has put their savings into becoming an independent business owner for Amway. This friend has also decided to move in with their significant other and is expecting a child in a few months.

I care a lot about this friend but everything I've tried to do to convince them that this isn't a good idea has failed. I really don't want this friend to throw their life away especially when it will affect not only them but their significant other and child. They have also tried to recruit some of my other friends into this and I'm getting scared how cult-like this all is. So, please advise. Any information would be helpful at this point. If you know anyone who has been through this or any organization that deals with this, please let me know.

If this is the wrong sub for this, please let me know.",25Dec2017,15
47,I recently got into a little spat with my boyfriend because I was giving a tone of voice he didn’t like and I told him earlier in the day I’m cramping really bad and I feel awful. For me on the days I get cramps I just get all the emotional turmoil on that day as well and it usually passes after a day or so and then it’s fine and all is well. But I find it really hard to control my tone of voice because i know it comes out sounding bitchy but I don’t know what to do. I just try not to talk because everything just bothers me but I also don’t want to create any issue but when I’m forced to talk about things it just always comes out bad. I take midol to help the pain but I don’t know if I can do anything to help the emotional aspects of it too. I’m just looking for any advice on it to help him understand it’s hard and also to help me figure out what I can do to help this besides just not taking for a day. Please don’t tell me I’m a terrible person for having bitchy tones because I’m really trying to fix this. ,25Dec2017,10
48,"I got a relative cooking lessons for Christmas.

She’s a good cook, but she’s always watching the food network and trying new techniques from internet videos, so I thought she’d enjoy some professional instruction. 

I’m worried it’ll come off as passive aggressive because I don’t want her to think “If you like my cooking why do you think I need lessons?” 

She has a lot of fun cooking and I wouldn’t have purchased her the lessons if I didn’t think she’d enjoy them but I’m having doubts now. 

They’re a digital subscription, I’m sending the email first thing in the morning, and still have time to switch it with a Kindle Unlimited subscription (less personal but less likely to offend). 

Is there any chance she’ll misread my intentions? 

EDIT: Thank you for the advice, I’ve decided to send it and include something along the lines of what I said up here in the card section to reiterate the thought behind the gift. Merry Christmas everyone!",25Dec2017,3
51,"I am not a naturally attractive person, I’ve been overweight my entire life, and let’s cut the BS and be honest: being an Asian male has not opened many doors for me in life. I know I’m naturally not a very likable person just based on my physical appearance, and going to college this past year made this very apparent to me. I was a very nice and energetic and caring person, or so I’ve been told, while I was in high school. Since coming to college, however, I have slowly lost this happiness and kindness. Nowadays, I have become very bitter and incredibly depressed and borderline suicidal. While I have gone through a deeper depression than I ever experienced and am seeking professional help, I do blame myself somewhat from changing who I am. I have operated recently on the belief that “since the world naturally doesn’t like people like me, I have no obligation to be nice to the world.” I don’t like the person I’m becoming, and I can tell that I’ve just become a hateful person. Any advice on how to stop this?

53,"My wife is 7 months pregnant, and we found out last month that we are having a girl. While we're excited about the new addition to the family, we've found ourselves in minor tussles about what we're going to name her. Tonight, on Christmas Eve of all times, it all came to a head. 

Here's a little bit of background: my wife is a preschool teacher and part-time yoga instructor, and I work as a senior coordinator of exhibitions for the local aquarium. With stable careers and decent salaries, we tend to get along on a day-to-day basis. We might bicker about things here and there, but we've never really gotten into full-blown blowouts like the one we had tonight, not even when we were dating.

Her mom and dad were at our house tonight for a christmas eve dinner, and they were (of course) asking if we've decided on a name for our soon-to-be. That's when it started to go downhill. See, my biggest passion is marine life. I love it. I live for it, it's my line of work. If I could pick any name for my daughter, more than anything, I would want to name her Orca-Marie. Orcas are some of the most intelligent forms of marine life, and their majesty is unmatched by any living creature of the land, sea or air.

When my wife mentioned the name I had picked out, she took a stab at my career and my father in law started to laugh. When I protested, she claimed that I loved ""fish more than family."" That really, really hurt. So I snapped and took a stab back at her which I now regret.

The name that my wife insists we give our daughter is so dumb. I don't want to mince words about it. It is literally one of the dumbest made-up names I have ever heard. She wants to name our new child Stiffany, a combination of her older sister Stephanie and her (recently-deceased) childhood best friend Tiffany. In the middle of our table-side argument, I regretfully called her idea a ""bunch of hippy-dippy new age bulls*t."" 

I mean, I really feel that way, but I feel terrible that I embarrassed my wife like that. I still feel hurt about her comments regarding my career, and the fact that her father laughed at me about it, but she's locked herself in our room and has been crying on and off for the last few hours.

We really need to come to a compromise about our daughter's name. I guess I'm asking the posters on this subreddit to try and pick one out of the two names that they think would be more acceptable. Maybe one of you can provide me with a convincing argument for the name I picked out, or perhaps even convince myself to go with my wife's choice. I just want a resolution at this point, so we can forget tonight and focus on a happy future for ourselves and our new daughter.",25Dec2017,4
55,"Recently my sister deeply hurt me and cut me off for a month. We live in the same house, our room doors are side by side. She basically called me her life's biggest disappointment and some other minor things.

Just recently she decided to rekindle our relationship and has been talking to me perfectly normal, acting like nothing happened. She told me she bought me a Christmas gift and so I decided to buy her one because I felt obligated to. I told myself and those who know about the situation that I'm only going to give her her gift if she apologizes. I've given her 2 weeks now and still nothing.

I feel obligated to give her one due to the reasons that she bought me one and because she's technically family.

I feel like just giving her her gift and then cutting her off right after. As in ""here's your gift, goodbye"".

But here's the thing. If I tell my boyfriend that, he's going to get extremely angry. He tells me that I shouldn't give her one because of what she's done. I don't know how to explain to my boyfriend how I see the situation and how I truly feel.",25Dec2017,3
56,"I started dating this girl back in March and we instantly connected. We actually started hanging out nearly everyday after we met. There were ups and downs, but nothing ever got too serious, we never fought or yelled at each other, and we tried to communicate as much as possible. Seven months later she’s at a music festival and I text her to check up on her and make sure she’s having a good time. I don’t get anything back all day. Later I tell her I’m going to bed and to let me know if she needed anything. Then she responds saying she can’t be in this relationship anymore and we’re done. It was like a car crash—one second everything was totally fine, and the next everything was falling apart. I tried calling her but she wouldn’t answer because she was still with her friends and didn’t want to talk. A few days go by and she comes over and we didn’t really talk about us, she just told me how it’s going to be and there’s really nothing I can do about it. That all happened back in October. I’ve been trying to get over her but I just can’t. I still think about her all the time and I just want her back in my life. We were inseparable when we were together so now that she’s gone I feel even more alone because whenever I used to be “alone” I was still with her. I text her and try to talk to her and sometimes she responds but most of the time she just ignores me. Everyone’s just telling me it hurts because it was my first serious relationship, but I think it hurts even more because I know exactly what I want, but I don’t think I’ll ever have it again. I’m almost always alone now and I hate it. I just want to give things another try because she means so much to me. Please help with anything at all.",25Dec2017,1

77,"I live a great life and really have everything going for me: looks, talent, great friends, intelligence, amazing family, I'm hardworking, have a very bright academic future, etc. and am generally quite happy and genuinely enjoy my life, but I frequently get intense bouts of depression. I'm quite a logical and practical person (I’m a mathematician) but I really have a hard time accepting the reality that I am mentally sick, despite those who know me saying I outwardly appear »too sane"" and stable. I had some drug experiences that resulted in mental health issues for some years during my mid teens, and while they were horrible experiences, I wouldn't change them because I learned the fleetingness of life which led to seriously improving my life. I began reading tons of books, working out, eating healthily, and I eventually moved out of my small town to a bigger city, worked and studied for some years, then made a huge move to a large international city with one of my best friends and went to university which I have been studying at for the last year and a half. I have been very focused and life is great in many ways.

My roommate has been gone for the last few days to visit his family, and I have never been alone (away from friends and family) for this long in my entire life, as my family lives overseas, and we unfortunately couldn't afford to have me over there for Christmas. To be honest, while I love my roommate, I am actually really enjoying the peace and quite after the intense stress of finals (exams). On Friday, I had a great day, meditating, reading, studying for next semester, I had a great workout, and went to my good friends for a Christmas party. I was meeting new people and chatting with friends I already know, one gave me a perfect thoughtful gift. After the party, I was dropped off by another friend, and while it was clear I had been drinking, I was having reasonably intelligent conversations  about academic stuff and politics throughout the night without too much trouble, so I clearly wasn’t too drunk, I had only drank a bottle of wine and a shot of liquor. I had been laughing and joking all night, having an amazing relaxing time, without a shred of negativity.

When one of my friends dropped me off downtown near the bus station, the bus station was closed so I asked the guys there for directions to the nearest bus stop which was one or two blocks away. As I was walking, I walked up some cathedral steps and completely broke down in front of the door. I was uncontrollably balling my eyes out on my knees for no reason. I was there for about 30 minutes in what I remember being horrible emotional pain, and thankfully no one was around to save my embarrassment. After I decided to leave, there just happened to be a cab across the street (this is all at like 3:30 in the morning) and he took me home in near silence, save some small talk. When I got home, I started again, and I went to the cupboard and grabbed all of the pills in the and whilst uncontrollably sobbing, I counted every single one and calculated the dosage in milligrams to make sure it was enough to kill me (there were over 100 pills including ibuprofen and aspirin). After some time of sitting at the table counting the pills over and over again, I remembered I had the suicide hotline in my phone but it was under a pseudonym I couldn’t remember so I googled it and someone picked up quickly. I couldn’t talk for a few minutes because I was crying so hard, but eventually she got me to do some breathing exercises and calm down enough to talk. We talked for about 40 minutes and I vented about some things that had been bothering me. She convinced me to flush the pills down the toilet and I was feeling much better. I texted my roommate saying something like « Despite appearances, I am not and have not been well for some time, and I would greatly appreciate if you could help hold me accountable in getting the proper help that I require » but mentioned nothing of my suicidal ideation and near attempt. He said that he had suspected something and that he’d be supportive in my endeavour, and we wished each other a Merry Christmas. At around 4 am I was exhausted, I lay down and passed out on my bed.

The next day I spent alone at home and was a little disturbed by my strange behaviour the night before (it still feels surreal and detached). However, I just went about my business and made sure I had an enjoyable day reading, playing piano, watching movies. I even called my parents and talked to my family, but was disturbed thinking about what they would think if they knew. I probably contemplate suicide every day but am usually completely dissuaded because I would consider it to be horribly selfish to take away a loved one from those that I love myself, especially my mother and my little brother, who is still a child.

I understand that I am to get therapy/counselling again, I received plenty in my drug addled teen years and had some earlier this year when I was feeling similar to how I am now, but I am wondering if I should tell anybody close to me about the incident. I don’t want to worry anyone, and anyone who hears what happened will be horribly shocked and I don’t believe anyone will have expected it, and to be honest it’s quite embarrassing. Even my roommate who says he suspected I was a mess would be shocked to hear that I had taken it so far.

Last august I drank one night, not particularly heavily, but I became very depressed and didn’t drink for almost 300 days after that. However, even with only drinking sometimes just one or two drinks a month, I stay up half night sometimes just staring out of the window thinking about dying. This is clearly not normal and as a supposed « practical  guy », I need to accept I can’t just do this alone.

Thanks for reading and I am not looking for any sympathy, just advice on how to go about this sensitive issue with those I love. Merry Christmas am I right?!

91,"Hi all, so this is going to be a bit of a rant and emotion vomit, but I’ve tried my best to clean it up and make it substantial. It’s my first time ever really “asking” for advice but thought I’d give it a shot. I want to preface this with that I am fully aware my problems pale in comparison with many people and this is one of the issues I have with my feelings (why am I getting upset over something so small?)

**Background**:

I’m a soon to be graduate (next semester is my last), and I’m overall a pretty successful student. I entered university a bit more than a year early, have decent grades, signed an offer with one of the Big 4 Tech Companies upon graduation, have many research roles lined up for me, genuinely enjoy my work and my program of study. I’m not sure if I’m socially awkward or not, but in my life (especially before University), I’ve had lots of great experiences with friends (male and female) and I was very satisfied with my relationships. Heading into university, I had a similar mindset that it would be just like that, but better, I could meet a lot of people quicker and faster. 

**University**:

The first and second year of my University is rather uneventful and I don’t think play a very relevant role - but it is worth noting that I did not end up with many friends (and to this day, I only made and have one friend from University). In my third year, I was very set on landing a good internship for the summer at a reputable company and could not find it in myself to enjoy anything (socially, family, etc.) until I landed it. For a bit more than half a year, every day was filled with self-doubt and frustration at myself, I completely ignored my family and friends for most of it to focus on academics and mathematics competitions, algorithms, contest programming, etc. to prepare myself for interviews. At this point, I was mostly doing it for self-validation and I eventually did end up landing an intern in California at one of the Big 4. Good, I’ve worked hard to get my career to where I want, now I can focus on the little things I want to improve: my social life, my family, my well-being and what I want to get out of University. I thought I’ve earned it now, I have earned the luxury to worry about other things. 

**Now:**

Now, in my final year of studies, I still only have one good organic friend at University, everyone else are people that require me a reason to see. For example, members on the sports team or friends from a similar club, I won’t be seeing them (or at least, it feels awkward to me) outside of the these events. Overall, if I could sum up my feelings about University, it feels like my whole “college experience was stolen from me” despite never having attained it. I am quite disappointed with my University experience and have found little to no social satisfaction and I mostly attribute this as a problem to myself. Just this September, my parents starting their rather one-sided split (my dad just randomly announced he was moving away) and to this day, I remain their primary method of communication. A lot of their problems are issues and situations that happened before I was born, but these months I have been tasked with arbitrating arguments, dealing with police calls to our home due to their arguments disturbing the neighbours (we live in a decently sized home, mind you), and consoling my mother who has not been taking it well (that’s putting it modestly). Every day I have to hear my mom blaming me for not being able to bring back our Dad or supporting her on some plan that will change his mind, or whatever the twisted family problem is. I know she (and he) doesn’t mean a lot of things they say and I don’t blame them since it’s a heated and difficult situation. I won’t bring up the specifics, but the situation is so complicated that I can’t even begin to imagine how the world’s best therapist could untangle them. In these past few months, I have developed this unyielding “anxiety”, I don’t want to be presumptuous and diagnose myself at the risk of offending those that actually have real problems and anxiety, but I will describe how I feel:

* Scared to leave my family alone, I feel like for some reason my time with them is becoming extremely limited and I’m constantly scared they’re going to die or if I don’t spend as much time with them now, I’m going to regret it later
* Every night when I sleep, I get this consuming and merciless deep guilt in my chest that makes me feel like I’ve done something incredibly wrong that no matter what, I cannot fix. It feels like a deep deep hole has opened in my chest. I use OTC sleep aids like Melatonin and anti-histamines, but thus far, sleep has been evading me for the past couple of months
* My stomach is constantly fluttering and I always feel worried for no good reason, worried enough that I spend a few minutes every hour trying to rationalize it out

**My thoughts**:

I think there are two main reasons why I feel this way:
After achieving a career with one of the big 4, I thought my life would be solved, I would be done, the joy it would bring me would overpower every little problem I had. That’s not true at all, a goal is only good until its gone and I’ve squeezed out all the happiness out of my offer letter already.
With little to no friends and being disappointed socially, I think my family has been one of the only “pillars” in my self-worth. Now that’s gone. 

I’m a the point where I have little motivation to see anyone. I just want to stay at home and practice algorithms, or read up on math, or talk to my mom and eat breakfast with her (despite never having really been homesick - I’ve been away from home many times for months at end). I’m now even considering alerting my company that I can’t continue with the offer and ask them to relocate me to my home city so I can be with my family (currently, I’m posed to work in the States and live in an apartment with my good friend from high school - but now I just don’t want to be with anyone). I don’t know if it’s just because I want my family back, I want a new goal, friends, or I just want a girlfriend, but these days have been moving so fast that I feel like I’m going to 50 next year and I feel like I have nothing else to do but just hopelessly watch. Nobody needs me at the moment, except my parents, and the best I can do is just try to stay with them for now. I've never really dated anyone, nobody has ever really needed me in any way, never really asked anyone to support or help me, my failed attempts at University to make friends for the past four years is pretty good evidence that I can’t or there is a good reason why people don’t want to talk to me. At the end of the day, the only thing good about me is my job at the Big 4 and my above average intellect, but so what? These are the questions that I rhetorically ask myself and I know how much privilege I have to be in a position to ask them, I know they’re not true, nobody is really “not needed”, nobody is truly incapable of “making friends”, but it feels very much like it. 

This whole post might just be a long rant and I’m not really sure where I’m going with this, but I guess I want to reddit’s thoughts, people’s experiences if they’re similar (or if they’re not but would be valuable to hear), if I should take to a counsellor(which I’ve always been pretty against to). Mostly, I’m using you guys to argue against myself, so I sincerely hope you don’t mind.

I work part time at a pizza place, and go to college as a full time student. 

I think I'm average looking. 

I have a small friend circle I trust, and talk to alot.

I am socially awkward and tend to stay home if I'm not at work/school.

I feel very indifferent about everything.( I feel as though I am just drifting through life just saying ""meh or whatever to everything.)

I have no real desires/wants/aspirations.

I know a lot of answers will be ""get out of the house!"" Or something like that, but I live in a very small town of about 2k and do not really have the money or the will to go out (even if I wanted to.)I also know reddit isn't exactly the right place to go to for this kind of thing, but I feel like it's the most comfortable place for me to turn to first. (I guess it's the whole anonymous part?)

I just don't know what or if there is something wrong with me, or what to do...

If you have any other questions or need further clarification feel free to ask/pm me.

Thanks in advance for any and all replies :D",25Dec2017,4

I feel like I can nearly be happy. I can forgive everyone but that here would be suicide. I'm so mad, disgusted, resentful. 

I hate that my life has to marked by this. These people. I don't remember what it's like to feel safe. I think - it must be forgetting the question of safety.

My family is fucked. I don't trust them. My friends are liars. Maybe hurting me in a way they can't help. I can't go anywhere.

105,"Hi all- Thank you in advance for your advice on this, I need it!

My sister is visiting from out of town and this evening, Christmas Eve, we went to my boyfriend's mothers house for dinner/festivities. At one point, my sister got upset about my annoying behavior and started crying, as she is incredibly outwardly emotional.When asked what was wrong, she went outside, and I followed to see what's up. From there, she told me I was a horrible sister among other harsh words. 

But the real trouble occurred with my boyfriends mother asking her to talk about what was going on, despite both my sister and I explaining it's a problem between us and we would prefer to not talk about it. Because my BF's mother kept poking and prodding, my sister couldn't stop her tears. Eventually the situation devolved into my Dee (BF's mother) yelling that we need to deal with our issues and that I ""constantly run away from my problems"" and ""Need to help my sister"" etc. etc, despite us both asking to not discuss this as we weren't comfortable. 

She eventually continued cussing at me and yelling about how I run from my problems and telling my sister I'm at fault and that we need to air out our issues here and now. She claims that because we were in her apartment, we were obligated to hash it out, right then, and right now, despite us wanting to deal with this later on our time and in our own way. She demanded we discuss our deep seeded issues in front of them and became verbally aggressive and rude towards me for telling her it was not her place to dictate how we deal with our issues and we would like to deal with this differently. 

Context: She has deep seeded issues with her own sister, and I believe she was projecting her own problems on us. Additionally she went on to tell my sister secrets of mine that I had confided in her about that I had no intention with sharing with my sister. 

My sister and I are not close at all, and I felt cornered and attacked by this demand to hash out deep problems with my sister on Xmas eve at her apartment. I am also not close with Dee. 

How should I proceed? Am I being irrational in my upset? Help!",25Dec2017,2

110,"Hi 

I'm a senior in high school and I feel like I have no control of my life. 

I never had any passions throughout high school and wasted my time looking at YouTube and watching movies and TV. I always hated that about myself, but I was stuck to it due to financial constraints and strict parents.

Now I'm super into wanting to learn music production and drums. My parents are a lot more lenient now, but they still expect me to be a doctor. Plus, I still have the financial constraints and the fact that college dorm rooms don't exactly make the best music studios. 

I'm on the medical tract and I know that time is only going to get more limited. I want to pursue that as a career but  more interested in finding a passion first rather than going through years of school without one. I fear that if I don't ever get to pursue these passions, I'm going to end up in a dark place in the future.

119,"TL:DR at bottom

21f and 26m, we have been together 2+ years (known each other 4) We used to live together but are currently doing long distance due to school.

I feel like things were going really good for a while, there was no fighting and I felt like I was moving on from our past drama, but he started pulling away and ""forgetting"" about me.

By this I mean he would be home from work for *hours* until I get a text saying ""Hey"" and explaining he forgot to message me. The first time I let it go, whatever, at least he remembered eventually. The second time I got kind of annoyed, because he remembers to get on Twitter but not shoot me a text, to which he apologized and I let it go again. The third time I got pissed. I let him know how annoying it is that he keeps forgetting about me but rememebers to talk to everyone else. All he said was ""sorry"". This half assed, one word 'apology' pissed me off more than anything, tbh. Everytime I would try calling him, he would reject it and message me ""he's too tired to talk"". This is believable, but three times in a row? I was miffed. This all took place over the course of three days.

Today (the fourth day) is kind of what drove me to post this. He messaged me good morning, and I replied a couple minutes later after I woke up. I asked how he was feeling, what he was up to, etc etc, nothing big. He stops replying all of the sudden, so I ask him if he's still there. He says yes, but I'm not ""giving him much to work with"" in terms of conversation. It stung a bit, not gonna lie. So I start asking him about his video game that he's been playing, what quest he's doing, stuff like that. Then he tells me to leave him alone, he's busy playing and he doesn't wanna keep pausing to talk, he will message me when he's done. 

I told him that it's a bit insulting to keep me constantly hanging mid conversation, he simply replied ""ok"". 

I waited four hours for him to finish so we could talk, only to find out he wasn't even playing. He was on various social media sites. He messaged me finally in the late afternoon saying he really misses me. I told him I'd rather he *show* me he misses me by actually considering my feelings for once, and he said to quit the attitude or ""he'll find someone who won't give him so much [attitude]"" 

and I'm honestly just really confused.

If someone misses you, surely they wouldn't lie about what they're doing, forget about you, and then disregard your feelings when you confront them right??? The whole ""find someone else"" comment threw me for a loop. I don't think he's cheating, at least I haven't seen any evidence of any. I dont know what to do from here. I know many comments will suggest leaving, but I want to know if there's anything other than that that can be done.


**TL:DR** Boyfriend forgets to message (only) me, lied about what he was doing today, then said he misses me hours later, only to say to drop my attitude or he'll find someone else. I'm really confused at everything he's saying/doing and how they contradict each other.

Here's the story, excuse any grammatical errors, earlier this month after getting home for the holiday I decided to go to the club, drank with my friends till the club closed after it closed we got seperated as I was busy socialising with other familiar faces, as people started leaving I then started to look for my mates and I couldn't find them. I then made a mistake of asking this ladies phone she agreed but still I couldn't reach them, she told me not worry she'll ask her friends to drop me off close to home I agreed but I doubt she did that because we ended at her friends place, after sometime when we got there she called me aside and said her friend says she can't drive now but will drop me of in the morning. Again I didn't mind after sometime she started to flirt with me to which I responded too and we ended up fucking, in the morning she wanted my 10s I gave her because I didn't want to be mean or rude. I answered her calls and text for a few days after the encounter she seemed very interested in to which I declined because she's too old, 19 years older than me. She kept nagging me to which I responded by blocking her. We never saw each other until yesterday, she waited for me to be seperated from my friends and begged me to come to her place so we could spend the night together, I declined and told her I don't want anything to do with her she seemed to agree at the time and I left her and went back to my friends. As the club's closing time came closer she came to where I was sitting with my friends to beg me. Again I told no, she kept begging and I got tired of her shit and left her at the table with my friends, she stayed for a while and then left, after she left I went back. She told my friends she loved me and she enjoyed the time we had together and they must beg me to go with her, they didn't they just made fun of me.

122,"Hey everyone! I’m new to this subreddit; stumbled upon it feeling kind of low. 

Kind of a long story but I don’t know where else to put it or anyone else to tell it to so hopefully I don’t annoy anyone here with it. 

I’m a third year at a big university kind of known for partying. I got in on a full ride academic scholarship to study Biochemistry in hopes of reaching medical school. In high school my mom was strict and would never let me go out during the week and definitely never let me party. I didnt really hangout with friends cause I was always busy with school work.  When I got to college it was really hard for me to manage my time wisely. I often stay up late hanging out with friends, party pretty often, and always put less important things before more important things like school work because I have severe FOMO. I failed out of Biochemistry (I failed Organic Chemistry twice and its against university policy to retake the class so I cant do Biochemistry and I no longer qualify for medical school), and am now a Psychology and Brain Sciences major. This past quarter I definitely did better but it still isn’t good enough. I hope to be able to do well enough in my last two years (hopefully I can graduate on time) in order to get into a good Post-Bac program to still be able to make it to med school. 

My problem is learning feels harder than it should. In high school I was a full International Baccalaureate student (comparable to AP although many people believe its harder) and all I had to do was attend class to learn the information. Now I have trouble paying attention in lectures, forget material easily, and go into tests after days of studying feeling unprepared. I definitely dedicated more time this last quarter than I did previously, and although my grades did slightly improve it wasn’t nearly enough. 

Whenever my parents get on me about my grades I get really frustrated because I know I should be doing better but I just dont know what to do. Actually, I feel like i know I need to put in way more time, I need to cut out some bad habits, and I need to go out less. But doing these things when it comes down to it is much harder than it is to say I need to do them. 

Reading back on this it seems like a lot of me just venting and not really asking anything. Sorry, I dont have anyone to talk to about this. 
 
I need advice on how to improve my academics, how to change these bad habits that I didnt used to have, and how can I buckle down and focus on the important things better while still balancing a fun and active social life. 

Any help would be really appreciative as I feel like whatever I do isn’t working. ",25Dec2017,1

128,"Howdy r/advice, in the past you guys have helped me an enormous amount so I thought I’d shoot my shot again to see if you guys can help me with another situation!

To give a little backstory, 
I broke up with an ex in early July that left me pretty broken, as a result of me being alone and without friends I attempted to get into contact with people I went to high school with. One person kinda came out on top as being the only person to really care about me, so she basically won my heart. Her attitude on things always uplifted me.
She is probably everything I’ve ever wanted in a girl, funny, makes jokes out of anything even if it’s a bad situation, loves to game, loves to work and have money, etc. overall a 11/10 for me.
Only downside is she has a boyfriend, but on countless occasions the complains about this boyfriend not being trusting of her and somewhat shitty to her because he’s scared she will be like his last ex which I guess was a shitty person. She comes to me probably once a week with something about him, whether it be he forgot about a date with her because he was drunk with friends, she wasn’t comfortable being around him and his drunk friends but didn’t have a ride home, shit like that. 
The most recent time she brought it up though she came to it in a different way, but before I explain it, I have before told her how I have felt towards her. To a very deep extent. She knows 100% that she is a very huge part of my life. Telling each other “I love you” and shit like that when texting or playing games is normal for us, even if my meaning of it is different than hers. She has told me how she feels towards me before, and the way she explained it is that she can’t live without me, that I’m a huge part of her life, and that she loves me. She didn’t explain in what manner she loved me, but my obvious guess is like as a best friend or some stupid shit. And when she says can’t live without me, there was a time in the past where I had a time where I came to her at my lowest of lows about suicide, not even thinking of our relationship, and I guess it scared her.


So going back to the most recent bring up of her boyfriend, 

She usually goes a few days here and there not texting me because she’s busy with school and work, and she usually gets off work at midnight and goes home and to bed and the most I get will be like a goodnight love you text, just normal friend stuff I guess.

So she messages me around midnight, says “I need to tell you something” and continues to say that she used to have feelings for me. And I said “why did you need to tell me that” with my thoughts on her having a boyfriend and me trying my best to respect that. And her response was “because I lightweight still do” (for the older Redditors, lightweight is a slang term for “lowkey” or “kinda”) I told her I was confused and she followed it up with “I know and that’s okay. I’m sorry that I never told you and I was thinking about it.. I wanted to tell you how amazing you are and just how I saw beauty from you outside and inside”

She then proceeded to tell me that her boyfriend said something to her about he doesn’t “need” her, so if something happens he wouldn’t hesitate to break up or leave her, because of his past experience with his ex he’s still on the alert or something.


Since her telling me her feelings I’ve just tried my best to be supportive of her but trying to question things. I don’t feel it’s fair to me to be put on edge like that with someone I adore telling me they have feelings than just moving on to another conversation.



So for the advice part, what is something I can say to her to make things happen? I don’t want to be a reason for them to break up and her to come to me but she’s clearly unhappy with him and tells me all the time but now I feel like she’s going too far with it and I have to say something because now it’s dragging me in literally.

Any advice will be appreciated! ",25Dec2017,1

Everyone is drinking laughing and having a good time, we’re playing a gift exchange game, The mood: relaxed and jovial. I notice a camera on a tripod, think to myself, ‘I could take some pictures with that’. But unfortunately my sister doesn’t like that. As I’m messing around with the camera, snapping a couple pictures, my sister comes up to me and punches me in the stomach. She’s 25. Taken aback and floored I return to the couch to stew in my anger. This is not the first time she has done this to me. When she gets drunk she gets hitty, and as a twenty something former sorority sister, she gets drunk frequently. On multiple occasions now, always after she has been drinking, she has hit me similarly, always devolving into a screaming match about how much we hate each other afterwards. A heated and verbal exchange in front of the whole family ensued  after she had punched me and I made the choice to continue to be angry about it and retaliate with very harsh and very cruel words. I am embarrassed by what I said in the heat of the moment, but my frustration has no limit. You don’t get to hit people. We are adults. This is unacceptable, and incredibly hurtful beyond the physical pain of the new bruise just below my rib cage.

I can think of something and then there are 100 thoughts following, imagining scenarios that will probably/hopefully never happen inlcuding a lot of „what ifs“ etc. This can go on until I feel (for a moment) like I can't be happy anymore. It's absolutely horrible.

I have so many things/feelings going on right now. **I haven't really realized until now that we're really together.** It took us a long time to get together, I was wondering for about 2 years if he's into me and I couldn't believe it though all my friends told me it's absolutely obvious. I'm still surprised why he likes me. I have a really low self-esteem and a lot of problems with my looks which is why it's hard for me to be able to accept compliments. I guess that somewhere underneath all this thoughts I'm happy but right now... it's just scary and confusing. And I'm ruining everthing. 

**I've even thought so much that it lead to a really big issue: Am I really attracted to him?** I read so much about physical attraction the last few days and that it's important for a relationship. Then I was wondering what physical attraction really is. I'm such a shy person I can barely look at his face without getting nervous. Especially now because I'm afraid he might want to kiss me and I don't know how to do that. When we're sitting quietly together there's this sort of tension in the air... I had a lot of intimate dreams with him in the past – is this a sign of attraction? Right now I really miss him, I wish he'd be here so I could hug him... and I have a strange feeling in my stomach. But maybe that's just the ""thinking hole"".

Maybe someone should just slap me in my face to stop all of that. 

I'm horrible right? :( Please tell me what to do.

141,"Merry Christmas. Unfortunately, my Christmas is not so merry. I had to stay at home to work my shitty min-wage job and don't get to see my deteriorating grandparents, and after waking up this morning, I feel like shit. Not the normal, expected feeling like shit of being sick or unhealthy, no, I have not felt this bad before from simply working. My legs hurt, my eyes are swollen, I feel weak, it's a little hard to breathe, my *hips* hurt (I'm only 24!), and I'm actually worried about my well-being.

You might be wondering what I do that could have me feeling this bad. I stand at a cash register and walk around a small store assisting customers. That's all. But these past few days have seen me standing for 7-11 hours, and I'm very undernourished. I'm expected to go back tomorrow, and I'm scared of the repercussions on my body if I do and how my manager/co-workers will be affected if I don't show, because I likely won't get a chance to explain due to the chaos of after Christmas shopping, and my manager has proven to me via her actions that she's actually pretty patient and understanding. She's put up with me being late pretty much every day and understands depression personally, and she expressed concern about me not having enough money if I quit. Now, granted, she *did* also express how hard it would be to fill my shifts if I left, especially during this chaos, so she could have just been desperate when she mentioned how I need money. I mean, yes, I *do*, but I already can't pay my bills, and a little extra minimum wage isn't going to help that. My cards are going to stay over the limit, and I've lost my insurance because I couldn't pay for it. Anyway, as far as managers go, she's possibly the best one I've had. I dunno.

My coworkers are all generally nice people, too. I don't really hate any of them like I usually do my coworkers in other jobs. If I can't show on the 26th, they're going to be hurting from me not being there, but I really don't think I can physically do it. I think I've reached my limit and I need to stop for my health's sake. I need time to recuperate. I need time to eat more than once or twice in a day. Yesterday I couldn't sleep until 4AM because I was in pain and then I had to be in at 10AM and worked until fucking 8PM.

Hello everyone,
hope this is the right place to leave this question:
My wife saw a picture in black and white style. She likes it very much and I'm searching it since...
Perhaps you can help me out, because I can't find it. I would even buy it...

On the picture you see a woman in nice lingerie giving a nice dressed man in a suit a fellatio. The man in the picture reads his newspaper, it seems like he don't care...

Does anybody know where I can find the image? Would be much appreciated! Thank you!

147,"Edit: more information

Hey all, So I'm new to asking strangers for advice here but I'll get to the point: how should I tell my brother that he shouldn't own a dog at this time and that his dog would be better off somewhere else? I'm willing to take in the dog but I'm not sure how all of this will affect our relationship.

Their backstory: Family recently got a puppy (5 month old) 2 months ago. I live many states away from the family but I'm visiting them for Christmas. I heard about the dog that my mother and brother own so I was interested in meeting the puppy. Honestly the puppy is adorable but I did notice a few things. One they live in Orlando Florida and the dog is left outside hours at a time. Two the reason why the dog is left out is cause it pees inside. Their thought is cause that it gets excited and it's a puppy. I would disagree, the dog peed 8 times within an hour (several puddles). I think the dog has a bladder infection. I mentioned a vet was needed and they were upset to spend the money. Three, when I mentioned things for them to change in order to better raise the dog, only my brother seemed willing to put in the work, my mother thinks her ways are best and dogs will be dogs. 

My backstory: Now my wife and I have a dog and she is five years old (got her at six months). Honestly she was a terror when we got her but we love her. We went through classes and trainers to train both us and the dog but overall wouldn't change a thing, we're happy. Our dog enjoys other dogs so an addition shouldn't be an issue.

Concerns: I'm worried I like the dog too much and I'm pushing this more so to take the dog rather than having the dog elsewhere (I would be happier if the dog was simply elsewhere in a safer environment even if she weren't with my family). There is a risk in time management for my wife and I but I have a flexible schedule. It does put us strapped for time for a bit while we monitor here behavior and well-being but it's fucking worth it. There is also risk that in all of this that my dog and new dog don't get along. Not likely but possible. I have a trainer on retainer (life coach) that could help facilitate this if need be.

Tldr: need help figuring if I am in the right mindset thinking my brother can't own a dog at this time.

Let me know if I screwed up any details. It's late and I needed to get this out. Happy holidays

148,"So I haven't displayed the best signs of good mental health at home lately...I've been disengaged with my family and the other night I was having a panic attack on weed that legitimately felt like a heart attack. So I called the ambulance and it was a whole thing that essentially made my mom think I was crazy (because I wasn't actually having a heart attack). Then yesterday I said fuck it and decided I would go live out of my car since the lack of freedom my mom alllows me was getting too humiliating and going too far, but I'll admit I came back innafter a few hours. I might have been up to the challenge of homelessness but ultimately I chose a warm bed.   

I know it's going to take time, but is there anything I can do to make my mother stop worrying? Just because I'm dissatisfied with where I am in life she thinks I'm suicidal or going to do something stupid and I'm not. I'm not sure if it's even possible to make her think otherwise if I don't decide to be all social, cheery and haply-go-lucky. She's also getting the family involved despite that being a complete bullshit move because now everyone thinks I'm a basket case and I *really* don't want to deal with that. My sister already just didn't believe me when I explained how I felt ok, as if none of them have any reverence for the way I feel or the things I say; as if I can't talk about myself with any kind of authority. I need advice more than anything on how to get my whole family out of my face because none of them respect the privacy I desire and *none* of them can understand respectfully allowing me to work through these things on my own except my dad, who has been trying to help everyone to think more about the holiday.",25Dec2017,3

152,"I am constantly in need of farting and it is a pain in the ass, I go to school and I am always scared of taking any tests, because I can't sit still for a long time without having the need of farting. When I try to not fart while taking a test or attending class, my stomach kind of explodes on the inside with a loud sound. I had to come up with something to prevent all this, so I usually go to the bathroom every brake we have at school to fart inside there so it will last for one class (45 mins). Though when we have mock exams it is horrible, we are allowed to go the bathroom yes, but a teacher has to wait outside your bathroom so he can hear everything. This is so embarassing to have as a problem, it's almost making me suicidal. Is there any advice for what food I need to stay away from/eat or any other stuff?

155,"So my Dad’s cheated on my mom a couple years ago with a woman from another province. If it wasn’t for me finding out through the internet search history (which revealed google searches about STI’s and his plentyofish account), no one would’ve known and my mom could’ve been exposed to something as serious as HIV. It was a horrible month, but everything turned out to be fine and my parents are still together, despite the fact that my dad doesn’t seem very happy. I have a strong feeling that the only reason they’re still together is because of kids and money issues. Fast forward a few years later, and the same thing’s happening.

Another issue here is whenever I bring up my dad’s suspicious activity to my mom, she always says it’s because I give him too much stress and he needs an outlet for that… Now I feel like I’m the one to blame for my dad’s cheating. I have a severe anxiety disorder and I’ve been getting a lot less support from him than I used to especially since I’ve noticed his frequent outings with this new woman. What pisses me off is the fact that he wanted to let this woman borrow my expensive therapeutic oil that I bought with my own money I had been saving up for my mom’s health condition. How do I know this? I read his text messages with this woman he made a fake name for. I know this is wrong, but my dad also reads my text messages, knows the passwords to all my accounts and refuses to let me have a life without letting him know who I’m with and where I am at all times. All the messages are extremely sexual and it’s clear that he spends quite a bit of time with her, which he covers up as spending time with “coworkers” when I ask him about it. He’s been lying about where he goes for several months now. Today, I asked him if he’s seeing someone and he got mad at me and refuses to talk to me. I’m 99% sure my mom doesn’t know the full story and my dad’s not planning on telling her either since he openly lies to her about his outings too. He has been keeping it a secret since the summer What should I do? I’ve lost an insane amount of respect for my dad and I can no longer trust him.

158,"So this is going to be a long post, and I'll try my best to summarise it with a tl;dr at the bottom, but its best if you read the whole thing.

I've been dating a girl for about a year and a half to two years now, and for the past few months, I've decided that our differences, fights, and lack of chemistry is just too much for me. We live together in an apartment, and its like living with a child, she has no financial responsibility, doesn't cook or clean for herself while I'm at work, more importantly she don't work, and a lot of personal issues physical and health-wise I'm not willing to reveal online.

Anyways, I've been speaking with friends back home and family, and it's been decided that in a few days I will be breaking up with her and moving on with my life.

So here's the thing - we moved about 700 kilometers (425ish miles) from our respective hometowns, and are in a college town (as college students) in which I know nobody, have zero friends. I've arranged almost everything, including a new bachelor apartment for me, and I just need to get her to sign off on a paper taking me off our current lease.

So here's where I need advice:

I don't know how to proceed after the breakup. She's currently all I have socially, I live in a town where I know nobody and simply moved there to go to school. I currently plan to try to get my life in order by going to the gym to work off some excess weight, and focusing on bettering my grades at school, but I feel like mentally I'm not gonna be able to take it.

1) What is the best way to at least keep my social level up, or to make friends in a situation like this?

2) Is tinder a decent recommendation from anyone to actually put myself out there when I'm ready to try dating again?

3) If my girlfriend doesn't sign the addendum to take me off the lease, what are my options legally? Or am I, pardon my language, fucked?

If anyone has been in a situation like this before, I'd be willing to listen to what you did to make it work.

tl;dr:

I cannot even get close to my family, the father, the mother and siblings simply because (and **ridiculous** enough) I have not experienced a romantic partner in a long long while. 

I am distant or grow myself distant, simply because of that fact. I am not complete, I do not feel complete, I have not experienced this year ""complete"" simply because I needed to keep my stomach fed and bills to have a roof under my head maintained and paid. Work definitely took most of my time. 

I am distant with family because each family member has had someone to bond and share time with. They know or have people who are not a family member... I need to experience this but I do not know why I use this reason to keep myself distant. Perhaps because I think it is gross? Being that single, bachelor, loner family member in every gathering? I feel like that finding a partner or growing a bigger social circle is a priority in the next year, and this is *after struggling* to find a stable job to feed and keep a roof under me. The self-wants more, and frustratingly enough for something simpler, like someone to know and get known outside of the family. **But why is this case?**

I think I would rate this year as a decent one when it comes to mileage, but I feel as if I fell short when it comes to accomplishments. I tried to find better work, tried even harder to save and pay bills. But my accomplishments (primarily personal) feels lacking.

I am a life long social introvert, don't really express myself that well at times, have an education, but I consider myself quite handsome and don't really have confidence issue, and I have been in multiple relationships. We went on a few dates, in which I thought went well but nothing ever came out of them. There was really no spark or much chemistry between us during those outings, but I asked her out for a 3rd get together anyways for dessert, in which she agreed but never followed up with a time that was good for her.


After our dates, she didn't follow up what so ever (like she never mentioned them at work about how it was fun, doesn't text or call me). So it's quite obvious that she is not interested. We would just awkwardly work together. I think she tries to dodge my attempts to converse with her, which is understandable. And lately she doesn't even respond to my texts. 


I did make some mistakes playing the ""game"". Made myself to eager and a little bit too invested. I've accepted this, and I want to move on. Problem is, we work together in the same department and we have the same group of friends at work, who also enjoy going out to eat together. Sometimes, during lunch hours, I would sit away from the table she's at to spare her and myself some of the awkwardness. But I don't want to have to do that. I want to enjoy time at work with my friends! 


Too make matters worse, I actually apologized to her the other day for coming off too strong. I have a lot of experience dating while she has none. I thought I was being too forward and maybe made her feel uncomfortable. However, she said I wasn't coming off too strong. And proceeds to say that if anything ""she is just an awkward person"". Needless to say, that conversation at the end of the work day was really uncomfortable for both sides.


So how do I fix this? I just want things to go back to normal, like before she knew I was interested. I want to be able to work around her and my friends without this lingering awkwardness. HELP!

He says I need to grow up and just fake being nice to her again (as I always have) when I don’t believe that’s fair whatsoever.

191,"Hello,

I have a tendency to overthink almost everything in my life - which often helps, as I am able to improve myself rapidly and become the person I want to be. But masturbation, and the information available online about it, is causing a lot of grief inside my head.

I'm 23, engaged to the love of my life, and we have a healthy sex life. We both have a strong libido years into our relationship, and there are no complaints about that. I rarely masturbate while we're together - often times I'd masturbate less than once a week in the shower, as my mind would drift to us and I'd get horny. I believe this is a completely healthy behaviour.

However, when we're apart, for example, visiting separate families halfway across the world for 2 weeks over the holidays, I get extremely horny. I miss intercourse, and am horny much more often, being unable to release it in a healthy sexual relationship. I start looking at the porn I used to watch when I was younger, and masturbate to orgasm. I do this about once a day during the holidays, and when I return, I keep the habit up for a little longer, masturbating about 4 times a week for a week or two once we're back together, even though I'm back to being sexually active. At the same time, once I'm back, I often think about sex more often during my everyday activities, and it can sometimes detract from personal work as my mind is preoccupied.

So here's where my mind just can't make itself up, on one hand, it believes that this is a habit and I need to break it, stop watching pornography, and perhaps stop masturbating, to ensure I don't continue the habit when I return from vacation. I often feel like I've just wasted time satisfying an urge, and think about how I need to stop. I have projects I like to work on during my free time, and sometimes get horny and spend time watching pornography and masturbating instead.

But on the other hand, this is just all on over reaction. If I would masturbate more regularly, perhaps twice or thrice a week throughout the year, I would never have to increase my masturbation while I'm away from my relationship. I can moderate my activity fairly well, it will get sex off my mind instead of having it consume me. Again, maybe this is all just an over reaction.

And then again, maybe saying it's all an over reaction is just a defence mechanism and my body truly is addicted and I do need to stop?

But then, maybe that's just hurting me even more by continually making me worried about whether my masturbation habits are healthy or not, rather than just deciding one way or another, and sticking to it knowing i've made the right choice.

But then again...

I get no where with this topic.

Any advice?",25Dec2017,3

Where do I go and what do I do?

Long version: So I moved in with a friend in Atlanta (im from Jersey) about 3 months ago with the intent of renting my own studio/apartment by about February, saving up money over a year or two, while working on some skills/hobbies and then going back to school. I put the details on the backburner since im extremely indecisive.

The last 2 months has in a way, pushed me toward making a quick decision. My father suddenly passed away two months ago. And after its all said and done I was left with a mass of apathy and a hole in my family, that might be worse since im not around. The last couple months were kind of a blur.

A couple days ago I kind of ""woke up"" and am starting to think of my situation more. I was left with enough money to at least start going to university without having to deal with loans and I have nothing tying me down, unless I decide to.

So the basic question I have right now is two main parts. 

First, should I decide to move back home? Itll be much cheaper in terms of living expenses and I can be closer to my family to help since some of them are still in a really bad place in terms of coping. But ill lose a lot of my freedom and might have trouble finding a new temporary job that pays as well as my current one.

And second, what should I do in regards to my education? Wherever I choose to go to school location-wise, whether its at home or away,  ill pretty much have to stay in that area for at least 2 years. Also in terms of a major, I love the areas of biology and writing, but i'm also aware that it's pretty rough for both in terms of work competition. Is there a viable alternative these majors?

If you need any more details feel free to ask, and thank you for reading this small wall of text.",25Dec2017,2

251,"My wife’s mother has been in and out of her life since her senior year of high school. Long story short, her mom cheated on her dad they got divorced and ever since her mom has become a cold and unaffectionate asshole. This all happened in 2003. 

Before the cheating and eventual divorce everyone says she was a great and doting mother including her ex-husband. 

Currently, her mother has a live in boyfriend with a preteen daughter and takes after several other younger children that she is of no blood relation to. She is loving and caring to these children, yet has nothing to do with her grown adult daughter. Is it a control issue? She has no power over my wife now that she is grown and has no need for her. Why does she show affection to strangers but not her own child? It has taken years for my wife to come to grips with her mother’s ways but it gets under my skin that she has alienated her own child.  How do I get the same place as my wife? We also just had our first child and her mother wants to see him. I am very uneasy of her unpredictable involvement in his life. Will she throw her relationship with him out the window when he is older?

256,"First off, I admit, for the longest I was a bitch and I bullied a guy for maybe 5 years. Well he went to the same college as me and to be honest it urked me, so I was even more rough that the past few years. And for some reason I guess enough people noticed to set me up...

So this hot guy has been talking to me and I never put two and two together, but he was occasionally around the fat guy I was bullying a lot. They were really cousins. But the hot guy has been flirting with me for a while and hinted he wanted to have a house date this Christmas. I expected making out and ect, not sex at all for reasons I will mention soon. But basically to become official.

Well. When I got there and went to his room or a room. The door was closed and that fat guy was there. I tried to run but he grabbed my hair and threw me to the ground then held me face down. He then told me how much he hates me and how I made him want to kill himself and how he wants to make me feel the pain he felt. I immediately told him I was calling the cops on his fatass. Then he just lost it. He repeated fatass like 5 times then started pulling off my clothes... I tried to fight back then he just socked me in the face. And continued till he took off my panties and stopped. 

&gt; Now the thing is most bullies have an insecurity which is why they bully other people. Mine... my vagina has a very bad odor. I already use Vagisil which helps... but it's still bad. This is also why I was a virgin and didn't want to have sex because of it.

What mentally destroyed me was he simply said, ""You stink."" And it's I completely felt defeated at that point. I was almost willing to beg him not to mention this to anyone. But all I could do is stutter until he decided to put his dick in anyway... Now I was physically destroyed because he took my virginity, this ugly fat lame that I've despised for years. And I was yelling and begging he stopped. He went on until he came inside of me from behind and told me, he hopes I have his child.

Tears in my eyes, I just mumbled that he was a psychopath. He swore I insulted him so he flipped me over to face him and went for round 2, ending again inside me only this time he stayed there. He actually started peeing inside me... then he just left me there crying saying no one will ever want to be inside me again.

After that he snapped a few pics threatened to put them on the school facebook group chat if I didn't agree to do what he want from now on. I just kept crying to myself and he actually sent it. Then he went and turned himself in to the police.

Now my life is over... I'm not going back to college next semester and I'm probably never leaving my room either. Every possible thing I can do is now over... Him peeing inside me has made it smell completely awful now. I feel like I deserved this so I can't help but feel just as suicidal. And worse I don't feel like I'll ever be married... this feels like the end. As if I have nothing now... So I made this simply to see if there was anything left. What is there for me? Why should I go on in life now... I feel like if I made him feel this way I should just end myself to be honest... ",25Dec2017,8
257,"So, as the title implies, one of my family members has access to Facebook account of my younger brother, who was killed 2 years ago. This person is accessing the account against the wishes of all other family members. They are reading private messages and even sometimes forget they are logged into the account, and ""Like"" posts, which is quite disturbing to many.  They changed the account settings to make themselves (their own Facebook account) the ""Legacy"" user to the account, meaning they control the accounts encryption and line of communication to Facebook staff.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? If so, your advice would be very helpful.

258,"A little context: my mother and father are the worst two people for each other. My father constantly verbally abuses my mother, and my mother is an overly religious type that cannot handle the duress he puts her under. She drinks and constantly screams/yells when things go sour. I see why she gets upset, but the way she acts when she is upset pushes me away farther from her. Lastly, she has some minor health issues and cannot really handle being independent. As for my father, I’ve been “playing nice” because I don’t have money to go to college so I’ve basically sucked this up my entire life hoping they’d change. I am a wreck myself and feel depressed around them. I moved out about a year ago, but I cannot financially handle it. So now I am needing to move back in with them, which is depressing me greatly. The plan is to last out the two years left of college and then leave. The questions is: am I wrong for wanting to leave them? Just straight up disappear? I love them both, but I want nothing to do with them anymore. It crushes me to feel this way, but I feel my mental health is being hindered by being around them.",25Dec2017,2
262,"Hi Reddit, I could really do with some advice.

For the past seven years, I've been working in academia at undergraduate, master, and PhD levels. The subject is not important, but two things that relate to this are: 1) my supervisor has been an ass. Like, serious abusive relationship levels of bad. 2) beyond full time management in retail and lecturing within my department, my worklife is limited. I have travelled a lot (praise be to winning grants and free time) but that doesn't really count.

So it gets to my last few years of study and I'm seriously burnt out. Stressed, depressed, and generally not in a good way. I start to consider leaving my PhD, and have already decided that, as a career, academia is not for me. Eventually, I stumble onto into the Army. The notion of radical change seems really good, and I jump at it, pass selection, and have a slot to begin officer training in January.

I look forward to this, persevere, write, and finish my PhD. I look forward to a new direction, go over my work, and pass my viva as of a few weeks back. But then I start getting this funny feeling, as if I'm making a bad choice. As if I'm throwing away things that are important to me (most of all, moving away from my girlfriend of five years, and I see her as one of the biggest things in my life) and it suddenly seems incredibly selfish. Things don't make as much sense as they did while I was writing my PhD, and now I feel unsure and lost. I don't really have time to do my corrections from the viva, and will be working on them over the breaks I have from the .mil. But, I'm also not wanting to delay my start as I feel I'm already seriously on the back foot in terms of... well, life. Things seemed a lot easier a few months back, which is not how I expected to feel given how horrible an experience undertaking the PhD was.

I suppose I'm trying to leave this deliberately vague and impartial, so as not to poison it too heavily with my own muddled point of view. But, any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope it is clear enough to give input, at least.",25Dec2017,8
