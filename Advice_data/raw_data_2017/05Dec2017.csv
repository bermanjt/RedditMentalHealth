2,So most people would say I like to be with people and I would agree. I feel kind of empty and useless if I'm not in a group. I think it's harming some relationships because I come off as attention seeking and won't leave them alone. Is there a way to  move past that?,05Dec2017,2
3,"I'm seeking advice on whether or not I should let a work colleague move in with my husband and I. Rentals in our town are so expensive and few that people are currently on wait list. Also my husband and I rent a 3 bedroom house with 2 spare bedrooms. 

 

I've already discussed it with my husband and at first he was unsure, however he doesn't mind and likes the idea of having some help us with the rent &amp; utility bills and he also reckons it will be good company for me. As my husband works late most nights.

 

I however am unsure. I'm conflicted as I've somehow got it in my head that married couples don't house share. We're not desperate for a house mate, as we can afford to pay all our bills.

I've looked at the positives which include that we have money coming into to pay some rent and bills. There will be someone there to look after place if my husband and I go away.

 

However the negatives are, my husband and I won't be able to walk around naked like we sometimes usually do. Also won't be able to go to the bathroom with the door open. And sex won't be able to be as loud as it usually is.

 

However if he was to move in, would there be some kind of ground rules? What's the best way for these sort of things to work?",05Dec2017,2
4,"I feel like I jinxed myself. Now I'm at a loss because he is the most unhappy dude ever. He's a 50-60 year old white guy (I'm a 22 year old African American) who is always grumpy and yelling. My friends keep telling me to get him a dildo, but I figure someone this unhappy deserves a good gift even if he is kinda shitty.


I have no idea what he likes other than his kids and yelling at people. I tried to compliment him on his shoes once and he told me he ""fucking hated"" them. Awesome. I would ask around but it'd be too obvious, and I've given you guys literally all I know about him so we're all in the same info boat.

5,"I may sound like a horrible person because deportation would be cruel. However, I fucking hate this woman. For 20 fucking years, I have had to deal with her bullshit and mistreatment of my family especially my mom (her sister). So she has been in the states for about 18+ years and it has never occurred to her to apply for citizenship until now. Well, my mom is the only one with citizenship out of her 8 siblings. So she asked my mom to sponsor her. Funny, she is nice right now but just 1-2 weeks ago she would not answer my mom's texts and calls. She yelled at my mom because my mom asked for help paying for my grandmas plane ticket to the US. My mom managed to get her a green card (only wants to visit) because she has not seen my aunts in 18+ years since they've been here. She didn't want to help foot any of the bills just like she ended up making my mom foot the bill for my grandpa's electric wheelchair. She doesn't want to pay for that she would rather spend money on alcohol, parties, live mariachi to play at her parties, and concerts (all of which she never invites my mom to unless she wants her to help pay for the food). So she ignored my mom so my mom was going to apologize to her like a puppy.  She always does this she would not invite my mom to dinners or events like birthdays and exclude her because my mom ""doesn't drink"" is ""too goody good"" since my mom does not like to get drunk and act a fool and drive drunk home at like 4am.However, as soon as she wants something she leeches onto my mom until she gets what she wants. Needs signature for a car? Calls my mom. Needs social security to work? Calls my mom. She even stole my mom's social security at some point without her permission. My mom found out she was shoplifting and confronted her because she would be held accountable because that is technically her identity and it would fall on her record. After she was caught shoplifting she got angry that my mom stopped letting her use her SSN. So she had my grandpa and the rest of the family yell at her and call her selfish. Even though my parents let her live rent free with my uncle and my cousins in my house for years to help them get on their feet. Treats me like shit too. Every time she sees me she makes fun of me calling me skinny, anorexic (I'm not), and ugly. She thinks its funny to pull my hair too. Hence why I try to avoid going to her house and avoid her like the plague. I don't think I will deport her since my mom would end up paying to get her back and I do not want to harm her in the process. But I have been fantasizing about it for years. Sure her husband is cool but her kids are following in her exact footsteps.  She is finally trying to get her paperwork together and is now always at my parent's house trying to get them to help her. Today, she would not leave until she got their taxes (they are going to sponsor her).  Than got I have their taxes (I needed to fill out my FAFSA) and I am a few hours away at college. My dad was going to pick them up tonight but I am at the library ""studying"". So he will have to pick it up tomorrow. She got upset he was not going to go tonight and was going to drive up here herself. I would've loved that. I am thinking of ways to sabotage the taxes (i.e remove necessary paperwork) to slow down the process and give her hell. Any ideas? What would you guys do? Am I justified to be this pissed?",05Dec2017,2
6,"Hi, I have a father who doesn't support me in becoming an entrepreneur. I have explained to him that I don't want to borrow loan to go to college because it made more sense for me to learn from a good successful CEO friend of mine while working a job, building up my business and stay on the positive note-financially wise.

I have explained that business will take time just like how it takes 4-6 years to get a Degree. But he still don't support my decision and wants me to borrow loan and go to college because he ""thinks"" that's the way to go since everyone is doing it and that is his proof. I give him proof of my multi-millionaire business friend but his ears are shut off. 

Every day he does what it takes to say negative things about me in front of me and friends. When friends that have the same mindset as me speaks for me, he backs out.

7,"This guy, Chris, is a frosh and has a one sided friendship with me, where he thinks we're friends, i'm not. The dude is a nice kid but annoying at times. We're on the same team, he's struggled to make friends, but he just doesn't know when he's not wanted. So he'll tag along with me and the people i talk to at times.

Yesterday after our game, i invited my friends Jake and Tony to my place after we passed for food, Chris tagged along even though i only invited Jake and Tony. We tried ditching Chris multiple times or to get the hint, but his dorm was on the way to my place so he tagged along. I gave my friends refreshments, Chris had one for the first time but took forever to finish it (i offered him soda, but he wanted to try it), pretended to be wasted, and was rude to whoever he talked to on the phone. He took an hour to finish it, when we were just trying to get him out of my apartment.

Like i get he wants friends, but he clearly doesn't know boundaries, but none of us have the stones to tell him. Tony has a class with Chris, and told me Chris sat next to him and took Tony's friend's seat.

I think he assumes we're inviting him to our team next semester. If he were a better player i would make the case to invite him, but he's frustrating to play with, so much so that i've lost patience with trying to help him. We keep hinting that he's not welcome, none of us want to tell him because he's a kid and has no friends.

Is it better to ignore/ghost him or should i tell him straight up he isn't welcome and needs to actually talk to other people to make friends?",05Dec2017,2

9,"So the tl:dr of my issue is that I was diagnosed with dysthymia a while ago, my best friend of 6 years that I’ve always told everything to and spent almost every day with was the one who drove me to see a doctor about seeing if I had depression, fast forward 6 months and she has said that she can’t take the negativity and toxicity anymore and doesn’t want to be around me.

Now for some more details. She told me this three days ago and since then I’ve spoken to her a few times trying to repair the friendship but I seem to have only pushed her away more. I don’t know if she’s doing this because she’s completely fed up with me and doesn’t want to be close anymore, or whether she’s doing this all to help me get better and be a happier person.

I’ve made an appointment with a doctor to get a referral for a psych and to see if I need meds for coping with the feelings I live with daily, I’ve also put in plans to take up sport again in hopes that I’ll find a sense of purpose in my life again.

Mainly I’m asking for advice on how to approach this situation. She seems really upset and over me. I know I have to focus on bettering myself right now, but I can’t seem to get the thought of losing such an important friendship out of my head. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated",05Dec2017,2

Questioning why I have this much feelings for her and why I still have them seems to make me like her more, even though we rarely see each other and even more rarely speak.

I shouldn’t have feelings like this for someone at this age, nothing good will ever come out of them, it will only weaken me, especially since that person didn’t want to date me.

She just wants to have fun, as do everyone in college I should be like that too but conditions made me turn out different.",05Dec2017,2

18,"Hi r/advice

I recently posted on this subreddit about my situation. Long story short, I was found violating school conduct (laundry room theft) and am now put on disciplinary probation. Because of this, I had to resign from a campus position that I'd worked for the last 2 years. The timing of this situation is bad. I recently got a really awesome job offer that does background check.

I checked with my school and they said my disciplinary record cannot be shared with people outside the university without my consent. I checked with the school police and they said I have no criminal record (no arrest, no conviction) and companies only look for county police record. I talked to my ex-supervisor and we are on really good terms (he invited to grab coffee sometimes before this semester ends).

Rationally, I have nothing to be worried about. But I constantly have this intrusive thoughts about having my offer rescinded and then I will lose everything. I have constant anxiety and my mind is never at ease. I also miss my job and the people I used to work with. I miss living on campus as well.

Any advice on how to overcome this difficult time?",05Dec2017,2

Anyways, the dude was a hell of a champ and apparently took care of it before i even woke up. I feel terrible because no one should have to deal with that, and i wish he would have woken me up so i could take care of it so that it was like it i didnt even happen but he said he didnt want to wake me up.

21,"(Context) So I don't have many friends, especially other guys, and I'm not super close with any of them.  One of my friends, who is a girl, DESPISES Owen, my only close-ish friend.  I only learned this recently, when she told me to my face that she hated him for being ""different"" and ""annoying"". (Apparently, She didn't know I was close with Owen at the time.)  She went on to essentially say that when he tries to make friends, it pisses her off.
I understand that not everyone gets along, and that's perfectly fine, I'm not going around saying you have to like all of my friends.
What really made me mad is that she constantly defends someone who has bullied me for the past 6 years, and refuses to even listen to my side of that story, saying he's a really nice guys and all that. (to clarify, the bullying is never physical, but he goes out of his way to ostracise me from the community, and since I go to a small school it's really effective)

So basically she hates Owen for being different than other people, which I can relate to and that really hurt me as well.  It was also really hypocritical of her to say all these things after defending a such a jerk.

Now she's freaking out because someone told her I was mad and I have no frickin clue what I should do.  
On one hand I don't want to end my friendship with this person but on the other hand I should defend Owen and I am pretty mad at her for what she said.",05Dec2017,2
22,"I (15m) have a really close friend that's 15 (Female, we'll call her Ashley) and she had a family friend's son (17, we'll call him jim) over the summer which used to come over to her beach house (while she was alone) 


Now she told me that first it started out as just a summer relationship that they would drop when the summer was over. However, Ashley was really naive and when Jim said he was ""in love"" with her she believed it. She explained to me that slowly Jim started getting more and more sexual and that the first time it got really significant was her first story, here is how it goes. ""Around mid July I was on the couch eating a candy bar in the morning still in pajamas, she was watching TV when Jim sat on the couch with her. He slowly started trying to make moves like putting his arm around her or kissing her or simple things where it wasn't out of the normal/she was ok with, but then all of a sudden he put his arm up my shirt and I said no. He stopped at first, but after a couple minutes he tried again, and again, and again, and after many times I couldn't stop him anymore. and I stayed silent. Nothing more besides 'small' things happened that day."" 


Now in between the first story and the second story more things have happened but she doesn't think they're significant so the second story goes like this, ""we were just chilling on my bed, just hanging out not kissing, not doing anything and all of a sudden he started reaching down my pants even though I kept saying stop then got up whipped out his dick, and I just kept saying I don't want to see that and please stop, and he took a step closer and I just pushed him away and he stopped.""


This fucking psychopath won't stop emotionally abusing her besides the sexual harassment, every other day he's either saying he loves her and that they're friends, but some day's I swear he act's so weird. She made me listen to her talking to him after he called and he had the most monotonous voice saying hey and nothing else, and she has to say whats up and he'll usually responding playing a game. Then it will be quiet for a solid 30 seconds. It's so creepy. He says he's like this because he hasn't had a girlfriend before She's had enough but she's scared. He has a car and knows her address, but doesn't want to tell her mom. 


I feel like I need to do something. I can't just drop it. She's acting like it doesn't matter that it even happened. She keeps saying she got over it, but most of the time I see her crying/really upset because of him. what can I do without her mom/parents knowing and if I can't do anything, do I tell her parents.",05Dec2017,5

29,"I need help and some advice. It's funny because I know what I need to do but I just can't bring myself to do it. I don't know if this is called procrastination well yea maybe it is but there are so many things I want to do but I'm so fucking scared that the fear or procrastination just stops me in my tracks. 

I have movie ideas but I won't fucking write a script. I just can't bring myself to do it. I have read so much that getting a script picked up is almost impossible so I guess that just adds to the fear and I don't do it. I have a title page from 2015. It's going to be 3 years and I have not written shit. 

It's just not even the screenplay its whenever I get an idea I get this fear of failing that I self-sabotage myself. How do I get out of my own head? Fear of failing is funny because you are scared of failing so you don't do anything thus you just failed. The thing you are scared of is what you are working for. It's insane thinking but I am in this trap and I can't seem to get out.

What do you do when your #1 enemy or the person that is standing in the way of what you want to do is you? I know what I need to do. I know how to do it, I just can seem to actually do it. So now my new shit is reading on ""productivity and procrastination"" which I just read was another form of procrastination. The ""study or research"" phase that just never ends and you end but doing nothing.

31,"My mom has always been abusive. She gets into these moods where she won’t do anything and sits on the couch watching shows all day (she’s a housewife) She used to love having power over my sister and I. She used to give away dogs to punish us, smack the sh*t out of us for extremely simple things. One time she promised my friend and I that she would take us swimming when I was 7, she then fell asleep and since I was so excited to go swimming I tried to calmly wake her up...she woke up angry and pinned me to the ground smacking me as I was squirming and crying. This was just one example I can count 30+ similar encounters. Apart from all this which happened 5 years ago, she’s been nice to me and has been a good mom. But the past few months she has completely gone back to her old savage ways. 

Today my sister and I got into a fight which was instigated by my sister, who knew I had stuff after school yet made every excuse to stall from getting home to punish me. I got mad and called her the B word, she told my mom, and when I got home that’s when it began. She legit would stop and go on her phone to text her friends, go back inside the school, and do anything she could to be an a*s.

I enter the house with my mom right there, no questions asked she immediately starts slapping me while yelling at me. I try to explain my case but my mom results to more yelling and smacking and screaming shut up every time I try to even talk. Now her abuse doesn’t hurt as much as it used to unless she slaps my face. After yelling at me for 15 minutes, talking about how I will have no Christmas, and threatening everything I have (xbox, money, etc) I decide I’m done with it and put my earbuds in. My mom runs over to me, rips my earbuds out, and slaps me 3 times extremely violently in the face...This is when I lose it, I grab her biceps and start power housing her backwards to show my power while yelling about how I’m so done with her shit and what happened today wasn’t my fault. She storms off with my earbuds and hides them elsewhere. Keep in mind this was self defense and I never hit my mom (and probably never would) but instead simply pushed her back after she violently face slapped me 3 times in a row.

I have no idea why she has been so mad and there has been built up tension, she’s been treating my sister extremely nice. My father is being treated just as bad by her. She tries to bully us and do anything she can to get a reaction. The reason she yanked my earbuds out and decided to get physical was simply because I stopped giving her a reaction to her petty threats. Me calling my sister the B word and my mom punishing me as bad as she did was not because of the fact I called her a B word, but simply because my mom has been extremely grumpy and angry with me lately and she wanted a reason to punish me. 

Yesterday night she went into my dads room and ripped his fan out of the wall, slamming the door shut, and sleeping on the couch. She purposely woke him up and she knows he has trouble falling asleep without a fan so she took it. The reason for this is because earlier that day she mad a big deal about herself ordering the wrong thing, and after arguing with the manger and whatnot, my dad stepped in saying she was embarrassing him making a big deal over nothing. Yes she will literally make a mistake then try to punish others out of...embarrassment? I really have no clue why she does this.

A few things to note: 
-I suspect she has a mental disorder since she gets into moods and shifts mood extremely quick.

-she has been sent to jail in the past for destroying my dads old fan with a hammer

-my left ear and that general side was extremely red from the slaps

-no marks were on her arms

-she has always been like this and I’m just older and stronger so I can actually deal with it, ever since I was about 5 she has always been very physical

-she picks between my sister and I and is very nice to one of us and sh*ts on the other, weird.

-I need help I have no idea how to handle the physical and mental abuse, I’m about over weight and my mom always shames me despite me going to the gym and eating healthy. She always only looks at anything bad I do.

32,"So I am 14 and I want to keep my computer in my room, my mom is fine with it but my dad refuses. He is the type of parent that says no to everything and will often persist past the point of logic. I want to keep my computer in my bedroom for several reasons, I would do better in school since all of my work is on my computer and I often put things off because I really really don't want to go downstairs around my family, then I end up doing poorly. Also, the rest of the house is disgusting. My bedroom is the only clean place in the entire house. There is really nothing I can do to change this, long story, just trust me on this one. I would also be able to make money. I get money from testing websites, but the problem is that I do it over a microphone and if there is a ton of background noise they refuse to pay you. My family is constantly making noise and there is nothing I can do to stop that. It is much quieter in my bedroom so there wouldn't be a ton of background noise. Finally, I just don't want to be around my family. They are toxic in a lot of ways and being around them just makes me get really anxious and I can't focus on my schoolwork. I can't leave the house, so staying in my room is my best shot. 

However, my dad refuses for two main reasons that I know of, he says it is a bad precedent to set because then my brothers will expect the same and start watching porn in their room. This point is invalid. They allow me to have my phone in my bedroom and you can do the same thing from your phone, so it won't prevent anything except them playing video games and doing schoolwork. However, if I say that he will probably just take away my phone. His second point seems to be, it would make me happy and I'm asking for it, so I can't do it. I am completely aware of how bratty and exaggerated this sounds, but he legitimately does this. It is just an unspoken rule in our house. Even my mom has admitted he does this constantly. He had a lot of mental and emotional issues and really should see a therapist, but he refuses and even if somehow he was forced to he wouldn't really cooperate so it wouldn't work. He had dozens of weird toxic tendencies, I could go on forever. 

Is there any possible way I could convince him to let me have my computer in my room?  I understand that there are bigger issues here, but I have thought long and hard about it, talked to people about it, etc. and there isn't a whole lot I can do. I think at the moment getting my computer in my bedroom is the best thing I can do because it will make it so I get better grades and can start saving money so I can get out of my parent's house when I turn 18.

They were sexually active, and during the latest encounter, he apparently held her for too long when she wanted to change positions, by her account. She was on top at the time.

I trust my friend, but I see that if he is lying, he is only trying to cover himself up. This is involving a sexual matter, meaning the only witnesses were the accuser and the accused, so the truth is unpredictable. I am closer friends with him than they are, so I wanted to ask questions to determine who was telling the truth. When I asked them, they automatically assumed I was siding with ""a rapist"" and kicked me out of the friend group, but not after calling me stupid and close minded.

So, I shall attempt to sum this up as quickly as possible. 
Basically, I have this ex. Everyone hated her. They say that when I was with her, it was the lowest point of my life, and I understand why.
She was an addict who guilted me into dating her. But, me, being the non-denying soul I am, gave in, and dated her- eventually growing somewhat attached to her. She ended up breaking up with me to be with her druggie ex. I left it behind quickly enough and decided to try and move on.
Cut to a week ago, I get a message from this ex. She is telling me she is so sorry for hurting me and that she is safe. She then goes on to say that after we broke up she got involved with a drug gang, got addicted to coke, ran away from home, got put in jail, got put in rehab and is now 70 days clean.
I, avoiding empathy for her as I have seen her manipulate me before, stay pretty silent. She then tells me that breaking up with me was one of the worst mistakes she has made. She begins sending cutesy videos from when we were together, trying to make me miss old times.
Then, I think it is over.
But, oh.
How wrong I was.
She messages me a few days later and I mention I was high (it's just weed). Since I had never smoked when we were together and was clean of all substances, she was intrigued and proposed that we ""smoke and chill, bruh."" 
She then goes on to say she regrets that we never had sex during our relationship. I tell her that is mostly attributed to the fact she never got tested- she was constantly having sex before she met me and very well could have had something. 
She keeps pursuing this idea of us fucking and I lay it on strong, saying that I only want sex if I love the person unless I hate fuck her and that isn't fair to either of us.
She then goes on to says she wants me and that I am super hot. She says she has changed and she continues to claim she just wants to ""chill... maybe more."" 
I told her everything I had kept inside, all the pent up anger was released... And she took it like a champ. She apologized and said she just wanted a chance to treat me right.
Now, before my questions, know that I am extremely lonely at the moment. Like- pathetic lonely. I have been so desperate for a connection.
So, when a girl that has the same sexual desires I do comes along super willing, I am not going to lie, I hesitate to say no.
I am a virgin lesbian into BDSM. These chances don't come often.
Do I take it? Do I have sex with her? Would a hookup be all that bad?
I am worried I would catch feelings, but, I don't know if it is totally not worth it or not. 
I know I deserve better, I know. But she is tested, she is willing, and I have the ability to practice skills for when I find the love of my life.

My sister has always made birthdays and holidays very difficult. 

My bday, my moms bday, Christmas Eve/day are all back to back, and my father is pressuring us to have her over for Christmas. He does not talk to her either (nor does she talk to us) but would like to invite her to the holidays. Additionally she left her dog with us at our urging after we called her out for allowing him to get extremely skinny and for her overall not taking care of him (no baths, vet visits, etc) and she now wants him back. We fear if she comes over and sees him she will take him back. 

We do not want this and have threatened to leave the house if she comes over. If we do this, there will be a big blow out fight and my dad will be an absolute asshole for MONTHS.

54,"Hi Reddit, I'm at a point with my life where I just don't know why I'm here on this planet.

I feel like there are people who are in way worse situations then mine and I should be blessed with what I have, but I just don't know what's wrong with me.

Before I start this I'm sorry if this shit is unorganized I'm just all over my feelings right now

For some background info I'm on my first year of college (I'm doing 2 years in community college and I'm transferring to a university). I'm living in an apartment with a good friend of mine, we've been going to the gym on and off since we've gotten here. And my mom who was cheated on remarried to someone else and moved to another state with him. I really appreciate what this man has done for my mom, but I've never been too fond of him (he seems to try to take the position of being my new dad, which in all honesty makes me feel hella uncomfortable). The last time I talked to my dad was in august (I've gone 2 years without talking to him before also, started talking to him before graduation because he seemed to start changing) but it ended up with me cursing him out because he was lying to me about helping out to pay the rent for my apartment.  I barely graduated highschool, I feel like I lost so many friends throughout it because I just started becoming extremely quiet  and antisocial.. I wasted over 3 years trying to get with a girl who was playing with me. Meanwhile my brother pretty much got a full ride to mit.  I just feel like I'm a huge failure to myself and everyone around me 

During the time of the divorce my mom's relationship and mine got really sour, we'd start arguing with each other to the point of both of us screaming at the top of our lungs, I feel like even though her new husband helped out our family a lot , it made my relationship with my mom even worse because she doesn't understand that I don't have much feelings for him, and she tries to force me to do shit with him. Obviously this hasn't happened since I left for college, but it happened when I came to visit once, and i feel like it's  definitely going to happen when I come for Christmas break. I thought going away for college would make my relationship with my mom better, but 95% of the time I'm on the phone with her it ends up becoming a huge argument. And she starts putting me down (asking why I havent gotten a job yet, calling me lazy etc)

Ever since I started highschool and the news broke out about my dad cheating, I started failing classes and school was just not the thing for me, I'd start out strong, but end up failing. I'd get distracted by going out with the few friends I had or playing video games. Now that college started I started off very strong (straight A's) but out of no where I lost all my motivation and I'm failing one class right now (no clue if I'll be able to pass it and no idea what to do about that) and the rest of my classes I have C's in.  I'm really sick of myself acting up in this way and i have no way how to stay motivated. 

And also I thought maybe I'd make new friends in college, but it's turned out that I've only had short conversations with a few people over class work, and I haven't made any.. meanwhile my roommate is always going out partying and hanging out with his friends. I feel like I'm such a loser and I just wish I could make some friends but idk anymore.

And just now I just exploded for the first time in a while, so I called my mom because I'm feeling really sick and I got a final tomorrow, I ask her if I go to the doctors tomorrow because I feel sick, what should I do at the front desk? And she tells me you can't walk into a doctors office, I guess she misunderstood me because my roommate told me that you can do a walk in with urgent care. And she kept telling me you can't do walk ins, and she started talking bad about me saying I can't even take pills (which is true but there's other ways to take medication, and I don't even know why she brought that up) and I started getting annoyed so I just hung up, and I started yelling out loud about all My conversations turning into arguments with my mom.  

I just really don't know why it feels like all the shit that happens to my life that starts off positive, turns to shit. I don't know what to do anymore, I rarely ever get suicidal thoughts but it's times like these where I just think to myself, why did I get put on this planet.

Sorry for the long and confusing post, thanks for reading..

56,"Trying to make this as short as possible on Wednesday one of my friends who I thought I was close with told us his girlfriend was pregnant. Since we are all away for school this happened on the phone, The next night I went out without one of my friends who goes to the same school as me and naturally we talked about the announcement. 

During this conversation he talked about how the friend had mentioned them getting married and ask him to be the best man. Since I was never told about the wedding I was confused, apparently they already know it'll be over the summer and he told everyone else in group. Some of them are even groomsmen

59,"(Bit of a read sorry, hopefully it’s engaging)

Ok so I’m a M 17 from Australia who just got back from a week long end of school celebration called Schoolies. The week is a crazy time pretty much the Australian equivalent of Spring Break. 

Anyway my story begins at the airport once I’ve landed back in my home state after the week. Now i’ll try to keep it short but it roughly went like this... 

Parents couldn’t pick me up from the Airport so had to catch the train home. I walk to the train station and whilst walking there catch the eye of a random girl, who I assumed was arriving back home too from the same schoolies week. We both look at each other then look away and proceed to head to our various platforms. Sure enough we go to the same platform and hop on the same train. We sit opposite each other and I can’t help but take sly glances at her every now and then (I thought she was pretty damn cute). Anyway the train slowly (very slowly) starts to gain more passengers so I had to give up  my seat for some elder people and end up moving to another carriage.

Oh I should also add that the trains that night were running 40min behind schedule as there was major congestion on the tracks and this was kinda my first time making my way home from the city at night by myself. 

Ok so anyway Im in this different carriage now and the train comes to its end and everyone has to get off, I try get to the doors as quick as I can in an attempt to i don’t even know what... talk to her I guess. But nope, she was gone. 

I slowly plodded towards my next platform a little lost when all of a sudden there she is, on my exact platform. 

At this point I was on the phone to my Dad trying to organise a car ride to get home once I arrived at my final station. I was kinda stressing out as I didn’t have an Uber account and wasn’t sure what really to do. 

Anyway the next train finally comes and as I’m walking on the girl comes up to me out of know where (must have kinda heard me on the phone) and says “Is everything ok? Where are you headed?” 

This sparks the conversation and we sit together in the carriage talking for over an hour due to the slow train issues. We find out we got a fair few things in common and are joking round and getting on quite well.

As we were talking I was still trying to figure out my ride home from the final station and as I’m trying my phone dies...

I ask if I can borrow hers just to call my dad and let him know mines flat and that I’ll just take a Taxi home

Initially this girl was suppose to get off a few stops before mine but for whatever reason she didn’t and ended up getting off at the same one as me. So we arrive at our stop and start walking down the street still chatting and trying to find the Taxi rank.

We eventually find one and realised we had to go our separate ways. It was that kinda awkward “Oh... well there’s a Taxi, guess you gotta go” 

I head over to the Taxi and chuck my suitcase in the boot, just as I’m about to hop in the Taxi I decide to run over and give her a hug, say thanks, nice to meet you and whatever. 

I then get into the cab and just as I pull away I yell out the window “ADD ME ON FACEBOOK! *My name*!” 
She yells back “ADD ME TOO! *Her name*” But I couldn’t quite remember it or here her over the Taxi engine...

We go our seperate ways (she got picked up by her brother a few min after I left) and that was that. A pretty nice almost movie like experience. 

The next day I try looking for her on Facebook but can’t remember her name. I then remembered I used her phone to call my Dad, so I actually had her number. I decided to text her from my phone...

I sent her a text at about 5pm the next day saying ‘Heyyyy *Name* really great meeting you last night, did you get home ok, then a little inside joke from the night’.....

At about 9pm she replies saying ‘Hiii! My names *This* not *What I said* hahaha! And yeah all good got home fine’ 

I guessed her name... and got it wrong. *Face palm*

I reply about an hour later at 10pm with ‘Nooooo! I’m sorry can’t believe I got that wrong blah blah blah’

Then at about 11am the 2nd day after she replies saying ‘Hahaha all good! We were both tired, who knows what I said, we wanted to get home”

At this point I’m thinking I kinda want to meet up with this girl again, I liked her and think (thought) she liked me too...

So I text her back fairly quick within 10min and say basically “Would you wanna meet up again over the next week or so?” 

And now over 24 hours later still no reply... so my question is why would she take so long to reply? Like she would have seen it at 11am (I saw her active on Facebook so she definitely would have seen it). She took hours to respond to the first (not that bad but still kinda long) But especially on that last one, i texted it 10min after she sent one and she hasn’t replied all day, over 24 hours of knowing about it. 

Any tips? Answers? Advice? Wisdom? 

Should I just forget about it? Let it slip? Or send one more text for peace of mind saying something like...

“Hi *Name*, I’ve done a bit of thinking and apologise if I’ve come across too strong... I think I might have read into this too much. Thanks again tho for all your help and nice to meet you, but sorry if I put you in a difficult situation”

Thanks guys :)

If you don't want to read that here's the run down. I like this girl at my church. We're pretty good friends and we message every now and then through Snapchat.

A mutual friend messaged me asking if I liked her. I admitted and within minutes the girl I like messaged me. Our mutual friend said it was a coincidence. We talked nearly everyday for a week. For example: the next day she randomly out of the blue texts me saying ""hey"". I'm thinking she might be interested. 

But since then we haven't really talked as much, the past few conversations we've had have been initiated by me. I don't know if she's just not interested anymore or never was, or is waiting for me to text her.

TL;DR: myself and a girl like messaged everyday for a week straight after I admitted to her friend that I liked her. We don't talk as much anymore and the past couple conversations we've had we're initiated by me. I don't know if she isn't interested or is waiting for me to talk to her.

66,"This is long so bare with me. I’m a sophomore and my best friend is friends with this girl that I have a crush on right now. Me and my best friend we’re hangout out and he let me go through their chat history. I scrolled back to about exactly a year ago when me and this girl kinda had a thing. Last year me, my friend, and her went to lunch a couple times but I was too late and she got a boyfriend. Shortly after she got a boyfriend last year she messaged me trying to set me up with her friend. Obviously when this happened last year I told my best friend about it since, well, we are best friends. Her friend that she was trying to set me up with never reached out to me like she said and I had no idea until now. Now going back to present day I was reading the chat when I found out that my best friend had lied about me and said that I was jealous of him for talking to her, that I am a 100% trump supporter (which isn’t a bad or good thing but it’s not something you say and I’m not), and that I didn’t want to try dating her anymore. This got me pretty mad because he made me look like a horrible person! I asked him about this and he said he was jealous that the girl was trying to set me up with her friend because they had a thing earlier that year which I had no idea about. So basically he sabotaged that whole thing while also making it so I look like a bad person to my crush but he also made it so I could have lunch with her in the first place. But still! So now the girl that I have a crush on is single again and I want to try and talk to in class (we have one class together this trimester and it’s math) and eventually ask her to go to lunch before winter break (so in two weeks). What I need advice on is how do I talk to her in class since I’m pretty shy and it’s math so I’m not sure how to do it and what do I do about this thing last year with my best friend lying about me and how do I tell her that it was a lie or should I not bring it up at all. What is the best way to DM her on instagram, try to get a conversation started, and eventually ask her to hang out.

Also here’s a bonus thing: when reading the chat she said last year that people that weren’t friends with me and hardly knew me were bringing me up like her friends and her boyfriend. I’m not sure what this means since she never talked about it again. My mother died a couple years ago so everyone at school knows me for that kid who’s mom died, is it about that?

73,"Apologies in advance, but I feel that since I'm asking for advice I need to summarize about 7 years worth of my past. 

Back in 2013 I graduated high school with a nearly perfect GPA. From my perspective, I was on fire and could do anything. The only real issue I had was not doing well on tests (learning disabilities), but even so I was able to scrape by and get a good enough ACT score to into the best college my state has to offer. It's very cheap, ranked 53/100 at the time of best colleges to go to, and was highly recommended by everyone I knew as many of the people who graduate from there go on to work for companies like Google or NASA. So I decided to go for Computer Science and thought that that would be the end of it.

After about 3 months I realized how stressful this place was. The college itself is very demanding, with no real support system in place for students who struggle learning new subjects, especially if you have trouble learning. Even the Special Aid services on campus couldn't help me. Many times I realized that the tutors didn't know what they were doing half the time. Only if you have a good grasp of the material already, and enjoy learning the course material would you end up doing fine. There were also other issues, such as facility's breaking down, superiority complexes from fellow students who were getting different degrees, health and sanitation issues (I was nonstop sick for about 2 months jumping from one illness to the next), etc. The final straw for me was when I withdrew from my Calc I class to try and take it over the summer at community college only to find out the school would not except any credits from that college (Ironically this rule has been changed recently). Eventually, I was so discouraged I decided to leave after my first year, barely maintaining a 2.7 GPA.

I ended up going to community college for Computer Programming, where I was able to get my degree with a 3.7 GPA, but realized during the process that I'm not interested in coding at all. Ever since then I have been doing odd jobs. An IT support position, dish washing, etc. I don't like these jobs, and I really feel like I'm wasting my time.

So here I am again at 23, looking into various colleges to see what my options are. I have not studied much of the course material for years (though I do have books), and am not keen on going back. Financially speaking I'm not doing great, most of the colleges I have looked at would use up my bank account savings in no time. The big issue for me right now though is I don't know what to study. I know I don't want to be doing what I am doing now, but not much else. The best option seems to be going back to my previous college, but I really don't want to do that if I can avoid it.

TL;DR: Should I go back to the same college to get my bachelors? Should I go to a different college? Should I not bother with this and focus on other options?",05Dec2017,8

76,"I was walking my dog home tonight, and as I approached my apartment building he started barking at my neighbours dogs, who were in front of the building. The neighbours dogs (two ~ 80lb dogs) started barking back and I moved to quickly take my dog inside to avoid my neighbour having to deal with that. 

At this point the neighbour (who is a large 6’3” 250ish man to my 5’10” 170) got extremely aggressive and ran at me with his dogs and cornered me on my buildings porch while yelling at me. He said that he would “beat” me if he heard my dog bark ever again. He raised his fist to hit me and I ducked to try to move out of the way, but he didn’t follow through. At this point he went inside and then came back out again (immediately)and told me he would beat me again and then pulled himself back inside (with what seemed like considerable effort  to not attack me on the spot).

I’ve now had some time to process this and am trying to figure out the best approach to move forward. 

I would like to call the police to document that this happened, but I’m worried that if I do that the will talk to him which would escalate  the situation. Part of me wants to see if I can just have a reasonable conversation with this person. I think that if I could let him know that I am actively training my dog to be less anxious around other dogs that he would be less angry. But another part of me thinks that this is just an unreasonable person who may fly off the handle if I go near him again. 

I do have to do something though because I see this person multiple times a week (I need to pass his door to get up to my apartment) and I don’t want to be afraid of getting my ass kicked every time I leave my house.

77,"As a kid, I was hyper emotional. Cried about everything, expressed very strong symptoms of love towards family members, expressed my feelings as necessary etc. Around middle school, I started going a bit numb emotionally and it only escalated from there. I'm 20 at this point and have hit an emotional rock bottom. I've had a girlfriend and broke it off with her because I just wasn't connected to her. I currently have a friends with benefits and she's starting to catch the feels. I'm not into her from an emotional standpoint and want to break it off with her because of it. I can't say or listen to the words ""I love you"". Saying it and hearing it makes me physically draw back and gives me this bad feeling inside. I can't really express my emotion since I don't really know what it is. If something bad happens, I don't feel angry or sad. I feel stressed and irritated but nothing more. When something good happens, I typically feel happy but only for a very brief period of time. I never lose my temper and am incredibly laid back. If I had to give you a description of my average daily feeling, it would be neutral. Day in and day out, I'm just emotionally neutral. Not sad, not happy. Just flat line neutral. 

This makes it incredibly difficult to maintain relationships with people and connect with people. The only people who I actually feel strong emotion for are my mom, my sister and my little group of close friends. By close friends, I mean **close**. Grew up together and have been friends for over 11 years with all of them. Any friends I made during high school or work just don't have an impact on my emotion. Should they die tomorrow, I wouldn't be sad. I wasn't sad when my grandpa died. I wasn't sad when my dog died. I wasn't sad when I found out my friend was suicidal. The only time I feel any actual emotions is when I'm tripping on LSD. This emotional numbness is starting to irritate me since it's starting to impact my daily life. I feel incredible amounts of guilt whenever I upset someone, make someone mad, make someone sad, blow someone off etc. I feel insanely bad about what I did until that person reassures me that they're fine or don't care. After that, the emotion goes away and doesn't come back. My emotions made a 180 degree turn from my childhood and I have no idea why. I want to go back to the loving, empathetic person I was in my youth but I just can't seem to figure out how to do that. ",05Dec2017,6

81,"How can one convince a friend to seek professional help from a psychologist or psychiatrist?

My friend's roommate (F28) has been sharing vague stories of childhood trauma since moving in a few months ago, and of course we've listened and tried to help as best as we can. The details are consistently unclear, as she maintains an inability to recall the events except in sudden, dramatic revelations. 

Unfortunately, over time, she's become more and more reliant on us for attention to the point of personal and professional disruption. It's come to the point where she'll scream and sob until she has our undivided attention (usually when she can get one of us alone), regardless of whether we're relaxing to TV, cooking, leaving for work, etc., and she'll hold us there for as long as she can.

We've tried to be supportive, but it's becoming impossible to ignore the severity of her symptoms. She's not just lonely, depressed, or generally trying to get attention for attention's sake; she is paranoid (believes her family is conspiring to convince her that her traumatic childhood event never occurred), delusional (stalking an unwilling ""soul mate"", including an impulsive trip to visit him in a city across the country even though he wasn't even in that state), and has a history of self harm. When she comes to us for help, she speaks at length in disjointed, incomplete sentences, jumps from topic to topic mid-thought, and rarely acknowledges any input we offer.

We are not qualified to deal with these issues, and she is totally disrespectful of our boundaries and responsibilities. We cannot maintain responsibility for her physical and mental well-being.

She's expressed a total unwillingness to use medication or seek professional help on the basis that her pain is a part of who she is, and resolving her issues would somehow be a sort of personality suicide.

I really dislike my height sometimes. By sometimes, I mean most of the time where it feels like it’s consuming me. Constantly comparing my height to others and thinking about it is what I mean by consuming me...

I’m about 5’1.5 ish and I really really wish I was shorter. I’m already on the shorter side for females. But, I constantly feel like I need to be shorter in order to be a “cute” and “petite” girl. I think talk girls are super beautiful and all, but I feel like I’m just suppose to be short... growing up I was ALWAYS the shortest in my class. Every class I was the shortest there never was a girl shorter then me, and then in middle school everyone was hitting puberty and then reaching there general “max” height, but I keep growing... no longer being the shortest girl and heading on the path to be average height or taller scares me because I never was. It took me so long to finally love and embrace my shortest height structure and now suddenly I’m on the track of growing and it feels like I just wasted all that stress... I know I sound unreasonable since I’m not even super tall, but I’m scared I’ll end up tall as one of my grandparents was around 6’0 and one of my oldest sisters is 5’8...

I also feel like because I’m Chinese, I am suppose to be “short and tiny”. This isn’t true I know, but I feel like I’m suppose to be like this. I love going to china, but whenever I go it’s makes my height issues worse because all of my relatives are either my height or shorter. 

I constantly am obsessing over height. It’s to the point where if I meet someone the first thing I notice is there height and jot down a guess of their height in my head. I’ll compare myself to people based on height and always think “I would be actually cute if I was just shorter by xx much”. It’s so bad that I look up character and famous people’s height to compare myself even if I have no idea who they are...

I just wish I was shorter or at least could stop growing... I know I sound unreasonable and that’s why I hate this issue I have even more because I know it’s unreasonable but I always think like this. It’s sounds a little more dramatic typed out I think, but I’m always thinking about height some days...

-

TL;DR: how do I stop obsessing over my height? 

Height obsessions:
• feel like I would be cuter and more attractive if I was shorter
• sometimes think that I need to be shorter to fulfill a stereotype pushes out for Chinese
• always comparing my height to people and even characters at this point 
• not use to the idea of not being the shortest
• feeling like I’m set on a path to end up tall or taller

I missed November's meeting because I had a mental breakdown in my professor's office, which involved talking to the associate dean, and then I got sent to a counsellor. There was no way I could have contacted my mentor because I didn't realize what was happening to me... After I calmed down, I followed up with an email apologizing that something unexpected happened and could not make it to the meeting. It's been a few days already and my mentor has yet to reply to me... I later emailed the director of the mentorship at my university and this is what they said to me:

I would reach out one more time hoping to arrange another meeting and to explain why you were not in a position to cancel the meeting. Not communicating prior and having people go to a meeting place only to not have someone show up has probably damaged the relationship moving forward.

However, I have been dealing with anxiety/depression for the entirety of my college experience. I am a perfectionist, and that makes college extremely difficult. I used to handle the stress of exams moderately well, as my drive to receive a 100% on them motivated me to study in extreme amounts. This kind of life is not easy to maintain, and naturally, after 4.5 years, I am burnout.

-Teacher (I could get my license online in under 6 months. My entire family is teachers, so I have an ""in"" in multiple districts)

My sister and I do not share the same mother but we do share the same father who I believe is the reason my sisters mother distances herself from my father and I. In the year 2001 I was graced with a little sister  when I was only 5 years of age. I have only one photograph of the two of us which saddens me deeply because we were both very young at the time and comparing then from now, a lot has changed. I remember being told by a relative that when word got out that my father had gotten someone pregnant that he wanted to get rid of the child and that he wasn’t ready for another one, which led me to believe this is where things started to go downhill. Things were rocky but only okay at the start after she was born. We ended up going to the same school together for awhile and she’d walk past me there without even acknowledging who I was which led me to believe that her mother hasn’t been telling her the truth, but at that young of age it’s a very complicated matter to tell to a child. I’ll always remember going into school one day and being told that she had moved out of the town we lived in to somewhere far away and thought to myself will I see her again? Now the years have gone past and I’ve turned 21 this year and she has turned 16 and I don’t know what to do. I believe she’s not been told about me or my father and what we really are to her. Either her mother is waiting awhile to tell her so she can grasp the situation at a better age or that she’s told her and maybe she’s just not bothered? I’m not putting all the blame on her mother as my father is no angel,  the years have been rough to him as a result of it. I’ve recently found her mother on Facebook and it’s been on my mind to message her but I just don’t know what to say, what if she’s not ready for the past to be brought up yet Yano ? I don’t wanna intervene at this time in their life cause it’s some heavy shit really finding out you’ve family members you haven’t seen since you were only a baby, but on the other hand maybe she has told her and they’re waiting for either me or my father to come back into their lives again. Her mother’s parents still live in the town I do and I always think about leaving a letter to give to the mother about how I feel and it’s not right that someone else is being punished for my fathers actions. I came into a bit of money recently and was thinking about leaving some of it in a letter and leave it at her grandparents house with her initials on it for Christmas, they’d surely have a guess who it is.

100,"My wife and I live in a 1000sqft apartment (Co-op), on the third floor that we bought outright in May. Our downstairs neighbor is a widowed older women in her 70's that has been really difficult to deal with since we moved in.


Within the first day or two we had been bereted for where we were parking (We just didn't know which spot was ours yet). She compained we were 'walking too loud', our TV was too loud and she could hear everything we did and said. Our TV doesn't sit above 30-40 most days and when its up louder its normally outside the alloted 'quiet time' hours of 10pm-8am.


Initially we would apologise and adjust what we did however the complaints didn't stop and it just seemed like everything we did was wrong. Here are a list of the larger complaints and what we have done to fix them:


* When we would take baths her drain would back up and overflow into her shower. We immediatly stopped taking baths, drained our water slower and allowed a plumber to come in and deal with the issue by ripping out our walls to replace some pipes.
* I Installed a new AC unit for the apartment. This was done all legally and with the correct permits which have been inspected and approved to our local regulations. Aparently since I did that her electrics have been flickering and she is having constant power issues. This is nothing that we directly have caused since our electrics are on a complete separate curcuit (separate meters), and we are having no power issues of our own.
* I drive a large red pickup, and she drives a brand new car. Our parking spot is next to hers and it seems like everytime I pull up she is watching from the window to make sure I don't touch her car with my door. She has complained about finding 'red paint' on her car even though I have never touched her car with my door ever. This caused her to near demand I park somewhere else. 

There is also a laundry list of small menial complaints that I have been told to deal with. This has resulted in some cases near daily banging on our door, screaming from the balcony up at us, and being accosted while trying to leave or just check the mailbox,  with more complaints and issues and we are both entirely done with it.


The reason for making this post is that tonight she banged on the door and my wife went to deal with it. Our neighbor was livid, shouting because her drain was backed up again with no fault of our own, we were just running the bath water. She started screaming at my wife and getting in her face, wouldn't listen to what she had to say, which ultimately ended up with my wife telling her to call the management, that we weren't going to deal with her anymore, and shutting the door in her face.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR - Older downstairs neighbor is making constant complaints about menial things or things we are not the cause of and blaming us constantly for them, to the point where it feels like harrasment, and it is annoying to live here.**

&amp;nbsp;

What can we do? Does this qualify for harassment? 



*edit: Thank you for all the replies. My wife and I have called the management agency about this. They told us to just keep sending her complaints their way and they will deal with it. Its just encouraging to know that we aren't being unreasonable.*",05Dec2017,2

107,"Hello friends! I'm sorry if I missed someone asking a similar question before. Also sorry this is a bit long and sort of rambling.

Here's my situation: I graduated this past spring with a BA in history. I love my hometown of Charleston, SC, where I grew up, went to school, and currently live, and I decided after graduation that I wanted to stay here and try and find a job and make a life. I signed a one year lease for an apartment with two of my friends and basically gave myself a year to figure things out. I had a part time job at a local medical museum for nearly the past two years. It was a temporary job that ended almost two months ago, and though I really enjoyed it I was happy to have the opportunity to explore different things that I could do with my life. I've been doing freelance painting and sewing work since then and looking for other local historical jobs. I love painting and I'm pretty good at it, but I don't think I really have the entrepreneurial drive to make a career out of it. Being away from my old job made me realize that my original goal of having a career in museum work is one I want to pursue, but I think I definitely overestimated the demand for cultural heritage sector employees in Charleston. Our whole touristy Thing is local history, ou can't swing a dead cat without hitting a historic house museum, and yet no one is hiring. Though it's only been a few months into my ""gap year"" of sorts, I've started to come to the conclusion that after my lease expires I'll probably have to leave town to find work. Even if I did find a job before then, my friends are graduating after this year and scattering to parts unknown, so I won't have anyone to split the (shockingly high) rent with.

I'm one of those people that tries to solve all their problems with elaborate excel spreadsheets. I made one in which I assign point values to different desirable qualities in a place I would want to live, and then it adds them up and ranks different cities. I put in basically every place I could think of, and even when I try to rig the scoring against it New York basically always comes out on top. I've been reluctant about the idea of living in NYC because I hate being cold, I get overwhelmed in crowds, none of my friends would be there, and moving so far away seems expensive and a huge hassle. Lack of snow and low cost of living were ranked pretty highly on the spreadsheet, but New York makes up for those things in points with it's public transportation and multiple major museums, among other things. 

The more I've been thinking about it though, the less horrible of an idea it seems. My mom is from Brooklyn and my dad is from Manhassett, and most of my extended family still lives on Staten Island. I spent a lot of time in the city as a child so I at least have some familiarity with the area. I'm really into genealogy, and my family has lived in the city since they immigrated in the 1880s; being the fifth generation to live in New York and seeing where my ancestors lived would be super cool. I could spend more time with my elderly grandparents and my aunt (and her awesome cats). I also don't drive, and that would be totally normal in the city. If I did move, I think I would like to live in Brooklyn. It seems like it would strike a good balance of location, price, and culture that I'm looking for. 

TL;DR: I'm a giant weenie scared about making a huge life change. Will someone please either play devils advocate and poke holes in these plans or assure me that it seems like the right choice?",05Dec2017,2

It's gotten to the point where I'm too anxious and end up having a feeling of dread anytime I even feel a tiny bit aroused. I've been to a therapist about this and she literally sent me away after 4 visits telling me 'I should be better by now,' and that I don't need anxiety medication. 

I want to be able to enjoy myself during these two weeks I have with him before he's shipped away for half a year. Can I please have some advice on how to just relax and not be so anxious about sex? ",05Dec2017,2
115,"So I joined my school basketball team a while ago.  We have a tournament starting tomorrow (I think, could be soon), but I don’t really like it anymore.  It’s just boring and unpleasant at this point.  I was thinking about skipping the whole tournament and just turning in my jersey at the end of it, but I don’t want to let down my teammates.  If I didn’t show up, someone from a different team would need to play two games and I don’t wanna be a douchebag,  but I really hate the sport now.  I’m split between quitting the team and just going home every day, and going to the games and being miserable the whole time.  Can someone please help me decide what to do?",05Dec2017,2
117,"Ok, so, I just got my period yesterday and I ran out of tampons so I went to the store and as I was reaching for a box of tampons I saw this thing called a ""diva cup"". I remember a friend of mine talking about how awesome they were and how you can save so much money by just using the diva cup. I decided to buy one as well as a box of tampons, just in case. So when I got home, I opened the box and read the instructions (which made the diva cup sound like the greatest thing in the world). I then went into the bathroom, washed my hands and the diva cup thoroughly and proceeded to painfully insert it. I the talked to my friend who recommended I tried the diva cup and she told me not to be so concerned about the pain on insertion. So, I waved it off and went to sleep for the night. This morning when I woke up, I did my routine morning activities and then after lunch I decided it was probably time to take the diva cup out. Well...4hrs later, I have given birth to a beautiful bloody diva cup (TMI, I know). I never thought it was possible to prune my fingers in my own vagina (yes they really are pruned). I have been crawling, sitting, standing, upside down, taken a bath and using pregnancy relaxation techniques as if I was about to give birth....to a diva cup. The relaxation techniques seemed to work the best because that's when the diva cup came out. Now I am very concerned because my vagina is bleeding an incredible amount which wouldn't normally happen even if I'm on my period. I haven't gone to the doctor yet because while I was furiously digging in my vagina for the diva cup, I took an Advil because I was getting a migraine and I was in pain from the ""birth"" of the diva cup. I know that Advil is a blood thinner so I figured I should wait a bit before concerning myself too much and going to the doctor. I am using a pad to help soak up the blood. My question is should I be concerned and is this normal with a diva cup? I don't know if I should try reinserting firstly because I'm a bit scarred and I don't have 4hrs every day to give birth to a diva cup. I also fear that the blood is from a rip in some sort of vaginal tissue. Can someone help me out?!",05Dec2017,4

The only place that I see her is a club that she only sporadically goes to and one particular lounge in our school that she sporadically goes to. I am friends with her on facebook and would like to ask her that way, is that a good idea? We only barely talk because we barely see each other.

123,"I started university in September and to make a long story short, I haven't settled in well. I haven't made many connections with people besides my flat mates, and I've fallen into somewhat of a depression. I've come to realise that the course I'm studying really isn't for me. I only Pickering because it's the same subject I always did well at at school and since I'm university seemed like the only logical step it also seemed logical to choose this degree. I'm hindsight picking a degree because I disliked it the least at school was probably a bad idea. 

I've therefore been thinking about dropping out and taking a couple of years away from studying and academics and deadlines to really decide what it is I want to do in life. Problem is I'm not 100% sure. And if I leave dropping out to later than this week I'll be in debt for 50% of my student finance rather than only 25% if I do it this week. I've also got a really important assignment to do which I have absolutely zero ability to do due this Friday, which means I'm going to end up getting shitty grades for this semester regardless of what I choose to do. 

I just don't want to be paying a fortune that I don't have, to study something I have no passion for, in a place that makes me miserable and I'm alone. But at the same time, going back home and working seems like it could be a trap I might fall into and not be able to get out of. I want to go to university again eventually, and I have good enough grades from school to give me a lot of options. But I need some time to actually decide where I want to be and what I want to be doing. 

Not really sure what I'm asking for, I guess just any input from people who don't have agendas like my friends, family and the faculty at this uni. Many thanks in advance. ",05Dec2017,3
124,"For context, we're both juniors and have been together for a year and a half. To make a long story short, my girlfriend would never even consider going out of the house in a dress a few months ago, let alone to a school dance. But she's finally in a mental place where she came to me asking about going to a dance. I had been to homecoming once before, and I specifically went to one at another school because my school is pretty famous for having way too many drugs and illegal shit, even for a school dance. That combined with the fact that we both share an annoyance for pop culture, we realize that school dances (even a formal, given our school's issues) would be a terrible place for both of us. But she really wants to go out in a dress (and I really want to see her go out in a dress too haha), so I want to do something the night of winter formal in a legitimately formal atmosphere. I've never been on a classy date with her, and I like that idea, but I come to you guys to either tell me I'm wrong about winter formal based on my limited knowledge of it, or to offer good ideas for a formal night out.

126,"I have a new co-worker who is very religious, to say the least. I didn't realize this until we were carpooling one day and he asked me not to swear in front of him. I thought this was a bit too far, as we were outside of work and swearing isn't even frowned upon at work.

For context, I work in a laboratory at a university and it's a very casual environment. (We have kegs at office parties) But I've tried to accommodate that request for the sake of professionalism.

Anyway, today he was to be trained on an experiment by one of my other colleagues who is a women. She's the most qualified person to train him and is also the only one who had time to do it today. He refused to be trained by her because he did not want to be alone with a woman, and asked someone else to train him on Thursday.

I think it's sexist and unprofessional, and the data he is responsible for gathering will be delayed by two days. But another co-worker said that we should be considerate and respect his religious freedom.

Is this a sexist situation that I should talk to our supervisor about? Am I being inconsiderate by expressing my disagreement with him? I'm afraid that I'm biased from our previous disagreements about cursing, so I want to get a third party opinion.

128,"So at some point in the not-too-distant future, I will be buying a vehicle. I can't afford a brand new one, so I'm going to buy one somewhere in the 2013-2015 range.

I'm also a little particular about what kind of vehicle. I'm looking at two particular models, and I don't want a base model. Everything is relatively flexible besides the colours I am looking for; as none of these colours are your standard ""black/white/silver/grey"", as such they are relatively rare and if I'm looking at a page with 50 vehicles on it there's a chance that I might find 3 or 5 at best.

I also live in rural Ontario with one Subaru dealership. Since I work full-time, I don't have that much time to be meandering about the province/Toronto area looking for cars, and most dealerships aren't open on Sundays, meaning I'd likely have to take a Friday and/or Monday off of work to drive down and see cars before making my decision. I guess in that case I'd call the dealerships beforehand and be like ""hey, I'm looking to test drive this vehicle at this time on this date"".

I'm just worried about the logistics of getting everything certified and ready to go before driving back home with my new vehicle, not to mention that everyone is telling me to negotiate. Like, do I just basically walk in there and ask them to take a couple thousand bucks off the asking price? I know roughly the amount I'm willing to pay and I'm looking for cars around or under that asking price. I'm really not good at negotiating either so I'm not really sure about that.

131,"So, since I'm stressed now from the developments of tonight...

My sister is... well, we didn't get along for the longest time. Then some really tough stuff happened in my life and we got a better relationship. A couple years ago, she wanted to get into my group of friends and meet people, I think mostly cause she doesn't really have many local friends.

Now, these friends I've known for plenty of years, the majority of them 10+ years, and the main ringleader of the group that tends to rally everyone to doing a good amount of stuff is my SO. The problem now though is.... that she doesn't get along with some of them and the SO is about to be like ""She's out of the group, she's causing too much trouble."" I can see where he's coming from, she has quite a personality in lines of she can be a bitch sometimes, especially to someone she doesn't get along with. The couple of friends that she mainly doesn't get along with are one friend who I'm not too close with mainly cause we don't know each other the best. However, he doesn't get to do much and I can put up with his personality enough that I don't dislike him. He has a wife and kids so he always gets excited to play dungeons and dragons, and I can't fault him for wanting something different to do.

The other person is a bit of a weird thing. The other person she clashes with is a fairly autistic shut in who lives in a crowded trailer. He can get kinda out of hand when he gets angry, trying to throw stuff and yelling and such, which might be why my sister doesn't like him much, but I know its not completely something he can really control. He also has stims where he bounces around and flaps his hands, and I half wonder if that just bothers her ears in a form of misophonia.

I don't want something crazy like her getting uninvited to things just because she can't get herself to be more friendly and such with some of my friends, but I can certainly see where they're coming from in not wanting to include her. It doesn't help that she's engaged to another friend of mine and she has him whipped to the point where he'd probably stop doing stuff with people if she wasn't invited. I wish I could try to help her find a new group of friends so she could have people who she gets along with better so she could separate herself more from my group of friends and no one gets feelings hurt. The worst thing I worry about is that she gets told shes not included really in the group anymore and she gets depressed and returns to trying to self harm. The worst I feel like I'm going through is that I'm gonna be pushed towards having to choose one side, which I can't really. I can't choose between friends and family. I don't want to either so I hope that it won't end up coming to that. 

Is there any way I can try to either help mend things or do something to help ease my sister to trying to find her own friends without having to put her through a really bad self harm episode without intending to?",05Dec2017,2

134,"Needing some advice regarding my family, specifically my Dad. Over the past year to year and a half, I've noticed a significant change in my Dad's behavior/personality as well as his health. 

A little backstory - My Dad has congestive heart failure. He has been sick since I was a child; strokes, heart attacks, pace maker, the works. About two years ago, his doctor said that his heart is failing and the final option they have for him is open heart surgery. He was told the risks may out weigh the benefits and he would have a 50/50 chance of survival during the surgery. Given this information, he declined the surgery and hasn't been to see a doctor since. This is when it all began. 

Honestly, I don't even recognize my Dad anymore. His personality and temperament has completely changed and it scares me. I started to notice that he would begin to talk about strange ideas and conspiracy theories. Things like the moon landing, Illuminati, etc. (I understand people truly believe in these things and I'm not trying to judge them or bash them for believing in conspiracies; it's just become out of control for my Dad.) He would then strike up conversations with me regarding them and when I would try to change the subject, he would get angry. I only have a problem with these beliefs because I can see that it's changed him. He is clearly upset and paranoid and it has caused some irrational thinking and mood changes. His personality switches. Sometimes I catch glimpses of the Dad I knew, loved, and grew up with. But that's quickly replaced by paranoia, anger, and sadness. Not to mention, he looks to be 10 years older than he should and I can clearly see he doesn't feel well.

What truly breaks my heart is seeing my Mom. She is constantly crying and upset every time I see her and I know that something is wrong. I believe that my Mom can see the change as well in him and it's destroying her. I'm married and don't live with my parents so I'm not there to see what goes on day to day behind closed doors, but I know that something clearly is wrong and I don't know what to do. I sometimes try to get my Mom alone to see if she will talk to me about it but she ignores it and tells me everything is fine (all the while she is crying and upset... so not fine.) I've casually brought up the topic of counseling or therapy but that was shut down very quick. (Something about doctors being evil? Again conspiracies and paranoia.)

In summary: I believe that my Father's health has affected him mentally. I don't know to what extent. It's causing problems between my siblings (still living in the home) and parents. I don't believe physical abuse is an issue here but clearly some mental and emotional. I also don't think my Dad understands the hurt he's causing because I don't know if he's all there. 

I feel completely helpless and heartbroken for my family. I know this probably isn't the right platform to help with this and I know this is all very personal to be putting out for the internet to read. But, I'm asking for help. I would love any advice you can give; if not about resources to get my family some help but maybe some coping techniques for me to deal? My husband has been incredibly supportive but he is hurting with this too and doesn't know what we can do. I would even appreciate if you have experienced something similar that you could share or maybe even some words of encouragement. But please. If you have any resources at all for me or my family to get some help, please share. 

Thank you.

138,"My high school boyfriend and I dated for two years, from around 17 to 19. By the time we broke up, be practically hated each other. As we started to get older and go to University, we learnt about ourselves (as in what happens at that age) and both really hated the person the other had become. To narrow down, he adored and considered his hero to be a politician I detested and was in rallies against. He was homophobic, I am bisexual. He thought climate change was fake, I teach the importance of caring for the planet. All those political/moral/ethical things were things we didn't really think about at 17. I also found that he was pushing me for a future I wasn't ready for, he wanted me to buy a house with him and get married 'in the next few years'. Now at almost 25, I am still not ready for that at all (including with my partner, who I love deeply). Despite all this, despite not having seen him for almost 6 years, despite not wanting to get married, his engagement (which I found out about yesterday) has bothered me for some reason. It may have something to do with the who (my best friend's cousin, no they didn't meet through me, I just live somewhere where that sort of stuff seems to happen all the time), but seeing as I've never meet her, this doesn't seem like it. I seem to be thinking about it a lot, and I'm not thinking 'I want to be engaged' or 'I miss him' I just seem to have it on repeat in my head. Does anyone have any ideas why this is bothering me so much (or maybe the same thing has happened!)

139,"I'm a 23 year old woman who has never been on a date, kissed, or had sex. I never learned how to drive, I've never had a job, and I don't have a college degree or vocational training. 




















































I live in a small town with my parents. I rarely venture outside of the house due to my wack sleeping schedule, social anxiety, depression, IBS, and chronic pain and fatigue due to ovarian cyst and other ""womanly"" problems. Also, nothing really interest me in the town I live in. I enjoy the arts (theater, music, fine arts, ballet/dance, etc.), and there's no real opportunities for such things in my area. Everything revolves around high school sports, trucks, hunting, and who's sleeping with who, and while I have no problem with people who enjoy such things, I have no interest in these topics. 















































I'm afraid that I'll end up a single, lonely virgin. It's something that I have bece obsessed with since I turned 23. I constantly see people online saying that past about 21 years old, being a virgin is unappealing and creepy, and that they wonder why you haven't lost it yet. The reason why I have never been in a relationship of any type is due to a lack of self-esteem. I've felt fat, ugly, dull, boring, and stupid most of my life. Now at 23, I feel like I can't compete with all the pretty, super experienced, college educated women my age. I also do not understand dating/social rituals, which is something that most people learn before they graduate high school. I never learned how to do most of the things my female peers know how to do, such as applying makeup, feeling confident in sexy clothes, styling my hair in an attractive manner (although I have been told I have beautiful long, dark, thick, curly hair most of my life), keep up on fashion trends, having a diet and workout plan, and just general flirting and being attractive to men. 












































I don't know why I never learned how to drive, so I don't know how to answer that one. The reason why I've never had had a job is because my parents refused to let me work when I was in high school, and due to the fact I have social anxiety to the point that I hold my head down, have bad posture, and I struggle with looking people in the eye. Oh, I forgot to mention I have no friends, and I've never really had any real friends in my life. My classmates always perceived me as being a snob, due to my reserved nature and lack of interest in things that my peers enjoyed. I was never mean to anyone--in fact, I may have been too nice/sweet--so I don't know why they thought of me in that manner. I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that adults have told me I'm beautiful my entire life, even when I was a pimply, ugly adolescent. I've just always felt alienated by most of my peers, especially my female peers. I don't know if it's because my personality (again, reserved, shy, somewhat ""prim and proper""), my race (I'm black), or if I just give people strange vibes. I really don't know. 














































In terms of my college situation, I don't know what to do anymore. I've only taken a few online community college courses in the four years I graduated from high school. I've dropped and withdrawn from several classes, which is something I'm ashamed of. I did this because of mental health issues, and because I think I'm a poor writer and I'm bad at math. The reason why I never attended a four year college is due to the fact that I'm afraid of living on my own. The subjects I actually enjoy are considered ""useless"" by society. I've always been attracted to esoteric subjects, such as art and music history, but I've never known how to voice my interest in these subjects to my parents. I would have loved to study fine art, art history, and forgein languages after high school, but I feel like I'm too to study these subjects. I love theses subjects so much that I'd consider getting a graduate degree in one of them. I never thought about what career to pursue when I was younger, because I'm not a very ambitious, career-oriented person. Now at 23, I'm worried that the fact that I'm not on track to having a high-power/high paying  career (engineering, law, medicine, etc.) is unappealing to most people. I've taken career inventory test (they usually suggest something arts-related), college major test (again, something arts-related), and personality test such as the MBTI (I usually get INFP or INFJ on these test), and I'm still at a loss over what to do. Another thing is that I've always dreamed of being a housewife, which I know is unrealistic for me. I feel so sick that being some weird over-educated artist/musician who has a husband that ""takes care"" of her financially and sexually is a fantasy I've had since middle school, and that I still think it sounds like a great idea. I feel like my fantasy is letting down other women, and would bring shame to my parents if I ever had the opportunity to pursue it. 



















































































**HERE'S MY BIGGEST FEAR:** I'm afraid that my lack of life experience will harm me in the future. I have no experience with men, and I'm pretty sure that most of them think a 23 year old virgin with no dating experience is a freak. Why would any man want some late bloomer who's been sheltered her entire life, when he could have an experienced woman who is far more interesting than me? I've pretty much blown my chance at having a good/decent career, due to the fact that I don't have a college degree, and I have no work experience. I'm scared of driving for no reason whatsoever. It's getting to the point that I'm having nightmares about being dirt poor and living with an abusive husband and five kids, because deep down I know that this is the most likely outcome for me, and it's what loser like me really deserves. I just have no one else to talk to, and I don't know what to do anymore. ",05Dec2017,2
141,"My interest in the certificate is not for any current need.  I had paid in part as a gesture of support for the platform, because I don't claim the hardship of a struggling student.  If there had been an option to donate, and forgo the certificate, I might have done so.  But having paid for the certificate, and seeing it might be of some use in the future, for a resume or application, I'd attempted the verification by photo and ID.

The status of the verification had pended for a couple days before I was told the picture was too blurry.  I had resubmitted a clearer picture, and the notification had not changed.  It had not claimed the need for delay, for further examination.  The notice of rejection remained as at first.  I resubmitted again, and there was no change.  I submitted a support ticket, and I was cited the cause of the initial rejection, that the picture was blurry, all of which had nothing to do with my inquiry.  I attempted to explain that a clearer photo had been twice resubmitted, with no recognition from the system whatsoever, but my reply to the ticket received no recognition either.  I opened a second ticket, which was answered by a different representative, and the concourse was identical.  I was cited the cause of the initial rejection, all of which had nothing to do with my inquiry, and my further explanation was ignored.

I'm so annoyed though!! Like it's an inconvienience for me and they KNOW that I'm leaving the day after. Like there's no serious reason why I can't go the day before but like don't people usually do last minute packing and just rest up in general before a holiday? That's a normal thing to do, right?

I need to know what happened to him... how can I find out? This feeling fucking sucks, he could literally be dead. Please aid me, I need advice in contacting him, all I know is his name, Facebook, and Steam.

150,"Ive been in the dark throughout most of this as my parents have mainly been handling this issue. My dog was attacked a about a week ago by a much larger dog wandering in our garage. He left a rather large bite wound which was closed with 8 staples. Antibiotics and pain meds were prescribed.

Couple days go by and we begin to notice significant swelling around the site of the wound as well as darkened tissue. Parents take the dog in and turns out wound was infected and had formed an abscess. Wound was opened and was given tubes for drainage. This is where what I know comes to a halt. I do not know what reasoning was given for the infection or what the diagnosis that they gave was as I have not caught up with my parents yet but what I can say is the tissue was severely darkened at this point so I am unaware if necrotizing fasciitis was identified/considered at this point, missed, or brushed off as something else.

I observed the site of the wound a few days later which had previously been covered up by a shirt to prevent his wound drainage from getting everywhere. I was shocked to see how large and repulsive looking it had gotten. The abscess was drained via two incisions, one on the left, one on the right. The skin in between smelled extremely foul and presented as being dark purple/black in color. It was at this point I realized what I was looking at was likely dead tissue which turned out to be correct. [Video link here (graphic)](https://vimeo.com/245871377)

He went in for surgery today to have the tissue removed and his wound, initially about two inches in length, has at least quadrupled.

I begun to research what exactly had happened, how it happened, what was done incorrectly if anything, and how to prevent this from occurring again. It was then I came across the subject of necrotizing fasciitis and begun to realize this situation is perhaps far more dire than I initially perceived which is why I have come here. Is this indeed what has happened? Is there potential my dog could have become septic? Was this situation handled appropriately?

Correct me if i'm wrong but it is of my understanding that if necrotizing fasciitis is identified, the infected tissue is to be surgically removed immediately along with the administration of IV antibiotics to prevent sepsis and the potential of death. This dead/dying patch of skin was left on him for days.

I will catch up with my parents in the morning to see what they were told but until then, would anyone here with some medical knowledge care to chime in? ",05Dec2017,1
151,"They've been on and off since 2015, I and his other friends always felt like there was something off/creepy about her so we were surprised when they got together.

We'll call him Steve, and her Sarah. Steve's a happy-go-lucky, hardworking guy, whom everyone likes. Sarah is a quiet, bad-tempered person. She doesn't really have any friends. They're complete opposites.

Sometime early 2016, I found out she hit him. I tried to talk him into leaving her. He must have told her or something because she sent me a threatening message on Facebook, then proceeded to send apologetic messages in which she said she loved me, she'd do anything for me (we don't know each other very well), and when I responded telling her she needed professional help, she started saying she'd come after me.

They broke up after she messaged more of his female friends. But he kept coming back to her.

Today I found another message. This time it was from Steve's Facebook account, but it was Sarah pretending to be him. ""Steve"" was telling me I'm the one who needs to seek professional help, that I'm a sick person, that I need to apologise to Sarah or else. She clearly still holds a grudge for what happened close to a year ago.

I don't know how to get it through to him that this bitch will ruin his life, and has already started to do so. We just finished texting, and HE was the one who apologised for her latest threatening message. Somebody please help me.

153,"The other day when i came back from homeroom, i opend my laptop, to find a photo of a penis as my back round, obviously someone had logged into my computer and changed it. I instantly went to the head of year and told her what happened. Later that day i told my parents, who then emailed the head of year about it. They got an email back saying that the person confessed, but said that i had been bullying him. It was obvious to me that he was just bringing up an old argument to take the blame and punishment of him. To clarify, i wasn't bullying him. The ""bullying"" that occurred was taking his pencil caseas a joke/prank. It didn't involve stealing it, it was just hiding it in obvious places so when he asked where it was, we would tell him it was obvious. Others started it, but then i carried it on. I only did it a couple times until i eventually stopped. Other people continued though. He started thinking it was methat was doing it, even though it wasn't, so he started punching me and trying to hurt me. He didn't really hurt me, but it was basically a threat. Eventually we (me and him) got over it completely, and then in about 2 weeks, this whole thing happened. Back to today, im new at high school, and this whole year has been shit. Ive done pretty bad in marks, and my parents have been putting me down the whole time. I specifically was mad about all the bullies as school ,and whole misbehaved everyone was considering i got to a private school. When my parents heard about me ""bullying"" the guy, they were mad. They said they were going to send a apology email to the head of year for me ""bullying"" him. They called me a ""fucking asshole"", a ""complete disappointment and failure"", and say that im a complete loser. I genuinely want to die right now. My parents pratically have no trust in me and hate me, i get falsly accused of bullying after being bullied and now im in trouble with the head of year.",05Dec2017,1
155,"I’ve got 5 other siblings and a single mother all living under the same roof. Myself and my two brothers don’t often talk and I’m always finding myself stuck in the past wishing we were still brothers. I’m the youngest brother and I just wish I had a brother to talk to and that’s why I’m here on this subreddit in the first place. My sisters are always out to get me; going through my phone and shit, trying to find the littlest speck of dirt on me to get me in trouble with my mum. And what makes it worse is that there’s a language barrier between myself and my mother, for I speak very broken Vietnamese, so whenever there’s shit on me I find it very hard to explain my situation, because everything gets stuck in translation. There’s absolutely no trust in the house. It’s my sisters and my mum who don’t trust me; I know and hope my brothers still want me, but for the most part I feel unwanted in the house, mainly by my sisters and mother. I always find myself hanging with my friends because they’re more supportive than my actual family, with the absence of the support from my brothers who I long for. But the downside is that I’m only seeing them at school, because I’m always hesitant to go out and hang with them on my own time because my mum and sisters don’t trust me and will always think I’m up to something. I just want to get away from everything and go live with people who I actually feel would want me and trust me.

So I don’t have a certain question. I just want advice. Am I being irrational? I just want someone to talk to.

159,"My friend Amy* is one of those friends who's ALWAYS ""going through something"" like, some kind of drama. I am a very, very empathetic person so I find caring for others as automatic. I have helped her through all her problems (and she's never ceased to have one since day one of meeting). I enjoy that she laughs easily &amp; seemed very ""chill"". So when she got evicted for more drama I thought I would help her out. I live in a 3 bedroom with empty rooms so I helped her move all her stuff in &amp; also helped her get hired at the restaurant that I work at. Well, since moving in she hasn't paid ANY rent. It's been 2 months. We make a fair amount at work (about $400 a week) and our rent is only $275 a person. She claims she can't pay...
Along with that she got her car towed and thought it would be okay to ask my brother to lend her money to get the car out and never paid him back. 
To add to it, she is a really shitty friend (uncaring, self-centered and attention is her main goal at all times). She has LOTS of drama and I started to get sick of it because I don't have any ever. 
So one night when she was starting stupid drama for the third night in a row (because I didn't include her in a photo I was taking with my best friend of 3 years on that friends birthday) I told her to ""Leave me the fuck alone for a couple of days, your drama is stressful"". 
She then cornered my boyfriend about it, came to our work when we weren't working &amp; screamed at me for drinking her sunny D in front of 4 other employees and got kicked out, banged on my door at 4am screaming ""what the fuck"" because I ate one of her ramen packets... along with other unnecessary drama. 
I'm wondering, is it harsh to kick her out? I mean she isn't paying rent at all, she's hiking my utility bills up &amp; I feel so much anxiety because she can't deal with this confrontation the right way she just yells or speaks to me like I'm a child. She talks down to me every time. 
I want to kick her out but I also don't want to start more drama because we still have to work together. I am extremely stressed out. 
The reason I haven't already kicked her out is because she lives 2 hours away in a trailer park with her drug addict mother &amp; I know she will be forced to go back there and quit this job... this might ruin her life for a bit and I'm really sad thinking about that happening to her :( ",05Dec2017,1

There are a few special moments between us where we laughed really hard, and that one time where he stared at me for ages. I also catch him staring at me and looking away really quickly, and he showed me baby photos of him once. Dude also tells me some important personal secrets, like who he hates and why, and that his dad doesn't get payed a lot (My mum and his dad both work as construction workers.). There is also this one time where we made a small bet, and he teased me about it because I lost, which led me to slapping him very lightly. He was laughing really hard.

So Dude found out I like him. I panic, because when my previous crushes found out I like them they avoided me like the plague. But Dude didn't. Dude actually stayed the same. He just acts a little shy now. He also looks at me and looks away quickly from time to time.

The only problem: I work right next to my ex-girlfriend. At the beginning of 2016, about a year after I started, we began sleeping together. We were pretty serious for about six months, sneaking around and making sure no one else at the office knew what was up. (Disclaimer: I'm pretty sure everyone knew.) 

Anyway, fast-forward to now. We broke up under pretty messy conditions and have been stuck in the absolute-fucking-worst cycle since. For the past year and a half, we'll follow this pattern:

* Phase one: We've broken up. Both of us do our best to snap out of any affectionate habits and act like normal colleagues. 

* Phase two: This is the shittiest one. One of us will start dating someone else. This is usually followed by a lot of passive aggressiveness from the other one, maybe a bit of drunken shouting. 

* Phase three: Somehow, someway, we make it through phase two alive. We're on good terms, we're chatty, back to being normal pals. 

* Phase four: We're such good pals that we go for a drink. One thing leads to another and we wind up back at the beginning until one of us decides to call it again. 

This has happened again and again, to the point where I feel like it's stopping us from living our lives. I think we're both obsessed with (maybe a bit in love with) each other, but it's making us completely miserable.

I think he must fear death, having seen so many of his friends die, and knowing that he's quite possibly next. Maybe he's sad to leave, to not see his grandchildren grow up. 

I want him to see the other side. DMT has a way to give answers, as a form of communication with an almost alien consciousness. An introduction to a sort of meta reality. I think he'd have great epiphanies, and may even look forward to, or welcome death. He might reflect on his life, and die a happy man, knowing that he's lived well, and excited for the next phase of the journey. 

Do you think I should broach the subject with him? I've raised the topic of drug law reform earlier this week. I asked what he thought of giving heroin to addicts, and he stayed silent, considering.

If you know nothing about screen printing, all you have to know is that I do everything with a certain thing before passing it off to the press operators to print with. And it’s miserable.

Something I finish today may not be needed tomorrow, this week, or even next week. You work your ass off but make no progress.

185,"GFs father recently bought a new house where he finished the basement for rental. He preferred family or someone he could trust and offered me the place. Discomfort started as soon as I moved in. Within 20 minutes of me arriving to the house he is downstairs trying to make small talk or just walking through the basement as he built a small storage closet for his things. He constructed a full sized separate entrance into the basement which has a small hallway. His storage closet is in this hallway an my “apartment” is separated from it by a door. I don’t see the reason for him to walk through my apartment to get to his things. The other door goes upstairs into his kitchen which he left the lock for on his side. He could go outside and down the basement entrance to get his things an not disturb me, but doesn’t. I have been living here for about a month now and he still has frozen meat in the basement fridge, which he said he would remove as it is for my use. On numerous times, he has walked downstairs while I’m in the shower and proceeds to knock on the shower door to confirm it is me in there showering, which is kind of annoying. On the rare days he doesn’t come downstairs, I can hear them open their basement door and listen, as to confirm I’m downstairs. What got me really upset was when my GF, his daughter, came over one day and stayed the night. He called her the next day not knowing I was with her and told her she could not spend the night over with me and she must respect his views on religion and marriage, and his house. It is funny because he lives with his new (unmarried) GF and they have 2 kids. Now my GF took great offense to that and does not even want to hang out at my place, because she has to always be reporting in upstairs.

She has offered me a spare room in her house but I do not know if this is the right thing to do. I have been grateful for this family taking me in, in a sense, and the only reason I took any of their offers is to save money to hopefully buy a home come spring time. Not sure what to do. Am I overreacting about all the lack of privacy? Not sure if taking the spare room is the right thing to do, I feel i am in peoples way and maybe I should just get my own place at the expense of not saving much and getting a home in a couple years. Or maybe I should just deal with the lack of privacy and just pay rent for storage basically and spend as much time out of the apartment. ",05Dec2017,2
186,"So I was offered a job welding for 17.00 an hour. I was suppose to get more but I didnt do so hot on the test because of my nerves. 

Full time. And overtime. 12 paid holidays off and 401k. Drive to work is 25 min. And is about $7.00 more than what i make now on the hour.

Youd think “Why arent you jumping on that!?!”

Well the building doesnt have any built in ventilation system. All it has is garage doors that open up during the day.

Im more worried about the health risks of welding in a not so good ventilated area.

A part of me feels maybe he didn't like my body or something like that... Also i noticed he commented a few flirty things on a certain girl's instagram in October and again in November (before we met up but we had been chatting since September)... But he's been flirty with me so, I shouldn't see it as he's not interested right? Because hey, he's single so he's allowed to do that.. It just stung like a bitch to see that. He has said that ""he would totally be with me"" and I wonder if there's anyway I can be like ""what the hell is going on dude?"" without having the ""what are we"" talk because we aren't anything yet. Hes just hard to approach and basically I just want to know if he's still interested in seeing me or not, without sounding like i'm taking this all too seriously (which i am lol!). He doesn't text much, I think he'd be much more receptive on the phone but he's pretty busy, I'm not keen on springing a call on him. Ahhhh frustration!!!!

She will yell at more because I haven't done her laundry  (I normally do all the laundry on sunday) and by Tuesday it's filled back up with loads of clothes. If I haven't cleaned the bathroom she yells at me again. She complains that my boyfriend doesnt do anything whwn he will hwlp me clean or do laundry. She complains he stays in our bedroom all day, but when he does come out our dog tries to bite him and my mom doesn't do anything or he is out in the living room with her and she doesn't acknowledge him at all so he would rather be in the bedroom were he can do something without worrying about her or the dog. My mother coupons because she can't legally work anymore and has yard sales on  Saturday and always wants my boyfriend and I to help her at 5 in the morning to set up. Granted we have to be up a few hours later for work, it gets very tiring. My dad goes to work and when he comes home he does nothing but sit on his butt for the rest of the day. He doesn't clean up after himself and mom doesn't say anything to him. She doesn't help clean up,she doesn't do her own laundry, and all she does is sit confront of a computer.

193,"I have an offer accepted on a flat. I am a FTB, offering a cash sale. I offered the asking price.

So far, I've been quite accommodating to the progress of his new purchase. When the offer was accepted in mid-September, it was known that I needed to be in by the start of December.

In November, the EAs asked if this could be put back a few weeks because the vendor wants to remain in the flat until his purchase is complete. I said I wasn't thrilled with this, but able to accommodate a few weeks because it didn't impact my timeframe that much.

Now, I am being told that the vendor still has some outstanding enquiries on his new purchase. He is aiming to move out of his current flat by mid-December, but I am rapidly losing trust in that happening. The vendor's solicitors have told my solicitors that they are not ready to discuss completion dates yet.

IMO, by mid-December it will have been 3 months since the offer was accepted. That is more than enough time to organise an exit. I have been accommodating thus far, but now it's beginning to seriously impact my timeframe.

I am ready to offer an ultimatum - complete and leave by mid-December time, or I withdraw the offer. I am willing to keep that ultimatum at this stage also.

The letter started out mentioning by name: my ex husband, my husband, brother-in-law, and someone with the same last name. 

The rest of it (5 pages) makes no sense to me. It's a guy describing his life, and I don't know any of the people involved, and I am sure I don't know this person. Other things in the letter make it clear they don't know who I actually am. 

He writes that he's in prison for murder for 50 years. I googled the return address, and it's a prison. 

I think what happened is this person is trying to find an old friend, and thinks I am that person, but just threw in the other related names from one of those skeezy websites you find when you google a name, where they try to sell you the person's info. (Edit: However it's a fairly common name, and there's a lot of results, so I'm not sure how they ended up at me)

Let me start sayin who i am, i'm 20yrs old, man, and i live in Chile. I like to play videogames, workout, play football, play guitar etc etc...

Ok, so, i think that there's probably at least some people here that came that moment in your life where you had to choose what to major in, but had absolutely no idea what you wanted, am i right?

That's my case.

I'm posting this at currently 12:30pm, laying on my bed, thinking and getting worried about life and the future because of no future-perspective because i have no idea of what i want to major in/work with.

One of my dreams is to move and be a permanent resident in CA or NZ, and once i'm living there, i actually don't worry about what i'm going to work with, as long as it's not a job that i completely hate, i'll be happy just by living in one of those 2 countries, i don't aim to be rich, i just want to achieve my dream and live a confortable life.

I've done some research and i found out that both of these countries needs I.T workers, and it's a job that immigrants can get a lot more easily than other jobs, so, this is why majoring in comp sci came to my mind.

However, i never had contact with programming in my 20 years of life and i don't really know if i'm going to like it, spend the whole day coding doesn't seem like a good job, i might be wrong tho because i know nothing about programming. Also, i heard a lot of stuff about programmers, cases of depression, that it's a stressful job, no social life etc etc...

I don't want a job that will make me depressed, that will make me work 24/7, a stressful job, i much rather have a lower salary than a higher one working like this. Again, i know nothing about programming, this is just stories that i read about on the internet, so, if you work with programming don't take that as an offense to your life's job .

What do you think? Is it worth for me to start majoring in comp sci to help me in my immigration dream?

If you read all this, thanks, i think this was just something i had to get out of my chest :[.

Whilst it occurs to me that I could just post this from my mobile, I find this more convenient, so that any feedback I get I can immediately use to log into my accounts.

The closest I can guess as to why this happened is that I cleaned my keyboard with a wetwipe (I realise, in retrospect, that this was a bad idea) and some water must've gotten in and messed it up. Does anyone know where on a Mac with the latest version of OS X I could get an on screen keyboard without downloading it? That would mean I'd have to type, since my password *isn't* all upper case. i can't just paste anything in either, because most of the time you can't do that in a password box.

I know ultimately that the best solution would be a mechanical keyboard but at the moment I can't really use one for reasons I don't feel I need to get into, and no, I can't use shift to type in lowercase because Macs are annoying like that.

I have a 50 Gallon drum as a fire pit in my fenced in back yard and this morning after I left my house my old lady texted me asking why I left a fire burning in the pit and that she went out and smothered it. This was about 5:45 - 6 am

I didn't have a fire last night and not only would I have ensured it was put out, it wouldn't have been smoldering, let alone still burning. So, that means someone was in my back yard having a fire somewhere between 4-530 am. This put me on edge, not so much for myself but for my girlfriend and our female roommate.

212,"For an entire year I've been trying to overcome my anxiety issues. I used to stay in my room playing video games which really affected my social skills and made me overweight.

So after losing weight and manning up a bit I got a job and started hanging out with different people. It was fun. I made some friends. But I had such low self esteem, and my anxiety was so big, I almost never enjoyed the time spent with them. I was always so anxious and jealous of others. I made role models out of people who can't even hold their own life together. It was bad.

Fast forward to today. I have a gf. I love her. But, you guessed it right, my anxiety and low self esteem seriously hurt the relationship. Or to be more accurate, how much I enjoy the relationship. I am living in fear that she might leave me, that she might find somebody better. Everytime I'm alone by myself I feel pity, I feel like I'm worth nothing, I feel like I have no dreams and ambitions. The guy who before kept looking for ways to improve himself now sleeps most of the day waiting for friends to get back home from work so we can play some video games (I quit but I still play from time to time). I am doing some things for myself but usually I have to really drag the motivation out of me to do them. And I also feel like I'm doing this for my gf.

I just can't stand living like this anymore. I feel like the combination of feeling like a loser + having non stop anxiety and an overthinking brain really made me give up on trying. Obviously I still did not give up because I'm here, but I feel so low right now, like I'm at the lowest point in my life. Like I'm worth nothing. Like I would never solve this and I'm conditioned to live in fear of what others think of me and self doubt all the time.

 I'm going to therapy. I am taking anxiety meds. But the process is slow. So far all I've done is tell her my problems and she said I have anxiety. I still have no clue how to fight it back. I don't know what to do with the voices that tell me my gf dislikes me. I don't know what to do with the voices that tell me she will never love me if I'm not x or y. I don't know what to do with the voices that keep trying to find solutions but they yell at each other that it's not wrong. I've read books, watched ted talks, nothing. My overthinking brain gets the better of me everytime. I can't recall a time when life lost its colors like now. Please help.

229,"My close guy friend comes over a lot, late hours and we would spend quality time together by watching movies, cooking, playing video games etc. He slowly became very affectionate and would cuddle with me and be very touchy.

I decided to take a step forward and admit my feelings, he kissed me and then we got more intimate. The next time he came over we also got intimate, however, I told him I was a virgin at that moment because I thought he should know before jumping into anything. 

He seemed to be cool with it, I invited him over the next day and he was very different. So distant, no cuddles, no affection, just very cold. 

He came over again a few days later, we were both drunk, and he invited himself... and in my head I was thinking oh so somethings happening, he gets in my bed and I’m like oh so somethings definitely happening! I get in and this guy literally just turns his back to me and keeps his distance ... nothing...

So, I decided he wasn’t interested and haven’t reached out to him since. It’s been 5 days he hasn’t messaged me, we’ve been speaking daily for the past couple months up until now.

I’m hurt but I’m healing; and as of now I want to let him know that I want things to go back to being platonic, and not to let this get in our friendship. (We’ve been friends for 8 months)  

I don’t know how to bring it up though, or go about it, it’s just something we’ve never actually talked about",05Dec2017,2

233,"Ok so long story... over the summer, my friend asked if she could stay at my house ""a couple times throughout the semester"" and I said yes. She has an internship at home but has a class at school that meets fridays, so she typically lives at home blah blah blah. Anyway, the first time she came to my house I said ""ok, so you can sleep on my floor, otherwise there's a pullout couch in the living room"" and she said ""well what about your bed?"" Still thinking it'd only be ""a couple visits over the next 3 months"" I said ok I guess that would be fine if we both sleep in my bed. It's a full so it's big enough for two people. She has proceeded to come stay at my house EVERY OTHER WEEKEND FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS, sleeping in my bed, except the times my roommate left for the weekend, then she would sleep in her bed. Two weeks ago, she texted me and said she'd be home late so I said I was going to bed and set her blankets and clothes outside my doorway, locked my door and went to bed. I had been very standoffish to her so I think by this time she knew I don't like when she's here. But then it was awkward because she came home like 15 mins after she sent the ""I'll be late"" text so I wasn't asleep and she tried opening my locked door. She slept in my roommates room that night. Then she came again last week (even though it's only supposed to be every other week?) and texted me saying she'd only be here Thursday night. This is the first time she's ever had to sleep on the couch. Then she texts me again on Thursday saying ""hey katlyn said I can sleep in her bed tonight so I'm gonna do that"" and stayed Friday night too. Now, she wants to come AGAIN tomorrow and I really want to say no because it's finals week and I have enough shit to deal with, but I have been letting her do this all semester so I feel rude saying no now. But every time she comes I get anxiety and try to avoid my own house but it's my house and I shouldn't have to do that! I don't want to be rude but at the same time I really do because HOW DOES SHE NOT UNDERSTAND THAT I HATE WHEN SHES HERE! I don't even talk to her when she's here because I don't want to accidentally be rude! I'm getting nothing out of this, she brought me a bottle of wine like twice, it is definitely not worth it!

239,"My 50 year-old mother has cirrhosis that is likely to end her life within 5 years, but she can live like normal person for another 30 years if she receives a half of living donor's liver.  Her cirrhosis is due to her drinking 1/3 of a cup of vodka a day for the last 10 years during which she had been in the nadir of her life-long major depression and isolation, but multiple physicians remarked that that's an unusually short amount of alcohol (even for vodka) for someone to grow cirrhosis. So she can't really be blamed, especially because depression and isolation lower one's cognitive ability, which paralyzed her ability to make discreet actions. In my country, liver donation from the deceased pretty much never occurs, and only immediate family members can donate their liver. In our case, all those who match the numerous stringent conditions are my brother and I, who are 20 and 22 year-old, respectively. 

Our family relationship is very good, and I have done my best to support her. While I'm eager to spend time and money, I'm being reluctant to give up a half of my liver because of my rather unreasonable fear. Living liver transplant is an extremely safe procedure, at least in my country, and the last 30 years of data show that there is no statistically significant difference between the donor and the average person in terms of QOL, remaining lifespan and liver function. Though there are some minor complications, these are almost always short-term, moderate ones. Halved liver gets regenerated, and the liver size becomes about 98.6% of the original liver size 2 months after the operation. There are various data positive for liver donation, and theoretically, there's no reason not to be a donor.

But I'm still scared. Having seen some close people dying from various diseases recently, I've done my best to maintain my health for last several years by doing nothing fancy but strictly regulating what to eat, how much exercise to do daily and etc. This is partly because of my phobia of death I've mildly suffered from since my early childhood, and I've avoided everything physically risky. Though there are no older than 30 years of the aforementioned data because liver transplant began only 30 years ago, it's evident that the long-term consequence doesn't differ from that of the normal people. So, it's not risky at all. I'm also scared of my stomach opened, my liver cut and having ascites and jaundice for a few weeks after the operation, which sometimes occurs. I admit it's childishly silly to be scared of such transient experiences, especially in comparison to my mother's plight. 

I can beg my brother to do the job, but that's also unreasonable and cruel to do. First of all, it's extremely unfair from his perspective. Why should he do it just because I'm scared? He must be scared, too. Everything he knows about liver transplant is from what I've told him, as I'm better at collecting such information, especially from PubMed papers. Therefore, if I decline to be a donor, even if he agrees to be a donor, he would feel he was forced to do an undesirable job, as that's the only option he has (and I know that he loves my mother more than anyone else does), and because even a person (me) who knows more about the operation isn't willing to have it. 

An advice I'm seeking for is how to deal with this dilemma or the unreasonable fear I have. ",05Dec2017,2

244,"If he would communicate to me like a normal person then I would be mildly okay with this, but he loses his shit every time over really small things.

For example:

When he leaves dirty dishes on the table I would just put it in the sink and clean it up with my stuff.  I just didn't see it as a big deal.

If I forget and leave my stuff on the table a couple times, he goes beserk and rages and acts as if he never does the same. I proceed to tell him I clean up after him often. He proceeds to continue to forget his plate after going berserk. This would've been an non issue has he not made it a big deal and recognized that he and I forget sometimes, but now it feels like it is a big deal and some kind of power struggle for something so petty.

In the past, he was usually the last to get into the car because he takes a long time to fix his hair. I would just wait for him patiently-again not seeing it as a big deal.
Fast forward-I had to use the bathroom and so for the first time I get into the car a minute after him (literally) and he explodes like a volcano and throws a tantrum saying that I'm the reason why we're always late.

Things like that always happen with said person, and I always point out his hypocrisy but he never apologizes for it.  It's almost like he does not realize that that other people work around him, yet if there is one or two times he has to work around someone else he loses his mind and act as if it is the biggest inconvenience in the history of this earth.

I've called it out more times than I can count but his unreasonable and biased judgment of the situation is pissing me off. And afterwards he acts as if nothing happened. Obviously I have to deal with the after matter of his stupid tantrums feeling quite frustrated myself.

So! Over the past 4 months I haven't gotten the last $400. When I texted 'A' asking her about the payment, she said ""next Friday when I get paid"" okay cool. 
Next Friday comes and I ask her if she's gotten around to the payment. ""Sorry next Friday, I had to pay rent"" okay cool.

Sorry, this will be long. 

So I'm a freshman at a big state university (29,000 undergrads). I came here because it has a good reputation and a lot of people really love the school and it has a nice campus, and at the time I didn't know what I wanted to major in specifically and it has good programs in many things. 

I've been here for a while and I really tried to put myself out there and make connections and friends. I tried to befriend my roommate but she's only interested in her high school friends. I lived in a dorm to try to make friends there, but no one talks to each other in the dorm at all and I hardly even know any of the girls' names despite trying. 

I joined two clubs. One, I was in for a while, but it was a big workload with no payoff, and didn't facilitate friendship, so I quit. The other is a club sport and I really enjoy it. There are a few girls in there that I am acquaintances with and I do enjoy this club. 

I attend a church and it's okay. I haven't made any friends there though. 

I just spend a lot of my time feeling sad, lonely, and depressed. I don't really feel homesick necessarily, I just miss being around people who love and care about me. I find myself losing motivation for my schoolwork or even to try to make friends because I feel so sad and that my efforts aren't paying off. 

So I talked to my parents about transferring schools. I figured I would have to stay through the spring semester and then I wanted to move home and commute to a much smaller 4 year school. They said they didn't want me to commute, and I either needed to stay here for another semester and transfer straight into another 4 year school and live there, or come home and go to community college for this spring semester. 

I feel so bad about this because I feel like a failure. I feel like I failed socially and I failed my parents, because I had a big scholarship to that community college but I turned it down to come here and now I'm not happy here. They were all for me coming here though. My parents are afraid I won't be challenged socially at home, I guess. But I don't want to stay here and be miserable. And I will have to transfer or my junior and senior year so eventually I will be challenged socially again and have to live on campus/at an apartment with roommates again. 

I just feel like I need some time at home to regroup and get back on track mentally. 

Any advice?

I worked a bit South at an Outback in the kitchen as a Line Cook. They were kinda desperate so I was like sure when looking for a job. They’re super genuine and caring, at least most.
But that’s a quality that a lot of people in the struggle have. They are understanding, often more patient, and just more “real”. These modern ‘sanctuary’ cities and some of the people are bubbled in.

I’m 18 and just started community college, and near the beginning I was actually kinda trying to pay for it myself even though it’s damn near impossible at this point. CC is still reasonable so I kinda felt the urge to fund it myself.

His argument is obviously valid. I need to focus on my education and should take advantage of not being required to work and go to school.

281,"*Names have been changed.

My family is a complete dramatic shit show. I am 21 and the youngest of eight kids. None of us are full blooded siblings, with the exception of my brother Marshall, who is 29, and my sister Madonna, who is 23. They are the main reason I'm writing you, as well as our sister B, who is (I believe) 35.

My brother Marshall is engaged to a woman, Ariel, who is barely a year older than me. They have a daughter who is two months old.

Before Marshall was dating Ariel, he was seeing a girl named Lara, who is as of writing this, 26 and the mother of a three year old boy. They were absolutely in love, he was going to propose to her, and he fucked that up. I don’t know exactly how he did, seeing as this is all ancient history and they split up at least six years ago and everyone decided that I was “too young” to know. 

He was introduced to Lara by our sister B, as they were all working together and Lara and B were friends, and through B, Madonna was friends with her as well. To this day, they are still friends with Lara, even though Marshall and Lara have not been together for years. This has caused many issues, for a few different reasons, along with the fact that Madonna has not had the chance to meet his daughter because she lives well over an hour away and does not have a car, and he refuses to make the trip to her himself so that they can meet each other.

It should be stated that of Marshall’s sisters, he has to be mad at one of the three of us. It has always been Madonna or B. I have no clue why he’s never mad at me. He should be. I call him a jackass to his face, I don’t bend over backwards to be in his good graces, and I’ll call him out on his shit as I see fit. In spite of all of this, I have always been his favorite sister.

Marshall is paranoid that Ariel will find out that the day of their first date, he was making plans to get back together with Lara. Obviously those plans fell through. Because of this, he has:

Let Ariel believe for the first year of their relationship that Lara was our cousin, and not his ex-girlfriend, after the two met at Madonna’s baby-shower a little over two years ago.

Fed her stories of Lara being a crazy stalker ex that won’t leave him alone, and that our family callously allows around because I guess we’re assholes or something stupid like that.

Said stories have made Ariel (already diagnosed Bipolar) paranoid about Lara to the extent that it amuses me. Why would you be paranoid that she’s going to steal your man when he refuses to see said person, and you’re engaged and have had this man’s child? Never mind the fact that you think someone would even try to steal him from you. The man is not a prize. Thinking he’s worth stealing is like thinking a pebble is a diamond. I guess this is where the phrase “One man’s redneck racist homophobic misogynist trash is another man’s treasure” comes in.

Refused to go to B’s wedding earlier this year because Lara accidentally received an invitation when she was not supposed to be invited. Lara rsvp’d no, and he still refused to go to our sister’s wedding. She has no wedding pictures with him in them and this hurts her a lot because she’s all “family is the most important blah blah blah emotions emotions feelings”. As are most of the women in our family. Me, not so much.

On top of all of this, because of a comment from Lara congratulating Marshall and Ariel on the birth of their daughter, Marshall and Ariel are no longer going to come to our family Christmas gathering. In the group chat for Christmas, Madonna brought up that she knew exactly why they weren’t going and that it was ridiculous.

You see, the comment on Facebook was made SEVEN WEEKS AGO and Ariel apparently just saw it yesterday. In conjunction with that, Lara is staying with Madonna because she was evicted from her apartment and literally had nowhere else to go. Put those things together and this makes Ariel think that everyone hates her, no one wants her around, she isn’t a part of the family, and everyone would prefer if she was replaced by Lara, and that no one wants her to come to family Christmas. Never mind the fact that Madonna is not even coming to family Christmas as the day we are having it is a mandatory work day for the retail store she works in.

My brother also compared Madonna being friends with Lara would be like him being friends with one of Madonna’s exes – specifically the one that is currently on trial for multiple counts of statutory rape (which is even more disgusting when you figure in that he’s about forty right now and was 35 when it happened), and who has served jail time for attempted murder. Who did he attempt to murder? Madonna.

Our brother compared hanging out with his harmless ex to hanging out with one of the most despicable human beings I have had the displeasure to ever meet.

In addition to this, Marshall has stated that Madonna is no longer family, no longer his sister, is not allowed around his daughter, will never meet his daughter ever, if she is around he will not be around, nor will his daughter be around. The words “Restraining Order” were thrown around as well.

It has also been stated that anyone who has Madonna around will be blacklisted from seeing him and his family, essentially forcing the family to choose between the two.

Madonna and I have not had a good history. She abused me as we were growing up. Emotionally, mentally, and physically. I would come home from school and only leave my bedroom to go to the bathroom or to get food, or in the later years, go to work. She abused our mother in much the same way, although she never attempted to kill our mother. She has since grown up and apologized, and has changed drastically since she had her daughter, and as such I have decided not to dwell on the past too much. I have not forgiven her, nor have I forgotten, but I don’t allow it to affect our relationship nowadays because she is a much different person. She knows I hated her with every fiber of my being, has mentioned it to my older nieces (fifteen, fourteen, and almost thirteen) in an effort to stop them from hurting each other. Even with all of this, she still called me last night, asking for help. Knowing that I was much more likely to be unsympathetic to her. Knowing that I could either not answer or tell her to fuck off. Knowing that it was much more likely that I would not care in the slightest. I respect her for this.

I know it is taking me a while to get to my point/question. I have a few. Obviously, the more broad “what do I do?” question that everyone has in dramatic situations. I also have more specific questions that I would like advice for:

I have no interest in being in Marshall and Ariel’s wedding anymore. They’re getting married in September. I’m one of her bridesmaids and I have already spent money on buying my dress, and I’m apparently supposed to start a Facebook event page for the wedding, but I have no interest, no desire, no care to be in their wedding. I have felt like this since I found out that he was refusing to go to B’s wedding (I was a bridesmaid in her wedding as well), and have felt this increasingly through the planning stages for their wedding, as I’m also feeling that Ariel is going to turn into a Bridezilla and I’m not a masochist. The above drama that I’ve listed is the last straw for me. How the hell do I get out of being in this wedding without causing our mother a heart attack?

How do I confront my brother about this? None of this sits right for me. I am not an emotions person, but I would like to continue my life in the good graces of our mother, as I still live with mom and dad because I can’t afford to move out, and I would like to continue being allowed to see my niece. However, I do not care if my brother is upset with me. Unlike my sisters, I don’t worry about whether or not I have the approval of “King Marshall of Turd Mountain.”

*

EDIT: My brother has since then accused my sister of being on drugs, and has stated that the man who tried to kill her should have finished the job. I am more resolved than ever that I do not want to be a part of that wedding. Please give me advice.",05Dec2017,2
282,"okay so a little bit of back story. about two years ago i had this friend, we’ll call her Francine. me and Francine were close in middle school, but fell off when we got into high school. Francine started dating my ex, and became a total bitch to me and has hated me ever since even though i didnt do anything. 
So Francine had this friend, we will call her Sarah. Francine and Sarah were friends before I met Sarah, but they werent super close or anything. 
One year later, I met Sarah and we became best friends really quickly. even still she tells me all of her problems and confides in me about her relationship struggles, etc. 
Over summer, i hung out with Sarah pretty much everyday, and she didnt hang out with Francine at all, so i thought they were not really friends anymore because Francine had this other friend that she was close with. Sarah even told me personal shit about Francine and would talk shit about Francine to me, even if I didnt bring her up.
So me and Sarah are close, but lately she has been hanging out with Francine more because they have classes in school together and Francine is no longer friends with the girl she used to be best friends with. I feel like Francine is trying to get closer with Sarah because she has no friends anymore and maybe even to make me upset. Ive even found out that Francine confides in Sarah and tells her her secrets and stuff, so I feel like maybe Francine and Sarah are closer than Sarah tells me, which bothers me.

Whenever Francine and Sarah hang out , I try not to get upset or angry and I havent talked to Sarah about how i feel about them hanging out because i know it is not fair of me to tell her not to be friends with Francine. But at the same time it bothers me because Sarah, my best friend, hangs out with Francine, and she KNOWS that me and Francine dont like each other. it even bothers me that Sarah talks shit about Francine to me, because i just feel like she is being fake and probably talks shit about me to Francine too.
Today, while Sarah was hanging out with Francine, and she texted me something snarky, so I felt like Francine was influencing her to talk like that to me and I did not appreciate it. It does tick me off that they hang out together and I have started to pull away from my best friend Sarah because I dont want to be vulnerable and have Sarah telling Francine all of my secrets and problems. 

I dont really know what i should do anymore but  I feel like Sarah is kind of fake, but I cannot tell if she is more fake to me or Francine. Its not fair to me or Francine that we are both being roasted behind each others backs, but Sarah has been my support for like a year now and i appreciate her. 

I feel like if I talk to Sarah about it she will get mad and just think that I am being petty because i dont like Francine. I just dont like feeling liek my best friend might be going behind my back and exposing me to someone who dislikes me.

I'm looking for people who have some drive or commitment to “the long-term success of humanity” (peace, prosperity, scientific advancement, galactic expansion, social or spiritual improvement – whatever that means to you, as long as it's an ends and is for everyone's sake), but also for people who are open-minded about what might be the best *means* to get there, and what we need to look out for on the way.

It's pretty easy to find people who want to change the world somehow, but they almost always seem to already “know” how things need to change and what will make that happen. In fact, many get mad when you try to tell them that maybe the way they're going about it is a little counterproductive. I'm really looking for people who are open to (and can be bothered to) talk freely about ways to change the world.

So my question is this: Where do I find people like this? How do I meet them? Are there subreddits where they hang out? Are there organizations they're often found at? Online is a start, but it would also be great if I could find anyone like this irl.

And even if you don't know that, are there subreddits or other places that might have good advice on this? If you were searching for these people, how would you go about it?

302,"For some context. I was a Baseball player in high school and only played 2 years of Football. I decided play football after my first semester of college because I didn't agree with the coaches. I got screwed by the coaches at my junior college but still got a scholarship to a small HBCU (I'm white) division II school. Went from California to North Carolina. I just finished my last season 

Here's my letter 

Dear, 
My name is Spencer ____ and I am a Division II Free Agent Receiver/Return Man. I am in need of an agent to represent me to help me earn a chance to play in the NFL or CFL. I am aware on the surface that I have a lot of things going against me. Coming from a small unsuccessful school and not putting up amazing numbers with a sub-par 40 time. But all Im asking for is for someone believe in me based on my film and what I presented below. I know I am not going to be a draft pick, but I am willing to show that I can play and compete at the next level. 
Stereotypical Small Scrappy Slot Receiver 
•	5’10” 200Lbs
•	Toughness, Quickness, Dependability, and Football IQ
•	5/5 on 4th down targets.
•	Competitive. Playmaker. 
•	Special Teams Coverage, Returner, Snap Holder. 
•	6 drops in 4 years.
•	Strong Ability to catch punts.
•	Played in 3 different offenses. 

In 2013 I decided I left my baseball career to play football. I was a D1 and professional prospect as an outfielder, but I wanted more as an athlete than to be standing in the outfield and be proud of being 3/10 at the plate in college. Only playing my first 2 years of high school football at running back and safety I showed up to the football offices of Orange Coast College in California and told them I wanted to play receiver. They had no intentions of starting me and I did everything I could to earn that. I had to be perfect for 2 years to give anyone a reason not to play me. I maintained the “first on first off the field” mentality for 2 years despite not being given an opportunity and only start in 9 of the 20 games. Even getting a new coaching staff my second year and receive less playing time than the first year. I was moved to an outside receiver role my second year with no experience and earned a stating role in the last three games. 
With little stats, I was able to attain some interest from D-II and D-III schools because my film was strong enough. From my limited plays on the field I was able to put together 5 minutes of strong film because every time I was in I could not afford to fail. After a falling out with a D-III I was without a place to play after 1 year. I then reached out to small D-II in North Carolina, Livingstone College where I received a scholarship to play. Despite having 4 different starting quarterbacks and giving up the most sacks in D-II my first year, and going 0-10 my second year, I was able to put up 77 Catches for 766 yards and 3 touchdowns. Also finishing statistically top 5 in receptions both years. There is no doubt in my mind that I could have put up stronger numbers with better quarterback and offensive line play.
Essentially the position I currently am in is no different than where I have been my whole life. When I see players like Adam Thelein and Trent Taylor, I see people who I have a lot in common with.  I have the character and competitive drive to compete for a roster spot. 4 years ago, I decided to pursue a shot at the NFL, and Im going to pursue that regardless of the outcome. Instead of being a victim of circumstance I will do what I can. And If from what you’ve seen on film and from what I’ve stated above believe in me enough to help put me in a position to have a chance.

311,"**TLDR:** I'm getting a BSME and need a cheaper university in the Midwest; preferably in a cities near some woods/rocks. Tuition budget of 12-15,000/year. **Where should I go to school?**

I received the bill for my quarterly tuition the other day, and it's become apparent that while my family can technically pay it, we need a cheaper option. I'm about to begin my 5th quarter of mechanical engineering, and am set on transferring at this point. This university is just trying to fleece us for every penny we've had. 

The problem is that I'm at a quarter school. I've found that the fair majority of quarter-based schools are private and thus generally expensive. I originally didn't want to go to a state school (I'm in Illinois), because I didn't want to be a small fish in an enormous sea of hopeful engineers. 

At my current school, I have great relationships with my professors and the head of the relevant departments, have gotten letters of recommendation from them easily, and work in a prototyping lab. These benefits don't outweigh the enormous financial burden though. 

I want to try to stay in the Midwest at this point--I'm hoping the Midwest Student Exchange Program can make this more reasonable. Size of the school doesn't concern me. I wanted a small school at the get go because I was worried about how I would do, but after 5 quarters and a 3.44/4.00GPA, I'm not scared of the material. 

I don't know if I should look for another quarter school, or expand the search to a semester based school where I may have to retake certain courses just to get the required credits. 

I attempted to transfer last year, and I kept facing the reality that so many of my courses wouldn't count toward my degree simply because they were quarters instead of semesters. I would have had to have retaken so much and repeated a year. 

My parents work good jobs in rural Illinois, and have generously set aside money for school; however, I cannot in good conscience make them pay this much. They're perfectly willing to draw from retirement, but that is beyond ridiculous. Attending my present university was a ridiculous choice; however, our rate increases and grant removals were never hinted at. We trusted them and got screwed for it. 

This year, we'll end up paying about $30,000/year. Last year it was $20,000. I'm aiming for something no more than $12,500-15,000/year not including living expenses.

After 2 years of going there i have decided that it isn't helping. Im on several different medications and those are fine but for the most part my sessions consist of silence and occasionally talking about my day. Im not suicidal anymore but no further progress has been made. These sessions are not cheap and my dad just lost his job. My parents have done so much for me but now i feel like they are wasting money on therapy. They don't tell me directly but money is clearly tight. My parents used to go out and have fun with friends all the time but it has happened less and less.

After my first semester, I have discovered that I am not enjoying what I am learning, even though I am doing really well in all my classes. On top of that, I see all of my high school friends on social media having the time of their lives at their respective schools and I feel like I'm missing out on the whole college experience. I am also feeling a little lonely as I don't have many friends here, which sucks.

The problem is that my parents are really proud of me (ironic, huh?).

319,"Hello, allow me to set the stage briefly before I get into specifics. I'm an only child (21F) who lost her father almost two years ago, and my mom (53F) is taking a toll on me with her grief. The past year and change has been nothing short of difficult, and I was my mother's rock to lean on in her time of despair. At times, I wonder if I even had time to grieve for myself. 

I am not one who believes in the ""other."" I am not religious. I do not believe my father's ""soul"" is out there. I don't believe in ""signs"" or any of the other stuff meant to comfort those who grieve. My mom, however, does, and she relies very heavily on it, and often shares these ""signs"" with me. 

Her sharing these ""signs"" frustrates me. There are no signs. He's gone. The afterlife is not communicating, it is physically impossible. I debunk her signs as coincidences, and deep down I know she's using them for comfort and closure, but it makes me so frustrated that she believes in it. She's gone as far recently to book an appointment with a medium, which I was not in agreement with, and I voiced it to her. 

What I want advice on is how to channel this frustration. I don't want to keep pushing down her attempts at comfort and I don't want her to stop talking to me about how she feels. That's what I'm there for, we're there for each other. Perhaps I've hit the anger phase of grief, I don't know, but I don't want to keep lashing out on her for her attempts at comfort. I've been working on just nodding and smiling and saying ""that's nice,"" but my mother and I have a strong bond. She knows it's through clenched teeth. 

A significant loss like this is not something you ""get over"" and I in no way expect her to move past this for the rest of her life, but I am really, really growing exhausted of being such a strong lifeline for her. She depends so strongly on me that I feel I have no one to depend on to help me through this. Where's my comfort if I can't find it in these ""signs?"" Maybe my frustration lies in the fact that I'm jealous I can't find an ethereal comfort like her. Maybe I should force myself to believe in something, lol.

We employ a 17 year old as a game programmer (with parental consent), he has a lot of potential. He lives in Kansas, America. I do not (and never have).

His stepfather is a Jehova's Witness and forces him to attend church. He repeatedly does not attend and the punishment is his internet is cut off for 2 days which is directly required for work.

We contacted his stepfather to explain this and the response was that we should treat him as a criminal that is sent to jail when he isn't available for work as a result of not attending church.

My understanding is that emancipation takes longer than it would take for him to turn 18. Is running away from home a viable option until he turns 18?

I looked up the first amendment to the constitution and found it entirely contradicts itself. [Src](http://askthejudge.info/can-my-parents-force-me-to-follow-their-religion/)

&gt;The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees all Americans freedom of religion. This right is not limited to adults. Children and teenagers enjoy the same right, which is balanced with the fundamental rights of parents to raise their children without government interference.

But then it goes on to say that they have no rights whatsoever *other than to what is in their own minds* unless there is a case of (presumably severe) abuse.

When I was 16 I hung out with people who were around 18 or 20 cause I could connect better. I only dated guys who were twice or 3x my age. I dropped out of high school in 10th grade, moved out on my own at the age of 17 and was on my own for 2 years in another state. I had a boyfriend of 3 years who was 4 years older than me, we went through a lot together that matured me faster than those my age.

I learned so many lessons from other people and gained wisdom.

338,"I'll try to keep this somewhat short, but it will still be extremely long. So **huge* thanks to anyone who hopefully manages to bear with me!!

I've been away from home as an au-pair for a little more than 2 months now, but all I want right now is quit and go back home, because it's not what I expected and I just feel like I'm wasting (valuable) time here. Don't get me wrong, the family I'm with is not bad. I've heard many horror stories about families and how badly some au-pairs are treated and feel kind of guilty for thinking about quitting, because I'm not having those problems with my family.

All in all I get along with the kids pretty well (3 boys). They aren't badly behaved in general, but could definitely be more well-behaved and are very demanding, because there are multiple fights between them everyday that I need to break up etc.. There are smaller and bigger issues in daily life that I won't go into detail about, but I just don't really feel valued/appreciated here. Whenever I try to talk to the mom (the dad is sadly not alive anymore, so she's the only one to talk to) about issues, I feel like she doesn't really take me seriously, because she mainly just nodds along and nothing changes. These issues are normally not big ones, but the handling of these small issues is the big issue, as weird as that sounds.

I often feel like I'm just a cheap nanny, because I'm good enough to look after and entertain the children, but fun activities etc. are strictly done when I don't work and I don't think I've ever been asked if I wanted to come along or something like that. I just feel disconnected from family life etc. Maybe I went into this whole thing with wrong expectations as well and had a really romanticized opinion of being an au-pair, but then again I hear other au-pairs talk about how much they like their families and how much they enjoy being there and sadly I just don't feel that way.

Also, adding to this all and basically summing most of it up at the same time, I had a ""falling-out"" with one of the kids yesterday. The mom was gone the entire day to spend the day with her boyfriend/partner and come back after the kids were in bed, so I looked after the kids the entire day. Midway through the day the mom texted me, telling me that one of the boys (9 years old) had learnt today that the father of a good friend of his has terminal cancer and that he might be in a bad mood (completely understandably so), but that I shouldn't mention it and just try to treat him normally, but tell her if something about it came up. And boy, was he ever in a bad mood. He's usually a quiet kid, but sometimes just pretty randomly throws big fits, but never before anything like this. He threw fit after fit, and once he got into that ""zone"", he started taking stuff from tables and violently throwing it on the ground, verbally lashing out at me the entire time and becoming really aggressive towards anyone who came near him, but mainly me. I didn't handle the situation perfectly, the main problem being that at some point I just ""broke"" for a slight moment as well and the f-word (""What the f is wrong with you?"") just slipped out. I immediately felt bad for it, but once said it's obviously too late. I honestly just wasn't prepared for this all. Trying to get him under controll while simultaneously trying to keep up normal routine (it was dinnertime) for the other boys - it was just too much for me.

After all that I had a discussion with the mom, and while she didn't say that directly, I really felt like she gave me the blame for that and thoroughly warned me about swearing and that I should just ignore him if something like that happens because he'll apparently just stop at some point. I didn't handle it perfectly, yes, but me swearing was the smallest of problems when your child has heard news like that, aggressively escalates at home, getting into fights with both me and his brothers, while I was trying to make dinner for the other boys - while you were out having a fun day.

But apart from all that (because I might still be emotional about yesterday and therefore might not see things clearly): I feel like I'm wasting my time here. I decided to do this to have time to make up my mind about my future and just have this experience. By now I have made up my mind about my future and the ""experience"" is disappointingly non-existent. Sure, meeting other au-pairs and speaking a second language daily is good, but I'd much rather be at home and advance in life. Because while I'm here, my private life at home etc. is pretty much on pause (and I'm already 22 as well). I'm going home for christmas and already know that once I'll be back home, I'll want to stay there moreso than ever before, because I'd have to stay here until July of next year, which would be 8 more months from now on/7 more when I come back here.

Before coming here, I quit an apprenticeship because I was really unhappy with it, but now I really feel like quitting again (and have been for a while) and really need some insight from people who can comparably objectively judge if I make sense. I just don't know if this would be the right thing to do, though it's definitely what I'd like to do.

Thank you very much in advance!

To be clear, he has a history of lashing out with violence as a result of not being able to manage his stress. For instance, the other day he got frustrated at something a client did, yelled ""FUCK!"" and punched a case of wine, shattering several bottles. Also, he frequently fixates on medical problems, and tells everyone he's ""going to die soon."" Often, he laughs maniacally for seemingly no reason.

Long story short, he works 7 days a week, 14 hours a day, and is going through a traumatic divorce and a dire medical diagnosis, and the combination of these factors along with his evident inability to handle stress in a healthy way makes me worry that him talking about bringing in a gun was not merely a bad joke.

That being the case, what do you all think is the proper thing to do in such a situation?

349,"I've got a terrible throat infection or virus from one of my friends recently and I'm wondering if there's any ways to ease the damn pain.

It feels like I've swallowed a razor and even swallowing saliva, icecream, water or food hurts like crazy. I don't physically feel like I can even eat proper food due to the pain. It's not only when coughing, just touching the throat or breathing puts me in to a lot of pain.

I try to go to sleep and rest but when I'm laying down and breathing I constantly have the urge to cough phlegm up but nothing comes, just pain. I do keep trying to avoid the coughing but either way the pain still persists with or without doing so.

The main issue I'm having is that this is the second day and from past experience I know it's going to get so much worse come the following days/weeks, it's never been this painful though.

I've tried home remedies like tea, honey and water, soothers(slightly helped but didn't last very long now I'm out lol) and I'm curious to if there's anything to ease the pain or some how take it off my mind for recovery.

I'm also constantly feeling weak and freezing whilst the area I'm in is at rather hot temperature. I'd appreciate any help or suggestions, thank you.",05Dec2017,1

351,"Topic in the title. We haven't talked in threeish years aside from a message sent to the wrong person on skype that lasted all of three messages. The end of our relationship was a garbage fire of catastrophic proportions that I regret deeply. She didn't seem to have any serious problem with me but I don't know if that has changed as time has gone on.

As for the guy, I don't know if he recognizes me and I don't know how much he knows about me. If he hasn't noticed who I am already he'll probably recognize my name soon enough. The only thing I want is to work without any issues. 

Talking to him during work would be incredibly weird would it not? I also don't know how he would react to me. As far as I can see the only way to go forward without involving other people is to either ignore it completely and hope it never becomes a problem or message my ex on facebook and talk to her about it.

I've been stressing out about this and I'm worried it is effecting my performance. I'm a temp to hire and it's a great job that I would really like to keep. Any advice would be appreciated.",05Dec2017,1
352,I recently followed a girl on Instagram and added her on Facebook. We've never spoken but we did go to the same school and made eye contact on occasion. My point is she almost instantly followed back and accepted the friend request. Am I good to throw a hello or would she instantly block me?,05Dec2017,1
353,"I'm in my early 20s and am crushing hard on my physical therapist who's helping me with a chronic foot injury. Since I got injured, my life's been upside down. I haven't had a social life in nearly a year and a half. I used to have a ton of friends, go on dates with many amazing guys, and had a vibrant life.

Now I'm home a lot and the only consistent man I interact with in real life (texts don't count..) is my PT. I have dreams about him, which are most likely caused by the fact that he touches me a lot, which turns me on.
The urge to make a move is ridiculously strong - would it be insane? It seems crazy just writing this out?

I fantasize about closing the door whenever we're alone together and kissing him.
He's 46. Guys always pursue me and make out with me first. I've never felt this strong urge to initiate and it's freaking me out.",05Dec2017,2
355,"Hi, 

I can't forgive my parents for their hateful words and actions. I can't forgive the years of self-hatred that they instilled in me. I can't forgive that they made me feel like suicide was a good option. I can't forgive the fact that I'm scared to trust people and form close bonds. I can't forgive that they made me believe that the way in which I love is intrinsically wrong -- that there's something wrong with me. 

Over the past few months I've become increasingly distant. They've started to worry about me, calling me regularly. I always tell them that I'm busy because I currently have nothing to say to them. I resent them, and I don't know if I'll ever get over this, as much as I want to. 

At first, they didn't know I was gay. I only came out to them earlier this year because I know what they believe(d). I moved out because I was tired of hearing their rants about ""faggots"" and ""queers"", and why it's disgusting; I remember my dad screaming slurs at the TV almost daily, turning it off and going upstairs when any gay people or topic would come up. 

It might seem trite, but years of that really does a number on you. They've apologized, but I can't accept it. I'm trying, but I don't know how. I know I should be the bigger person and accept it and move on, but I just can't. 

Any advice?",05Dec2017,1
