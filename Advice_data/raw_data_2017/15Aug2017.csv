2,"My first job is at a distribution center which is hard labor. I work from 3am until 2pm (anywhere from 8-12 hour shifts) for 3 days. My other job I work as a server at night, my hours are usually 4pm to 11pm for 2 days a week. I don't have trouble with my sleep for my serving job but I find it hard to fall asleep at 7pm to be up at 3am for my distribution job.

4,"Okay, I know this post may make me sound like a bit@h...and in all honestly, I probably am one.  But, I had a question that's been lingering on my mind, that I hope to get some insight into it.

There is someone I know who is incredibly talented, smart, and prolific in her field of work.  I really admire her for her strength and productivity, and I value the work that she produces.  It's quite inspiring.

However, something about her makes me keep my distance instead of getting too close.  

Have you ever met someone who just felt a bit fake?  Like, you just feel they are not showing all of themselves?

This woman, is SO NICE.  So Sweet.  So perfect.  Never angry.  Never shows a frown.  Never says anything 'negative'.  Or, honestly, from the looks of it, thinks anything 'negative' either.

She seems like the type of person that if you showed her a news story, would plug her ears, and start singing :""la la la la la la la la"".  

And, there is something about that that is strange to me.  And, as much as I admire her talents, and enjoy her work, I find anyone who is smiling and looks like they could never have an impure thought to be...fake?

Can someone be so light and fluffy all the time?  I mean, where does all the real stuff go?  You know?

5,"I first met my BF when I was 16 and we were in a relationship for 2 years. Back then he was a quiet guy whose main interests included playing badminton. reading books and cars. He had very few close friends but he was kind and caring to me. We broke up after an argument just before I went to uni but we parted amicably. He got an apprenticeship as a car mechanic and I haven't seen him since. Today, 4 years later I was walking down a street in my hometown and saw a group of guys hanging around outside an off-licence, bantering and swearing. To my surprise I saw my boyfriend was one of them and when he turned round he also recognised me and said 'here's the ex' to his mates, looking in my direction. To my shock his arms were covered in tattoos down to his knuckles and he had a cigarette in his hand too - he didn't smoke when I was with him. Even the choice of words he used was completely different and he no longer spoke respectfully to me as he used to. Due to the expression on my face he could probably tell I was really shocked when I looked at him. We talked for a few minutes before I carried on walking. Was I right to react in this way? How would you react? Have you ever been so shocked how much someone can change? ",15Aug2017,1
6,"So it's somewhat a long story but I'll try to keep it short. A little while ago, before I started dating my gf, this guy and her had sex and got her pregnant. Now we didn't find out she was pregnant until after we started dating a few months in (she didn't know because she's been on birth control and doesn't get periods). Then we figure out she is and get an abortion, easier said than done but we got through it. But now she continues to talk to him because they've been friends for a while. I don't know why but everytime they talk it just brings up memories of the abortion and how much stress we both went to and it seems like she doesn't care. Dumping her is not an option because I truly love her and think I'm going to marry her but this is really the only issue we've had and i can't seem to put it past me. Any advice as to how I should go about this without being like ""you're not allowed to talk to him"". Thanks!",15Aug2017,6
7,"I wrote a lengthy letter meant for my new psychologist. I wrote about this letter a while back. Well, my appointment is next week. I wrote the letter itself a while ago. I no longer remember what I wrote, but I dread even the thought of attempting to read through it again. All I know is that I talked about everything in it. I don't remember the letter word for word (obviously) or the exact details I chose to include. I just know that I talked at least briefly about everything.

Now I'm facing the reality of having to pass this letter on to another person. Do I want people to know all of these sensitive details about me? All of the embarrassing stuff I mentioned? No, I really don't. I'm not sure how I'll be able to go through with it. Should I maybe try to get to know her a little first? Maybe I could just choose one thing to talk about, and then give it to her at the end of the session? 

I have to retake classes I already took last year. I had too much to think about. I couldn't focus on school. I worry this'll happen again. That's kind of why I'm going. I feel perfectly alright (for the most part) at the moment, but I figured it's better to be a little proactive. I kind of know that I have to give it to her, but there's always the option of not giving it. 

Does anyone here have any advice on how to deal with this? I've seen psychologists before, but this time I plan on telling everything. I've kept the worst stuff to myself previously. I have no intentions of doing so this time around. I feel vulnerable though. Especially considering that this will be the first session with her. And I'm supposed to share everything with someone I've just met.

8,"My brother thinks he has depression. I say thinks because he refuses to see a doctor and has never actually been diagnosed. Every day I come home and if he's awake, he'll come running up to my room and tell me something like ""Depression is great!"" or ""My friend almost called suicide watch on me."" 

I work in a kitchen and usually have a full 8 hours of stress, plus an hour drive there and an hour drive back. I try to listen to him and talk but I only end up more irritated and upset.

Okay...so basicaly , I've known this girl for almost a year now , we met in class and since its a particular school programm , we're invited to make lots of friends to work with , wich causes multiple ""crew"" to be created in the same class. (the nerds/the hipps/the yolos...) you get the point. Well me and her ended up in the same ""crew"" and we've bonded slowly troughout the course of the school year.
I would love to say that I'm the only one that bonded with her ,but that's not the case. Another guy from our ""crew"" befriended her so ,fast I couldnt believe my eyes. They became kind of best-friends.

I've asked her during party and shit , if she was attracted to him , but she told me , she would never go out with someone like him. (too immature/to young) He's 3 years ish younger than us , lets call him ""Sake"" for the sake of this post.

There was a party at the end of the year , we took a lot of shots and alcool. She was pretty drunk and so was I. We talked a bit..its kind of blurry. I remember she complained about Sake being to sticky always following her and stuff.I woke up in an hallway sit on a chair (The party was in a school and there are a bunch of table to sit near the dorms.) I locked myself outside the dorm and ended up sleeping there apparently.
In the morning she was the first person to wake up.And she came to sit in front of me. We talked a bit , she couldnt believe I didnt want to knock at the door to get back inside the dorm. 

Then it was summer.
Troughout the course of the summer we saw each other 4ish time I think , we were never alone tho, Always with some friends from school (Ironically enought , she didnt invite Sake at 2 of those hanging-outs , and the 3rd one he couldnt come.

The last one is the thing that is making me doubt everything , and I need advice. It happened 3 nights ago , we went to a bar-ish place , pretty cozzy , nice music , not so loud that we coulnt hear each other. Anyways after a couple of shots she wanted to play truth or dare (wich ended up being , truth or truth..also yes 21 years old and playing TorD , deal with it) 

I'm pretty unlucky usually , and for once I hoped it would play in my favor. First Spin she makes ends up pointing at me. 

She asks me :

""Truth or Dare ? ""

to wich I replied

""Truth""
She asked me if I ever had a girlfriend , I responded no.

My friend spinned the bottle and it ended up on her. Out of no where he asked her if she was a virgin.
She told everyone and we kept playing. She spin the bottle and it ends up on me.

This time she asked me : Have you ever been in love ? I replied yes , she then quickly followed with : ""Are you currently in love ?"" To wich I also replied ""Yes"".

Her friend then spin the bottle and it ended up on her , he asked her , of all the guys from our programm in school wich of them would you be the most likely to be interrested as a boyfriend.

She kind of tought about it for a while , and ended up not giving an answer , she said none of the guys really interessted her.

My friend spin the bottle and ends up on me , he asked me who are you in love with. Before I even start to think about how to formulate my answer , a friend of us tell us we need to leave cause we're gonna miss the last subway. We rush there , get in the subway and I sit near her. 

We arrive at the station , we're outside and we're all sit on a bench waiting for a bus. My friend tell my crush to come with him for a few sec , they exchange a few words , something about that question , something like ""Why would you ask him that ?"" Thats what he told me , he told her at least. They went back to the bench , and she sat next to me , without facing me , looking away as if she was distracted or didnt want to talk to me. My friend asked me again. ""Who is it that you love ?"" I looked up at him and just shook my head in silence , my heart was killing me , she didnt see any of it. The bus arrived and we parted ways.

 I havent really talked to her since , and still feel the pain in my heart , I want to text her..but I dont know what I should say, should I asked her about the questions she asked me?

I need help...big time , this is the most amazing girl I've ever met.

13,"Disclaimer: It's a problem some people would relish, I'm aware. I'm not complaining, simply looking for some input.

I'm a builder. I focus mainly on the finer things like furniture, sculptures, copperwork... that type of thing. I spent 10 years of my life in Nashville, TN, building a business that, towards the end, was fairly lucrative.

2 years ago I moved to New Orleans to be with my wife. She had moved to NOLA to chase her dreams, and it took me 3 years to move down with her. She runs her own business, and it is currently doing fantastically. I, on the other hand, had to start from scratch with a whole new client base, and zero clout in the community. I'm currently doing okay work-wise, but not well enough to continue trying to build full-time. My wife is an angel and covers bills when I don't have enough projects coming through the door.

My wife and I have had a brick and mortar store outside of Nashville for 5 years now. We sell the fruits of both of our labors there, in a retail capacity. We have begun to consider starting a family, and have both decided that New Orleans is not where we want to raise kids. 

With the rate that Nashville is growing, there is a lot of work for someone with my skill-set in the area. I have been landing some jobs there on and off. Since I've left, there have been hundreds of new craftsmen move to town, and my old clients have moved to the new guys because I was no longer available.

Since I am under-employed, and love my wife, I have been looking for gainful employment in New Orleans. I have been offered a smaller than optimal salary to act as Mainatance Supervisor for a large private company. No benefits, but a steady paycheck. I would need to let my fabrication business go if I took this job, as there wouldn't be enough time to pursue that, work, and see my wife.

On the other hand, outside of Nashville, where the store is, I have some very interesting opportunities that are time sensitive. I could go back there and be to work doing what I love straight away, and begin building back my business from there. My wife could not come with me for the foreseeable future.",15Aug2017,1
16,"Sorry for the length of this, I didn't want to leave anything out.


I live on the second floor of a fourplex, and I've never been too happy about my (directly) downstairs neighbor of about 5 months.  She began her time here by making a lot of noise with power drills, hammering, talking extremely loudly, constantly slamming the door and having people coming in and out of the back door all day long.  I have always suspected that she was taking heavy drugs like meth and doing it with the people that came and went.  I also suspect that maybe she has made some major modifications to the apartment which would be grounds for a search by the property management company.  None of this stuff bothered me quite enough to report any of it, however.


2-3 months ago, the visiting and the noise just suddenly stopped.  ""Great,"" I thought, but in the back of my mind I suspected that it could be the calm before the storm.  It seems that I was right.  Around 3 weeks ago, I saw another one of my neighbors packing things into his car.  I asked him what was going on, and he said that he was moving for various reasons, one of which was that the neighbors were ""sketchy.""  I asked why, and he said that there were police around all the time because of them.  Strangely I never noticed this before.

I bid farewell to him and didn't think much more of it until a few days later, on the night before I was headed off for a two-week vacation.  I was walking back up to my room from the basement, as I was down doing laundry and storing recyclables, and on the floor in front of my back door I found a piece of paper on the ground, a sort of letter.  It was addressed to a singular person who was unnamed, and in my mind it had to have been placed there deliberately, as it could not have just floated up the stairs.  The entire front side of the paper was full of very emotionally charged words, including accusations of rape and theft on many levels.  Signed, ""Your Victim.""  On the back was a list spanning the entire page that included all of the material possessions stolen or broken in addition to ""my fucking life.""  I took photos of both sides and dropped the paper in front of her door on my last trip down to the basement.


It's when I was on my way back up that I heard someone skulking around on the second floor outside my door.  Super frightened, I fled the building and stood next to my truck while I called 911.  Within minutes, 4 police officers came and searched my apartment.  They didn't find anyone, and 3 left while I talked to the remaining cop about everything that was going on.  He said that they had investigated my building recently in response to calls from my downstair neighbor, who was saying that she thought someone was creeping around upstairs.  The police, like me, suspect that she is either psychotic or taking drugs or both.

So, I left on my trip for two weeks, and when I came back I went to do some laundry again.  I noticed a new sign on the rear exterior door saying ""Keep this door SHUT and LOCKED at all times!"" (it never is/was)  On another trip from the basement, I noticed that her bedroom door was left fully open.  She was sitting in her bed, looking at me with eyes that made her seem really drugged up.  I asked if I should shut the door for her.  She replied, ""I know that you and Mitch are up there, I can hear you all the time.  And I know that you have cameras all over the place.""  I said that I didn't know anyone named Mitch, and that I've been gone for two weeks.  ""Yeah"" she said, and then nothing.  I noticed that she had black garbage bags covering the entire ceiling.  I went back to my room.


This was just a week ago, and there's been no sign of her since then.  I talked to my property management company on Friday and told one of the managers everything. (I forgot to mention the stuff about suspecting modifications to the apartment, though)  They said that they would contact the neighbor that moved away and ask what happened.  They also sent me a complaint form on my email.  What should I say/do???  I really love my apartment and it's the only thing I have to live for in this shitty town.  I really don't want to run away because of some psycho neighbor.  But I feel super freaked out living here now, especially when going to the basement to do laundry.  I want her the fuck out, please help.

TL/DR: I highly suspect that my neighbor is psychotic/methed out and has torn up the apartment downstairs.  She seems to be convinced that I am colluding with her assailant and that I am spying on her with cameras, please help.",15Aug2017,1

I've done this for so long because we come from horrible parents that made us feel incredibly unloved and didn't give us any proper guidance in life. So I always felt it was my job to hold everything together and be nurturing and loving and don't ask or judge just do because there gonna be there for me.
My friend that I let live with me for 2 years (rent free most of that time) eventually met a gal and pretty much abandoned me altogether. I was kinda bitchy towards home towards the end but DAMN.

But she can't live here. My OTHER sister 3rd sister/hasn't been mention so far) just got kicked out and FORCED her way into my place.

I know the manager is probably doing all she can. She's told them several times to cut it out but they insist that they're doing nothing wrong. They even confronted the manager in her office one day and got pretty aggressive about it (according to her).

She doesn't do her job, ever. She constantly puts it on us. She gets booked 2 or 3 dogs a day to groom, though it's up in the air if they even come in. So on many occasions she only gets one dog a day. She says she can take up to ten dogs but refuses to let us book her more than 4 on a busy day. She has us work on them but then we realized it was iffy especially when all she does is sit and talk or get on her phone. I went to another store for a few days in another town and spoke to them about the issue and at first they were on her side until I mentioned how many dogs she was doing- their groomers do 10 or more dogs a day. Her refusing to take more than 3 or 4, then not doing anything else is just lazy. There are multiple occasions where people have told us that if someone cancels, even if it's last minute, to call them and they'll come immediately.

And finally got scheduled for August 22nd so she was at least on the schedule with the promise that we'd give her a call if something came up sooner. Something has come up sooner. Tomorrow, even, but SL said not to book anything in that time spot because she wants to help the other girl out, despite telling the other girl that the new girl was coming in to help. So. Who knows. I have to nag her to call people who missed their appointment (one she kept saying she would but then ultimately didn't because the dog was old and she was scared it had died and didn't want to have to deal with that), or to decide if she'll take someone on the cancellation list. 

It's made us very frustrated. She also never cleans up after her dogs and her teaching is abysmal at best. She has been opening the last two weeks with the two new girls, leaving me and the other girl on the afternoon shift, which is fine except for the fact that literally none of the morning stuff gets taken care of. The cleaning buckets stay full of dirty cleaning solution and don't get refilled, the leashes and bowls don't get washed off leaving us without any. My coworker and I have been doing our best to make sure the new coworkers know what to do, but I'm sure they forget, especially when their own manager can't remember to teach them to dump the buckets out. 

A lot of the times we've been finding kennels left overnight (from when she closes), that are left dirty, some of which have dried/drying pee on the bottom. 

We've had to write numerous statements about her and apparently she's had quite a few talking to's from upper management, to the point that she's told at least one other coworker that she wants to quit because she feels no one is on her side- but it's because she just won't do her job.

I feel like I should warn the new employees about at least some of our grievances so they're not blindsided, and also so they can keep an eye out for some less than savory behavior we've noticed with dogs when she thinks our backs our turned, but I also feel like that's rude and backstabbing. I would also like to make my way up in the place, and if what I say makes it's way back to her, I feel like she might become a hindrance because she seems to like me and the work I do, though I doubt she could do much because upper management likes me too and I doubt would let her do anything to me especially considering they agree with everything I've told them about her (they're the ones that pushed me to make the statements in the first place).",15Aug2017,3

40,"I've always had trouble conversing with other people. I wouldn't consider it to be social anxiety or introversion, though. I would say it is a bit of shyness, but I think that is just a sympom of a larger problem which is that I have trouble conversing. The thing is that when I find myself conversing with people I never know what to say. Usually I'm not even nervous or anything and I really, really want to continue (or start) the conversation to avoid awkward silences, but I just never know what to say. I will sit there thinking ""Say something. Come on, say something. What should I say?"" then it has already been two minutes and it's awkward. Or I'll only answer with short answer because I don't know what else to add.

I think it stems from when I was a child in school and I was perfectly okay with not talking to people. For instance, if we'd have to wait for the teacher to do something for a few minutes it seems to be natural for everyone else to start talking to each other, but I am perfectly happy just sitting there and thinking to myself. I have no problem doing this, but I think because of doing this I haven't exactly developed conversational skills the way normal people do. 

I don't know if this matters but I'm going to explain my story and why I think I'm this way. When I was in fourth grade I moved and changed schools. Pretty much my earliest memories of school came right after this and I remember not talking to anyone on the bus rides home. In fact i enjoyed looking out the window and just thinking to myself the whole time, but at other times it was more of a problem. I don't remember it clearly but I think one of the first days of middle school I was going to sit alone at lunch when a boy named Nick that I had met playing football invited me to sit with him and his friends. These kids became my friend group throughout middle school. I remember several times during middle school when I was asked why I was so quiet and I never was able to answer why other than that I had nothing to say. I remember towards the end other kids telling me that they noticed I was talking more which didn't mean much to me at the time, but now seems quite interesting to me as I hadn't noticed that at all and it still doesn't seem that way in my memories. Although I did remain friends with that same group of kids throughout middle school I never really interacted with them outside of school like is normal with friends. I went to two of their birthday parties and thought it was amazing and still look back on that fondly. My best friend in school was Nick because we had many classes together and were able to get to know each other over four years. Even though I considered him my best friend, I never hung out with him outside of school. As far as relationships go, there was one girl that I liked (and I'm almost completely certain she liked me too). I actually texted her (which I never did with any of my friends), but only because my older brother and his friends texted her on my phone first. There was one memory that I remember quite well. She asked me out over the phone, but at this time I wasn't a very good texted and took a long time to see texts. I definitely would have said yes but before I say the text she said she was only kidding. Then, and now, I was pretty sure she only said that because she thought I'd say no (which I wouldn't have). Then I really wanted to ask her out but I was always too afraid. I would tell myself that I wasn't afraid of her saying no but of her saying yes because I wouldn't have known how to be in a relationship (although that seems stupid now because we were only in middle school but I didn't see it that way then). At this point I went to high school. I went to a private school in a different town and regretfully I cut all contact with my friends because I never hung out with them outside of school. High school was even worse for me. I haven't even come as close to being in a relationship and didn't have friends like I did in middle school. I've been to see two separate therapist about it because my parents wanted me ""to be able to talk to people."" Neither was very helpful. They didn't seem to make an effort to learn about my past (what I've told in this post) or even how my ""condition"" was. They only seemed to give vague advice like talk to more people or say hello to people. But saying hello isn't the problem, it's carrying on a conversation. To be fair I wasn't very eager to participate in therapy, but I didn't think the were helpful and stopped going. This may have been more info than needed but it was fun and insightful for me to write it all out.

I'm 18 now and I'm going away to college in less than two weeks. I'd like some advice on knowing how to carry on a conversation because I just never have anything to say. I've also notice that when I'm frustrated I have a hard time even communicating simple problems.",15Aug2017,2
41,"Hi reddit--

My brother is planning on eloping with a young, young girl who is absolutely in love with him. She can't see that he is an utter emotionally abusive ass to her, because she is in her early twenties and this is her first relationship.

My brother has said some disgusting things about her-- that he wants a girl with no experiences so that he can shape her into the ideal dutiful wife, that he wants a young girl because she will always feel submissive to him. He makes fun of her in public and barely can make conversation with her. I know that when she realizes one day that she deserves better she will be miserable and trapped. Now my brother is quickly trying to tie it down, in part, I'm thinking, because he wants to ensure she has a hard time leaving if she comes to her senses.

I'm wondering if it is out of line for me to intervene out of interest for her happiness. I'm thinking about trying to find her best friend and brother on facebook to see if they have similar concerns, but I do not want them to contact her and then I'll seem like I'm her enemy, because she sees nothing wrong with the relationship.",15Aug2017,2
43,"I'm going to try and sum this story up as quickly as I can and want to go ahead and thank anyone who reads the whole thing. As a bit of context I am a 17 year old kid living in a small town in the United States. I made this account pretty much to just post this.

Ok flashback to around 2009(may have been earlier idk). I'm a 9 year old and my dads a civil engineer (this will matter soon). Well around this time the economy started going to shit so people stoped building things. Well when people stop building things civil engineers start to become useless. Long story short we lost the house we were living in and moved to a rental in order for my brother and I to stay in the local private school because my parents want me to have a good education rather than the garbage public schools in our area.  This was tough on us as we had started doing very well financially before this occurred. 

Flash-forward to the present day. So it started out as a normal summer break night for my tonight. I'm in several AP classes so I have work to do over my break so I've been doing that all week. Anyways my parents go to some pre-school function (my mom works as a teacher assistant there) and when they return a couple hours later my dad starts figuring out diner for us. Well during this I miss the fact that my mom leaves fairly quickly after they get home. She calls me while I'm eating at the house and sounds like she's been crying. Basically ask me if we were fed then explains that we need to talk, and it's involving my father lying.

It should be noted that my dad works for himself in an office in our house and has been for the past 10-15 years or so now. 

Well leaving a conversation like that gets me pretty nervous as I wait anxiously wait for her to return while my brother and dad are oblivious to the whole thing sitting right next to me.  She gets home and I slowly make my way upstairs. We find someplace quiet and she explains that back when we lost the first house he had lied to her about how we were doing financially and now the exact same thing is going on again.  As she explains this I begin to piece obvious bits of things I noticed this summer that supports this accusation.

Pretty much all summer I've been dying to get a car but I know we are not loaded or anything so I've worked to not badger my parents too much about it. He's given me these different deadlines when he thinks he could get me one but explains that he's just waiting for someone to pay him. Some of these cases being large sums of money at a time. Occasionally he will come home with a check from the post office but never for the large amount he had explained before. This has been going on for several months now and I'm beginning to fear that it's all a bunch of crap.  Not out of fear of not getting a car, but for being able to keep a roof over our heads. 

Back to my mom talking to me. She explains that she checked her Credit Karma which explained that there was some sort of payment that had not been paid on our mortgage (I do not know exactly how this would work but I assume their accounts are somehow linked as try are married). Well today the mail lady came right to the door which I thought was odd but it turned out the letter she brought was straight from our mortgage company explaining that last months payment on the house was not paid, even though my dad had explained to my mother that he had it covered just a couple of days ago.

She explained to me that in he past he has tried to make her seem stupid to herself and my brother and I. She also explained he she can't do this again and is feeling bad for even having to explain this to me.  Before we ended the conversation she said that she just wanted to let he know all this because it seems like it's going to start coming up with him soon. She also added that I need to be careful about what I trust that he says and that's what has begun to make me even more worried about this whole situation. 

To add onto this about twice a year or so they always have some massive fight with each other than I always end up hearing bits and pieces off. This could be a result of the whole trying to make my mom seem dumb thing that I brought up earlier but I can't say for sure. This has gone on for years and it honestly wouldn't surprise me if they separated after my brother and I were out of the house which fucking sucks.

This is the first time she's opened up to any of this to me and I'm not all that sure what going to happen in the next following weeks regarding this. Now I know there are  a tone of people less fortunate than I am, but I'm not an emotional kind of person and this has been eating away at me all night now.

Sitting here writing this I remembered something else my mother told me... we still owe the school I'm going to money which is why I can't see my schedule online right now. The problem with this is about a day or two ago I emailed our schools registrar (a lady I've befriended over the years who has been really nice to me) saying that I thought it was an error and asked if it could be fixed. She never responded and all I can think about now is that she's seen it but knows that I don't know the truth and couldn't respond because of it. I know I'm going nuts;(

Basically what I'm asking is what am I supposed to/can I do moving forward?  I worry about the future way more than any of my friends do and now there's talk of not being able to afford the house we are living in let alone college I have to go to in 2 years (throughout my life I've always wanted to be a surgeon). 

I'm also fearing that when I'm added to this conversation when it comes up that I'll have to pick one of the contradicting sides of weather or not my mom or my dad is lying to me without one of them admitting it. 

Sorry for the rambling in this post but I'm typically a level headed guy but tonight I've just been a freaking mess. Again thanks if you read this far and any advice on how to move forward in this situation would be VERY appreciated. 

Edit: meant to add that my mom said that my dad denied to my mom that the payment on the mortgage was missed and said the letter was some sort of an error. Also my mom explained that this was stirred up in the car when she asked if he had been lying and he could not give her a real answer. Sorry for not adding this to my original post. ",15Aug2017,1
44,"Okay so I'm not sure if anyone in this sub Reddit really knows about the FBI and all that so I'm not sure if this is a long shot of me asking in this particular place. But here's the question, so to qualify for the FBI you need to have a minimum bachelors degree and 3 years of professional work experience. If you get a juris doctorate you only need 2 years of professional work experience. My question is what type of work should I get into for the two years. I'm going to be majoring in psychology if that's important, but I'm curious as to what job I should work at to fill in my 2 years of required work experience. So many questions and thoughts are running through my head because if you only need about 2 years of experience it probably shouldn't be a job that is very difficult to get into since it's only 2 years. But at the same time you want it to be a well qualified job so they know you worked a good job for those 2 years. But I feel like it can't be a job that will take a while to get into. It's hard to explain what I'm thinking. But does anyone know what type of work I should get into that I can do for 2 years that isn't too hard to get into and looks good to the FBI?",15Aug2017,2

On to the main issue. I made a very large number of female friends and noticed that every two weeks, I would really like a different girl.

50,"Good evening Reddit, 

I'm writing to you in need of some insight on a few things happening in my life. Let me quickly start with a little bit about me:

* 25 year old male from Ontario, Canada
* Post-secondary education in Marketing (2 year college program)
* Currently employed full-time as a retail sales manager in telecommunications
* Hobbies/Interests: electronic music, photoshop/adobe, reading, yet to be determined

I've approached a point where I'm starting to become consumed by an obsession over my inadequacies. I feel trapped. 

I've worked the same job for the last three years and have progressed through the ranks via passionate interest in doing a good job. I've hit the glass ceiling as a store manager and since being promoted four months ago, I've been feeling an increasing and overwhelming sense of dread. 

The staff do not respect me, as they have been in the industry longer than me without seeing substantial reward - no doubt a result of their jaded demeanour. I've had no luck in conveying my goals as their manager, they instead insist on pressing me into deftly exercising my authority. 

That has been coupled with an increasingly stacked list of newfound responsibilities passed onto me by upper management. They expect more and more, for the same pay...without improving the essential infrastructure and support required for me to be successful [and] happy.  

All of this has triggered my mind to start clawing at the walls of complacency I've built since starting at this store three years ago. I keep getting caught up in psychological feedback loops of what else I could be doing with my time and what I haven't done with the time I've already spent. 

I look at my friends and *feel* disparity. They went to University, I went to College. They have great jobs, I work at a retail store waiting to be inevitably replaced by the internet. They purchased their first homes, I rent a basement one bedroom apartment. They are planning to get married, I'm dating someone with no high school diploma. They go on vacation every year, I can afford a six hour radius. 

People keep reminding me to stop comparing myself to others and that it is the reason my mind is desperately trying to figure things out...but I don't know what to do. Social media has become so commonplace in my routine that I incessantly reach for my phone like a lit cigarette and reinforce my insecurities. 

""Why did I just waste an hour browsing Reddit and nulling self improvement?""

I want so badly to be able to coax my mind into a golden train of constructive thought that proceeds forward on an unceasing path to greatness, but that isn't how life works. It's so hard all of a sudden. No one prepared me for this. 

Why can't I find something that captures and holds my attention strongly enough to block out distractions? 

A deep part of my being can feel that I'm capable of more. There's always a voice ringing out in the back of my mind, screaming for me to figure it out- but still I haven't, why!? 

I apologize for rambling but I've got so many thoughts running through my mind right now, I kind of got lost in trying to convey them all at once. 


tl;dr: 25 years old, working as a store manager for a retail outlet and constantly worried about falling behind in life (no house, no kids, no financial security, etc.) due to failing at pushing myself toward reaching true potential. NO idea what to do and as a result, self discipline toward long-term goals is suffering.

60,"Today i come to you Reddit for some advice about something that seems so stupid, and so ridiculous that has really messed me up and has given me lot of self confidence issues and has made me missed so many opportunities and as a shy person i feel like maybe i can get some advice to help it.

 

Now, lemme explain my problem a bit more but first let me give a little bit of info on me! im 17 going into my last year of high school and am 6'4 210 pounds. Now, I've had this problem for a bit now but when i was younger it didn't bother me nearly as much as it does now. I basically sweat really fking easy. Ill wake up, go down 4 stairs and back up them and sit down and i can already start to feel myself sweating. Now for people who are saying im out of shape, im not saying im in great shape but im never tired when doing these things, i just sweat. 

 

Another example, I will be playing on my computer and my hands and feet will be freezing. Ice cold, in pretty decent warm weather, like 22 ish Celsius and ill be sweating. SITTING DOWN! WHILE MY HANDS AND FEET ARE ICE! I dont understand. Like today, i went swimming, swam a few laps, played with my nephew, for a good 4 hours, get out of the pool be chilling not that tired and go inside after drying off in pretty cool house and if i get up and do something as simple as switching laundry , boom, i feel myself sweating again. 

 

This has been going on for a pretty long time and its really messed me up during school mostly. I would skip weight training classes because i would sweat a lot working out and i wouldn't even be tired, My face would just be really red and id be sweating but not a bit tired. But being a very shy person and self conscious i would stop going because i couldn't go to other classes with my face being beat red and sweating and being extremely hot but not tired at all! I would literally go into the staff bathroom before i went to my fourth class because my face would be red from my weight training class 2 periods ago and i didn't want the girl i had a crush on see.

 

I've been offered to go to parties, trips, play sports etc etc. And ive just had to say no because i know im gonna start sweating and my face will get red and i will want to crawl into a ball and cry because its weird and gross. I've missed classes , I've literally been so embarrassed from just sitting in class sweating while everyone else is wearing sweaters and look perfectly fine.

 

And i know for the most part im going to be told "" You're 210 you need to lose weight and be more active, you're cardio and stamina is low. And i agree, i am a little chubby in my stomach and face and body, but you need to remember im 6'4 lol it makes sense im at a higher weight but i agree i dont go to the gym or anything like that because again the same reason. And to people who say well thats the point of the gym, thats were self confidence issues and social anxiety comes into play. 

 

Please, if anyone has any advice for me or has dealt with this please please please please give me some help and help me be happy once. Thank you and i appreciate any type of help or advice, Thank you.

 

TLDR: Im just sick and tired of feeling like a fucking weirdo who just sweats for no reason after doing nothing. Im sick and tired of people thinking that im some weird fat kid because my face is red all the time and im sick of sweating for no reason when im not even tired. ",15Aug2017,2
61,"In less than a week, I'm moving for college. My friend is moving a couple days before me, and while we aren't too far apart (2 hour drive) I don't want us to drift apart.

63,"I'm 24 and have had depression for 8 years. I've already done the therapy where I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It stems from seemingly everyones (even my own family) constant manipulations of me, people playing on my fears of being alone and not liked to do what they wanted me to do.

It's happened so much in my life that I began ruminating on it all, now its to a point I can't take criticism without feeling like a general bad person, I've been used and played and hurt so much and deeply.

As of right now, I'm not mentally stable and I can tell, I always have a sad/depressed look on my face, I ruminate from sun up to sun down and most of the time try to keep to myself to prevent more bad stuff from happening to me, but then I just feel lonely and fear being alone for the rest of my life.

I know deep down I'm not a bad person, that people manipulate me because they see I have low self esteem and men try to take advantage of that and laugh at how they got to me.

I wake up most mornings now with a wet pillow because I've been suffering night terrors and cry in my sleep, and tbh I'm scared because recently when these thoughts arise of people and how they hurt me and then justified how it was MY fault and not theirs, I start having evil thoughts.

I wish they would burn in hell. I imagine myself in that position again and see myself killing them and laugh at how funny it would be to see them in pain. Of course seeing that isn't reality so I'm stuck just crying myself to sleep at night.

Long story short, I used to live in Europe until 2 years ago and I go back every summer and visit. Oh man was this summer especially good, I saw all my friends and had the time of my life, I met this one girl who I have such strong feelings for and I really miss it. I didn't even think I was sad at all before the summer, just thought of myself as a loner. Now I see that's not true, it's not at all.

Getting back to the girl I really like, we're still friends which is one thing I'm happy about. However, at the same time I can't tell if I made the biggest mistake of my life not telling her how I feel about her. I was so fucking scared of ruining what we already had I wimped out of telling her what an incredible person she is. Now she's 5000 miles away and I want to tell her, I really do, but I'm still scared and I feel like doing it over messages isn't the best way to go at it. She went on a date with really cool yesterday, she said, she met up with him and she seemed really happy. I keep telling myself that all I want is for her to be happy and it's true, It really is. I just can't help but wish she was happy with me.

Off topic from the girl, but now I'm going to college. I've been here a few days and I'm trying to make friends. I never really put myself out there before, but now I'm really trying and it's not working. It feels hopeless at this point. I'm not even sure if I'm following the right career path. Everyone is telling me how much I'll like it but they don't really know me. I've never told anyone how sad I am and I made this throwaway a while ago.

I'm really lost. I'm really sad. I don't know if I'm ok. I just want things to be better. I've thought about moving back to Europe but it's too late for that, I'd have to go through this whole year before I could even try.

Sorry if everything seems a little incoherent, I'm trying to put this as best I can but I'm struggling. I need to see what people have to say about all of this cause I have nowhere else to go.

70,"So I have gone on a few dates with this guy and hung out with him and some of our shared friends and all of our mutual friends keep wondering when we are going to become official. The thing with this guy is that I'm his first for a lot of things. I was his first date, his first crush, and hopefully more firsts to come. And we are in High School so this boy is very picky and not usually interested in relationships.
Everytime our friends ask if we are official yet, I say no. Noah, our shared friend said that he can tell that this guy doesn't like it when I say we aren't official so today in front of everyone, I asked him if we were official and he started getting a little scared I guess because he was asking people what that meant and laughing. He said it doesn't make sense but my guess is that he didn't want to answer in front of everyone. I won't see him again until a week from now and he doesn't have a phone at the moment so we don't text.
What's the best way to ask him if we are official? Like what's the subtlest cutest way to ask him?

73,"Hey, so I'm super torn on whether or not to accept a job offer and kinda want some insight. Four years ago I moved to Denver, Colorado and knew a handful of people when I went. Between the awesome snowboarding, Red Rocks and all around the best music scene in the country (my #1 hobby), and just meeting the best people and making soooo many of the best friends out there I can without a doubt say the past 4 years of my life living in Colorado are easily the happiest I've ever been and the most fun I have ever had. 

I've recently been working in Los Angeles the past few months and always thought to myself ""they could double or triple my salary in my finance job and I'd turn it down to work at grocery store or ski resort and live paycheck to paycheck in colorado"". Well, the day has come where that has been put to the test. I've been offered an amazing career opportunity right outside of LA that almost seems too good to pass up. Not only will I make a TON more money but the benefit this will have for my resume and career all around are just extremely tremendous. I have a couple friends out this way I know (which was similar to Colorado when I went out there and ended up getting me an awesome crew of like almost 100 people I'll chill with). Wouldn't be my first time leaving everything behind as I hail from the east coast and left most of my friends there for Colorado but it just seems so different to leave there. It's like... I finally found my home and the best place in the country (and I've been all over it) but California isn't a bad runner up and the job opportunity is just that good. Every day I change my mind from saying ""Fuck that I'll never leave Colorado no matter what- my career can take a backseat"" to ""This is what I've worked so hard for my whole life and I just am having a golden opportunity drop in my lap and I'll always regret not taking it if I don't. Plus this is an amazing career advancement"". But the snowboardig... the live music scene... Red Rocks... awesome friends.. and ridiculous concerts/parties every weekend. But then again... this is why I wake up and bust my ass every day, for a job like this.

Finding myself extremely torn on this decision and wondering if people had some input or advice. Whether you've relocated and it was worth it, you regretted it, or never have even thought about it and say to follow your heart/do what is significantly better for your career, I'd love to hear it!

Just want to add I have no problem up and moving for new things. If I move to California it will be the 4th state I've lived in for an extended period of time and the first two places I left I never looked back, even though I left good friends and all my family to move 2,000 miles from home. It's more of leaving what I finally considered was where I want to be my whole life that has me second guessing.",15Aug2017,3

78,"Hello! 

So, I discovered yesterday that my housemates had stopped using the toilet and were now using our buckets to defecate in, and dump around our washing line and garden.

The couple are living in the garage currently, and have been for a few months. 

The guy isn't the problem, he's gone from 5am-7amish and usually uses the bathroom in the morning. The girl stays at home all day, but never comes inside at all (I don't know how she's showering) We have made it clear to them that they are more than welcome to use anything they need inside, and we always leave the laundry door unlocked from them which is just a few steps away from the back garage entrance they use to dump their shit. 

Firstly, I'm confused and absolutely disgusted. We don't have a bad relationship with them at all. Usually we'll have a few drinks on Friday and they're not shy people. 

It's winter here, so I usually use the dryer instead of the washing line and thus never really went out there which is why I've only discovered it now. There are huge shit smears all along the fence, what looks to be dried up shit in various parts around the garden and a pile in the corner. I've taken pictures if anyone wants to see how bad the situation is [(NSFL)](https://imgur.com/gallery/vSZ9k) 

The whole place just absolutely reeks and I'm really concerned about the neighbours. I've never had housemates before and I definitely haven't encountered this situation before and I'm just at loss on how to handle it. Do I ask them to clean it up and move out? Write them a letter? Go and scream at them? My thoughts are all over the place right now so if I've missed anything out or you want more information let me know. 

Advice would be very much appreciated.

96,"Hello Reddit,

I'm not really sure what to do with myself anymore. Maybe you can help.


I'm a 30 year old guy, and I'm basically a ghost. I don't have friends or family. I live alone. I don't currently work.
I'm a disabled veteran. I used to have a job as a Linux admin.

Then about a year ago, I got sold some K2. I ended up in the hospital after a bout of psychosis. I was in a mental hospital for about 10 days. Got fired from my job. Spent 6 months in a homeless shelter.


Then the VA helped me get a reduced rent apartment. With my disability check I can pay rent. That's where I'm at now.
It's been about 6 months I think since I've been here. Kinda lost track of time. I've lost interest in pretty much everything. 
I used to have hobbies like reading, playing games, dating, going to movies, concerts... Basically normal stuff. Now though, I've even stopped playing video games. 
I have them installed... I'll play for like 10 minutes and then get bored. I used to be able to play all day, and enjoy myself. Now I can't even do that.


Nothing really seems to entertain me anymore. I kind of just read reddit all day. I'm so sad all the time. I feel like such a loser. The isolation is so crushing. 


I don't know what I want to do with myself, so I haven't really been doing anything. I went for an interview for a datacenter position a few months ago. It was so embarassing.
I couldn't answer any of their questions. My brain feels so fried. I don't know if I even want to get back into Linux anymore at this point, but I don't really have any other skills.
I'm pretty sure that I qualify for job retraining with the VA, so if I wanted to get into another field or go to school I probably could. I don't know what I want to do though, so I haven't found out if I qualify.


I want to move out of the city I'm in, but I don't know where to go. I think I might like to get a job involving boats. In what capacity though I'm not really sure.

TL;DR: Paralyzed in a dark pit of indecision. Don't know what to do with myself.

first off my mum and i love each other very much and it absolutely kills me to think of her passing. but sometimes when we talk it becomes a total war zone. she is really mean and stubborn and her being a christian does not help her stubbornness one bit. she never admits her mistakes: sometimes she says something and when i tell her about saying whatever it was, she flatout denies it or she tries to counter my point. when she does apologise its always really passive aggressive and that really hurts me. i feel like she really doesnt care about my feelings or hurting me because she can always go to God for forgiveness. worst of all, she feels like she has nothing to lose, when the argument really gets heated, she can say all sorts of crap like, ""im gonna call the cops"" ""i can kill both of us right now"" ""leave this house and dont come back"". i actually left the house once and she immediately told me not to go and gave me all sorts of reasons like ""you have nowhere to go"" ""you have your exams coming up"". even then she didnt even try to apologise or whatever and that really hurt.

ive tried. i dont know if ive tried enough. but its really tiring. i try to be peaceful but when she screams at me i scream back so i suppose im in the wrong too.

Because I don't have a BA, I cannot apply for a Work Visa to continue living in Japan. Up until this point, I was on a student visa, at a Japanese language school.

To remedy this, I tried to apply for a tuition-free degree in Germany. I don't have a lot of money, and I really don't want to be in student loan debt again (I attended two-three years in college, with terrible grades).

I found a good degree course, and I met all the list of requirements... except my high school GPA. They require 3.0. My GPA was 2.987. I applied anyways... and was rejected.

I can only stay in Japan until Oct 5th. My girlfriend does not want to go to America for numerous reasons, and I agree with them. I really want to get my BA so I can live in other nations. And I had my heart set on living in Germany for the next few years.

115,"Just as the title states. I'm about to move from a public school to a private school next month. (Year 11 which is year 10 american) School here starts in Feb and ends in December. Most people at this point have obviously made close friend groups, not mentioning that year 11 isn't a major starting point. I feel like I'm going to be 'out of place' and it'll be awkward trying to fit into a friendship group. Normally making friends isn't too difficult for me, however this huge transition makes it harder. I'll be more around 'rich people' and while I'm not poor, a private school is still costly for my family. Any tips? ",15Aug2017,1

117,"((I know the first comment will be about breaking up but we have been together 4 years and we've come a long way so please))

anyways
boyfriend and I (both in 20s) have been together since 2013. He ended up cheating (not physically, phone sex + skype sex + nudes) on Facebook for about a year until I found out. I found out early 2016, and since then we have both taken down our facebook's and tried to work on restoring our relationship. It's definitely better than it was before, there are no doubts when it comes to love or whether he is serious about me. He wants to get back on Facebook because he says he misses his friends and keeping up with people, I can understand that. He also says he doesn't want to feel like I am isolating him. 

This last comment made me feel kind of guilty, because I honestly wasn't trying to isolate him or anything. But now that he brought up getting back on the social media site, my mind is racing. I don't know what to do. He is a grown man, I would never tell him what he is *allowed* or *not allowed* to do, although I'm glad he discussed it with me first. I'm just scared he will go back to nudes/phone sex. 
I know for a fact he hasn't in over a year and a half, but then again he wasn't on Facebook.

I feel insane, I feel dumb for even having this issue. I don't want to break up with him over this and throwaway everything because I'm insecure, but I need to know what I should do.

Is it worth trusting him and risking the heart ache again? Should I have just walked away from this in the first place?? I feel so guilty, I feel angry at myself, I just need some advice.",15Aug2017,1

119,"Please note, I'm against any sort of actual racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. Of any kind. As you read this, you might be able to understand my situation better.

I have had a friend since middle school who has since become an extremely liberal fellow. They call themselves transgender and non-binary, as well as asexual, panromantic, and speak of how much they want sex reassignment surgery, despite having no dysphoria and even bragging about their breasts. 

I'm transgender, and they try to tell me how I should feel about being trans, and if I disagree, they label me transphobic. If I try to speak about a man I met, they say, ""You mean a person with a penis, right? They might not identify as a man, and not all men have penises, you know!"" They also go on about how gender isn't real, because ""animals don't have gender roles"", as well as how my body dysphoria was fake because ""If you believe you are a gender, you are biologically that gender.""

I've been called a Nazi-sympathizer. I tried to tell them that people shouldn't be arrested just because of their beliefs, and that freedom of speech protected them, wether they disagreed with them or not. I don't agree with Nazis, but unless they have actually hurt somebody or committed an actual crime, I don't believe that they should be arrested.

I made a sincerely joking comment, ""You already ate the whole pizza?"" Which, honestly, I would have made even if they were skinny. They backstabbed me by exposing me as a fatphobic bigot, and sent me hate texts calling me anorexic and saying that if I didn't starve myself, that I would be fat, too. 

In the past when I've tried to avoid them like the plague, they trash talked me to everybody until not a person in the school was willing to speak to me, and I was forced to accept them back into my life, despite their horrible behaviors towards me. 

This is why this is so concerning to me. I'm afraid that if I do break up with being friends with them, that they will go around saying that I'm all of these horrible things that I'm not - Like being transphobic, or a TERF or a Nazi sympathizer. I feel forced into staying in a friendship with them for fear of what they might say.

It's so downright terrible how they talk down to me and tell me that I'm disgusting and uneducated. I know for a fact that they leave hate comments trying to bait Republicans into commiting suicide, because, as they believe, anybody who disagrees with them, even slightly, deserves to be dead. They brag about the hate comments that they leave.

122,"Hi, 

I'm hoping to find someone on here who's been in a similar situation. Any help/advice would be amazing. Also there is no such thing as bad idea so feel free to chip in. 
I've had my iPhone snatched out of my hand by some bikers while walking down the street in London. This is not uncommon and has been happening more and more. I reported it to the police and there was a short investigation. There was no cctv camera on that particular street and the case was quickly closed. Police concluded that it's pretty much impossible to find the criminals. 
I had Find My iPhone app and kept logging in to iCloud for any activity, but the phone remained switched off. A week later I received an email from my iCloud account saying that my phone's name has been changed to Esak's phone. I've checked where it pinged from and manage to figure out more or less where the phone was. At that point it was still in London. I called the police to let them know about my discovery, but again they said they couldn't really do anything about it. The location wasn't accurate enough to go there on my own. Another two weeks passed. Suddenly I received a suspicious SMS from my iCloud with a code, but the rest of the message was in Arabic. So it seemed that someone was trying to change my iCloud password to remove my device from Find My iPhone. Next thing, I get an emails confirming password change. I quickly logged in to iCloud and tried changing the password but he's removed my phone number and replaced it with his own (wtf). I looked it up on my Macbook (one of my safe devices) and I was able to view his phone number! It was an Egyptian mobile. I checked the IP address on the iCloud emails and it turned out it pinged from Cairo (IP 41.129.150.201). After a couple of hours of basic research I managed to track him down on Facebook. Now I'm not sure what to do about it. The guy knows he's got a stolen phone (whether he bought it off someone else or he's the thief). I send him a text to say I know who he is and that I know where he lives etc but he obviously ignored it. 
I don't believe in the idea of purchasing stolen goods. It enrages me that some people think that it's their right to buy something and don't give a damn if it belonged to someone else. I want my phone back but I'm a realist and I know it's going to be impossible. However, I want this guy to pay for it one way or another. I'm going to leave it here and hope that the good people of Reddit (maybe some Egyptians) can help me out. ",15Aug2017,1
123,"Hi, I'm 20, so I had an amazing childhood. I was so close to my family, they were younger so we would go out every weekend with our relatives and come back late at night..

Andrew and Lily had a thing a while ago, and while he wanted to pursue it further, Lily wasn't and isn't interested. The only problem is, he and I have been talking this whole time and now, he is conflicted between me or Lily. 

I am not a virgin and Lily is. Andrew knows this and even commented on it, saying how if his decision between us two girls was based solely on sex, he'd choose me for the experience.

Lily does NOT like Andrew that way at ALL. Him choosing her would hurt me and him, but choosing me wouldn't affect anyone badly. However, I think he might pick her. I have a hunch. 

This hunch is that he only wants me for my body. Andrew too is a virgin, not having had his first kiss yet. Him and I even sent nudes last night and he asked if I was interested in Friends with Benefits.

130,"I am posting on behalf of a friend, who gave me permission to share this since she didn't seem comfortable with posting herself. I have been friends with her a long time and it's been a very long lasting issue that hasn't gotten better. She is 19 years old and lives in a very rural area. We have both graduated and I'm in college. I'm going to call her **K** for this post.

K's parents, especially her mother, are just shitty, irresponsible parents.

* they refuse to help to teach her to drive and help her get her license. she asked why, and her mother said that her younger brothers had priority over her and that she would have to wait until they finished driver's ed and got their own licenses before they would help K, even though they both have a few more years before they can drive.
* they keep telling her to get a job even though she doesn't have any mode of transportation to get to work, and as mentioned before, they aren't willing to help her learn to drive to solve that issue
* i actually have the time and resources and could probably teach her myself (i have my license and my own car), but her mom is super paranoid of strangers and doesn't like her hanging out with friends - the only time I've hung out with K outside of school was during a town festival, while she was with her brothers. On another note K's mom actually hates me specifically because she knows i'm LGBT, and also apparently thinks I do drugs? (I do not)
* her mother almost never punishes K's brothers. i remember a specific instance where one of her brothers called her a bitch and name calling from them is a regular occurrence (i have seen this for myself so I know she isn't not lying about it). they did not get punished. I'm also 90% sure one of them is on the autistic spectrum (i have met him irl and K's mom told K that he has a ""mental disorder"") and he has some pretty bad behavior that K's mother excuses because he's autistic.
* a few years ago in middle school K's mother got physical with her and pushed her into a wall. we actually told the school about this but because she didn't have any evidence there was nothing they could do.
* I also remember another instance where K's mom tried to force K to give her her social security money (which she was saving). When K refused, she actually drove to the SSA office and tried to convince an employee that K was severely mentally disabled and that K couldn't be held responsible for her Social Security income. Obviously that didn't work.
* K's mom has also stated that she won't let her move out unless she gets married to a man. I know she can't actually *force* her to stay since she's legally an adult, but I think it helps paint the picture of how controlling K's mom is.

So yeah, K's at a loss for what to do at this point, and it's pretty clear her mom is beyond reasoning. We have a couple of mutual friends who are willing to let her stay in their apartment, but 1) they need to ask their landlord, and 2) they live about two hours away (If you ask me I feel like that would be her best chance to get out her situation if she could find some transportation, pack up her essentials, and leave quietly when no one's looking lol). But obviously that's not going to happen overnight, if at all. If anyone could help her think of some solutions that would be awesome.",15Aug2017,1
134,"Okay so.. it was my first week of school. I was never at that school before. So I didn't know their tardy procedures or absence procedures because they didn't go over it. I guess they assumed all sophomores should've known? 

Okay the counselor told me the bus was supposed to come at 7:42. Okay so on the first day the bus was extremely late. And my dad told me it was probably because of the traffic and because it was raining extremely hard. Okay. So. 

The next day I waited until 7:50 and the bus never came. Some kids who ride the elementary bus said the bus came. But I was waiting since 7:30? 

So my sister came to pick me up and I walked in a little before the tardy bell or as soon as it wrong 8:15 and she said I was late? 

The first bell is at 8:10.. what was the 8:15 bell for then? Someone told me it was the tardy bell. 

I think she marked me as unexcused. I didn't know the procedures since no one told me anything. Usually at my old school the 1st period teachers never marked is late if we walked in a little bit before the late bell or as soon as it rung. 

They're just now handing out the books for student conduct. You know the annoying booklets you're supposed to get on the first day?

Also I had trouble finding my classes since it was the second day.. so I asked around and asked teachers and they gave me vague and bad directions or didn't know.. but I still made it at 8:14!

137,"I've been with my fiancee for almost 4 years and over the past 6 months I've been having doubts.

She's a great friend and companion, she's always there for me when I need her and I'm there for her too. I just don't love her like I used to. Not to say that I don't love her anymore, I still care about her, I just don't have romantic feelings anymore.

We live together and her life has never been better. Her past relationships were with guys that did nothing and didn't care about her. She's happy as can be, I feel like a jerk because part of me wants to end it.

Her dad's home has no room left for her (his place is like an episode of hoarders) and her mom's home isn't an option because of an abusive stepfather. She doesn't have much options to go somewhere else and she doesn't drive either. So of course I worry what will happen if I end this.

Recently, she was out of work for a few months and would snap at me anytime I asked how the job search was going. That put a lot of strain on the relationship. While she was out of work, I struggled to get us by. Depleting my savings entirely, but never did I fail to pay any of the bills. I would check my account daily and calculate all of my bills, and that has been draining on me.

I've been very stressed about this. I'm losing sleep and it's affecting my work. I just don't know if I should go through with this or not. Other people I talk to tell me that my happiness matters and if my heart's not in it that I should tell her. However, I've always considered my happiness to not be important. My mother asked if I can see myself being married to her and I can't visualize it anymore.

Okay, so I split up with my ex about 4/5 months ago, and everyone goes on about dating apps such as Tinder, OkCupid, and all of the other various dating apps. I thought i'd try out OkCupid.

147,"Ok, so a little background first so you can understand the situation and its severity. 

I live with my mother, step-father, and little brother to help them stay afloat. We are relatively poor and pretty much just scrape by. 

Now my step father has a brother, lets call him Tom. Tom is a loser. Tom called my step father to pick up their mother when she was having a heart attack and bring her to the hospital because Tom thought it was more important to go smoke weed with his buddy. Tom got $250,000 from a lawsuit from an accident and pissed through it in a year buying stupid BS and going to Amsterdam so he could smoke weed openly for fun. Tom buys weed with his money, spends his mothers on BS, then guilt trips people for money for his mothers insulin. When Tom gets called out he gets violent. Tom lost a job for what his employer reported as ""Terroristic Threats towards customers"". Tom invites collage aged homeless kids to live with him than fucks them even though he is almost 50. Tom lost his house because he cant hold down a job because not only is he a selfish self righteous psychopath but also because he is lazy and doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut. Tom blames everyone else and everything else for the problems he creates. Tom is also incredibly stupid. I'm talking aliens on the moon, chemtrails, illuminati, stupid. The kind of guy who harasses sandy hook victims because he one time saw a video on the internet. Tom is a boat anchor. He drags everyone around him down with him and then drowns them.

My step father is a nice guy. He loves his family unconditionally. However he also knows that Tom is a major issue but he doesn't quite get how much of an issue. He just wants his mother to be in a safe place and not living on the streets. He is also a pacifist. He has no balls. He never wants to do what needs to be done.

My step father's mother is at this point just senile. She continues to defend everything Tom does and blames everyone else. She is your typical delusional mother who's kid can do no wrong. She defended him leaving her at a house by her self to die during a major heart attack so he could go smoke weed.

Now my little brother is disabled. He has his own issues, but he is special needs. This is just so you can see how vile the situation I lay out is.

Now to the situation. Tom decided not to pay taxes on his house and was going to lose it. So before actually thinking about his options he sold the house for $25,000 and decided to ask my step father for a place to stay until he gets a place. Of course, since my step father doesnt want anyone out on the streets, he said yes.

Here is the thing. We have a 3 bed room house. This is an additional 4 people. Tom, his Girl friend, which btw is 25 years younger than him and just turned 21 recently, his girlfriends Ex, Tom and my step father's mother, and 5 cats. There isn't enough room beyond a few days. I don't even want them here for one.

What my step father doesn't realize, and Tom tries to hide, is that they CAN'T get an apartment. $20,000 means nothing, even more so when they are going out every day to the Mall, getting tattoos, and just spending spending spending. Tom, his GF and his GF's ex don't have jobs. They can't get jobs because they can't pass a drug test and have no intentions of stopping with the weed. The weed I might add that they have been smoking in our god damned house. In a state I might add that is in the middle of its most draconian crackdown in the last 30 years.

These 3 live off of Tom's mother's SSI which is only $800 a month. Apartments down here start at $800 a month. No one will accept that. Furthermore no one will rent to someone with 5 cats, 4 people, in a studio, which are the ones that start at $800. The cheapest 2 bed room in my area starts at $1,200.

You can see where this is going. They are trying to play off my step fathers kindness to force their way into our house and ruin what we worked hard to make for our selves. They are destroying the house, they don't clean up, they don't help out, they just smoke weed, fuck on the beach, and shop. That's it.

My mother is having severe chest pains and is probably going to end up in the hospital because of the stress. She just wants them out now. My little brother is having panic attacks because there are fights every single night because of Tom's childish moronic behavior and his mother making ridiculous excuses.

Me, my sister, and friends have all tried getting it through to my step father that this cant continue but it's not sinking in. This needs to stop and it needs to stop now. If something isn't done soon the house is either going to get raided or someone is going to end up dead from a heart attack from the stress. I have no doubts about this.

How do I get him out of this house. I need a way to remove Tom, his GF, and her Ex from this equation with out exposing that I had anything to do with it while bypassing my step father. This loser just needs to drown on his own, he wont learn, he never has, and he never will.

He carries his weed in his car. I'm thinking about reporting an anonymous tip when they all go out on one of their sprees and having them put in jail but I feel as if they may come back on me.  It kills me too because I am outspoken against these laws to begin with, but this man is the exact reason why they still exist. 

I don't want to hurt family cohesion here however doing nothing is not an option either.

This may seem manipulative, and I know it definitely is, but put your self in my position and see how you would feel about watching your families life go to ruin because 1 person wants to do right by family members as disgusting as these ones.

He didn't explicitly said that to me but originally both of us mentioned how we are from private schools and then he later made posts about his ""family history"" in that sub. He also made a couple of statements which makes me feel like he is out of my league.


I did enjoy talking to him but after I found out about his background I naturally saw him as ""too different"" and feel shouldn't meet him irl. He also occasionally makes out of touch remarks and he also posted about how he's against people with disorders (including dyslexia) from reproducing. I am dyslexic and I can't help but be upset but I guess he has a point that it kind of sucks for kids to inherit dyslexic from their parents.


Tl;dr: I met a guy online and I enjoyed talking to him. I then found out that he is from a really rich background and have caught him making out of touch remarks. I can't help but feel a bit upset - should I reconsider meeting him irl?",15Aug2017,1

160,"Ok, I would have put it in r/socialanxiety but I need as many answers as possible.
Ok some backstory first: I currently started a course (it's like school but free to prepare for a test similar to the sat - I live in Brazil btw). So on Friday I wanted to ask the teacher something and since I didn't find the courage to ask him during class I decided I should at least do myself the favor and ask him after the class. My heart was racing, I was nervous and impatient since many other students wanted to ask him something too, so I turned around and asked the girl behind me.
The question was about some study material/whatsapp group/email thing idk.. anyways, she told me the guy who just went knew more about it so if I gave her my number, she'd pass it to him and he'd answer my question.
He then told me about it and idk I kind started some conversation??? Idk it's weird and I tried to be as less awkward as possible and ""normal"" (since in person I'm really quiet and idk..not good with approaching people although I tried).
I try to procrastinate my answers because it makes me anxious thinking about what to reply, I either don't have an answer right away or I am afraid to speak my mind.
Fast forward: j thought I'd approach him at school and ask him if he's him..the guy I talked to (since I never talked to him in person and I kinda know who it is but not sure and I think he doesn't know if it's me??) and idk maybe start some conversation at school.
I was happy to maybe have found a friend after a while but now I just feel like it's sooooo stressful. Socializing is stressful. The thought of doing it but not actually doing it.
Idk if I should just leave it as is or face my fear and approach him? But what happens after I approached him??? What if he isn't bothered??? I'm going to embarrass myself or feel like an idiot...I'm making everything way more complicated than it should be ..it could be so easy..
Like j want friends and socialize but at the same time I'd rather be alone, in peace since it tenses me up too much.

161,"Sorry if this is long and rambly. I'm sort of making this post on behalf of my mum but this greatly affects me too. I'm at a place where I really need advice because neither of us know what to do. We've both been unhappy for many years, my mum much longer than myself.

So we're stuck in a situation where my parents live together but have never been happy. My mum(68) has always had to do everything physical; all housework, looking after me, any DIY. My dad(75) retired only a couple of years after they married and he does deal with the financial side of life (though less so nowadays), however in general has lived the past 20 years not having to do any physical work and my mum doing all of it, with no kind of reciprocation (other than paying bills, but I don't think that is enough). This is not a happy, loving marriage. It's all take and no give. My mum has felt no love or support or care from him. My father has neglected her. There is no communication. The few times my mum tries, he is unresponsive or has child-like tantrums. He needs her to look after him and that's all she has ever been to him. He's incapable of doing anything himself (I mean maybe he could if he tried?). I could relate it to my mum having to look after an adult child for the last 25 years. 

My dad's health and physical ability has severely deteriorated over the past few years. It's at the point where he can't do anything, he can barely walk. He doesn't do anything for himself really. Not that he ever did in the first place but it's now simple things like carrying something that have become impossible. And I would say if you were in a healthy, loving relationship then of course you would be there for your partner and help them all you can in their time of need. Watching someone deteriorate is a terrible thing, but considering he has given nothing to their marriage his whole life (other than providing financially), I don't think it's fair that she feels forced to look after a man that has never looked after her. 

He can't see anything from a point of view that isn't his. He has almost no empathy. He's not thankful or appreciative towards my mum or I even though we have to do almost everything for him. He doesn't understand the situation we're in or is simply in denial. He doesn't care how either of us feel or that we are unhappy. It's just a massively toxic environment and always has been. Even as a child I could see it and have had to grow up surrounded by it. But I still have my life ahead of me; at some point I can escape and that makes me able to deal with the current situation for now. But my mum has no future, she has almost no income and never has and she's only getting older from here. 

The obvious answer is to split and my mum and I agree on that. The problem is finance and where we would live. And since my dad can't look after himself, what about him too? Even if we sold the house, neither of my parents would likely have the money to be able to buy property/be in a care home. My mum could rent, but she thinks that it is a waste of money (and it is, but what else can we do?), since she really wants to have inheritance to pass on to myself and her other three sons when she passes on (that's another reason she doesn't want to sell the house). Though I think happiness is more important than money. She would also feel very guilty for leaving my dad because of his inability to look after himself, which I understand, but I still think her happiness (which she has not put first for the whole marriage, in fact her whole life really) is more important. 

I guess I'm just looking for some advice and ideas for both of my parents. I know divorce is messy, I don't want my dad to be left stranded when he's in the position he is, but I also don't think it should be up to my mum to do everything for him. He doesn't have anyone else he can rely on. His other daughter doesn't do much to help and honestly I don't want to either, because he's never been there for me as a father. He's having his hips replaced soon (first surgery is September) which means things will only get worse for my mum. He hasn't asked for her help but he's going to need it and he will expect her to give it, and probably me too. 

I need to live nearby where we currently live because of studies and I'm pretty sure if I had to I could find a place to live without my mum. Things like a cleaner or just extra help have been suggested (we hired two cleaners who were both useless) but as my mum says it's really at the point where she needs to leave now, but doesn't know if it's financially possible. I've told her to spend time sorting out finances, since she doesn't even know her income, and to write out all the possible things she could do at this point. Ultimately it's up to her and she will need to push things if she wants divorce, but I don't think she will because of the uncertainty of her and my future if she does it. 

Anyway, any advice from what to do from here would be much appreciated.

180,"So a new person has moved into my dorm recently. She seems nice but both me and my other dorm mate have some problems with her that we need some advice on how to approach her about.


First, she leaves the lights on all the time. Seriously, every single night and even during the day. At first I thought it was just a bad habit but she soon proved me wrong. Just today I came back from a class on a nice, sunny, morning to find literally ALL the lights on and all the curtains opened as wide as they could be letting in all the sunlight they could, along with the front door being wide open with no one in the apartment, which in turn is its own problem. She’s even been writing passive-aggressive notes on the whiteboard where we have our house rules to “leave the lights on!” literally any time there are light levels less than a slight cloud covering the sun, and to “stop turning the lights off!” at night too. Even the hallway, where the doors to our individuals rooms are situated. This causes problems for us, as both me and my other dorm mate prefer to have the hallway lights off as the light seeps into our rooms at night, and it’s way too bright if we need to get up for any reason. It's not pitch black at night, there's plenty of light if you need it from two glowing exit signs in the hallway and kitchen. Multiple times, I’ve heard her get up in the middle of the night, flick a switch, then go straight back to her room. Seriously, why? When we try to talk to her about it, she just says “it’s too dark” and walks off. We got her to agree to have one of the kitchen lights on and leave the hallway light off at night a few weeks ago, but she’s beginning to ignore that too. As a person who’s grown up in a household that always turns the lights off to save money on electricity and help the environment, it’s getting too much. Especially when she won’t talk to us about it and only communicates through the whiteboard.


Second, ever since me and my other dorm mate started living here with another person, who later moved out just after the problem one moved in (for unrelated reasons), we’ve agreed to clean designated areas of the apartment every weekend. We’ve spoken to her about this as soon as she moved in, however, we have yet to see any sign of work being done. Last week, we cut her out of the cleaning schedule but have not heard anything about it from her. Now me and my other dorm mate have to double up on areas, which takes more time that we could be using to study.


Any advice on how to approach her on these matters would be greatly appreciated. Maybe we're overreacting and I'm the type who prefer to avoid confrontation but these problems are starting to get out of hand, and she’s making me at least feel uncomfortable in my own apartment. Plus, I don't really wanna start wearing sunglasses at night...

190,"Apologies in advance for rambling, i've never had to explain this before, it's somewhat difficult for me.

Ever since I can remember, i've been a blank slate. What I mean by that, is that I lack the general emotional attachment to other people that well functioning humans should probably feel. I love my family, but from a purely analytical perspective; I understand the concept of the nuclear family and the relation to myself, but that actual feeling of love and sanctuary is a gaping void to me. I wasn't abused, my parents did everything they could for me, and I appreciate that for what it is materially...but nothing beyond that. Put a pin in that.

Being a blank slate, I had to learn every aspect of social interaction and adjust it into terms that I can understand. I get a lot of ""You look mad"" because I don't necessarily know when to smile or laugh at jokes. I miss out on relationships because despite having a natural charisma (seriously guys, make women laugh), I don't pick up on cues to proceed unless they're mood killingly overt. And even then, i'm bound to clarify the intentions to the point of explicit intent in triplicate. This inability to ""fit in"" to even the basest standards of emotional health has led me to be a loner, it just kind of works out that way. I feel like an alien, and this inability to relate plagues me in my deepest thoughts. 

So a couple of years ago, I set out to resolve this existential crisis by ""jumping"" my emotions to a state of normalcy. It's instinct, give it enough stress and it'll just ""start working"" y'know? I tried love; found a girlfriend I thought I really liked. I guess I wasn't trying hard enough because I blew the relationship up when she had no amswer for my issues. It was unfair to her, but so was dating a robot. I tried anger. People walk over me a lot, so I decided to go over the top. Imagine how fucking stupid I felt arguing with someone over trivialities when it didn't make me feel any better. I tried sad movies, happy activities, anything that would make me FEEL something. 

Then my brother died. I didn't cry at his funeral, but I felt that pain. Pain I could understand. As intangible as emotions were to me, pain was real, it was visceral. I became obsessed with death, because death was the only thing that fostered that pain within me. I was an ogrish loser back in the day because of the shock, but here I was on Watchpeopledie as a participant instead of just a morbid spectator. Beheadings, disembowelment, gunshots, this was my home. Pain forces you to acknowledge it, and I was at its altar prostrate. 

Well, when your only ""meaningful"" interactions with people are seeing them brutally murdered, eventually you begin to disconnect. I became a vessel for pain instead of a human being. If it sounds suicidal, it was to an extent. I wanted to die, but not for any particular reason. It wasn't a feeling or event, it just seemed like the right thing to do. I was little more than a meat bag with a maladjusted brain, what the hell was I supposed to think?

Then, before doing it, I felt a fleeting moment of relief. Subtle, but definitely there. Maybe i'm just an asshole for feeling relief in nearly offing myself, but that little twinge stopped me. I don't quite know what sparked that little moment of clarity, but i'm here because of it, so it can't be all bad. 

Unfortunately, that leaves me with the underlying issue; that being in my brain for that amount of time totally skewed my perceptions of society and frankly, salted the proverbial earth with regard to personal attachment. I can definitely sell it, but even my logical underpinnings for selling it are on wobbly legs. I just don't see the value in people. 

So reddit, all my ramblings being done, how can I work to humanize people again? I successfully indoctrinated myself into a nihilist cult of my own creation, but I lack the ability to deprogram myself. My sense of self being is shot, i'm totally alienated from society, and at this rate i'll almost assuredly die alone. 

But in an ironic funny kind of way, despite my own failings regarding taking my life into my own hands, I feel like a blank slate again.",15Aug2017,1
191,"So a while back I signed up for a 10-day Vipassana course.   
 I just received an email about my acceptance, and it begins in a little over a week.

This is incredible news for me. Meditation has been my escape rope for a lot of issues in my life.   
This opportunity is a blessing. 

This also means that there are some important decisions that I'm going to need to make in the next couple of days before I confirm or deny my acceptance...

I've been in an internship for most of the Summer (May - Aug), and I'll be getting out within the week. 

My girlfriend, despite spending most of the week with me at my apartment, hasn't spent much time with me this summer (Our work is far away).

We've been together for 5 years, and have worked to keep our relationship together despite being long-distance through college for the last 2. 

Recently, we've decided that we're going to try and work something akin to an open relationship this year. 
   
We've only been in a relationship with each other, 
and we both have a lot of anxieties surrounding not developing properly through college (both with experiencing relationships with others and pursuing academics wholeheartedly). 

Our colleges are quite far apart (~3 hours), so it's difficult to see each other as often as we would like to. 

She has a job that she works a couple of hours a week at, and she gave her two weeks notice in a little bit ago so that we could have some sort of trip together before we both go back to school. 

I've yet to tell her about my acceptance to this retreat. If I went, we wouldn't have any actual time to spend with each other before we effectively part ways back at college. 

This is difficult for me to talk about, especially since our motivations towards this partial separation are due to a lot of fear and confusion. I can see myself spending the rest of my life with this person, yet I know that we can't continue with the way things currently are. 

Part of the reason for me needing anxiety preventing tools is due to the stress that comes with the separation and effort it takes to keep the relationship stable when we can only talk over the phone and face time to communicate for a majority of the year. 

It is also difficult knowing that this retreat experience would be immensely beneficial for me when i've had mental health issues in the past and that if I denied, I'd be missing out only to hold together a relationship that will be further apart during the upcoming year.

This conflict speaks to a lot of internal turmoil that I've had over the past several months, and I'd love if someone could help me get some insight about it.   
(If this isn't the right subreddit, I'd love it if someone could point me to a better one)

tl;dr I got into a Vipassana retreat and i'm not sure if I should go, or spend the remaining time in my summer with my girlfriend of 5 years before we head back to college (where we won't devote ourselves to our relationship as much as we have in the past).

193,"I'm 29/f. Boss is 45/m. Boss knows I want promotion. 

The promotion is for my bosses level, which is ok as there are multiple people in the building doing his job, so I would not be a threat to him in this way. 

Myself and my colleague, who is 45/m are actively being supported for promotion by my boss, so he says. We both recently went for promotion, there was one spot and we both failed. I got 63/100 and the pass mark was 70. I have no idea how much he failed by, I know he didn't come second, and I have a feeling that if he had have just missed it, then he would have mentioned it. I personally feel that the person who got the job, deserved the job.

Boss was very unhappy at the outcome, they both totally kicked off about it and said it was unfair because my colleague had been a manager in his old job. I personally thought my score was indicative of my performance and saw no reason to complain, just work on myself and try again another time. 

Boss then told me that he thought I wasn't ready for the job, that he thought I would be next time, but that my colleague was and he had been really unfairly treated. 

Me and my colleague joined the organisation on exactly the same day, and we even got promoted on the same day, two years ago. I can't help thinking that my boss treats him favourably because he is an older male and because they get on well. He has worked with him on the team a little longer than I have. My colleague is also more confident than me, and likes to give advice when it isn't asked for! 

My boss has gone away for three weeks, and has asked my colleague to deputise. This isn't anything massively important, just attending meetings and answering some emails on his behalf, but every little helps. He has never asked me to do this. I'm considering approaching my boss on his return and asking for this role the next time he is on leave. 

In the meantime, is there anything else I can do to improve my chances? I already work pretty hard, and I've just turned a major job around for my boss in very quick time, which he will find out about when he gets back.

195,"TL;DR: I am, against my conscious will and desire, subconsciously lazy to the point of adverse effects on the most important aspects of my life.  **What should I do?**

In my own time, I have three categories of things to do:

* **Things I need to do.**  This category encompasses tasks involving financial issues, self-care (mental and physical), home maintenance, commitments to others, pet care, eating, and more.
* **Things I want to do.**  This category has tasks that aren't strictly necessary, but would improve the quality of my mental or physical health and/or simply be enjoyable.  E.g. developing gifts for friends and family, organizing media, chores, designing living spaces, unpacking, writing, preparing for games w/friends, and more.
* **Things I enjoy? doing.**  Sprawling out on the couch or bed with my SO, mindlessly gorging on video media, endlessly talking, catching up on internet happenings, and generally screwing around.

Here's the rub: I need and want to accomplish **1** and **2** (respectively), but instead I find myself only doing **3** day after day after day…  I can't help myself; it's not a conscious decision.

I don't know whether it's a broken self-rewards system where I treat myself with the easiest feel-good things as a prize for working all day, or whether it's something else entirely, but I simply never find myself doing the things I need or truly want to do in my own time.  For example:

* I'm trying to lose a not-insubstantial amount of weight, but the moment somebody mentioned the idea of having Chinese food last night, I forgot my eating plans entirely and overindulged to the tune of 1546 kilocalories (calculated now, while at work).
* My cat, whose loss would be literally and absolutely devastating to me, needs subcutaneous fluids every few days, and yet despite reminders and to-dos and all that technology can offer, it usually takes an inquiry from my SO to prompt me into action.

These are not isolated or unique; unless it's as easy as the prospect of sustained immobility on a comfortable surface with a screen afore my eyes, it gets forgotten entirely—not ignored, for that would require awareness of the task or need or desire in the first place!  The next tomorrow, upon the light of a new day, I remember what I did, I remember what I needed/wanted to do, I weigh them against each other, and find that my free time came up severely wanting.  It was effectively a waste, and aside from having consumed some media that I may or may not have particularly wanted, I accomplished nothing.  Yet again.

Lastly, it seems salient to mention that I have a diagnosed and duly medicated mental disorder.  However, this for which I'm asking advice has been a companion long before my craziness.  Make of this what you will.

196,"**TL;DR:** I'm no longer productive *at all* because I'm not an early bird, always tired, and my 9–5 is making me miserable.

***

I noticed that I'm always the most driven at night, most creative, and most productive. It's annoying hearing people tell me I just need to train myself, and that I need to just lie in bed in the dark, put on some white noise, and close my eyes. Even if I do get a full night's sleep, I'm still tired in the morning and my drive is nonexistent. 

I went to school for 12+ years straight and have always struggled getting up early. Although I graduated high school on time, I was almost always 2-4 periods late. During summer and winter, I could wake up around 3-4pm highly motivated, bask in my productive hobbies until 6-7am, sleep, and repeat. When I started college, I thought that the best option would be taking late afternoon and evening classes. So I would wake up around 11am/12pm instead of 6/7am. It helped because my drive was good enough after class because I could stay up late, but I was still always tired.

I've tried *everything* and even went to my doctor about it, but I'm extremely healthy and take multivitamins with an enormous dose of vitamin B12.

I know most jobs are not graveyard, so I thought I'd suck it up and take a ""9–5,"" especially considering the financial crisis I'm in. For the past 7 or 8 months, I've been getting up around 7am because my previous job, though remote, required certain tasks to be done in the morning. 

It's had a serious toll on me. I haven't done anything productive since, make so many mistakes in writing, and I'm getting moody, lazy, and easily stressed. At my new job, I fight the urge to go to sleep and try so hard to focus. After work, I either want to sleep or play a video game to lift my spirits and take off some stress. It doesn't help that I have to deal with social interaction nearly 24/7.

I went from exercising, managing a blog, going to school (recently kicked out for grades and lack of progress. Don't know why, but I could never fucking pass my tests despite studying, doing homework, and actively participating in class), web designing, drawing, and teaching myself other computer-related skills and subjects to waking up at 7am, being miserable at work from 8:30am to 5:30pm, and playing video games or sleeping in my free time. 

I've done so much when I had the ability to be awake throughout the night, and now I do absolutely nothing. It makes me want to quit my job and either kill myself or just leave this state to go and do fuck all.

This is only my third week working here, and I'm already giving up. I thought I could do this for ~6 months while I work on building my development portfolio and whatnot, but I don't even have the motivation to do it anymore. I honestly could've been done with my website by now, but it's nowhere near complete.",15Aug2017,3
197,"So I'm 25 and I feel like I'm having a midlife crisis..

A lot of negative, but here is everything. 

I currently have a full time job as an apprentice as an aircraft mechanic . I've been in this field for a year, and I went to college for 2 years. 1 year I even moved to a city 4 hours away for the year. Before this I did 1 year for a program in architecture.. Did summer school too, but second year I came to school and decided I didn't like it. I still kinda regret doing leaving that course, because it was kinda fun, but I was lost that first week because I didn't remember enough from first year to know what I was doing. So I guess I could say I dropped out because of lack of knowledge first year..

I took a year off and did aircraft maintenance engineering in college, did the 2 years, and was lucky enough to land a job right out of college, despite again.. Not paying much attention... And on top of that, aviation jobs in my city are unheard of out of college. Anyways I'm over a year in now, and I've learned a lot. 

My friend and coworker said something to me on Friday and I kind of got my gears spinning. He said in this industry, you really gotta love aircraft. And I don't. 

Maybe it's this and a lot of other things, but I really wanna jump ship. 

Another friend told me that sometimes it's just a quality of life thing when you're unsure because a lot of other stuff isn't great. And that's true. 
I'm lonely, apart from some friends, some online friends but still close, and I live at home. Last November, my dog passed, who I had since I was 10, her sister died in year one of my second program. My grandmother died a month before and, now I only have my parents. 

I'm lonely and want a dog more than anything, but I live at home and don't pay rent so I am not allowed. 

It could be the extremely toxic work environment I work in having an incredibly narcissistic boss who will never find good in what I do, or anyone. 

Also haven't been getting along with my parents recently, and that's partly my fault. 

I want to jump ship, but I don't wanna do what I always did, and just jump too fast into something I didn't think through, and I don't wanna disappoint my parents, even though I know in the end, they have nothing but love and support for me. Also don't want to get into more debt, since its hard to work and go to go to school. 


I have been looking at courses, and accounting intrigues me. It has great job outlook in my city and I'm really good with math. 


My mom keeps saying I need to get off the video games... I come from work and sit there till I go to bed, but honestly, it's just an escape, cause its the only thing that makes me happy. 


Anyways, not sure what I need or want to do. 





Just need a change.

The problem is that I'm having trouble applying what I'm going over to new examples. ",15Aug2017,1
201,"Let me preface this all by acknowledging that, yes, I need therapy. Unfortunately, therapy isn't an accessible option right now. I live in an area with limited mental health providers and am currently on a waiting list to start therapy.

That said, where to begin?

[1] The past 5 or so years of my life have been a normal routine of psychological and sexual abuse. The perpetrator was my mother's husband. I was the primary target of the sexual abuse, but myself, my sibling, and my mother were all victims in our own ways. A month ago, this abuse has come into public light after the rape of my sibling by my mother's husband.

I know I have PTSD from this. But, the symptoms of the PTSD are to such a degree that I have fully dissociated from the current events and the past five years; it is no more emotional for me to talk about than discussing the weather. Is this healthy? No. But I'm perfectly functional. I'm not a risk of harm to myself or anyone else. I'm not engaging in risky behaviors.

However.

[2] My work is concerned about my mental state. I'm avoiding details for privacy's sake, but it was pretty unavoidable for my work to find out the exact nature of what is going on in my personal life. Additionally, I am good friends with some of my co-workers and my boss; they were bound to find out due to that alone. I understand, and even appreciate their concern, but am frustrated by it nonetheless.

My boss is worried that everything going on has impacted my ability to perform my duties. This is because, apparently, I look like a zombie in between clients - which I probably do. I've struggled with insomnia since high school and haven't found a medication yet that fully addresses the symptoms; the medication I was on previously ran out w/o refill authorization, and I'm waiting to get back in. 

But I'm not sleeping at work. I'm ""on"" and perky/engaging with my clients. My memory of work-related information is not negatively impacted. I'm just always tired and apparently look it when I'm not ""on."" Yes, I have a problem with micro sleeping, but the episodes predominantly occur at home or when driving. I do not drive for my job. There have not been any complaints by clients.

I also am actually more productive now than before the abuse came out. I'm no longer taking work home to avoid interactions; everything is done in a timely and accurate manner in-office. I'm also volunteering to do additional work if I find myself finished early with my own, mainly because I hate being idle. It's just paperwork, anyway, nothing strenuous.

But, my work worries nonetheless. And, while I appreciate the concern, I honestly feel like work is the only area in my life right now that isn't falling apart. I don't want to take time off (and have only missed one day since this all happened to deal with some legal issues). I just want to do my job.

*[Advice Query 1] How do I reassure my boss and coworkers that while I may not be ""fine,"" I'm perfectly functional and able to perform my duties?*

[3] Like I said, I am good friends with my boss and coworkers, and their concern is not strictly professional. As has been pointed out to me, I have withdrawn from some of my primary supports (which is true) and have not been tending to my own emotional needs (which is also true). 

The thing is, recent events have likely worsened my persistent (since middle school) depression. I know this. But I take medication that deals with most of the symptoms. I just haven't felt especially sociable the past month - which isn't even necessarily because of current events. I go through episodes of extreme social isolation every few years. That doesn't make it right, but I know that I'll get my head out of my ass eventually.

And, on the issue of my own emotional needs, I honestly don't know what I need emotionally. Like I said earlier, I've dissociated from everything to such a degree that I'm wholly apathetic. Eventually that will change, but for now the apathy is really working for me. I'm able to work (which is necessary, as I now pay 50% of the bills) and take care of my family; right now, that's all that matters to me.

But...

[4] Even this seems to be an issue for my support system. I have, as a result of recent events, become the *de facto* ""man of the house."" Which isn't anything new to me, to be honest, even if it isn't necessarily healthy (and is probably why I sometimes get a bit gender confused). And, yes, sometimes I have to ""parent"" my mother - which is also nothing new, even if it was less obvious to my friends before this all happened.

And, honestly, I'm okay with that. Maybe I shouldn't be, and when I do start therapy it will probably come up a lot, but I genuinely do feel fine (or, at least, apathetic) with having an identity largely centered on my functional role in the family even at my own expense. But, as was pointed out to me, this means there isn't much of a ""me"" that exists outside of my family or work role. 

*[Advice Query 2] This is where I get stuck because I don't know what, if anything, I should be doing about all of this: the PTSD, my (nonexistent) emotional needs, everything. So, if I was your friend, or someone you knew, what would you advise me to do? Where should I even start in tackling this mess?*",15Aug2017,1
202,"I'm looking for advice. Her background isn't particularly relevant, I don't think, but here it is. Maybe it would help someone give me better advice?

Topanga (I've been watching Boy Meets World.) is F23 and we actually went to the same elementary school. I never met her there- but her older sister- Nebula (I'm gonna keep the continuity, if you don't mind)- was actually in my first grade class. I didn't remember her very well because I completed first and second grade in the same year. One day she showed me a class picture with both of us in it though, which was an awesome surprise! This adds to why I never met Topanga here since that put her two grades below me, and I left this school after the fifth. Nebula actually married my godbrother earlier this year, and it was from hanging out with them that I met Topanga in the first place. I've only been dating her a few months now.

I'm (M24) in the military, and I routinely deploy and/or travel. I fully intend on staying in the military for a long time, 10+ years minimum, and I don't want to start a family while I'm still in knowing that a large chunk of my time would be spent away from them. I don't want to be flexible about this. I've seen exactly three relationships in five years work out where one of my guys was deployed a lot and came back to a loving wife who understands what he needs to do. Topanga has demonstrated these traits, but I'm on the fence because she's a single mom. She has an admittedly *kind-of* probably-cute-in-the-right-light-or-to-a-girl 3 (4?) year old boy. Bio father isn't involved, and she doesn't take child support either, claiming that he'll want partial custody and she doesn't want him to influence the kid with his lifestyle. Or something. Totally makes sense, I never really bothered or asked much about it because those are simply her wishes. This is background information for you guys, but let me know if there's something I need to clarify for you! All these little tie-ins to my past and my family give me those ""what are the odds?"" and ""maybe this is supposed to be"" feels, but I'm hesitating. Her son is pretty well behaved with me. Naturally I don't take any shit, so he doesn't give me any. Topanga has quite a few sisters and they all want to spoil him, so he acts like a brat around them. Shouting for attention, throwing things around, etc. When he's not around we mesh very well together. We communicate openly, share our dreams and aspirations, encourage each others' growth, and generally enjoy each others' company all the time. I'm very affectionate and physical (typical guy I guess), and thankfully she is too. I hadn't been with someone that could be as affectionate as I could be, and it's been great to just hold her waist, her hands, stroke her hair absently, and kiss her everywhere. When we were first seeing each other she noticed that I acted much less affectionate with her son than I did with her, I mean... of course? Normally it should be a red flag to meet someone's kid within a few weeks of meeting them, but in those days when I did see him she simply didn't have access to a babysitter. I wasn't going to stop seeing her just because she'd have to bring him along too, I thought that'd be totally fine with me. Now I'm not so sure. I get that he's just a child, I just... Now that I've pictured a possible future with her, I've thought about what happens when I *do* want to start a family. If I'm being honest, I'm crazy about the idea of starting a family of my own. I can't wait to be a father! My issue is that I know myself well enough to know that I'm going to treat my future biological child much more warmly than I will him, even if at that point he'd think me more his father than his biological father. It's completely unfair, and I've voiced this concern with Topanga, full disclosure. I suppose at that point he'd be around 8 or 9, but a little person that I know I brought into the world does something to me that caring for him simply doesn't, and I don't want to put him through that. Fatherhood doesn't intimidate me, but being a stepfather just doesn't seem like something I can handle. Apart from what I do for a living, I have a strong feeling of wanting to see the world. I don't want to live my life in the same sliver of the world I was born in. Starting a family usually means giving those things up, and that's also why I want to wait- I want to *live* before I think about tackling the adventure that is starting a family. Topanga seems to be all about it, travelling the world as a family unit and teaching the kids languages as we go... It all sounds great to me, but I just don't know. It seems silly when I write it out, but I don't like the reminder that she made this little person with someone else. Not intentionally, but she kept him (**That's another can of worms entirely. Abortion is absolutely a woman's right and I most certainly don't wish he was dead now that he's here. Not *at all* what I was getting at.**) She hopes that with time I can at least learn to accept him, I'd never love him as much or more than she does, and the only thing I haven't told her was that I don't think I'm going to stay with her long enough to know if I'll be able to accept him that way. 

She thought I believed she was looking for a father to her child, but that's just not it. I know if I stay with her it'll be for many years, long enough to consider having a child with her. If I stay with her even 5 years I would have been in her son's life longer than he's been alive without a father in his life, I would just *be* a father to him, whether she was looking for that or not. I feel as though I'm all over the place by typing this out, but I felt like I needed to get that out. I know the best course of action is just to get out, knowing I don't want to be a stepfather, especially at such an early stage in my life/career. But I'm here because I'm at least willing to listen to advice on things I could try to make this easier on all of us, she's a catch and I don't want to fuck up something otherwise good because of a few hangups on my part.",15Aug2017,1

""Why does the world work like this? What am I supposed to do with my life? How do I get a job that isn't totally soul-crushing?""

I dropped out of college and kind of just randomly fell into a career in software engineering and I'm fine with my life. I have absolutely zero idea how to the job market works -- absolutely zero idea how people go about ""getting a job"" -- absolutely zero idea about anything -- and I feel like my heart is being pulled out my chest when she cries about this, because I know I just have zero advice for her.

Does anyone here have a clue how the world works? Did anyone have parents that actually transmitted actionable life skills? Neither of us have a clue.

The situation now: She had been working a ridiculous job at some beauty startup in Los Angeles. 70-80 hour work weeks, with a just-barely-meh salary. The stress eventually drove her to the edge, and we almost had to have her hospitalized (5150). We've got her in touch with a therapist now and I think she's going to recover, but the dark cloud still hangs over her: What does she do when she gets out? Her resume is ""meh"" and she's in a lot of debt already.

Any advice for her is so, so appreciated.

M, 20. I recently completed my graduation and moved away from my hometown and my parents to a different city for further education. Here I'm preparing for competitive exams that gets you a job in various government and private service sectors like banks, railways, etc. I have one exam in September and one in October. Although I'm studying properly the vacancy to application ratio for these jobs is very low. It's like 1 in every 500 guy gets selected after multiple elimination rounds. Plus, the reservation and cut-offs, I'm very stressed.

I've always wanted to live away from my parents, being independent, not become a burden on them. That's why I moved to this big city. But, lately I am thinking of moving back to my hometown as soon as possible as it's much more comfortable than starting afresh. I mean I've got friends there, family, a home with all necessary amenities and stuff. Managing everything on my own is difficult than I thought.

Anyway, lately I just haven't been using it much. In the past six months I've used it maybe three times, and while I do want to, the hassle of it really turns me off. There's basically one place I really use it now, and I only get there a couple times a year. I have one more chance to realistically use it before going back to school, and once that happens it probably wouldn't be used until next summer at the earliest.
While I don't really need the money at the moment, if I could get even a grand for it, I could invest that in other hobbies (or find a new one). On the other hand, if I do sell and realize I want to try it again, I most likely wouldn't be able to afford it.

Before her I felt a strong desire for sex, and through ages 13-16ish I messed around with a lot of girls (and a couple of boys) and enjoyed it all immensely, but never managed the full shabang. Then I put on a little weight and was always too shy/embarrassed, particularly as I got older and my virginity persisted into adulthood. I wasn't 'fat' but had a bit of a dad belly. 

I lost that weight when I started University, but never regained that vigor or confidence I'd once had. I would often shy away from girls advances, and was once making out with a girl in her bed and literally got up, said goodnight, and left. She pretty much never spoke to me properly again after that. I've literally had girls I really fancied touching up my leg and crotch whilst out drinking and outwardly telling me they're coming back with me to bed after, and I've just done the Irish goodbye and left without saying anything to avoid it.

After the relationship with my ex I just don't even crave sex anymore. It doesn't even feel like it's AT ALL out of low self esteem anymore. I've processed the fact that I'm desirable to enough people to get laid, but the thought of actually doing just feels so... completely nothingy. I barely go out drinking because I know I'll end up frustrated with my inability to flirt with women - even women that are trying to flirt with me. People at work are starting to think I'm a bit weird or maybe just lying about not being a virgin - because it's become clear that I'm not at all sexually active. There are a couple of girls there that have made advances and I've just not followed through. All the guys find it weird that I've only had one sexual partner when some of them have had over 30.

I do get horny, but only really have the desire to masturbate a few times a week, though it's enjoyable. 

I really don't know what to do. I really want to fuck and gain some experience, live my life, but even the idea of paying a prostitute makes me feel a bit sick. Thinking about sex just feels a bit grim now. 

But I just feel so isolated because of it. I'm wondering if there are common chemical reasons for this? Or solutions that have worked for people in a similar situation? Please help!

233,"So I just came back from the walk-in clinic. My doctor wanted me to provide a blood sample and a urine sample. I was able to provide the blood sample. However, I wasn't able to urinate. I just wasn't able to. I waited for a good 20 minutes to see if anything would happen, and nothing did. At this point, I was pretty anxious. People were knocking on the washroom door to see if anyone was there. So I gave up, left the sample cup empty, and got out of there. This was my first ever time going to get a blood test and a urinalysis done on my own, and I didn't know what to do. What should I expect to happen? Will the clinic just call back and set up another day and time to complete it? Or should I call and mention it to the clinic myself? ",15Aug2017,1
235,"My mom has the great ability of making me feel horrible about myself somehow but I don't want it to bother me as much as it does. I've always been the type of person who does everything on my own, but recently I'm not very good at it after I left my job. I left the job due to sexual harassment and anxiety and even then she's upset because she said I should've gone to HR & sued the company because *thats what she would've done*, and that's the problem. She puts herself in my position constantly and tells me how she would've done this or that and it's *always* the right thing. For interviews if I bring up details I would've liked to change, she says she would've said ""xyz"" and it's always the right answer. I actually feel like she puts herself in my shoes too much and seems to think in my position she'd be doing better, but she doesn't understand *me* and who I am in the equation. I have bad social anxiety and she's very outgoing. When we talked about it she said she'd never even heard of social anxiety before, so we are two very different people..

 

So my mom is dating a man who is very financially secure and when she's not at work she's shopping or getting her nails done or at the gym. I'm the only one of my siblings with a college degree and I graduated from UC Berkeley. My mom never went to college & proudly says things like ""ignorance is bliss"" because she doesn't want to talk boring things like social issues or politics. She's always been very open about how pretty she thinks I am and how if she looked like me she'd be doing xyz or having so much more fun than I do. She thinks I have beauty and brains and *""theres so many men you can just choose from!*"" because she wants me to meet and **marry** a man with money to take care of me like she has. I want to prove to myself I can do things on my own & my boyfriends don't need to be super successful - but for the first time I feel like I can't. Maybe she's right? And it's making me easily annoyed with her. Shes helping me financially, and I can't seem to get a job. So in the meantime her and I are becoming increasingly annoyed with one another, but neither of us likes it.

236,"As title says, PE is real problem for me. I think that I have some kind of PTSD or something but feel really anxious. Why you may ask. Hmm, I think this started when I was a child I almost drowned in pool and teacher pull out me out of water after long moment. Then I avoided all pools to this day. In my previous school (Im in High School now) I had no problem with PE cus I had great teacher (I was a bit overweight but this is past) and I had good time. One year ago I went to high school and problem started first 3 weeks was nightmare for me, PE with High School teacher, literally another little trauma caused by school, sport related, activities. I had bad dreams, stomach pain (when the time for PE comes), couldn't focus etc I've talked about this with school psychology and she suggested that I should get medical leave (I have no medical problems) and here we go, I needed to show this to my PE teacher (I hate lies, but I had because otherwise I would just escape from the school) and I had an exemption for year from PE. Everything was fine, my marks immediately got higher and I could focus on Maths etc. But another year is coming and I'm just scared and don't know what to do. First thing that came to my mind was another medical leave but this is risky and I dunno, another was some kind of paper about my fears (I think its enough when I cant focus on anything else cus of stress) but I don't know if this will be recognized in my school :(",15Aug2017,3
237,"My brother is 32 years old, a diagnosed schizophrenic, and living at home with my parents, and he is making their lives miserable.

He has 2-3 psychotic breaks a year and my mother is usually the antagonist in his delusions. He's never hurt her, but he has said some very ugly, awful things to her and said things like ""she must be stopped"" and ""I have to do something about mother"" and things of that nature. He has also destroyed a considerable amount of property at various times. (His delusion is that she's a member of the Illuminati and attempting to drug him forcibly, or get other people to, which was fueled by her support for him to seek treatment for his illness.) They've kicked him out once already, but he convinced them in January that he would attempt to get better and make a life for himself, so he's back at home. (After about a week of actual effort, he didn't do either of those things — he has sat in the basement obsessing over his delusions ever since.) His paranoia about people trying to drug him is a really difficult obstacle in trying to convince him to seek treatment.

Today, he had another break — he was yelling all night about various things, then woke my mother up at 5am banging on her bedroom door (she has a lock now), so she called the cops on him after trying unsuccessfully to talk him down. The cops brought him to the hospital, where they spoke to him for a few hours, took a blood sample, then sent him on his way. My mother is of course now afraid to go back home, since he's still clearly ill and has been texting her vitriol since he was released. This is not the first time any of this has gone down, but this is the quickest the hospital has spit him back out (usually takes at least three days). 

My mother's only recourse seems to be to go to the police again, but if this awful merry-go-round didn't work the first time, what is there left to do?? I feel terrible that she has to feel unsafe in her own home and it is SO CLEAR that he is a danger to others right now and should be in a hospital equipped to deal with that. 

So I guess my actual question is: Is there another way we should be dealing with these psychotic breaks? Does anyone have any relevant experience that may help? What do we have to do to get my brother the help he so clearly needs and will not seek out himself?",15Aug2017,2

240,"So, context. I'm about to hit 20 years old, live with parents in dead end retail job in England.

As far as how i've ended up here? I'll try to make it short.

In secondary school I started having panic attacks as a result of anxiety, went to counsellor. She told me CAHMS (Child and adult mental health service) would like to see me, needed parents to know before referal. Months of persuasion later I say, sure. Parents react badly, am branded 'Selfish, lazy and a liar' for it. Never bring it up again. GCSE's go by, I do alright with 13 from C - A*. Go to good 6th form, new school though. Become complete loner. See Councillor there, she says same thing as before. Self harm started around here. I flunk 6th form. Go into dead end retail job i was working part time in for the summer. September comes, start college course for computing. Do alright in the first year, they cancel second year as not enough new starters. Back to dead end retail job. We move across the country to center of England. In new dead end retail job. No friends outside of work. Only reason i leave the house is to get food or go to work. I don't think im a bad person, but they way things have turned out kinda makes me feel like I must be at this point.

*Also, I did go to the GP about my issues, he simply gave me a pamphlet and sent me away. I waited until I could drive and all to get there without telling  anyone and yeah, fucked me up a little more with how little he cared.*

241,"Me and my crush both broke up with our Exs. at the start of the summer... We helped each other heal throught the break up and we came closer together.




The big difference in our cases, is that my relationship lasted 4 months and ended on good terms... Her relationship lasted 2 years and was toxic with daily arguing for several months.




At the end of July it happened, we had an intimate moment and something I said made her remember her ex. A few days later she says shes not ready for a relationship and wants to be single for some time... She says she wants to remain friends and in the future if we both still feel the same it'll happen. Now heres the real problem... I have no worries giving her some space, I don't wanna be with someone that still thinks of their ex while we're together (Until this point the relationship had no issues and we were both happy at how it was going)... But i have no problem in waiting for her. I don't know whats different with her and all the other girls i've dated, I don't have difficulties finding other girls (I'd usually just turn away and move on to the next one), but i actually wanna try to make this into something... Its really weird, because we both play the same games, both have the same interest, humour, dreams and are in a strange category of geeky people that don't get out of their house that often, but are still above average in the attractiveness scale.



Now to the hard part... She says she doesn't want to meet in person for a while since i make her feel things shes not ready for... I've noticed we spend way less time texting, we haven't played anything in a while and we left silicon valley mid season 2... I've basically stopped starting the conversation giving her all the space she might need. I really don't know if she wants us both to forget and move on or not and thats killing me...
Until the other day something happened... While i was having a casual conversation with some friends in the gym, I mentioned that if i could get a copy of GTA 5 for 20€ I'd get it... This girl I barely talk to, said she could get it for less and would give it to me for free... Well I posted about this on discord and she got a bit jealous. The next day, we spend the entirety of it without talking to one another and I get a sudden message on whatsapp of her asking me, how would she know if some guys are talking about her and that some of them are checking her out...




I have no idea of what to do... I'm tired of mixed feelings and I know starting a convo about this again would only serve as pressure and pull her away more...",15Aug2017,6
242,"I'm dating someone who I'm nearly 100% certain wouldn't cheat on me, but my relationship before him was a long one and that guy definitely cheated and at the beginning of that relationship I didn't think he would have but he did. And as a child I witnessed my own dad bringing strange women home behind my moms back and that really messed my mom up so she sort of instilled the fear of being cheated on in me as I grew up. She encouraged me to always be suspicious of men in that way ""just in case"" because ""you never know"". 


So now I find myself in a very serious relationship with this man and we have lived together for a few years now, all possible evidence points to him never in a million years being the type of person to hurt me in that way. Like he's simply made of integrity and has never given me even a sliver of a reason to doubt that. His brothers have even told me stories where he went WELL out of his way to get himself out of a situation where it could seem like he was cheating with previous girlfriends. 


The thing is that I feel like I can trust him, but the fact that I've felt like that with someone before and was proved wrong scares the hell out of me. Plus I've been a lot heavier than I'm comfortable with for years and this has made me feel incredibly inferior around other women already, and then knowing how attractive my boyfriend is doesn't help because he definitely gets checked out left and right and for good reason. 

I just started losing a lot of weight so that is helping, but still every time I know that there is going to be girls our age somewhere we're going, my brain has this awful shit fit and I get so anxious and self conscious and all I want is for him to see it as me struggling with something that's difficult for me to struggle with and try and comfort me out of it or help in some way. 

But instead of that he takes it very personally and it ends up as an argument. And I totally understand why he reacts that way, it makes total sense, he personally has never given me reason to doubt him so he sees this as me doubting his integrity. But it's so much deeper than that, and I just want him to understand it from my perspective. I realize it's hard to see it from someone else's perspective but I can see it from his, and I've even clearly communicated that I understand why he is reacting that way and then calmly and clearly explained why this fear happens in me and that it's not personal even if it seems like it. But he's so stubborn, he just can't get past the initial feeling and try to work with me on this. 



Sorry this is so long. Does anyone have any advice on how I could go about this better? I feel like I've done the best I can with trying to communicate about it... I don't know what else to do. And of course I've tried just swallowing the fear and keeping it to myself but every time I do that it just ends up as a panicked explosion later on and I end up just silently feeling insanely anxious all night and unable to express it or ask for help.

246,"Basically I graduated 2+ months ago. My grades were pretty flimsy in one professor's class and I spoke with him in order to make it up. He cut a deal that he would extend a deadline for me in exchange for drafting a document template for him 2-3 weeks after graduation (he knows I'm design-y). But he was asking for professional-quality work which is completely out of my depth, realistically. I have it mostly completed but pretty much ghosted him.... I graduated with great grades but I sunk DEEPER into an episode rather than snap out of it.

I've had a really hard time adjusting to being graduated and basically been sleeping and wallowing for the past two months. I've only now kind of snapped out of it and got my mental health together but am somewhat paralyzed with anxiety about how I completely neglected this assignment for a professor I'm completely indebted/grateful towards. He's also an important figure in my prospective field so I pretty much fucked my future up.

What can I do? What should I say in an email? I'm still willing to do the work but I don't know if he even still needs it or will accept it from me.

254,"I recently had to find a new job and did so at the corner store, not five minutes walk from my house. It pays min. wage, but money is money right now. I've held the job for two weeks. It's not bad, but last night things became extremely uncomfortable.

The situation is this: The boss hired her daughter, BD, months ago, to work under her. BD gets away with a lot of things that others would not because her mother is in charge. Every complaint or issue with BD is brushed under the rug, or ignored. These two interact either like best friends or are two seconds away from throwing punches. It's maddening, *and* against company policy to hire direct family. Yet, here we are.

Now, BD and I have talked in passing. I've mentioned that my mom and I aren't on speaking terms [long story] and that I live with my dad for the time being [another long story].

Last night, BD's boyfriend came in, as he delivers baked goods to different stores in the area. I recognized him from two previous stores I've worked in, and said so to BD.

BD: He get fresh with anyone at store one?

Me: ...no?

BD: How about store 2?

Me: No.

BD: You sure?

I'm getting frustrated at this point because while I can tell she's joking, it's not funny and I have to count cigarettes. She then leans into my personal space, and asks me,

BD: You ain't gonna flirt with him, are you?

Me: *No.*

BD: Why? Cuz he's black?

I'd had it, and stated calmly but firmly, ""No. I'm gay."" [Well, lesbian, but they mean the same thing to me.""

BD's response was a slew of weird questions that escalated in strangeness and discomfort.

BD: You don't look gay.

Me: It's not a look, it's a sexuality.

BD: So you JUST like girls?

Me: I like women.

BD: *smirking* What, big girls, little girls, black girls-

Me: I JUST like WOMEN. 

BD: Okay... so... you ever kissed a girl?

Me: That's *private*.

BD: Okay, okay.

Not even a minute later.

BD: So, how long have you been gay?

Me: I don't know, my whole life. Can we not do this here? [I'm losing patience at this point. We have customers to ring and I need to focus on giving proper change.] 

BD: Maybe you're gay cuz you're closer to your dad and not your mom, so you only like girls because your mom wasn't-

Me: [I'm done.] BD, I'm not in the mood for you trying to psychoanalyze me. I have *always* been like this, and I don't want to talk about it on the sales floor anymore.

I head away from the registers to clean the coffee bar, when a fellow coworker, OM, approaches me. He's an older man and has been with the store for a LOT longer than half the staff.

OM: You okay?

Me: I guess. Just... haven't dealt with questions like that since middle school.

OM: What she just did is considered sexual harassment.

While it bothered me, I'm the new hire and don't want to make enemies. I explained this, and OM continued.

OM: She was asking you questions about your personal life that she had no reason to.""

Me: Well, to be fair, I did tell her I was gay.

OM: If she said things like that to [openly gay] Manager, she'd never heard the end of it.""

Me: I just... I don't wanna make waves.

OM: Then I'll do it. If this happens again, and it comes back that I didn't do or say anything the first time, I can get fired.

Me: Just... do what you have to.

He did... and BD was pissed. She's overheard the entire thing as well as the call he made to her mother. She was nothing but a fuming little storm cloud the rest of the shift. She called her mom and asked to come home early. She does this often.

I get the feeling that, if her mother doesn't handle things, then I'm going to have to call  or at least someone above their heads. I may be the new hire, but none of that was okay.

That's why I'm here. 

 * What do I do if I end up fired for this? The boss has fired people for less than tattling on her daughter. [she bragged about high-turnover rates at her store on hiring day. Should have been a red flag.] 

 * What do I do if I keep my job, but am treated poorly by BD or her mother for this? While I'm not the reporting party, I am the victim.

I don't usually trust people's words, but I always trust their actions. And sometimes words are actions (like if you keep insisting that you're so trustworthy, you're the last person I'm going to trust).

So this guy keeps saying how he's not usually this comfortable with someone, he doesn't know why he's so comfortable with me, I'm easy to talk to, he doesn't usually share this much and so on. It's just like what's wrong with you that you don't have any close friends you can talk to? Either you have horrible trust issues or people end up not wanting to get close to you.

Also, we just met less than two weeks ago I have a hard time believing you have actual trust issues or don't share stuff with people often if you'll share with someone you barely know (It's not even deep personal stuff, just his feelings. Are men really this embarrassed about their feelings?)

She went through a very rough time and suffered a long chain of major losses. She worked so hard and was very strong throughout everything , however, she sunk into a severe depression when she came out the other side.

She isolated herself from friends while she was working through this, and was forced to give up on everything she normally did for a while. She tells me it feels like she doesn't know who she is or what she wants anymore. I don't feel that she would ever harm herself or commit suicide but she gets extremely frustrated and repeats things like ""I'm done, I don't want to live like this,"" and ""There is no point for me to be here,"" a lot. 

She has gotten herself to see a therapist and psychiatrist and is currently on a low-dose of an antidepressant/ doing weekly therapy. She decided to try the anti-depressant because she had become very low-functioning. She is completing some grad school applications, and tells me she just sits staring at everything she has to get done... unable to do the simplest things. She will work on the simplest task for hours. She is not making progress on anything anymore, even things I know are important to her.

She used to be so bright, and funny and ambitious. She had goals and motivations, and my heart is breaking seeing her like this...

She is seriously struggling making even the tiniest choices, and cries every single day.

I immediately called the police and they took a report, but haven't been very helpful since. The most frustrating part is that I know this woman (she used to live next door).

We leave for vacation to the Caribbean early on Thursday morning, we have to be at the airport at 4 a.m. We've gone there before so my parents already know I won't be sleeping tomorrow night so I can just sleep on the plane ride.

I asked them if I can go bowling with my friends tomorrow night, I'd probably leave at 6 pm then probably be back home by 1 am. They usually have no problem with me being out that late, but bare saying I can't go out tomorrow because we leave for vacation. The reason my mom gave me is that she doesn't wanna risk me getting hurt right before we leave. But I explained I'm going bowling... Bowling. There's no way I could get hurt, but she still won't let me go. My dad is saying no but won't even give me a reason. 

They started saying that I'd probably get home late, but I always get home at around 12-2 whenever I go out with my friends, so I'd definitely be back home before we leave for the airport. Then they said it's just wasting money because we're already spending $9,000 to stay at a resort in the Dominican, but I have my own job and I'd be paying for the night by myself. 

So now I wanna ask reddit for some advice, because my parents are being stupid for no reason and refuse to let me go out. I'm an 18 year old boy, if that matters. My parents are Indian, so there is an element of strictness there, but they've never been like this before. 

Any help would be appreciated with this! thanks!! ",15Aug2017,6
266,"PLEASE READ THIS ALL vvv I NEED HELP BAD               I play field hockey and tryouts are all this week, this morning when I got back from tryouts my legs and arm were in pain and it hurts when I move. I want to go to bed early tonight and have a calming bath so I'm ready for the last day of tryouts. But... there is also a travel club that I might be interested in I just need more info(my moms going to a meeting Thursday for info). Me my sister and cousins were invited to come and be in the practice tonight. It's from 7-9 and I was hoping to be in bed by 8:30. I don't wanna go but my sister and cousins are and I'm afraid if I don't I will miss out on meeting my possible other teammates. But these girls are good and I don't wanna let them down at the games in practice. I just wanna stay home, but if I go, it could be good for me, good practice, but my legs are in pain, but if I don't go they might think I'm a wimp, but I need sleep for tryouts. I literally keep going back and forth with myself and it's causing me major anxiety. Someone help me out and make the decision for me. 😞 *EDITED- I ended up not going, but I still feel worried",15Aug2017,1

I don't really know how to work out or where to even begin. My house has a treadmill in it and I plan to start running but when it comes to lifting I have no idea. Also, the thought of going to the gym terrifies me because I'm scared people are just gonna stare at me, I look pretty young for my age as well so it's really hard for me to muster up the courage to go.

269,"Context: I'm currently 16 and love animals to no extent, but this isn't just a case of the dog not being constantly pampered. My neighbours own a very pretty, very friendly black lab who's constantly outside in their yard. This on its own isn't exactly a problem, but where I live it's either freezing cold and buried in snow or blistering hot. In winter 2016 I called the animal abuse hotline when I saw them physically hit him (forcefully, not a disciplinary sort of hit) and they found signs of abuse & neglect, but they only put them under watch for 6 months. After that nothing seemed to have changed. He has a doghouse now but it's on the hard concrete, as well as a kiddie pool that never seems to be filled up. Just five minutes ago I looked out the window and he was stuck in a cage/crate with no food or water bowl. Should I call the abuse hotline again or is there anything else I can do?",15Aug2017,1
270,"While at a restaurant with my girlfriend we had terrible service but I understood because they were swamped. It was just me and her at our table. At the end of our visit when he gave me the bill he tried to sneakily drop something on my girlfriend's lap. She showed me as soon as it happened that it was his phone number. I obviously wasn't very happy about it but it seemed like she wanted to diffuse the situation and not have me make a scene.

I asked the hostess for the general manager but he was not there. I didn't end up keeping the number and I didn't say anything that night. It bothered me though, even though I took the high road about it. I still feel extremely disrespected and feel like I should do something about it.

Should I call the general manager when he's in? Should I go there in person? Should I wait until I see the server who did it then say something? Is it too late to say something?",15Aug2017,22

Life just sucks right now, I try to remain upbeat and everything but I have no one to vent or talk too and it's genuinely sad. I spent my last 4 birthdays alone. It was only when my sister jokingly said ""You have no friends"" when it hit me.

I always over complicate things in social situations it sucks. What's worse than being lonely is having people (especially family members) realising that you're a loner...

276,"I work at a tech startup, around 20 people. Been there for little over a year. Open space, free pepsi, ping pong sort of place. Boss is a shorts and flip flops chill dude. The yearly review went very well.

I noticed he kind of acts defensively, awkwardly, when we happen to be in the kitchen at the same time and other casual situations. Like he doesn't know what to say. He teases other employees but never me.

Recently I had some minor health problems that needed checking. I booked some days off. Later, a colleage told me Boss had been asking around. He suspected I was secretly going to job interviews. According to my colleage, Boss literally said, ""you know how he can be"". Well I don't.

Not sure what I'm doing to elicit this behaviour. I'm active on linkedin, maybe I should neglect it a bit. I'd like some advice to earn Boss' trust so he can be chill near me too. But it would be awkward to just bring it up because he hasn't said anything to me.

278,"The low level employee texted a supervisor with a question. The supervisor mistakenly texted the same employee back. The supervisor meant to text their immediate manager. However the text contained info showing how the manager and the supervisor collude and manipulate behind upper management’s back, and even mentions one of the upper managers by name. Employees have gone to this specific upper manager to complain about this manager who was supposed to get the text.
Recently more complaints have been made, and this text proves this exact point. The employee says they do not want to show upper management, but they have shown 2 employees who have recently made complaints to upper management. If this employee did not want to go to upper management, then why did they show the text to 2 employees who have previously complained about the issue shown in the text. Also this employee has talked to upper management about the issue prior to receiving the text.

279,"TL;DR - Junior in high school, tried football for the summer, didn't like it at all, miserable, I need advice.



Going into junior year of high school, I thought joining the football team would be a good thing for me to do. I thought I might enjoy it, however, it appears that I am not enjoying it...at all



Just a little background, I am a 3.8 student and maintaining my GPA is the biggest thing on my mind right now, especially considering I am taking 3 AP classes this next year. I also just received surgery for my wisdom teeth and for a traumatic bone cyst, so I haven't been able to play.




I am not enjoying football like I thought I would. In fact, I am not enjoying it at all. I don't want to play. I am not a major star, I'm not great at the sport, so if I quit, it's not a big loss to the team. 




I've dedicated my summer to practicing with the team and I have dreaded it. I am miserable. I shouldn't feel like killing myself would be the better option (I'm not actually suicidal, I'm just being melodramatic). 




I am still trying to get the guts to write the email to my coach and tell him I don't want to continue to play. Academics is most important write now, so I would plan to include that in the email. I also plan on saying ""thanks for being a good coach, blah blah blah...surgery has made me vulnerable...blah""




And if we're being honest, my coach couldn't give two fucks if I quit the team. What I'm struggling with the most here is telling my family and my friends that I don't want to continue to play. I know I'm going to get a lot of shit, but thats just how life is. I would rather not do something that will make me feel miserable for the next 2 months.



What do you guys think? Any advice for me?",15Aug2017,1
280,"I broke up with him and it wasn't pretty. I was really bitter about him accusing me of being the problem and creating problems when all I wanted was in fact solutions to my doubts about him. The way I coped with this break up was forcing myself to forget about it all. And then he messaged me. His life is not going very well and he says it's not because he's lonely that he wants to talk to me but because he genuinely misses me and he's not trying to get back with me either. I believe him but, chatting to him has become... different. I talk to him like I would a friend but I don't tell him a lot about my day for no particular reason. Maybe you've guessed already but I'm one of those people who when asked by (close) friends about their day tells them how every single minute was spent. (Alright that is an exaggeration but I'm nearly there lol) But I really don't know what I am to him now except for his ex? Is this normal? To just talk about our days like acquaintances when we shared so much more than that? Our conversations don't yet feel totally weird but something is off. How are you supposed to talk to your ex and what about? Is it even possible to become good friends with an ex? ",15Aug2017,1

285,"I really want to start gaining confidence and self-esteem. I want to start being able to handle negative criticism better, I want to stop feeling inadequate, and I want to stop comparing myself to others. When I see a person who appears good-looking, ""chill"", or more hard-working, I tend to feel sad about myself and wish I could be more like them. Since I'm insecure, I tend to find faults in others internally. I don't say it out loud. But I tend to do this a lot.

I also tend to easily get jealous of other people.

286,"So 6 months ago, my boyfriend found out that he had a daughter. He is 25 and I am 23. The daughter was apparently 11 years old, turning 12 this year. My boyfriend, who we'll call Casey, had her come over from Nebraska to see us in NYC for 2 weeks with her sister. Casey and his daughter, Alyssa, were meeting each other for the first time in that trip. This happened 4 and a half months ago. 

Here is what happened that made me jealous of her: 

1. I never wake up with Casey next to me anymore. In the trip, he was either always in the kitchen, cooking while talking to Alyssa, or sleeping while cuddling with her. Since then, he is either in the kitchen or in the living room, talking to Alyssa on the phone. 

2. He shares thing with her that he never shared with me. We had this baby monitor in the living room since we always babysat Casey's nephew on the weekdays. Anyways, it was on and I heard them both sharing secrets with each other. At first it was cute, I heard them both giggle with each other and share secrets like crushes and falling asleep at work (I didn't know any of those secrets since they were so innocent and not very important). Then I heard Alyssa tell Casey that she once gave her crush a note, confessing that she liked him. Then Casey told her a secret that I thought mattered a lot that I know and I didn't know it. He said that in highschool WHEN WE WERE DATING EACH OTHER, a girl once gave him a love letter but he told her he was taken but he still kept the letter. He kept it and I didn't know. Not good. 

3. No more crazy shit to tell him about because he heard it all. So I would always tell Casey about new conspiracy theories that I found and crazy events that happened but now when I tell him about it, he always says that Alyssa already told him about it. Here is an example: You know the crazy shit that happened at Virginia in Charlottesville with the protesting shit? I told him about it but apparently, he said that at the morning when he talked to Alyssa, she told him about it first. 

 4. He is happier with her. When I saw him laugh and talk with her, he was happier than he was with me. He had this whole new glow that made him so positive and outgoing and loving. He was sweet with her and was so protective over her. I would tell her that the music she liked was terrible and instantly, he would become so defensive and protective. He is never like that with me.

5. He only calls her cute nicknames. Like, if I ask him to start calling me an angel, he would say that the only angel that he knows is Alyssa. 

What do I do? I talked to him about it but we began having this huge fight which lead to us sleeping in different rooms and me crying the night away. We made up but everytime I bring the topic up, he says that everything is fine and it is normal. ",15Aug2017,0
287,"Very likely going to be homeless in a few months. My apartment is kicking me out because I make too much to live here after my last promotion, and for all of the other apartments around, I make too little to afford them. (Apartments here are very extreme. You either need to make 70k+ a year, or you need to make less than 30k a year.) I have enough saved up to get a home with the help of a loan and grant, which I qualify for.

I qualify for a loan and grant for first time home owning, but the broker needs to verify my income for the last two years. I asked my boss for a sheet or pay stubs for the last two years, and he told me to call the service center to get it. 

I did that and they said I needed a password. I asked my boss the next day for the password, and he gave it to me. Cool. I call and its the wrong one. I let my boss know, and again he gives the wrong one. Ok. By this time its late so I call him the next day. He gives me the right one this time, but the service center is closed. Ok... Keep trying every day for a week, still closed. After two weeks of trying, I finally get through! They tell me they cannot give me that information and that I need to log in on the employee computer. Oh, ok. Next day at work, I try to log in but it doesn't work. Repeat, about a week later it works! I'm able to log in and I'm looking for any tabs that have to do with income. There's one, but it says if I want pay stubs or any pay information, to call the service center. I call the service center right then and there, and they *tell me they cannot help me, and that I need to use the employee computer*. After telling them that I am on the computer and it says to call them for the information, they tell me sorry they cannot help and hang up. I call HR, and it directs me back to the service center. I text my boss asking him for help because nothing is working. He tells me hes on vacation and not to bother him. I have no idea when he is scheduled to be back. At the very least, he is not scheduled at all for the rest of this month. I am running out of time to get my income information before I need to restart the loan application. If this happens, I will be homeless for a period of time. 

TLDR; How the fuck and I supposed to give a loan when my boss and the company refuses to give me my income information for the last two years? I just need pay stub copies. Ive been trying for a month at this point. Please, any advice so I don't become homeless for a few weeks. I'm so beyond sick from the stress.

Obligatory, I made this account to beg for advice. Sorry if I did something wrong.",15Aug2017,5
