8,"   When I turned 16, I realized how much I hated High School as well as the area I was in. But, I was stuck and had to find a way to cope with 2 more years of being miserable. I had friends and was never bullied, so those weren't the source of my negative feelings. I ended up smoking weed too much and experimented with other drugs like molly, xans, percs, acid, and shrooms. Anything to give me a reason to be happy or excited.

   When I did graduate High School, I had moved to Richmond for college and I assumed that it was exactly what I wanted in life. 4 months later, I am miserable and lost again. I barely have friends, my anxiety is bad, my acne has led to me losing any confidence I've had (as well as a falling out with a girl I really liked). I'm so stressed out and feel more lost than ever.

   I want to dropout and pursue my dream of becoming a rapper, but am scared to truly dive into in. I'm afraid of what my family will thing, I'm afraid that I'll run out of money, I'm afraid that I'll never be good at it. With all these doubts, one would assume that I would have given up on the dream, but I haven't. I was an atheist growing up, but recently I have been exploring my spirituality. I have had feelings or ""signs"" that this is my purpose in life.

Am I crazy? Am I stupid? Am I going down a bad path? I'm sorry if this is poorly written, but I need advise or insight. Help me please!

11,"So, to start, I'm a 22 year old guy with no college experience aside from probably a couple of credits during running start. I work as a lot attendant with 40+ hr work weeks at 11$/hr, no chance of a raise past minimum, and wind up living with 0$ to my name after payday.

The advice I seek would just be what could I do (vague I know), because there's a plethora of things past scrubbing a car I can do (light operate stage light and sound boards, edit and film video, act, sing, eat fire, juggle, use technology better than the average Joe, write, list goes on and on), and being stuck at a job with no real chance of moving up in a field I don't really care to work in while living a life of worrying if I'll have enough food to eat let alone pay all my bills.

I know getting a second job is the first obvious answer, and I am looking. My job has me working in the middle of the morning to close in the evening, so unless I can find something like four hours a day after this job or something on my weekends, which I already feel are too short.

12,"Hello r/advice! This is my first time posting here! So I'm sorry if this isn't the normal post but I need as much advice as I can get. 

I recently (2017) finished my MS degree in geology and in my final year of school I applied to jobs and PhD programs. The PhD programs were in science education which is much different than my BS/MS degrees..but also related. I really love teaching and I love trying to improve the way Earth and environmental sciences are taught in our schools because they're often considered the red-headed stepchild of the sciences. I was accepted into a fully funded, stipend included, PhD program but decided to defer for a year. I needed a break from the rigorous program I was in. In the gap year I've worked at an environmental consulting firm. The job pays well but I'm INCREDIBLY bored. I don't really like the field and I feel out of place. So, now I need to decide if I should accept the PhD offer. 

Here's my issue: my boyfriend of five years (who has substantial student debt) would be 3.5 hours away unless he finds a job/goes to grad school in the area of my PhD program. He has to have a job to support himself and his student loans but the area where my PhD program is located is rather rural and devoid of jobs. I'm worried that starting a PhD program will destroy our relationship (assuming he won't find a job and will have difficulty getting into a funded MS program). But, I don't even think I can do the PhD program without him. I need the support. I know what grad school is like and I know how I react to stress. If I don't have a support system, I won't do well. The program typically takes five years so it's not like we can manage a two year long distance relationship. 

I'm really just looking for any advice you can give me. This is the biggest decision I've ever had to make. Thank you in advance!",01Nov2017,1

15,"so, i just finished my CNA class, and today i started my 4-day clinical rotation in a long-term care facility. and this facility is depressing AF. i’m guessing it’s as sad and bleak as it is because it’s medicare-run, and the state doesn’t give a fuck about spending money on things like comfort for people close to death. (but don’t get me started on that whole issue... THEY’D RATHER SPEND IT ON THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. shit. sorry. i’ll stop.) 

anyways, this guy in my care has me so sad. he’s not even *that* old, but he can barely move his body because it’s all contracted and the muscles are atrophied, and he can’t really speak (he can get a garbled word out if he tries with all his energy, but evan then i usually can’t understand it). he’s still mostly there though—it’s his body that has betrayed him, not his mind. he’s in pain whenever i have to move him, and he starts sobbing every time i have to give him personal care, because he feels so uncomfortable being exposed. he cries quite a bit, actually. and while others have photos of flowers, beautiful landscapes, family, or soothing things like that, he has nothing. his only personal effects are a CD player, and two CD’s that play on repeat while he’s in his room. 

he’s not completely without family though, because a wife is mentioned a few times in his care plan. but my heart just breaks endlessly for him: trapped in this broken body that’s trapped in this depressing, fluorescent-lit shithole. and i feel like i need to do something... should i? or am i assuming too much responsibility? would i be stripping him of even more dignity by assuming i can? and if i *should* do something, what should i do? any compassionate advice is much appreciated, and any advice from those with personal experience in this situation is GOLD. 

addendum: to preempt anyone saying i may not be cut out for this, or that this line of work is not for me, i’ll just mention that i wholeheartedly agree. i’m getting my nursing assistant certification so i can work in a hospital—not a nursing home—while i pursue further healthcare schooling.",01Nov2017,1

I was seeing a counsellor at my college for 4 months doing CBT for anxiety. I became very attatched to her and was extremely sad when I graduated and was no longer allowed to see her (it wasn’t romantic at all- she was like a mother-figure to me). I ran into her accidentally in public and we sat and talked about what was new in my life. She told me she thinks about me all the time and was so glad to have ran into me. Before we parted ways, she asked if we could meet up for coffee sometime soon. Is this inappropriate? I really want to see her again but I don’t know if its healthy for me to do so.

I used to meditate in the mornings but have since dropped it because I couldn't get into doing it regularly, and it got harder and harder getting into that space of mind.

But anyway.

I need to seek therapy and the last 2 therapists that I had, had no idea how to help me. The first lady was terrified at how dark my mind went, and the second one was so busy asking me questions about how deep the rabbit hole goes that she wasn't able to render anything for me. We kept going in circles.

So next time I meet someone I want to try to figure out how to explain myself without them freaking out or without them putting me in the nut house. Granted, if it wasn't for the fact that I like playing games and they won't let me in the nut house, I'd go, honestly.

So here are my problems:

* Severe depression - damn near ultra depression including suicidal, tried 3 times in the past

* severe anxiety

* body image issues

* anger

* and...there's a word for this and I can't find it but it's that thing where you fall in love with a character that doesn't exist and you know it but you can't help yourself regardless...I have that

Last but not least:
A view of humans and society as a whole that is nothing but a complete dark empty void of loneliness and sadness, without any hope whatsoever, so much so I feel like I've died and this I am quite literally in hell even though I'm not even Christian


That last part is kinda what gets them looking at me kinda funny. But, honestly, if that's how I feel, they should know it right? Or is that something I should not bring up? I guess I don't know what is appropriate to bring up when you're in therapy and what's not. Anybody have any advice on that?

24,"I recently complained about a professor in an anonymous survey that we are made to fill out. He is a professor that I find to be intimidating to his female students, harassing and disrespectful. On the first day of our course, he began, in a very intimidating way, asking female students if they would let him ""take you to bed"", and insisted that this was for an academic example. He repeatedly asked one girl, several times, this question as she became increasingly uncomfortable. It  was not funny, it was not a joke, the whole classroom was silent and tense. During this class he also attempted to ask me if he had any of the atributos that I would find attractive in men, whick I successfully diffused. Another student later had to cancel the course because she was being flirted on by him, and upon rejecting him, found that he began taking academic repercussions against her. Along other comments made frequently in class, and things told to me by friends who had previously attended his classes and have even been targeted by him, I have determined that this man has a history of sexual misconduct with students. There are many in appropriate rumors in regards to him. Even the male students refer to him as a pervert.

The comment I inserted to the survey said ""this professor does not know how to respect at all and he is very intimidating towards his female students. The first day of class he began to ask students if they would allow him to take them to bed. I know this issue has been recurring so I don't understand why the University allows it to persist.""

The professor *probably* does not know it was me, however, he does get the results sent to him after the dean views them. In today's class he began ranting about how he was going to be fired because of the comments one student made. He proceeded to show the whole class, asking us one by one, to read a picture he took of the comment I made. Several other similar complaints were made, but mine I think had stronger wording. Another student also made a reference to his initial comments.

He became very intimidating in today's class, and I believe breached University protocol in showing us the comment, as he also has access to knowing from which group the survey came. He began speaking menacingly about the person who made the comment in an attempt to victimize himself.

Although I can rationalize that I was honest, that he has had other (and far more serious) complaints made about him directly to the dean, and that I as well as others have witnessed his behavior over an extended period of time, I am terrified of him finding out and taking repercussions against me. I've heard a lot of first hand accounts from female students regarding the way he has behaved when they have rejected him or complained against him and even male students warned me about his repercussions.

I just got a new job in a very small town. I had my first day yesterday, my third day will be tomorrow; that's how brand new I am to this area. With me, is a horrible credit score, not a lot of cash, and a temporary residence at my mothers since July, which, admittedly is the only upside of the recent predicament I seem to be in. 

Work, is about an hour and a half away, every morning. We live outside a notoriously bad city for traffic, though I've consistently left early enough to be on time. But, it's slowly killing me lol. I can already feel I'm gonna not be able to do this drive for any amount of time. 

On top of this aspect, I also kinda want to get out of my mom's house again. Not to be rude or disrespectful to her, I'm 23 and I want my own space, ya know? 

I've been looking at apartments, and holy shit, all of them are expensive. I'm talking 1k a month, 1500 etc, and I don't have that capital yet. Bi-weekly I make maybe 850, though I'm not sure I haven't been paid yet to know exactly lol. In any event, it's not enough for those places. I've been in a situation before where I've had to use all of my first and a part of my second paychecks, monthly, just to make rent— I don't want to be in that position again. (although, it was utilites included so that was cool)

I met a nice young woman at the office, about my age who said I could move in with her in December if I was looking for places to live. I think she lives in the town work is in, and she mentioned it would be like $550 a month, or something close. Another lady I worked with tried to introduce me to some people I went to college with, but they're all married and I'm guessing that's a no-go. 

Should I just wait it out? I mean honestly, worst case scenario I have a month of money in my pocket, hopefully that's enough to move in, I'm not sure. I feel like one of my coworkers might come in clutch, plus I can't find anything worth shit. I would also appreciate advice on places to look, if you have any.

Okay. This has been so hard for me to ask/admit, but I need some guidance. So I’m an absolute social bug, but I HATE socialising. I can’t explain it. I have 4 children, all of which I teach empathy, sympathy, love, forgiveness and kindness to. I teach them every day, and they are growing into amazingly compassionate human beings. However; I lack every single one of those traits except for kindness and forgiveness.
The reason I teach my children these important lessons, is because I HATE not having them, and to me; being able to be kind in a world so cruel, is so important. 

I had an AMAZING childhood. I saw no violence. No drugs. No alcohol. I was never abused verbally or physically. So there is absolutely no reason why I should be this way. I want to speak to people, and I do not have social anxiety. But just the thought of potentially creating friendships makes me utterly sick. My stomach literally turns. I HATE school drop off’s, or going out, because (not boasting) but for some reason I am a magnet to people. Everyone wants to talk and converse with me, and I can’t stand it. I have so much that I want to say being extroverted; then my introverted side steps in, and I either muddle up my words, or very rudely walk away and ignore them. 

People are constantly messaging me to go out and go to lunch, and I usually delete the message before opening it. If I accidentally open it, I make up some ridiculous excuse. Like literally, so stupid. I will say something like “Oh. I have the flu.” And they will say “but we saw you this morning.” Lol. 

Everyone comes to me for advice, and I give it. I give amazing advice. Sometimes my friends, friends who I don’t know (nor do I want to know) come to me and I give them the best advice I have for their “terrible” situation. However, I find myself not caring at all about it. I feel like a totally empty vessel. Almost robotic. 

I’m a ghost friend. I ghost people quicker than anything. I long for friendships. But the moment I feel one growing, I become resentful and sickened to/by that person. I’ve lost/left so many friendships that were wonderful. And I honestly couldn’t care less. I care about old people, animals, and my family. That’s it. I will help anyone in trouble on the street.

I'm guessing that the people I've met at these club meetings are my best chance at making actual friends cause we have a lot of the same interests, but I can't seem to get beyond a superficial connection.

Anyways, I was really hoping for some advice going forward about making friends and also how to deal with how lonely I'm feeling here. Any time my parents/friends from back home ask how I'm doing, I say that I'm loving college, but in reality, I'm really lonely and sad. 

Up until this point, I'd convinced myself that it was just a matter of time before I found my group, but it's been two months and I haven't connected with anyone, and I drifted away from my freshman-orientation friends. I'd say I'm a normal, nice person, I had a big group of friends in high school which is why I'm pretty shocked/sad that I don't have any here.

I really was hoping to find ""my people"" at college, and so far it isn't looking so great. I know that a group of friends isn't something that just falls in your lap, so I would really appreciate any advice you guys have about making friends and dealing with this stuff. ",01Nov2017,2
41,I'm 24 and embarrassed to be asking this. I live in Northern San Diego County. I just don't get how to form a new group of friends. Ideally I'd like to have 4 or 5 close friends to do things with regularly. I'd also like to start hanging out with girls more. Not romantically but just having girls that are friends. I've never really had that before. I'm so lonely ,01Nov2017,1
42,"Hello, hoping someone more adult-y than me could give a few pointers here. 
I work 8:00-4:30, often later since there’s so many samples and analyses that need to be run. I’m on my feet at the lab all day and go home to make dinner, eat, clean up myself/my apartment and by the time that’s all done I barely have the time/energy to do much else. I prioritize sleep and do my best to get as close to 7-8 hours, so bed around 10 and up at 6. I don’t like fatigue interfering with my work day. 
I want to continue my hobbies like drawing and virtual pet games and whatnot, but I’m often too exhausted. I don’t even like talking to my own family/friends when they call me after work, and I feel so bad for that. If I wasn’t for my constant preoccupation with work, I think my issues with depression would have kicked back in. I admit I haven’t been taking my medicines, but I have yet to find a new psychiatrist since moving from my home city. 
I apologize for the length. TL;DR: all work and no play doesn’t make me dull, but I wish I could have the time to enjoy myself. (Inb4 the “welcome to adulthood” responses)",01Nov2017,1
43,"I don't know if I'm going crazy, so tell me what to do please. 
My sister is a high functioning special needs student and my dad is physically disabled (not in a wheelchair). My dad drives my mom around and he and my sister wait in parking lots a lot and I wait in them as well. 

Whenever I come back, my sister is sitting in the front of the car and my dad seems i dont know jumpy? Once, when he was picking me up from school, his jacket was off (and he normally has it on) and the car seat was reclined. My sister was also in the car with no reason to...

I know that my mom is actually a raging bitch and disrespects my father but that is not an excuse (if it is actually going on). I don't think that I can tell my mom because my mom is VERY volatile and I don;t know how she would react.

The thing is, I can't ask my sister about it because she is very limited (not in that sense, but she is gullible). My dad will often buy her toys and sleep next to her. Once, I forgot something and I went back into the house to find the door open in the bathroom with my dad sitting on the toilet and my sister in the same bathroom (he ALWAYS closes the door).

Today, I w=asked her about why she was grabbing my dad's shoulder and she said that at night my dad grabbed her and touched her and after she said that, my dad got huffy and told me to stop asking questions.

Also, a few months ago, I found ""old guy with young asian girl"" porn on his phone when he lent it to me... (that's the title fyi). I k=don't know if my brain is messed up, but uh I have seen my sister in a ""blowjob"" position across from my dad. Like on her knees kind of? Without putting her face up close to his crotch.

I can;t sit down with her and ask her questions nor do I feel like I can report it (as my dad is the only income source ~selfish, i know~).I've had this nagging feeling for months now and I'm not quite sure as what to do. :( Am I paranoid or is it my intuition? ",01Nov2017,2

45,"I had to put three of my dogs down today, and rehome the fourth for killing cats, (this is the third cat they have killed, my kitten wandered too close to their kennel when i was out and they grabbed it)
dog 1: male, husky/boxer, about 6mo old Putdown
dog 2: dog ones sister. Putdown
dog 3: Female, Collie/german shep, about 3yrs, putdown
Dog 4, female, husky/lab, about 8yrs, rehomed.
They would fight with eachother too. when i adopted them i was told they were fine with all animals. told they were sweet and calm, they were all (except dog 4) were completely wild... would hop or dig under the fence until their feet bled, as if i abused them, but i never laid a hand on them, they always had food, always had water, they had a bunch of room to roam around for about 8hrs a day outdoors (4 in the morning 4 in the evening, plus a potty break around 1am since im awake anyway) these dogs had no reason to be so terribly wild, i tried to train them separately, and they would jump on me and bite until they bullied the food out of my hand. or just would completely ignore me, (even if i hadnt fed them that day yet and i KNEW they were hungry) i have two dogs of my own, that one was a rescue at 3yrs old, the other ive had as a baby, pit/lab and german shep/pit respectively and neither of them had any probs with any behavioral issues, they are unaltered so they become pissy with eachother but its never more than a loud jealous huff-off to eachother. ive owned rotties, pits, a very stupid chihuahua, but i was still able to train them... i dont know what the issue was with those three, the first cat they killed was a small kitten, and i forgave them assuming they thought it was a squirrel, the second, was my adult lucifer, to which i again forgave them because i didnt separate them, which was my fault. but this time they were all kenneled in their runs, and i guess the kitten rubbed against the wire and they grabbed him. I didnt think i would have needed more than the run to keep the kittens safe. thinking the kittens would know better. but whats done is done. reason why i didnt put the eldest down is due to her just being a very sweet dog other than the cat killing. so i gave her to a friend who doesnt have cats. the other three, seeing as to how wild they are, i was afraid of them going up the ranks and killing other dogs or worse. even if the two were young they were relentlessly wild.",01Nov2017,1
46,"**TL;DR** My kind, supportive parents actually turned out to have an emotionally and verbally abusive streak that I've just noticed after a lot of therapy. They also favor my brother and value his successes more than mine. I am dependent on them because of a recent medical emergency and I need advice with how to cope until I have recovered and how to not be upset at them going forward.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
Growing up, I always had what I thought was a nice family. My parents seemed supportive and loving. They're still together and they never really fought when I was a kid. We weren't rich by any means, but we weren't poor and my little brother and I always enjoyed plenty of food, a nice house to live in, gaming consoles, fun toys, any after school activities we wanted, etc. I thought my childhood was okay.  
However, I began struggling with depression when I was a preteen and I have been in and out of therapy for it for years. I'm twenty now, and I just started seeing a therapist again because I had a seizure out of nowhere that knocked me off the course I had set for my life and sent me into depression again. I thought I'd be talking about day to day stuff like with my old therapists, but this new therapist has had me talking a lot about my childhood. I realized maybe it wasn't as good as I thought- not horrible, mind you, but not good.  
It's not hard to see that my brother is the favorite child. He's the baby and he gets away with things I would've been crucified for. From elementary school until my senior year of high school, I had a different grading scale than everyone else.  A's were B's, B's were C's, and B-'s and down were all F's. If I showed signs of dropping to a C, my parents would ground me and take all my toys and tech away from me. Some subjects were extremely difficult for me, but my parents didn't let me give up.  
My brother is not as smart as me academically, but he is very socially smart. He does poorly in all of his classes, but he is popular and gets a pass. He's in his senior year and failing one of his classes purely because he distracts the whole class and my parents laugh it off. He doesn't have his college application essays finished, and he wants to be a musical theater major, he hasn't made any audition tapes or even decided what schools to apply to and the deadline is tomorrow. I didn't think I'd go to college (my plan was to be a hairdresser), but I'd have been grounded by now if I had been that lackadaisical. He's going out to party tonight instead of working on college apps. My mom literally spent 7 hours the other day breaking down what colleges he should apply to and how he can get his stuff ready by tomorrow. She would never do that for me.  
In fact, I know she wouldn't, because I've been trying to find my path after I had my seizure and I decided I want to be a musician. There had to be a reason for that seizure (because there hasn't been a medical one we've found from all the testing), and I decided it was because I needed to follow the dream I've had since I was young. I need to sing. It's the only thing I've ever been truly passionate about.  
My mom keeps pushing me to be a medical equipment technician (???). I've told her that's not for me and I want to go to school for music, but she acts like I haven't decided what I want to do and that she's just trying to help me. My brother and I both are planning on double majoring in teaching so we could teach our art if we don't get our lucky breaks, but it's not acceptable for me to do. Just him. I have to do a science job that guarantees I have a high salary (Which, does that even?? And why science? I'm terrible at science)  
Also, I realized that growing up, my parents were lowkey kind of weird. My dad has anger issues. He screams at inanimate objects and kicks/punches them. I unfortunately inherited this from him and used to break things when they made me mad. But by the time I was 10 or so, I learned to take care of my stuff and not break it when it pisses me off. However, if I accidentally broke things, my dad would always yell at me like I'd done it on purpose. Oh, you broke your DS because it fell out of your pocket when you scootered over to a friend's house? How dare you?? Why don't you treat your things better!!? I can't believe you did this again!! The battery to your ten year old laptop died??? You probably spilled something on it or dropped it and just won't tell me!!!! You're so irresponsible!! He even did it to me the other day, I had filled a humidifier up with water and was taking it down to my room and he had told me this specific way to put it together so the water wouldn't spill. Well, I was doing things the way he wanted me to, but I have a tremor in my hand, so my hand shook and I dropped the water tank and it cracked and dumped water all over the floor. I asked him for help and he came downstairs yelling, ""Seriously? Why can't you be more careful!? We're trying to sell this house and you're ruining the floors!!"" I stood up for myself that time, but he never apologized for yelling at me.  
My mom is... different. She would always call my brother and I names growing up. Things like r3tard, idiot, dumb @ss, stupid, d!ck, b!tch, etc. She was always juuuuust kidding!! :))) when she called us those things, though, so she thought it was fine. However, because of my depression, these names never came across as amusing to me, and if I spoke up about it, I was called overly sensitive. She's also super passive aggressive- for example, if I try to talk to my dad about anything in the same room she's in, even if I'm whispering, she'll shush us, turn the TV up louder and louder, or even pause her show or music and sit in silence. That's when my dad tells me to stop talking. It makes me feel like I'm annoying.   
She and my dad both constantly tell me I'm a negative person. I'll try to tell them about a funny interaction I had online, or a social issue that's on my mind. Sure, I get passionate. Sure, sometimes the social issues can get me heated, because there's no easy answer and I don't like hearing about things that are unjust. But I always get shut down. They tell me not to spend my time thinking or talking about these things because I can't do anything about it so it's not productive. I've internalized that I'm a stupid, negative, unsuccessful b!tch.  
I never knew why I thought those things about myself until my therapist asked me why I thought that. We had been talking a lot about my parents that session, and their favoritism of my brother. It didn't all click until I came home that night. All my friends have told me I'm nice and funny. Hell, ex boyfriends have told me I'm a great person after we've fought and broke up (with no intention of reconnecting). The only people to call me negative, stupid, lazy, etc. are the same people telling me, ""Oh you can do whatever you put your mind to! You can be whatever you want! (As long as it's a medical equipment technician.)""  
I feel so... confused now that I'm realizing this. I mean, I don't think they hurt me on purpose. I don't think they know they've hurt me, either. And I don't want to say anything because my family has had a rough year and we're already on the verge of falling apart, so speaking my mind wouldn't be smart. It would probably be the breaking point, and since I'm unemployed, can't drive (I do have a license, and a car my dad cosigned on, but my driver's license was suspended bc of the seizure), live with them, and need their help financially once I go on to college (which they've promised), it'd essentially be shooting myself in the foot.  
They want to move us closer into town since we live on the outskirts of town- out of walking distance from any retail jobs and even any bus stops- so that I can have a job again and they can get out of debt from my dad's unemployment.  
My plan is to get a job when I get my license back, or when we move, (whatever comes first), work through the spring semester and the summer time and save money, then apply to a community college with a good music program across the state where rent is cheaper and get my AA in music while I work part time and continue saving. This way, I'll be away from them, but not super far away, and hopefully won't have to be reliant on them financially for very long. Once I have my AA, I'll have hopefully found a good four year college to double major in music and teaching. I plan on working on my music career throughout all this as well. However, my mom has poo poo'd the idea. She wants me to go to a four year, but won't help me research schools. All the good schools I've found from my limited research are way out of our price point and completely focused on performing arts (no teaching).  
I guess I have a couple of questions... How can I change what I think about myself? How can I survive the next year or so under their roof? They're not evil people, but it's hard for me not to feel kind of distant and resentful now. How do I plan for a future in college that I never imagined for myself? How can I start teaching myself music with no income and little financial help from my parents (they already pay a ton of money for me to see my therapist every week and they like holding that over my head.) Am I going to be okay, haha?

Note: What I’m about to share is something I’ve never told anyone in my 23 years life on this earth. I am so sorry to bring people mood down but I really don’t know who or where to turn to. Everywhere I look is a figurative wall with no windows or a door. Thank you so much for your time and for you input (if you decide to comment). Everything I’m about to say is 100% true. I am pouring everything I’ve kept in so excuse me for any grammatical error.


A little about me, I am an Asian American immigrant from Vietnam. My mother and I immigrated to the US when I was about 5 years old. We moved from house to house, state to state a couple of time literally every single year until middle school. (My mother does nails and apparently she needs to move for work. Idk why she needs to go to a different state for her job but when I was younger, I didn’t know/ask.) I was raised….normally?....I like to believe I was raised in a stereotypical Asian way. Pressure and expectation on grades were high else except I wasn’t given an instruction manual/advice how to get there. (i.e. no cram school or literally anything)
I remember that I would get beaten (with a clothe hanger, broomstick and sometimes get objects thrown at me-anything within grabbing distance) and put down mentally (1-3 hours of her talking) when I don’t do well in school. I remember when I was in 5th grade, I use to bring home weekly report card. In that report card there were regular grades (A-F) and “citizenship” score. (for those who do not know, its basically score on how well you behaved in class). I would consistently get good regular grades (All A’s if I remember right) but also consistently get an “S” for satisfactory. (Citizenship grade was ranked Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory, and Outstanding) “Outstanding” grade if I remember correctly was given to only 1-2 students in a class of 28-30 students? At the time I was young and like to interact and talk to my friends so the teacher note that down when I talk to my friends while the teacher was talking. My mother did not speak English well (at that time, not at all so she use a dictionary) and only focused on that part and think I did badly in school and no matter how I explained she did not listen. (she think I was lying) She then proceed to beat me every week and I remember at the height of it, after beating me should would take out old childhood photos of me back in Vietnam and she would literally ripped up every single picture. (I do not have any picture of my younger self) That is the type of person she is, she literally only remember one word or phrase that impacts her the most. In the report card, it was the citizenship grade and during an argument, she would filter out anyone who would disagrees with her and ONLY remember small word or sentence that agrees with her OR only talk to people who agree w/ whatever it is that they are talking about…. I’ve LITERALLY never seen a time where anyone convince her otherwise from her initial opinion. (no matter how wrong it might be) She would say those people do not know what they are talking about or they are “out to get” her.


Fast forward to middle school….high school….College….


I would love to continue telling my story (high school and college years, there is SO MUCH more and it gets SO MUCH worst) but I am afraid it might be too long and no one would read so I will end this here for now. Maybe if there are enough people who want to know the rest of this sad story, I would tell in another post…but I’ll get to the point of my post… I am about to graduate in a few months and will be out looking for a job. (Update: As you might imagine, things did not get better with my mother and I, maybe even worst.) But for a quite long while I keep thinking to myself of whether or not I should abandon her/cut her out of my life and run away. (I never had that option before because she would control every aspect of my life based on the fact that I have no money or friends. She made sure of that. She would let me get a job or see anyone.) I feel literally trapped and unable to get out… I cannot remember a time in my life that I was happy.


Am I selfish? Am I a bad person?


I see my friends and other people on youtube being happy and have family and friends that support them. I want something like that in my life where I can wake up every day feeling loved. I do not get that now. I wake up everyday feeling a heavy burden on my shoulders and head. During worst moments, I’ve thought about killing myself, but I feel like I should at least experience some happiness in my life? I want to run away and get a job somewhere, doesn’t matter where. IN a city or at in the middle of no where. I just want to get away and hopefully find good friends and live my life away from all the negativity. The only 2 things holding me back is this. I am scared that she would find me and mess up the life I would create. I am scared that the law wouldn’t protect me. Would the law require me to go back and take care of her? And second is that I really do love my mom. She isn’t the type to treat me like trash 100% of the time but only 90% at most…the other 10% she would treat me like any other mom. But that is where I am very conflicted and feel trapped. I would rather she neglect and abuse me 100% of the time so I can leave with an open conscious. I do not know what to do…. What I do know is that I will never find happiness living the way I am now. I yearn to breathe free...

52,"So, my childhood was a carnival of abuse and neglect, my relationships with my bio parents are terrible, and I'm basically just a big old bundle of Daddy issues. I spent lots of years in therapy ""getting over"" it, and everything was cool for over ten years. Then I met a fella who has kids. We've been together for just over six months, and I'm starting to feel crazy. When he talks about his kids, I get insanely jealous, not in any weird sex sort of way, but jealous that they get him as a father. I think back to how my own childhood was, and get profoundly depressed that he didn't raise me instead. It's to the point that my stomach hurts and I want to cry when he tells me good things that happen between him and his children, because I wish I was his child, so those good things would be a part of me. So now I'm just sitting here in a big old bucket of feelings, because not only am I suddenly fixating on the abuse and neglect in my head, but now I have this feeling of being robbed, and I can't stop desperately wishing to be his child.

60,"I don't really have trouble finding a job, I work in tech so I spend most of my time dodging recruiters when I'm happy with my job.

For the most part I've been pretty happy with my current job. But over the last six months to a year. I've become pretty un-enchanted with the projects my job offers.

So when I was feeling particularly upset with my current projects I updated my resume and sent it out. I've kind of have always wanted to live in NYC and there are really well paying jobs (even accounting for cost of living) that I'm qualified for so I sent it in. ""What's the harm?"" I thought. Additionally I take a slight pay cut for my particular part of tech compared to the average but I really wanted to be in this part of tech when I started.

So you're probably like ""What's the problem then?""

Well my current job I was like the 5th employee. Over the last couple years I've really helped to build the company. I'm really good friends with everyone there. The people are smart and friendly and dependable. They rely on me and I rely on them.

So while I take a slight pay-cut, I work with some really great people. But as I said before lately I've been getting pretty bored of the kind of work we do. So different parts of tech that pay more in a different city is pretty enticing.

The part I'm having trouble with is the social aspects of changing jobs. I watched one of the other original employees leave and everyone was really upset about it. So when I sent in that resume I felt kind of guilty. Like I was letting everyone down. Eventually I got a call back and did a few phone interviews which made me feel even more guilty. And probably next week I'll have to do an on site interview where I take a day off to head to NYC.

They've said before whenever someone leaves to ""Talk to us if you're unhappy"" But I haven't worked out a way to do that without being like ""Make me happy or I'm bailing"" which would be professionally sensical but from a friend's point of view ""kind of a dick move"". 

On some level I don't think there's projects I can be happy on. We usually have meetings about prospective deals and things and nothing has really piqued my interest. 

So now I'm sitting at maximum levels of guilt trying to figure out how to proceed. On one hand I've got work I'm not too happy about that pays less than average but it's with really friendly and trustworthy people. And on the other hand I have a job in a city I really like that pays more.

So I guess I'm looking for advice on two things.

  1. How to talk to my boss / friend about how I'm not happy with my job
  2. How to leave a job without making good friends upset.

1) I really don’t like aroma cigarettes leave behind. I have kissed this girl and it just kind of bothers me and takes away from the feeling of kissing and being intimate. 

2) I don’t know if this would cause people to judge us if we ever dated. 

3) I don’t want to get addicted to cigarettes. I don’t really buy them, like I said above... but whenever I would get a chance (before i stopped smoking) I would bum cigarettes off people. 

This may sound dumb all together... but I just wanna hear what y’all have to say... Maybe there is someone out there that went through this? Maybe someone could give me advice on how to help her quit? Im just kind of confused about all of this right now and wanted to get some thoughts.

64,"**My Life**

I am currently 20 years old, despite scraping through high school I made the decision to go to University. 

When making my decision to go to university I just thought that I would choose a career path that would get me a job. The career path I chose unfortunately held my number one weakness,  mathematics (calculus). 

Now as I am failing courses like calculus I find myself completely lost and have no idea what I should do anymore. The older I get I realize how little time I have to get myself together so I've come to ask for advice on what others think I could/should be doing. 

**Feedback**

Compared to many of the posts here my problem really does seem petty but please share any thoughts you have. I am aware that Rule 1 of this subreddit says ""Be Nice"" but for this one post just say what you think. I am currently facing reality and am willing to take any criticisms.",01Nov2017,1

69,"I (25F) recently made a new friend (30F) at a new job. When I first started there she suggested that we go out together with her husband and my boyfriend. About 2 months passed and we never ended up doing anything, but I was still interested. She wasn’t much of a texter and because of our schedules I only see her like twice a week for only a few minutes, so I felt slightly discouraged because I would send her a text every once in a while and she’d send back very short replies. Anyways, a few weeks ago I run into her at work and she invited me to her daughters birthday party at her house, which she was not inviting any other coworkers to. I ended up going and had a good time, and she said shed like to get together again soon. This time I initiated, and we ended up going out for drinks with her husband and friend the folllowng week. She was texting me more every day,  We had a lot of fun out together, and I thought we were getting closer. However, starting from the day after we went out  she hasn’t initiated any texts, when I text her she answers with short replies and seems disinterested. I feel very discouraged now. I thought I finally had a friend (New city, new job). I don’t want to seem so desperate, but I kind of am because my job AND this city fucking blowwws. 

Any advice on making friends and reading people???


TLDR: new friend doesn’t text me much anymore and seems disinterested after a really fun night out together, confused. ",01Nov2017,1

There was this halloween dance and the strangest thing just happened. We never talk irl but talk on snapchat. But then as the night's ending, he suddenly talks to me asking how i'm doing. I said ""Good"" (shocked expression wide eyes). Then he said that's good and left me there behind wondering what the hell just happened. So exactly what should i do the next time i see him? He seems like a shy guy, but the thing is, i'm shyer and i'm hella socially awkward. I know how nerve-wracking it is to make a move, and I don't ever want to lose him or push him away.

75,So I've been seeing a guy lately. We aren't official on his terms and i have been bringing it up for a while. He isn't quite over his last relationship but we act like a couple. Such as kissing and having sex and cuddling and act romantically unlike any FWB i've ever been in. So I go to parties alone every friday and saturday and usually get pretty shit faced drunk in all honesty. While at one of these parties I met his friend and we had sex that same night at the same party. His friend asked that I keep it a secret because he doesn't want to come in between anything as well as his own friendship. I said fine and went on. Then I went to a different party and ended up sleeping with 2 more people and one of them was another one of his friends. keep in mind I didn't know all these guys were friends with him. When we found out we again agreed to not say anything. anyway the next day he literally asked if his friend saw my tits and that was when I just told him everything that happened rather than lie to him. But we weren't a couple because he didnt want to date me. He wasn't even mad that it was his friends he just told me that it broke his heart that I would sleep with other people. Like I am supposed to wait forever for him to change his mind. But does this count as cheating?,01Nov2017,1
77,"I work as a security guard and about a month and a half ago, a tenant who was moving out left a pair of sunglasses for her friend to pick up. I told her we are not allowed to hold onto stuff for non-residents, but the tenant said they would be here in the next hour to pick it up. That hour turned into a day, and that day a week. We now reach the present time, a month and a half later.

So I figured the person was never gonna come back for it, and since it was placed in the lost-and-found box, it should be ok to take. But I don't know, this still feels immoral. If I took this sunglasses, is it considered stealing? Should I return them back? All advice is appreciated, thanks.",01Nov2017,7

79,"Since my first job at McDonald's, I have worked in the customer service oriented field. My path has brought me to hospitality, specifically front desk work. I am good at my job, but I am dying on the inside. Dealing with nonsense that I really don't give a shit about is extremely tiring. My job fatigues me mentally and emotionally, and I receive very little reward for my labors. 

Truly, I think what I hate dealing with is the people. I cannot feel empathy for some of the petty bullshit that they fuss over. That is, unfortunately, the nature of hospitality. Management themselves even tells us to ""Smile, even when you don't want to. Over the phone and in person, a smile goes a long way. Fake it until you make it."" Well, an insincere smile is easily detected, in my opinion. Plus, I don't give a shit about most of the problems that arise at the front desk. The stress is so unnecessary; I have enough to deal with outside of work. 

Now that I'm done ranting, allow me to get to my point: What can I do now that I am considering leaving hospitality? I only have customer service experience. Although my years in customer service have allowed me to develop certain skills which I will always be thankful for, it is just about the only skill I have. I would rather not deal with customers as I have in the past. 

Thank you for your suggestions. ",01Nov2017,1
80,"Ok, so about 9 months ago my fiancé and I moved in with his parents ( his biological mom and his much younger step dad) we were pregnant at the time, and everything was going really well until I had my son. It's been six months since I had my baby ( we are currently saving up a lot of money to move out) and things are good with everyone but my father in law . He's a super health nut, so he's constantly judging everyone including me and my fiancé when it come to what we eat/ how much we work out, he has MS, and some we assume he gets a lot of mood swings from it. He's also an ex cop, and talks a lot of shit about my fiancée family, including his step children that live with us ( that really pisses me off because their dad, not my fiancés, died when they were both very little, so they have some issues) and he treats my mother in law, like crap. For example, she likes to go out with her friends and family, and have a good time, a few drinks and some dancing, but he refuses to go with her every time she asks, and when she gets home he gets upset and yells at her for not spending time with him. All he freaking does is go to the gym, or sit on the couch with his iPad, he never wants to do anything, unless it involves hanging out with his mother, or his one and only creepy as fuck friend who makes super pedo remarks about my fiancés 14 year old sister. Now recently this piece of shit has even making my life very hard, for instance, my baby son just started solids,  and I make my own baby food ( it's cheaper) but every time I buy the fruit or vegetables to make it, almost all of it is gone before I can make the food, because that asshole eats it, and if I say anything he tells me it's his house so he can do whatever he wants. He also went on a rampage yesterday about how his wife puts all of her kids and our son, her grandson, first before him and how he thought that was all bullshit and that he should come first before everyone else. I really wish my mother in law would just leave him, he's the type of person who will only buy food for himself and not his step kids when the wife is away out of town for work, instead my fiancé and I have had to buy them dinner, or go grocery shopping to feed them and us. He basically doesn't think about anyone other than himself and it's driving me insane, and tonight, we took our son trick or treating with his cousins, and no one was at home except the asshole, well we have two doggies that stay in a kennel in our room when no one is home, he was home for six hours, and didn't let them out once, and we suspect he might do this all the time, I just really could appreciate some ways to keep my sanity while living here, we move out in two months, but it's gotten to the point where I find myself searching how to make someone who has MS's life harder, and I daydream about crushing laxatives and mixing them into his protein powder, and pre workout.  I would never actually do those things, but he really is the type of person I genuinely wouldn't care if something bad happened to him, when he goes on and on about how he used to pull people over or arrest people just for fun, or because he didn't like the looks they gave him, it really really pusses me off.

83,"There are a few songs that I can't listen to because it is too painful.I don't listen to them actively (obviously), but they are somewhat popular and are often played at events.

I can't listen to Respect by Aretha Franklin because it has been seared into my memory with some very serious unpleasantness in middle school. This was 14 years ago now. Long story short, it involves unrequited love from a girl (who is now a good friend), some very severe bullying, and a massive sense of failure/inferiority for not making the show choir team.

Sky Full of Stars by Coldplay and Goodnight and Go by Imogen Heap were mine and my ex's songs. We would sing them to each other often. While it was extremely pleasant at the time, it is now very painful because she  left me very abruptly last year for another man.

87,"Little bit of backstory.... I really feel like I haven’t done anything in my life at all. Nothing has been good for a long time. Bad things happened to me when I was in sophomore year of high school &amp; it has been worse ever since then. 

I’m not in college &amp; haven’t been in college yet. I had 1 stupid job at Home Depot for about a year &amp; a half or so, maybe a little more &amp; I hated it but kept at it to make a few dollars. I was the guy outside pushing carts too, not selling anything like a cashier. 

But anyways, for quite a few years I’ve always thought about joining the Navy. My dad joined the Navy in his senior year of high school &amp; went to Naval Academy at 18 when he graduated. I compare myself to him a lot &amp; now my brother is catching up to me in life &amp; a senior now &amp; going to a college when he graduates. I have done nothing, none of that. All I did was push carts at HD which isn’t even anything at all. Don’t have a girlfriend or any friends. 

So my main question is how do I take action? I’m really bad at committing to something &amp; having the motivation to keep going. I also never get out of the house. I still live with my parents &amp; brother &amp; just play video games for hours &amp; hours every single day &amp; go on this dumb iPad for hours every single day. 

So my path is either the Navy or college. I’m really not sure what to do. I have no friends at all, no social life, never go out of the house even if it’s the grocery store (my mom always goes), &amp; can’t get out of the hole I’m in. I know my life isn’t tough but how do I get myself a push to get going immediately &amp; just be normal? Having no friends is brutal for me &amp; I feel like I’m just going to keep playing video games &amp; doing nothing every day. 

I’ve had a bad cough for over a month now &amp; it won’t stop so joining the Navy would be difficult now. I’ve already been to the recruiter 3 times &amp; still not joined. Idk what it would be like. I never talk to my parents about what I will do in my life. I don’t want to talk to them.

90,"Hi people of /r/advice,

Back story I was in a mostly online relationship from 14-18 until we attended the same college and then were together until I was 20.

We broke up, that was fine but even in the relationship I struggled to focus on it and felt that I just needed time to myself quite often.

Since becoming single I'm yet to have any interest in a relationship or finding a partner, I'm now 22 and I enjoy my life of working, going home and relaxing/spending time on my own and occasionally hanging out or playing games with friends. I don't see how I could maintain the constant activity involved in a relationship and I don't feel lonely or like I need one.

The issue is that I feel like I should want these things and that it's expected from family. That the next step after graduating university and finding a full time job would be to find a partner, settle down and live happily ever after (or something like that).

Am I still just young and eventually this will change? Anyone have similar experiences or feelings?

His wife has a very big and ‘supportive’ family. 


It was my birthday today, I had a very small dinner with him and his wife, and my SO. It was quick, yet enjoyable. Small store-bought cake and a little card.

At first everything was OK, but now that a month has passed, I got more enemies than friends...

I will admit that I acted foolish on purpose the first few weeks, just to break the ice. I basically started making people make fun of me so they could see me as someone friendly and funny. Worst idea ever, they were too dumb to see that I was just acting like a fool... 

Now people think I'm stupid and keep hating on me even tho I did nothing to them. And this gave me alot of enemies, that were supposed to be potential friends. One of them is a pretty good person who I'd rather make peace with, but don't know how to do so, he's a jerk to me.

So what should I do? I wanna change my image and make people see me as a good person, not everyone's pick to make fun of. I think one reason is that I barely react and most of the time just ignore them or laugh it off. Trust me I know how stupid they are and don't wanna get in fights with immature kids.

109,"I used to believe and support democratic socialism and would donate to charities and I would help other people and so on. But the more time I spend on this earth, the more I get fed up with all other humans. 


The two main problems that I have with humans are that they are either unwise or they are bad persons. And because of this, I've stopped doing all those beneficial things I mentioned in the beginning. Now I think capitalism and caring only about yourself is the best. Weak people have to try to survive on their own. I have no desire to help someone weak because weak people aren't any better than any other people. And if I'm fed up with people in general that I'm fed up with weak people as well. 


The thing is, if I know that for example, someone that is stupid, who does evil things because they don't understand it's evil, they think they are doing good things and mean well... I can try to enlighten that person... I've tried doing this with thousands of people by now I'm sure but they are all too stupid to understand logic and reasoning, well then what can you do? Should you keep showing kindness and giving them your help, no punishment when they continue doing bad things because they are so stupid? 


Then there's also the people who actually know that they are doing bad things and they don't care. Being evil makes life so much easier when you can take advantage of everyone.

113,"Hello!

First of all, I'm new to reddit so if I say or do anything wrong or not allowed please let me know. This is gonna be pretty long and I don't know if that's allowed but I really need advice so eh, here we go.

I was brought up in an eastern society in which everyone (especially my family) believes that girls should always have a parent or a husband as a guardian, meaning they don't ever really have independence unless their family is dead or something. Thus, my entire life I was raised on the belief that they will always control me, especially my mother. My parents are divorced and I live with my mother. My father is not as controlling at all and much more flexible, but he doesn't really go against my mother's wishes because she'd make everyone's lives hell and he's not ready to deal with her or stand up to her, even for me. I'm 18 years old and I'm not allowed to speak to males, she disapproves of every female friend who does not follow her religion 100%, she does not allow me to take a cab or bus alone and I have to ask for her permission every time I go anywhere, be it 20 minutes or 2 minutes away (she does not allow me to go to the movies or anywhere that's more than half an hour away unless escorted by a family member), wherever I go I have to call her when I get there and get back home by 7 pm or she'd start yelling at me and insulting me and stay mad for days. If she gets really mad she hits my head or slaps me hard or threatens to beat me with a metallic pole. Once she held a lighter to my hand and threatened to burn my hand if I ever stepped out of line. She yells at me if I laugh too loud, starts shouting if I stay up at night and sleep in sometimes eventhough I don't have anything to do right now. (Not allowed to get a job)

Don't get me wrong, if she does attempt to follow through on her threats (the burning or the pole) I would fight back because that might bring me permanent damage. Otherwise, everyone just tells me they're empty threats and she's just being protective because she's my mother and they don't take me seriously. Dad lives with my relatives and I can't move in with him. My three older brothers have the liberty to give me orders, insult me and yell at me and I'm not allowed to talk back (one of them lives with us currently). They used to watch me take severe beatings as a child and do nothing, feel nothing (they were adults then, but too broke to move out). I had to endure listening to her yell and rant for weeks when I got a bank account to save for college. (Stuff like ""don't go thinking you have any independency"" and ""I wish I listened to your brothers when they told me you are too rebellious and have a mean heart a few years ago""). I could go on forever.

Now, the only reason I'm saying all this is to let you know why I HAVE to move for university and also to make you understand that in my society it is not as easy as ""you're an adult, you can do whatever you want"". It's nearly impossible for me to stand up to my mother because I have been living like this my entire life and I haven't really known anything else. Every time she glares I cower and become unable to say anything or stand up for myself or express my opinion. In my country I'm legally an adult at 18 but no law enforcement will really protect me if I go against her wishes and something bad happens. (In my area husbands shoot their wives with no repercussions) So with all due respect, please don't oversimplify things.

Now, I have a few choices as to what I can do for university. (I'm majoring in Chemical Engineering and starting Spring Semester)

1. Go to AUB, arguably the best university in my country but also the most expensive. I'd have to pay around $13k/year after deducting FA and minor loans. If I do this, I will share a small apartment with my friend next to the university, but it's a fairly expensive area and I'd end up paying around $500 a month for rent, water and electricity for a tiny shared apartment if I'm lucky (still cheaper than dormitories). Our financial situation is bad but my father says he can manage, to make up for the years I have lived in this house. The problem is, my mother would get very, VERY angry with this (she would start saying I'm an ungrateful brat and don't care about her but only care about my dad) and once I get past that, there's the fact that the university (and thus, the apartment I'd get) is a 45 minute drive from my home. My brother just got a car so I have no doubt she'd start asking him to drive her to my apartment every week unexpectedly because in her eyes I'm a child and can't be trusted, she'd worry that I'm befriending guys or dressing inappropriately or not following her religious practices carefully or whatever. She'd make me promise to spend the weekends at home (I don't doubt she'd show up at my door fuming if I don't do it, and my country isn't exactly big on calling the cops so that won't work).

2. Travel to study in Iran: The university I have in mind in Tehran is good from what I've heard (and cheap) but I'm not a fan of the country and I'd have to live with at least 3 other strangers in my dorm room who might not even speak a language I know or the country's language. I'm quite introverted and though I can adapt to living anywhere, I don't think I'm ready to give up all my alone time. Also, a big portion of my entertainment and lifestyle comes from American products (movies, books, etc) and stores which are mostly banned there, and I don't really like their replacements. I'd have to actually start learning in Fall 2018 as I'd have to spend Spring 2018 learning the language (which, by the way, I tried to learn for 5 years in school but just really disliked). Rentals are pretty expensive. In this case, I'd have to come back home in summers and in semester breaks. So while I'd mostly be away from home I don't think I'd be happy there. I don't wanna sound picky, I just don't know if I can deal with the cultural/political environment there.

3. Go to Sydney and live with my uncle: I would do this in a heartbeat if it weren't for the fact that tuition in Australian universities is around $25k+ and as an international student I don't have much FA options. We definitely can't afford that much. I also don't think I have enough time left to apply (my dad only recently informed me he would be fine with this option). This would be also the most angering option for my mother; girls traveling alone is almost blasphemy for her as it is, let alone staying with my uncle there who she hates.

So these are my options. I don't really know what to do as all of them have major pros and cons. They're my only options because dad is paying and these are the only options he's agreed to consider in general. I know it may sound like I'm whining too much or being too picky for my situation, but I don't want to make a wrong decision for my future just to get away from home; and I literally cannot put up of staying with my mother for four more years. I have unbelievably low self esteem and am insecure about everything, and little to no independence. I can barely talk to strangers, I don't know how to do anything because my mom has never allowed me to stop living as a child or do things alone. I need to change and grow into my own person and stop her from controlling my every move because frankly I'm not ready to keep being anxious, depressed and wanting to die 24/7. It's turning me into this bitter, hateful person that I've been trying so hard not to be.

119,"So I got into some trouble and it made me go unemployed for 2 years. I got my expungement and it is being processed in 2 weeks and I’m officially free! 


Around the 2 years I’ve been doing different courses for programming and doing one currently for freecodecamp. I’m also looking into becoming an insurance adjuster, mainly for the money. There’s a class for 2 weekends only that is offering the 6-20/3-20 accredited adjusters license in December 2-10, it’s from 8am-6:30pm just for Sat/Sunday’s. 


I have been applying to any jobs and none has called me back. It’s not even because of my record but I just haven’t gotten any callbacks. There’s this one job that my friend can get me in and it’s at a National Park taking care of the tickets. It’s a 8:30-5 (or 6 for overtime) job and it pays $14/hr. I’ll be getting $500-$600 weekly pretty much. The thing is, this place has no benefits at all. It’s just a go in to work, go home, go to work again. 


I have absolutely no money. I don’t even have any money for the class nor can my parents even help me. The class is $459 which isn’t bad. But the fact that I’ve been unemployed so long and now I have the chance to work again, I’m in a dilemma of whether or not I should just work first to save up money. 


The problem with the job is that I don’t have weekends off. And apparently it’s too hard to get it off, let’s say I work there and I’m already asking for 2 weekends off on my first month of the job. It just doesn’t look good. But no one has called me yet at all.... maybe because of my experience? I’ve only had 2 jobs where I was a sales associate. Both for retail, one was for a year and the other was seasonal. I’ve graduated school and got my BA in psychology.

122,"I'm sure this is a story as old as time, but hear me out. A friend and I are in college this year, but in HS, our shtick was being the sweet/genuine kids. We avoided crazy parties because we had a better time making our own fun, yet we were well-liked enough that it was a conscious choice to not go wild (as opposed to not having the option at all and making our own fun our of necessity). Obviously there were more facets to our friendship than that, but that's the relevant part.

Now that we're freshmen, I feel like they're changing. They talk about how they don't like frat culture, but post snapchat stories that are clearly at frat/sorotity parties--butthey'll say they just went to dance. They bring up that they still enjoy finding things to do that don't rely on drinking, but their friends usually look like they've had quite a bit to drink, and that's different from what I've known.

I've always had friends that drank/smoked/partied/etc., so it's not like I'm judging them for that specifically by any means, but I guess it stings that I feel like I'm being lied to, especially about something that doesn't seem like the person I knew would do. I totally get people change in college, but I would rather just hear them say they're trying something new or having a crazy first semester than lie about something stupid that makes me feel like we can't honestly talk about our lives anymore. And maybe I'm being too nosey, but we've always been pretty involved in each other's lives, so it's weird to hear them sound so sincere and then seemingly just go against it.

I guess I'm not sure if it's the kind of deal where I should ""talk it out with them since I value the friendship and want to set the record straight,"" or if ""people change in college, and it's not your business what they choose to tell you or not tell you.""",01Nov2017,1
123,"I'll try to be as synthetic as I can.
Me and my brother have to split the properties of my father.
We have the family house, a second house and a piece of land.
He is over 30 and he got a solid curriculum, he works and does not have money problems. I'm over 20, currently unemployed and studying.
Possible option:
1) Live together in the first house, sell everything else and split the money (almost) equally.
2) I take the land or the second house.

Now, consider that:
Legally he owns everything, while I do not own anything and can't sue him if he for any reason decides to not split (now we can because my father is still alive and he's acting as a pacifier).
The second house is just an asset, is far away from working areas and likely I won't live there. The land probably will increase in value over time.
So, should I take the land or the second house or it is best for me to stay in the family and split the money?
If I stay I know that he'll be in charge of almost any decision for us, he's stubborn and relentless. But together at least we can solve any problem coming from the ""outside"" world.
If I take the land or the house I may lose part of the money, because they may be necessary for any illness of my father or other tragedies, but to me seems to be the best possible scenario: I get something of my own (land or house), the possibility to stay in the first house while my father is still alive and I get the choice to sell my properties and go wherever I want to go later on, and my father can help me with money while he's still alive; the worst scenario in this case is that we get in a fight and I have to leave the first house, while not having any working background, losing part or all of the money of my father and ending up with a useless land or a house distant from working places.

131,"This past year I noticed my friends have been doing a lot behind my back. I also noticed one of my friends only reaches out to me when the other friend is out of town or hanging out with another friend. My “group” has moved on without me. 

In August, my friends sent out a text in our group chat asking who wants to go to the migos and future concert. I quickly responded “I wanna go” And everyone else wanted to go. The night before the concert I reach out to my friend and asked if he he was going.  No response. I ask the other friend the next day if he was going and he responded  “yeah.” I ask him what time” he said “around 4” and I said “word” assuming he’d give me a ride because they know for a fact my parents won’t drop me off and that I don’t have a ride. After messaging that friend I asked the friend I texted the night before and he said he isn’t going. 

An hour later, I see on Snapchat that the whole group is there and I message my friend who said he wasn’t going. “Why’d you go without me?”

He responded “I changed my mind about going, and we didn't know you needed a ride”

I responded “How was I supposed to get there? You guys didn’t even reach out to me. I had to reach out to you guys about this”

He responded “1. By asking for a ride
2. We forgot
*friend 2* said he'd be here at 4 and you said ""word""”

I responded “I thought he’d be here by 4. Did you know what I meant by that?”

He responded “He meant he'd be at the fair at 4”

I responded “have a great time guys” 

And they said “next time ask for a ride” 
I said again “have a great time guys”

After this they talked to me less and treated me more like shit.



Today at the library I ask friend 1 and 2 about letter of recommendation and they give me a good response to the question. And they just talked to each other the entire morning. When Friend 1 is talking about some girl I ask who he’s talking about and he doesn’t tell me. He told me these things like 10 weeks ago. They don’t even try to talk to me and a couple minutes ago I was heading to class with them and I walk by one of my favorite teachers  room and I was saying “I wonder if *teacher name*” and Friend 1 cuts me off and says “this better not be about letter of recommendation. You always mention This when you walk by his room.” I said “I wasn’t gonna even ask that. I was gonna ask if he heard about the Tony Podesta scandal.” And friend 2 said “who cares. Trumps 95% bad” and I said “no he isn’t. There’s no evidence of collusion” and the friend 2 said “ I  agree hillary is 100% bad I give trump credit for the 5%” I said there’s no evidence of collusion. both said “believe what you want man” 

Politics aside, this isn’t a political debate I need advice, they know I’m a trump supporter and one of them liked trump too but it’s weird how he turned on me. It’s like they’re belittling me now.

He always tells me how bad im or i dont know things and he does. And he can speak with me only when he needs something. If he dont need my knowledge, he just say hi to me and thats it. But if he needs something he lick my butt. If i dont know something he bashes me ""this is what you learnt in school no wonder why you dont have a job"". Or raises his voice or stressing me. If i done his petty chores its just done. Sometimes he burps a thank you, thats it.i even made a logo what he starts to use as a brand and makes money from it. I got nothing. My sister is his favourite because she get his chores done. But he speaks with you like your boss. Sometimes comes in at 8 pm or 9 and ""i need to get this done now(its his hobby stuffs).

He ruined several pc-s, my mothers phone, my ipod because he thaught he can fix it and literally pushed buttons. He didnt even looked up a tutorial, nothing. Just pure guessing. Now he reseted our router because internet wasnt available and of course he f...d it up. He thinks he is god and he knows all the things in the world. Aaaaalllofiiiit. Smart.ass.. That guy dont even know which shocks is his. Always wearing mine because those where in his wardrobe...wtf?

I cant tell you how much i hate his vibes, his being. I hate when he comes home, his voice. When i was a kid i was so happy to him but one of my first memory is he arguing me (i was 11 lol) on something what should be handled on his side with a simple ""you are right"". I was just a kid and he argued with me.

I cant move out because of money issues but since i was 11 i hate him and its starts to be worse. I want to stand up and tell my things to him or just no dude, f off and leave me. ",01Nov2017,0

I understand why he did it. He had told me before. I thought that he was feeling better. Seemed happier. Some songs--which I love(d)--bring back bittersweet memories. Halloween this year, he never got to experience it. Nor christmas. Nor any more holidays after that.

I pay for most of my things, and the things I don't I could take over, except for the horse.

So my problem is that when I want to do something my mom disagrees with, she holds the fact she pays for the horse over my head. At 23 I want to go out with friends, or spend the night at my boyfriends, or other young adult stuff. If she says no and I pick a fight she'll just mention how she pays for stuff and I have to do what she wants.
I don't know how to deal with this. I love this horse, so I'd rather be a hostage like this than sell him, but I don't know how to bring up not being treated like I'm 12, and in debt to her.
Also, I feel like even if we did come to an agreement for small things, any large decision she didn't agree with, she'd pull the same move.

157,"Hello Reddit,

         I'm a 23 year old male working full time and going to school part time to graduate with a bachelors this upcoming spring.  I'm currently living in an apartment with 2 other guys, one who's my age and one that is a few years older, for a little over 2 months.  I'm only living here until May of next year when I graduate and get a new job somewhere else but I have a problem.

So my older roommate is also the ""landlord"" (I put it in quotes because technically, I guess, his parents own the property but he maintains it and his name is on the rent check every month so I don't know).  A couple weeks ago he go a puppy which I'm happy for him.  However, this dog is destructive as f***, which I get I've had puppies in the past.  This normally would not be a problem but he doesn't even try to train the dog.  All three of us work full time then have something to fill in the gaps (me: school, landlord: MMA, other guy: girlfriend), so none of us are ever really home.  Nevertheless, the landlord cannot be home to train the dog so it is left on its own pretty regularly and we all come home to stuff chewed and ""puddles and landmines"" EVERYWHERE.  

Normally, I would just shut more door and say, ""not my dog, not my problem,"" however today's my day off and my landlord texted me asking me to hang out with his dog and walk him and take him out for nothing.  In this stage of my life, I really don't have the time or desire to be raising a puppy and to be, quite frank, I don't think he does either, which didn't stop him from spending $2,500 on this dog, not including vaccines, vet visits, food, etc.  

The reason this is coming up today is because my other, non-landlord roommate has given his months notice today and he confided in me that part of the reason he is moving out is because of the dog.  I don't really know this roommate too well because we never see each other and I did not know him before moving in, but I don't see him as the type to not be a dog person.  Just someone with the same feeling I do that neither of us have the time or desire to raise and train someone else's puppy for free.  Although I don't want to uproot and move in the middle of the school year, I don't want to live with this puppy anymore even for only 7 months.

What do you think?  Should I follow suite and put in my notice today or should I just stick it out until I graduate in May?  Thank you in advance for all of your help I really appreciate it.",01Nov2017,1

162,"This may be a bit much for this sub so i apologize for the long post. 

Ive been having some issues lately involving myself, and some problems my mother probably caused. 

To start, my mother wasnt there. I was raised almost entirely by my father. I grew up being told that my mother, who i only saw once per year, was basically garbage. 
She used to party into her 30's even while i was 4-5 years old, passing me off to different family members and my father on weekends (before i began living with him). 
 
I was too young to understand just what she did at parties. To this day my imagination can run wild. My mother and grandmother used to have screaming matches in the house and i never understood what they fought about being so young. To this end, i came to recognize that my mother was not around and often was around other family members more than her because she would disappear for days at a time. I remember times where i would beg her to not go partying because i wanted her around. 

Eventually my father got custody of me. Things became more stable, more secure. I often wondered about my mother but she maybe called twice per year or came to see me once per year on the holidays. My father always tried to make me like my step mother who wasnt as bad as my biological mother but we couldn't quite connect on a lot of levels. To this day i cant connect with her. 

Now, 15 years after i moved with my dad, im 20 years old i have my own life, i have a beautiful girlfriend and things are happening on my terms. 

However this is where the aforementioned issues come into play. My girlfriend is a very kind, loving and assuring person. We have been together for one year this month and the future looks good. However ive noticed that i take issues with things shes done in the past. Nothing ridiculous. She has a few ex's and has been drunk and has smoked weed. These are things that i have done, (this is my first relationship though) and these facts about her past shouldnt bother me but they do. I really wish i could get past this. The emotions that come into play are a combination of worry, questioning about her past and regret that shes done these things. Again, shes not a drunk and she doesnt sleep around nor is she an outright stoner. But it still bothers me. It does when i think of most females doing this too. I really wish i could move past this but i cant and those emotions give me a lot of anxiety. 

If anyone has experiences like this or getting over similar things, any help would be very much appreciated.

I apologize for the long post but this is a problem that has been around for years and im just now thinking about it in depth. ",01Nov2017,1
163,"I was never really racist growing up.  I noticed differences and if I saw a minority or anybody acting aggressive or dressed in ragged clothing I'd be cautious or put my guard up.

169,"Hello!

I'm after a bit of general advice and I'm hoping that somebody out there has gone through the same thing as me. I'm 23 years old and currently working in retail. I work as an assistant manager of a well known shoe shop and, though I enjoy it, it's not what I'm hoping to stick to. I have a few ideas of what I'd like to do with my life, but I'm having trouble going about getting into them or starting off, because I've never really had the support or the encouragement to do so.

Let me start off by saying I have GCSEs and a PPP in a BTEC Level 3 Ext Diploma in Forensic Science. I never went to university due to family issues at the time and I always sort of struggled in school and never applied myself, and I feel that at this point, universities won't accept me due to my low grades. I have little skills and barely any hobbies, so I'm not sure what I want.

There are two things, though, that I've always been keen in doing with my life. One is that I would like to be a barber. I've never cut anybodys hair before and my parents always kind of laughed at the idea because I probably won't be very good, but still. I've looked up courses for it and the intensive ones look to be around £3000 and full time. I'm on an awful wage and live with a friend in a flat that costs around half of my earnings each month, so I won't be able to afford this without taking out a loan. Due to it being a full time course, I will have to quit my job in order to attend, so it's basically impossible at this point.

The other thing I've always wanted to do is start my own business, but everytime I mention it, I get laughed at. I want to start up my own mobile gin-based cocktail bar. I want to buy an old horse trailer and convert it into a fully functional bar that I can take to festivals in the summer and maybe weddings and other events throughout the rest of the year. Once again, money is an issue here, and a business loan will have to be taken out. Plus I'd have to look at licensing and laws and everything else, but I wouldn't know where to start. I'd have no clue who to talk to about it, or where I can get business advice from. 

Would anybody be able to point me in the right direction? Would taking out a loan for either of these be worth it, or would I be screwing myself over big time? And do either of these options even seem viable or realistic? I've never been much of a risk taker, but I don't want to be stuck in retail and working for somebody else my whole life. That's what I dread!",01Nov2017,1

I've always been very shy and timid but people always say I'm a sweet person.  So why does no one want to be my friend then?  Growing up when I tried to make friends and was sad because I didn't have any, people would say I wasn't trying hard enough...so I would try harder to no avail - still no friends.  Now they said I was trying to hard.  I've never been able to find that middle ground that's just right.  I know attractiveness has a lot to do with it so I have that going against me, but I've known some people who aren't that attractive that are still popular.  I don't want a million friends, I know that a few deep friendships is better than a ton of shallow ones, but I don't have either.
When my boyfriend and I started dating it was just us - he only hung out with me and I pretty much only hung out with him except for occasionally hanging out with one friend who isn't in my life anymore.  It's frustrating to see how easy it is for him to make friends.  I've been at school for a few years and have made no friends - I try talking to people in class and they're just not into it.  The only people that talk to me are people that have to talk to me, and usually only when they need help.  He's been at school for a few months and already has 2 or 3 friends that text him all the time and they hang out.  I've been working at my job for a few years and it's a very small business and my coworkers are all middle aged women.  He tends to jump from job to job and this latest one he's been at a few months and he already has at least 10 friends that text and snapchat him all the time, and he hangs out with them at least twice a week.
What can I do? I feel like whenever I try to make a friend or talk to people they're completely uninterested.

179,"Let's go back a few years before the situation i'm in now. So, during my first year in college I get a call while I'm in my dorm. It's my dad. I haven't spoke to my dad since I moved away from California, when I was 8 years old at the time. It was unexpecting, and I didn't really know how I felt about him calling me. Apparently he found me and my mom on facebook. So the only way I know how he got my number was through my mom. 




Nevertheless, I talk to him. During this talk he was barraging me with information about my older sister and my older brother, whom I never met. I found my older brother through FB, and we managed to become good friends. Mainly because we both play League of Legends. I added him and his fiance, and played a couple games with him. Fun stuff.




Then he told me about my older sister. Now, I knew I had an older sister but I didn't know anything about her. She's only 2 months older than me. Despite not knowing each other, we actually lived dangerously close to each other. We both ended up moving from California to (insert state here) around the same time. We actually lived close in California too. Anyway, I talked to her on Facebook, but she doesn't use that as much. We ended up following each other on instagram, snapchat. She's probably the closest sibling I have. We both met each other face to face around my 2nd year in college when she was attending (insert school here) in Cali.




Now let's get to the present where my problem is.




So while I'm on Facebook, I get a message. This woman, my father's ex, messaged me talking about my two younger sisters that I haven't seen since I was about, 6 or 7. I really want to see them since they're going to (insert college here), which is close to my place. However, I have nothing, and I repeat, nothing to do with their mother. Her mother is, in my opinion, best friends with the devil himself. She has made attempts to fuck up my mom's, my grandma's and apparently my older sister's mom's life up due to the fact that SHE believed that we should be her children and not our mothers. When I told my sister about this, she said that she doesn't want anything to do with our younger sisters since she believes that their mother might have fucked their head up, making them crazy. When I told my mom and grandma about this, they both got angry and didn't want me to talk to her. 




I'm in an emotional situation right now, where I want to speak to them, but at the same time I don't want their mother to know about it. Their mom said that they have a snapchat, but I think she's trying to trick me into asking her for the information. 




There are some ways as to how I think I should go about this, but I'm not sure if it's a good decision. One of my ideas is to ask my brother. I'm not sure if he knows their snapchat, but I do know that he's seen them as recently as last year so he may have something. The problem with that is that I don't know how he and my sister's mom are. I don't want him telling her about what I'm trying to do. 




Another idea is to talk to my dad and ask him for their information. Or at least try. The problem with that is that I have his number blocked for various reasons that I don't feel like talking about here. That's a different story. Not just me, but my older sister as well. 




One of my friends who I told about the situation is to just let it go, and hope that they try to contact me instead. But i'm afraid that their mom might just try to stop them from doing that. 




I'm just confused as to where I should go on from here. I'm having a hard time sleeping ever since this situation came up. I just want to meet them, but I don't want their mom to know about it.




tl;dr want to me little sisters but their psycho-bitch of a mother is hindering me from doing so.

182,"I am in a very toxic job right now and I need out. I am unhappy and nauseated on my way into work and in tears on my way home. 

I've been looking and I've been applying places. It's hard, because ideally, I'd like a job with benefits that pays around the same that I get now, but am willing to take a lesser paying job if I truly think I'd be happier. 

Here are my current battles in this job hunting journey: 

1) I've interviewed for a job that has similar hours and pays a few hundred more a month. I am still in the 7-10 business days wait for them to see if they'd like to invite me to the second round of interviews. There are benefits and my PTO from my current job would transfer over to the new job. 

I still have to wait a few more days to find out if I made it to round 2 of interviews, and even then, it isn't a guarantee I'd get the job, so the process is taking a bit longer than I had hoped. If I DON'T get this job: 

2) There is a partial telecommute job, work days are Saturday-Wednesday, but you work from home Saturday and Sunday. Pay is $15 an hour (current wage is $20.66 an hour) but there are also no health benefits, so I would have to purchase my own if I applied and got the job. I have spoken with the company out of interest in the position without applying and they seem very receptive and interested in me even though I haven't applied, but I just don't know if I can afford a significant pay cut AND having to buy my own insurance. BUT, with working from home on weekends and having two weekdays off, I COULD see if there's some part-time or freelance work I could do that would supplement it. I think the hours and what I would be doing in this job would make me happiest, but it's really just a financial thing. 

3) Stay in my toxic job and just keep searching, and take mental health days off here and there as I need it and hope I can find something. 

I think the biggest worry is that I go for option 2, but that option 2, will respond quickly, and I'd have to make a decision IF they wanted to hire me, but option 1, would be best finanically because of the health benefits and significantly more pay. When I spoke with option 2, they said that their goal is to offer benefits to employees within the next year. I also think, because it's a startup, there is room for growth and room for pay raises and to work my way to the top someday if I like the company. But I would hate to apply and get hired in this lower paying job, and then have option 1 call me. 


BUT, with option 1, it's a M-F office job, essentially...and I know I wouldn't want to do that forever, it's just more in line with what I currently do, but again, not something I want to do forever. 

I'm REALLY leaning towards option 2 just because I think I would be happy, and, maybe I should just apply, because honestly, at this point, no one's offered me a job. I can't count on option 1, I can't wait around for them to decide and miss out on other opportunities...I could apply for option 2 and always turn it down if  I decide I don't want to take the pay cut and be without benefits/if I hear back from option 1.

185,"Hey,

I'm 16 and live in the United Kingdom. I am studying economics, history and geography and in one years time I will need to pick a university and degree to attend.

I am an Irish citizen and so would preferably like to study in the European Union as tuition fees are, generally, much lower on the continent and it's a good opportunity to experience a different way of living. I live in a very deprived part of the United Kingdom and to be frank - I'm sick of the country. 

Building on the prior point - I'd like to live elsewhere and so any career path I go down must give me the option to move abroad.

The thing is - I don't know what career I'd like, degree I'd like or university I could attend and I don't have many interests. I'm consumed by the want to self-improve and yet I can never be bothered to do that so I just pretend I'm doing work or play games. Fun times.

Enough of the self-pity though - I don't have many interests besides economics and politics and even then I'm not sure if I'd want anything to do with these topics when it comes to careers.

She said the reason didn’t seem like enough to actually quit. I went into the whole story...and I started to cry. I didn’t mean to. I apologized profusely. The female doctor got me a tissue and told me it was okay and she said she understood (she’s VERY pregnant!).

The interview ended, not because I cried, but because it was over. I thanked everyone for their time and I left.

Is there any way to come back from this? Or do I just move on?

188,"First off, I already have my bachelor's degree and I am firmly set in my decision not to pursue vet schoolf.  I put in an application to vet school in September but have since decided that it is not a good option for me (mostly due to money and mental health issues).  

My parents have always had super high expectations of me.  In high school I came home and was super happy that I got a B+ on my honors chemistry exam.  All my mom had to say was ""Well why wasn't it an A?""  I got my bachelor's degree and I didn't get into vet school the first time I applied, and I didn't apply for several of the following years.  They would constantly nag me about applying, etc.  I hated it.

Now I've gone and told them I am trying again, which I now regret.. 

So I somehow need to tell them that I am not going to pursue this. Period.  But I have emotional problems and the last thing I want to do is break down crying and fail to adequately express myself.  I have serious emotional issues.

Is it appropriate to write them a letter/note?  I am so much better at expressing myself in text.  I could even sit down with them and have them read it while I am there and maybe we could discuss afterwards.  I just don't want to hurt my parents.  Even though they expect perfection, I still want to be in their good graces.  Also I live with them right now.

Would that be acceptable?

197,"Allow me to introduce myself. I am a 20 year old dude working for the gas company. I am making decent money now and I have a few things I'd like to do with it, but not sure which should be on top of my priority list. I am currently living in a small shed on the side of my parents' house which we fixed up into a nice living space. I have my own A/C, heater, TV, and  so on. It's a nice little place, but I don't get much privacy. My parents are always barging in looking for things that they claim I have, which I don't. I can't lock the door because they have a window on the other side of the door which they can just open and unlock the door. My father permanently locked the door to the outside from my little room so that I won't go anywhere at night, So I am forced to go through the main door. I can't bring girls home to engage in paramoric activities, or just to hang out and watch TV because my brother always has his music loud. And every now and again my parents and I get in arguments and I can't do anything but stay in my room. But some reasons I have for staying is that I don't pay rent, and I can use the money I have to work on my project Miata. 

On the other hand I want to get a 2017 Toyota 4Runner for multiple reasons. One is that I am embarrassed to go out and pick ladies up in my Civic because it  was a hand-me-down and is pretty beat up cosmetically, that is. She's a trooper. I travel 150 miles both ways every weekend to go fishing in her. And my Miata, despite being fully functional, isn't really reliable to have as a daily. So I want to get that truck, not only because it'll most likely increase my confidence when going out with girls, but also because it would be more versatile, I love going off road and exploring mountains. 

I know it's first world problems, or whatever, but I really don't know what to do about it. Should I move out and have my own 'bachelor pad' or should I get the truck of my dreams and feel more confident when going out? Also, I should point out that I do not want to have roommates.. Thanks

TL;DR
I'm making enough money to either move out of my parent's house or to buy a truck to go off road and fishing with? what is my best bet? I have a 1999 Civic and 1991 Miata.

He kept babbling nonsense about Koreans, wars, etc. He was out of it clearly, but I was very uncomfortable. Then he kept standing there staring at me, I left the park and this piece of shit follows me for a few minutes. A biker almost ran into me and my dogs in the crosswalk... I lost my calm for a moment.  I went into a local business, he didn't follow me but just watched me from across the street. I called the police and they were there in less than a minute. The dude starts to walk away, like the shitty coward that he is. I told them what happened and they went after him and took it from there. Then I went home (didn't want him to follow me and see where I live) and left for work. 

Now... I wish my day didn't start like this. Feeling pretty anxious and shaken, even though these things happen in cities. This crazy dude wanted attention and power, even for a minute. And he chose to bother me because I'm a woman and I noticed him, and when i ignored him he wouldn't leave me alone, bc he had nothing better to do. 

I'm mad at myself for briefly losing my cool in the crosswalk. Gave him and the situation that power over me. 

However I remind myself that I have everything and he has nothing. And he's a coward. 

I hope I handled the situation well. Would you have handled it differently?

Hate that this happens. I hope I never see him again and if I do, I'm hoping he won't remember me or my dogs. If I see him again, I'm calling the police, and also telling others to look out for him.

209,"Backstory: I met a girl about a little over a year ago who asked me on a date. We dated for less than a month and she broke it off between us, but we still liked each other enough to stay friends. Later on she told me she only dated me to make someone jealous, and as soon as he gave her attention, she broke up with me and would hang out with him and mainly just kiss. She's a very sqeemish person so she wouldn't be very comfortable doing anything else. Eventually she got into a fight with him and then they just became friends. During this entire period I was still her friend and I didn't know this was going on (it lasted a few weeks). She didn't admit this to me until about two months after it happened, and of course I was very upset. She apologized and promised me she wouldn't do anything like that ever again. It's been a year since then and things are very different. Her and I have remained friends while sometimes dating other people and neither of us have had any luck. Her and the guy she left me for quickly stopped being friends because she couldn't stand how complicated he was being, there was another guy who had a ponytail and smoked cigarettes she briefly liked, but he ended their friendship as soon as she revealed she liked him. There was another dude who  was very smart and worked for Apple, and I actually didn't mind her dating him because I knew she deserved someone nice and he seemed pretty cool. But she ended up breaking up with him very quickly because of how he was too ""anxious all the time"" (her words). I dated a girl who was very smart, but was admittedly way too boring to be around for long periods of time. There were a few other girls who showed interest in me, but most of the time I stay away from dating in order to focus on school and myself.

Anyways, the original girl is still my friend. And recently she's told me that she wishes she had never broken up with me because it was very premature and she hadnt really given me a chance. She said she wanted to finally be able to have an actual working relationship with someone, and she thinks that person is me.

We hang out and talk pretty  often. We talk about our problems with one another and we get along very well. She's kind of ADHD as fuck, but I think it makes her more interesting than the average person. Shes the kind of person who goes way over the top when buying a present and the kind of person who makes herself laugh more than anyone else can. We're pretty different when it comes to socializing and music taste, but I feel as if contradictions bring is closer together because we both enjoy bickering. I honestly feel like I do love her, I just don't know the way in which I do.

I know she wants to date, but I'm scared of a lot happening. I don't want her to realize it was a mistake and break it off again. I don't want her to become crazy about me and then my relationship with her becomes completely different. I don't want us to go down a path that leads to us leaving each other, because above all I want to know her for as long as possible.

So what the hell do I do? Do I explore this pathway, or should we just keep it the same?",01Nov2017,2
210,"**Throw Away, for obvious reasons.**

Okay, I know, this sounds VERY BAD, just please hear me out for a second.

I (23f) am the only employer for a person of a profession... I am hesitant to give the name of the profession. 

He (71m) is old and semi-retired. My job is very  part time. 

**I love my job.** 

I love doing the data sheets and the packaging, I take pride in my work, and I’ve learned a lot in my two years of being there. 

**My boss, though..... I was once cool with him, but now it’s getting bad.**

I suffer from a neurological issue that makes doing things like turning keys into locks difficult.

I CAN DO IT,  but it takes me a few tries.

My boss was convinced I wasn’t getting it, and tried to show me how to work it over and over again. 

I told him it’s just the condition, I’m fine, and it’s not just locks, my boyfriend (23m) cuts my steaks for me even lol. 

**He then proceeded to pretend to feed me like an infant.**

___________________________________


**This isn’t the only thing he’s done, though.**

He has become increasingly difficult for the following reasons (note - not all of them are sexual):

- Offered payment for sexual favors

- Tried to convince me to let him take naked pictures of me

- Asked me if I was “wet” when talking about Celebrity Crushes

- Whenever I struggled has said *”Let Daddy Help.”*

- Screamed at ATT Internet Providers because “the Google isn’t working.” 

- Asked me extremely inappropriate questions 

- Tried to get me to teach him how to work a hookup site on the new smart phone his girlfriend bought him *(I know, right?)* 

- Tried to convince me not to get serious with my boyfriend.

- so so so so much more. 

__________________________________________


This is a private business that does not report to HR, and given the nature of the job, it’s really not worth it.

He’s going to fully retire soon, he’s already made it clear to me that I am his last employee. 

I love my job, I can’t stand working with him. 

But I found a loophole:

**I found a way to get my work done when he isn’t there.** 

^ I am allowed to be at work when he isn’t there and log in my own hours. It should be noted he works at his place of residence. 

He is frequently not at home for a variety of reasons, including a gym class he takes twice a day. 
Sometimes he leaves for the night. 

I frequently give him excuses as to why I couldn’t come in when he’s there, because when he IS there, I get nothing done. I have no desire to work, I want to leave ASAP. 

But when he’s not there, I have the most productive time ever. I get shit done, and I enjoy it. 

I can not afford to quit my job right now, but I’ve run out of excuses to coming in late. 

Which leads me to my dilemma:

_________________________________


**Today I panicked about going into work while he is there, and impulsively told him we’d been hit by a car and are working on it.** 

I’m trying to prolong my “dilemma” till I know he won’t be there, so I can go in and get work done in peace.


My description was going to be the car was sideswiped on my side, but I was injured enough to be taken to the hospital for inspection and would then be released. 

**I’m not looking to commit insurance fraud or anything terrible like that.** 

I just want to have a story believable enough to be able to wait long enough to get to work at a time he won’t be there so it can be bearable. 

I don’t mind giving myself a couple of bruises to make it look realistic, I just need something plausible. 

I’d break my arm, but I can’t afford an actual hospital visit. 

I just want a story mild enough to seem injured enough, but not get anyone in trouble. 

Sorry I’m asking for such a terribly dishonest thing.

I wouldn’t do it if I felt it wasn’t necessary.

I live with 5 roommates in university, 3 of which live a 5 hour plane ride away during the off school months. Last year, one of my roommates, who is also one of my best friends, set me up with her friend who goes to the same university and is from where she is from. Him and I got together and were together for 8 very rocky months. I was completely in love with him and he treated me like absolute shit but I let him come back and get away with it every single time. Before summer last year, he decided he didnt want to do long distance and I was devastated. I cant tell you how many times I have cried to my roommates about this boy. It completely destroyed my mental health because he was so emotionally manipulative and abusive but I was so infatuated by him that I was not strong enough to let him go. It brought me into a deep depression because I couldn’t move on. I am now on multiple meds, go to weekly therapy and struggle every single day. I’ve always struggled with mental health issues but falling in love with someone so toxic honestly triggered me into such a low state in my life. 
Summer passes and I come back to school. I hadn't talked to my ex in 2 months but the moment we saw each other again, we ended up going home together. I know, I know…. horrible idea. Next day, he says I’m sorry if I lead you on but we have to be just friends. Safe to say I was HEARTBROKEN. So far, in the 2 months of being back at school again, he has lead me on like that 3 times, just for him to change his mind again because he cant decide if he wants to get back together with me. 
Then one night he gets so drunk he tells me that he misses me and thinks about me everyday, and then he says “in the summer i had sex with (insert roommate and best friends name) and we decided not to tell you”
I am heartbroken. My best friend whom I have spent countless hours bawling to about this boy SLEPT with him and decided it was best to keep it from me. I value her friendship more than ANYTHING and she claims she was really drunk and it was the biggest mistake of her life. I don't know what to do at this point… do I forgive and forget?

225,"I don't know where this belongs, but it seems right to put it here. Sorry if it's too long, but i think the story matters.

Six and a half years ago, I was living in Canada with my mother, two younger brothers and an older sister, while my dad worked for his own oil company in Nigeria. We lived in a nicely sized house, had a decent car and went to public schools. In Summer 2011, while we were playing around my mother's gigantic bedroom (I was 9 at the time), she told us that we'd visit my dad in Nigeria for a month in about a week's time or so. I'd already been there once, he had a nice house (although he'd recently moved into an apartment), bigger than the one in Canada, he had internet access and would take us to really cool places. I had no problems with visiting, to me it wasn't a ""third world country"". 

Fast forward to the last day of our stay, all of us were fully packed and ready to leave, but my mother hadn't done anything. We did not leave that day. Or the next. Or the next week. Soon it was August and my father took us around to some private schools and I was fucking freaked out. The thought of attending a school in Nigeria frightened me, even though some of the schools looked nice. I still remember how scared I was while my dad took a picture commemorating our ""first day of school"". I don't want to remember my elementary or ""primary"" school days, so all I can say is it was different in a bad way. 

When I started 7th grade i'd gotten used to everything. I'd just started going to a new school, with my sister. The campus was beautiful, the buildings were much better and the people were much better and cleaner. It's a British school with British (and Nigerian) people and teachers. Later my sister told me how much *fucking* money my dad was paying to send us there. The price was around $22k for a year, it didn't have much of an impact on me back then, but it helped me understand why I knew so many people with surnames i'd seen on Forbes and newspapers. End of the year, my sister left and went back to Canada, where she went to a school that cost 3x more. 

I knew it couldn't last forever, i don't know the specifics of the oil industry, but things are slow to say the least. The recession doesnt help either. All my dad's friends who would often have huge parties at their mansions calmed down. We've had a house near the apartment that's usually full of people working at desks on the ground floor, it also functioned as a guest house upstairs, but it's been empty for months. Yesterday, my dad had a friend over and one of the first things he talked to him about was ""how much the schools cost"", saying ""oh I cannot afford the next term"" I didn't take it too seriously, he'd complained about it before but a few hours later he called me over to look at a school he'd been checking out. I was fucking livid, but I kept it inside. There are only 2 schools in the country, other than mine, that are good by the standards of the people I know. One's more expensive than mine and the other's barely cheaper. He said I can either go to a cheaper school here, or a public school in Canada where i'd have to live with my uncle. Most of the people who leave my school go to boarding schools in England, so I got him to consider it if there was something half as cheap or less. 

Turns out there's probably not, and if there is, you'd have to question the quality if they're that hard to find. I'm not sure what options I have.
I could possibly stay here but my brother would have to do me a big favour. 
I could go to England with my brother, but it most likely won't happen. There's lots of Nigerians there and I'd probably find some people I'm familiar with
I could go to a cheaper school here with my brother, which scares me to death. MY school is extremely fun and I love the people, there's really no school as liberal with self expression as mine around here. 
I could go to a public or boarding school in Canada, which terrifies me because 1) i'd have to switch from the British school system to the Canadian system 2) I've developed a stigma to the idea of public school.. it's.. public school... and 3) Deal with new people and a different culture. I don't know how people are over there, but over here the people are really nice and there's no bullying cause, that's just how we are. I love the people here so so so so so much. and I've pretty much dropped any feeling I have for Canada other than regular nostalgia w/ my siblings

I got the news yesterday afternoon, I haven't eaten since then, my heart's been beating fast as fuck, I've been sleeping after midnight for a week but last night I fell asleep at 8:00.

When you start ""year 10"" in an international school that offers IGCSE exams, you choose 6 subjects to take in addition to english, math and PE.(this is not the case in england)
I'm part of an accelerated English class that skipped what the rest of the 10th graders did and went straight to next year's stuff, theres also some other things my school does differently that mean moving to another school would need a lot of catching up. It would be destructive to my education to move at this point. My sister graduated with nearly perfect exam scores, which I'm expected to surpass. I have quite enough to study as it is and don't need to add any catching up to that. Would it be selfish to even think about letting my brother take the hit? he's in 9th grade so he hasn't made any decisions about his subjects, this is actually the time most people switch systems, but I'm too deep. 

I haven't told my dad about any of the eMoTiOnAl stuff im feeling or the details of the state of my education compared to my brother's. I don't know what kind of help you can give me tbh but anything is appreciated

226,"Long story short, I live at home with my parents in my small, boring hometown right now.  I moved here in August from the big city where I went to school and most of my friends are.  When I first got here, I had a full-time job.  Unfortunately, due to a miscommunication in the interview, I lost the job and had to go for a couple of weeks without one.  In the interim, I found a part-time seasonal job which I'm working right now, but only for a few hours per week.

I'm planning to move out again in January to a nearby city with my girlfriend.  I'll start attending school full time when that happens.  The trouble is figuring out what to do in the meantime.

I have a few friends here, but it's very difficult to connect with them anymore.  We don't have a lot in common and hanging out can be really awkward, so I mostly just stay at home.  My parents have me working on some projects; mostly painting a few rooms in the house, aside from the usual chores.  My dad works during the day and my mom typically does as well, although she doesn't always.  Right now, since I don't have much income and I'm using the income I have to save up for my security deposit for January, I'm not really keen on taking my old, beat up car out to drive around.  My dad broke my bike accidentally and won't pay to have it fixed, so my mobility is very limited.  I don't live in a walkable area, which contributes to my staying at home.

I've been spending too many days inside, playing video games.  I interact with my dogs, but it doesn't take the place of human interaction.  I read, but I'm having a hard time keeping motivated to finish a book once I start.  I've tried asking my program advisers about things I can do to start preparing for my post-baccalaureate program, but their response has been *not* to do work before I start, in case it makes things confusing for me as a student.

I've been researching masters programs and even come up with a list of programs I'd like to go to, contacted the schools, and read research papers, so I feel as though I've been at least somewhat productive.  I've been practicing my Spanish in the hopes of becoming conversational and got an app where I've matched up with language buddies and practiced.

I play racquetball and do yoga with my dad, take my dogs hiking and on long walks, and generally get exercise.

I'm just sort of at a loss for what to do.  Everything sort of blends together and I'm starting to feel depressed because of lack of contact with my friends.  Contacting people who live 4 hours away and talking on the phone isn't super helpful, although it helps somewhat.  My girlfriend and I talk all the time, but I'm starting to feel overbearing since she's my link to my social network right now.  The few friends who I still get along with and who still live here are constantly busy and don't seem to have time to hang out.  Just interacting with my parents and dogs on a day to day basis is getting old.  I really miss the fullness of the life I had, and I want some way to recapture it here.  It's just hard to act on that much, given that I'm about to move again and start a new chapter.  I don't want to feel like I'm just wasting time, but that's what it feels like.

Anyways, wall of text aside, I really need something free to do from home which will fill up my time.",01Nov2017,0
227,"I am an administrative assistant at a small, growing 50+ person company. As is the nature of this role, I juggle multiple things every day, all day, and it constantly changes. However, I do have my list of core tasks that I have had for over a year and have been slowly growing as our company's needs change. It’s been a bit overwhelming lately, but I’ve been dealing with it as they have hinted at promotions. 

Our communication, management, and processes have been incredibly inefficient and the problem has been growing in the past 7 months, and I know I'm not the only one who sees it. We've had 14 people leave in the past 7 months. I recently spoke with our CEO about my concerns with the lack of communication within management and the lack of processes where there already should have been one. He was very receptive to the feedback.

Flash forward about a month and my boss pulled me aside to assess my current workload. She said they want to see if I have room to take on many of her tasks (and the tasks they gave to someone who left) since her role will be changing to ""process lead"". This essentially would mean for me I would be taking on tasks that belonged to the office manager and the people operations specialist. 

I was happy to say yes to this as I thought this meant I would be possibly getting a promotion and pay raise and it also meant they listened to my feedback. After our meeting, I realized she only mentioned that her own role would be changing, and not mine. So I went back to her and said I had a few questions. I essentially asked if this meant my role would be changing and what their plans were. She told me that there were no intentions of changing my role, just “giving me things that should have been going to me all along”.

So I guess my question is, am I wrong to feel that this is extremely unjust? If so, could any of you provide me with advice on what to do?

TL;DR: Boss is giving tasks that are above my title at work, thought it meant I was getting a promotion, boss told me it's not and that they have no intensions of a promotion. Please help.

229,"This is a previous break up, happened a while ago and had a conversation with a friend which brought up the topic again. (The friend is a cat lover so I'm sure this is biased)

I like most animals but not cat, I like dogs, squirrels, birds, guinea pigs, chinchillas, etc. I don't hate cats but I do have a slightly negative feeling toward cats, I have seen well behaving cats that I liked before. 

I was in an established relationship with this girl for about a year to year and half at that point, did not move in together but talked about it. She have this cat that's been with her for about 5-6 years and loved the cat a lot.

She went to visit her family oversea for about a month and asked me to take care of her cat, I didn't mind it at first but then discovered lots of general cat issues that I do not like/can not tolerate. 

The cat would scratch up all the mattress/box spring/sofa (she let the cat do that at her place), cat litters everywhere, poop is very stinky and this cat does not cover up the poop like some other cats does, and meowing day and night when the cat feels like it, also attempted to scratch my monitor/tv but I stopped it.

I have my own pets, a dove, guinea pigs, and chinchilla. (had the cat in a different room when it was at my place) and the cat could cause harm to them. 


I do not like cats to begin with; her cat IMO have some behavior issues like scratching up furniture; I do not like living in a place with cat hair and litters everywhere; the cat could harm my animals; and while I like her a lot I really can't stand it when she ask me how cute her cat is and I knew I would snap one day.

I am committed to the well being of my pets when I got them, and I'm sure she is too, it wouldn't be fair for any of us to ask the other one to give up their animals or make compromises that may have an adverse effect on their animals quality of life. 

We broke up two months after she got back, I did not tell her that it's about the cat but I mentioned compatibility issues, it was not a bad break up.

I thought breaking up was the mature thing to do when the other person have way of life/choice of life that you do not feel comfortable with or not willing/able to put up with in the long run, and asking her to give up her cat would be the real jerk move. ",01Nov2017,1

233,"I started dating this guy almost a year ago (around halloween 2016), and we dated for a little over 10 months. Around the end of August I was getting this feeling that maybe I should cut it off for a lot for a lot of reasons from mental health to identity issues to just a lack of interest. I kinda sorta ghosted him for a week while i thought about it, which I know was probably a bad move, and then I broke up with him over the phone when he called me to get an explanation. I know I hurt him deeply, and I broke down after I hung up the phone and cried for a long time.

 We haven't talked since except for a few short words when I gave him all the stuff he had left at my place and vice versa. We shared a lot of the same friends, many of which have cut me off, and I've stopped doing theatre at my university (something I've always LOVED) because he is highly involved in the program. 

I've come to the conclusion that I probably made up those reasons for breaking up with him because I'm afraid of commitment and the 1 year mark was freaking me out, but I'm not even sure if that's true. When I see him in public now I get panic attacks, when people bring him up in conversation I sometimes have to physically leave the room I'm so emotionally affected. The feeling of immense guilt and shame I get from even looking at his face is deafening. 

I don't know what to do next, but I know this situation is currently severly affecting my schoolwork, job, and overall ability to function as a human. Any ideas on how I can get myself out of this mess, or even just move forward?",01Nov2017,3

237,"I've had the same problem since elementary school. Although, back then not only was I eccentric, I had terrible anxiety, so I didn't ever speak to anyone except for a couple of kids. Then I got to junior high, excited to get a fresh start. I no longer was ridden with anxiety, by then it had significantly dissipated. I ended up getting bullied by a *lot* of girls in my school. When it came to just being laughed at and made fun of, there were dozens of people who did. I eventually had to talk to one of the school principals, and he was able to stop a lot of it. Nowadays, I don't get bullied, but I do get made fun of and laughed at. It's not always to my face - usually it's kids in my classes around me.
I really wish I knew the reason *why*. Whatever it is, it's never gotten around to me. And in general, I just feel like crap in my school. It's happened for so long that I feel like everywhere I could possibly go in the world, I am the outcast. And that has always been the case (such as in extracurricular activities I tried that had other kids/teens there). 

Another thing that gets to me, is the fact that while others are pairing up and dating, any guy I like never likes me - and I presume it's because I am the ""weird"" girl. Along with that, my looks may play into it further, but I'm not sure. I see an ugly girl in the mirror, and I haven't ever been told otherwise (I've gotten called ugly 3-4 times in my life - not too much but it's still noteable to me. I also almost never anything positive about my appearance) from my parents (whom absolutely insist that I'm an attractive girl and that I ""need my eyes checked""). But I have functioning eyes and access to a mirror, and I'm not deluded.  It always kind of stings. And often, guys make a joke out of me amongst themselves, and kiddingly say to each other ""there's your girlfriend!"". In the same way I've seen guys say that to each other when somebody very unattractive walks by to tease each other. 

I don't want any of this to bother me so much. Everywhere I go, I have been the odd one out. I would really appreciate some advice. I feel so conflicted. ",01Nov2017,1

I thought moving here would make me happy, but nah. I thought visiting home and my family would make me happy, but nah.

I've been single for most of my life (I'm eighteen) and so I always sorta thought that being in a relationship with someone I really cared about would cure this constant sadness... But nah. I still hate myself and still can't bare to be alone with my own thoughts and if anything it's gotten worse.

Me and him were friends many years ago at school, and a month or two ago reconnected through a mutual friend and talked over text for a couple weeks or so. I thought it was going well but then we didn't talk for two whole months, nada, nothing. This was after he was meant to come to a party I was going to and then he couldn't come, and I was sick of always initiating conversation first, so I stopped trying to message him.

Recently he attended my closest friends party (which I wasn't able to go to) which prompted to message him again after mainly forgetting about him (lol) and not having anything to say for the two months.

My question is: is he showing me he's not interested and I'm not picking up on it, or is this just his personality and he's hopeless at texting.

Examples he could possibly not be interested: 
1. I always initiate messaging 
2. I find myself asking more questions to keep the conversation going 
3. He didn't try and message me once during the two month ''break'' 
4. He doesn't reply even remotely quickly, neither do I to be fair, but sometimes he doesn't reply for hours but he's been active on snap chat

If you can't already tell I have pretty much zero dating/flirting experience and I've never been in a relationship, so I desperately need advice. I really like this guy, but I don't know what to do about any of it (doesn't help I have social anxiety)! Any insight would be much appreciated!

Major: Computer Management &amp; Information Systems

Expected Graduation: Spring 2019 (I'm a Junior)

Current Job: Cook (been one for 5 years)($11.00 per hour) (10-30 hours per week)

Ideal Job: One thats pays just as much or more than my current, and would allow me to put my IT knowledge to use. One that would allow me to get experience in something that would be useful to my major, rather than what I do now which is cook food...

Certifications: CompTIA A+ , Testout PC Pro

________________________________________________________

**Friendships/Social Life**

In my life I don't have much, by that I mean I have 1 single good friend. He's a good guy, honest and I've known him since kindergarten. He's been there for me through a lot and means a lot to me. Unfortunately for me that's it. I don't have any other friends than him. There's a couple things about me, one of them being I don't use social media, I have a twitter but it's never used. I don't use Snapchat, I hate taking pictures of myself, and the same goes for Instagram, and Facebook is just not useful for me. I don't know if it's how I act, which is funny but serious at times, but I can't get any other friends. I have no ways to get other friends, and even if I did I don't know where I'd start. I go to a school with a bunch of guys who have wives and kids, because it's a trade school and all, so it's very hard to become friends with them outside of school. My job is one that consists of 3 other co-workers, who have busy lives and they too are way older than me making a huge gap in age. I don't like to party, most guys my age love partying and it's what they do (old friends from high school, for example), but me, not really, I can't find the time for it or the patience, it's not enjoyable for me. My town is extremely boring so there is pretty much nothing to do around here as well. I feel like I should have more friends, my dad always said I should get more friends but holy shit it's easy said than done it seems like for me. Nothing socially works out for me. That's problem 1.

________________________________________________________

**Relationships**

This one is pretty big for me. I haven't had anyone significant in my life since my ex-girlfriend from like 3 years ago. I've been alone ever since. At the start it was nice, being able to keep to myself, not have to worry about anyone but myself and family of course. Now, it's getting old and very lonely. I've tried everything I can to get some kind of relationship with a girl, even a friendship would be nice, but everything just dead-ends and whoever I've been talking to just disappears. I don't know if I'm not trying hard enough or what but it's very upsetting. I'm not an asshole by any means, I've been raised to respect girls no matter what, and treat them how they deserve to be treated. That never seems to work. I don't know if I'm too nice or what but it doesn't get me anywhere. I'm not ugly, in my opinion, and I'm not overweight. I'm just, average. The only huge problem that I can see is social media. Every girl I've met wants to Snapchat me or whatever, and I don't, as I said before I don't like using Snapchat, or whatever. Hell, I sometimes don't even like texting, I'd rather call you than text you. It sucks. All the girls I've met have been into social media and it's all they seem to do. My mom says a relationship will come when I least expect it to,  it I don't think that's how this works anymore. I haven't expected anything for the past 2 years and that thought is still the same. Nothing comes out of anything that I've tried to pursue. My dad on the other hand says ""just find a girl to fuck for one night"" and other bullshit that I don't agree with. I'm not that type of guy to have a one night stand, it's bullshit, so he isn't much help at all, he thinks it's easy, like snapping your fingers and poof I'm in a relationship. No one understands. 
I know, you don't have to have a girlfriend to be happy, but happiness isn't the problem, it's being lonely that is. Because I don't have many friends to rely off of, the thought of having someone to talk to during the day or when I'm not busy or hangout with when Im having a bad day is really comforting. 
Another problem that probably tackles both my low friend count and relationship issue is my job. I work full time, and during these day long hours I cannot use my phone, almost at all, except during break. Because of this I've probably lost a lot of opportunities with other girls because they assume I don't care enough to message them throughout the day or whatever. It's complicated but I hope you understand what I mean. I'm not trying to sound needy, I'm telling whoever is reading this that this is how my life is, and it's not right. Obviously a relationship with another person isn't a huge deal, but I don't want to live my life alone, and honestly right now that's how I feel it will be.

**Wrapping it up**

Overall, I'm happy with my life, but not living it how I want to live it. I'm financially fine, and educated to where I need to be, but not pleased with my social life at all. I'm a simple guy. I try to make friends but nothing comes from it, I try to start a relationship with a girl or even a friendship and it always leads to no where, so I'm out of options. Right now I enjoy playing Xbox after work and school, making friends there is simple and easy, I have a good time and enjoy just hanging out on there. I don't know if I'm socially awkward but I sure as hell try not to be. I just want my life to feel ""right"".

258,"This is a long story 

I roomed with this girl who I'll name Mae last year and we got along great. (We are in college and live in apartments that are only for college students. They aren't affiliated with my school) However, this year we got a roommate with a dog. Mae doesn't like dogs at all and was very upset about this but could not do anything because it was an emotional support dog and she wasn't allergic to dogs.  She complained to the office and couldn't understand that even though it was a non-pet building they could still put an emotional support animal in the apartment. Fast forward two weeks. 

Everyone moved in and it was a rough start. Mae was mean to the new roommate and the dog. It created a very awkward and hoists environment; however, Mae soon starts to get better around the dog and plays with her and all is going well. But about two weeks ago Mae had a ""fake"" breakdown (I say fake because her mom manipulated her into thinking she is depressed) and needed her mom up in my apartment for a week living there. 
While her mom was here she manipulated her into thinking that the dog was the cause of her anxiety. Mae is now worse than she was. She is slamming things around and slams her door. She radiates anger and at one point, I believe, hit my roommates dog. Every time Mae comes home she cause me to shake and start to have anxiety. My heart drops when she opens the door. Is there anything that I can do to help this situation? I understand that saying her breakdown was fake but I live with her I know when she is faking things like this because it wasn't the first time. Also she has no reason to blame the dog. She is moving home to 8 dogs, so it's not the dog. This is not the whole story, jay the shortened version. 
How can I not feel anxious around her and what can I do about the emotional distress she is causing? 
Edit: she has now posted a Snapchat story of how she feels uncomfortable in the apartment. I haven't spoken to her all day. ",01Nov2017,3

Some background information; I wanted to make the world a better place and I like science, mostly maths and chemistry. I love people and socializing, so I got into self improvement and psychology a lot which I like as well. I’m a big lover of movies, music and an incredible fan of nature.
So I wanted to study something Chemistry-like, with psychology as a side-subject perhaps but then the doubt hit if I actually want to do that for the rest of my life and now I don’t know about anything anymore.

I’m just scared to make wrong decisions, that can define the rest of my life... Yikes I actually prefer not to think about the possible consequences

I even don’t know anymore what hobbies I want to have or who I want to become, since I’m not sure if that’s what I want to do or what people would love me to do, things that make me (seem like) a better and cooler person.
I’ve come to the point that I just want to screw it all and spend the rest of my life surfing, snowboarding, and listening to music without caring about anyone anymore.. but I fear I have to graduate high school first.

269,"Last semester my old roommate decided to commute so I asked one of my close friends to room with me in my residence hall on campus. Everything was fine once we moved in but I started noticing things within three weeks. Trash never got taken out, dishes never cleaned, she would stay up until 2 or 3am and I have to work at 6:30am just to name a few. 
Recently, things have gotten so bad I am just ready to leave now. Out of the 12 weeks we have lived in this room, she has taken out trash 3 times. I have had to tell her before to take it out. Dishes will sit there for days on end, crusting up with old food. The staying up late thing has continued for this whole time. 
So, to try and give her a hint, I separated our trash cans (we have a private bathroom in our dorm). Hers was in the bathroom but I moved it into our room on her side, and put my trash can under my bed. I thought she would get the hint to deal with her own trash but she continues to put stuff in mine. There’s five days worth of dishes currently sitting on our counter. 
I have had it with her. I’ve tried talking to her before but I could tell that she physically tuned me out and nothing ever happened after that conversation. The problem is, is that she is an only child who is only ever had her mother do things for her and take care of her. Yet, she is 21 years old. How do I get through to her?
I’ve basically come to the decision that I want to move out and get a private room next semester, because I can’t deal with the filth (she’s never cleaned our shared bathroom but she bought all of the supplies) and the immaturity. I shouldn’t have to tell a 21 year old to take out their trash. 
My only thing that’s stopping me is that we have been friends since kindergarten and I’m supposed to be in her wedding next year. However, next semester starts my senior year and I cannot and should not have to stress about living in my own dorm that I have paid for when I should be worrying about graduation. But how do you get through to someone when they’ve been set in their ways for 21 years?
P.s. I have connections in the housing office so getting a private isn’t a big deal. I just don’t want to lose the friendship.

270,"So I am having a few issues with my girlfriend and I could use some advice. This post might seem a little extreme but it's a very real problem I'm dealing with and it's slowly driving me crazy. So she's morbidly obese (around 400 pounds) but is getting gastric surgery soon. Unfortunately, her personal hygiene has suffered (especially lately as she's put on 50 pounds in the last year or so) and I don't know how to approach her about it. We've had a few big fights lately and I don't want to start another one.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Firstly is her personal hygiene downstairs, especially when it comes to sex. My girlfriend will work a full day at work, get all hot and sweaty, come home, chill for the evening, go to bed, then try to get in my pants first thing in the morning before she's showered. Folks, I can smell her vagina (and occasionally her ass) before she even takes off her pants. Once she does, it's all I can do not to gag. We've gotten to a point where she thinks I have low sex drive or low testosterone when the opposite is true because I avoid sex with her at all costs due to this! She's also upset that I won't sleep in the bed with her. I sleep on the couch or in my recliner because the bed smells like her crotch!  
&amp;nbsp;  
Secondly is her recent lack of pants. She has taken to lounging around without pants or panties on lately, in nightgowns and such, on our couch. I've started to notice her leaving ""moisture"" behind when she leaves the room (what most people refer to as a snail trail). I tried to bring it up with her once and she just shrugged and said, ""It happens."" I tried bringing it up again later and she got upset that I kept talking about it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
About a month ago my best friend came for a visit and one of the first things he said when he came in the door was (and I'm quoting him here), ""Dude, I can smell your girlfriend in here. You need to talk to that bitch about cleaning herself better.""

282,"Hey Reddit, I really need help from you guys with asking for a raise. First, if any of you are CAD Designers, here’s a little context. The construction/design company I work for is a fairly small one (I’m their first CAD Designer), that works on high-end projects. The company owns another that performs work for other builders (so, everything we’d normally do minus the actual design), and I do CAD work for both companies. I have 1.5 years of real-world experience, and have learned three new softwares in order to do this job, as well as learning some of the structural and BIM functions of Revit. I interface with clients and outside talent on a regular basis, create working drawing sets, and generally keep the design and CAD side of the business organized in terms of backups and Dropbox, for my boss and other employees. I also handle to a smaller extent, setting up social media accounts and teaching my boss how to use them. 
One of the softwares I learned for this job is Trimble Field Link. I use this in conjunction with a Trimble robot (which I also had to learn) to survey sites prior to and during design and construction. I know that learning new software isn’t noteworthy; the only reason I mention this is because I don’t think surveying, even unofficial surveying, is in the normal scope of a CAD Designer’s job, and me knowing how to use this equipment must be saving my employer thousands of dollars a year. I get paid about $6000/year less than the market value of my experience for the area I live in, according to Glassdoor. I might also mention that my employer intends to send me to educational classes which the company will pay for. It’s not educational reimbursement though, it’s “we want you to attend this class at this conference and learn this thing”, so I don’t know if that should count against my salary or not.

I graduated in April, I had been applying for engineering positions since January. It’s almost been a year now with only 2 interviews and 0 call backs... Now all I do is I have been sitting at home for the last 6 months not doing pretty much anything(I did have a small month long trip to USA in June though). I sit at home everyday, usually in my bed or in a chair just thinking or watching the news or playing a video game(I do apply to jobs when I find them).

But overall, I haven’t really done anything in months. I thought at first it would be a small break, but I am literally just sitting at home everyday...and I feel like I’m doing absolutely nothing.

Even the teachers love to befriend the students. It is hands down, the most chillest atmosphere for someone to study in. People talk about anything and everything. Joking is a the main form for everyone to connect with each other. 

I on the other hand, can't seem to understand why my brain doesn't allow me to reach out for people. I am stuck in this infinite loop of attacking myself. Asking me, ""why can't you say something?"". ""Why can't you talk to anyone?"". ""Why do you forget things so easily."" ""You can't understand people."" ""You're so fucking slow."" ""It's probably your past. Or your nature."" These thoughts don't come in words, they come in like... Feelings, I guess? I'm not afraid to go talk to someone. I just have nothing but self-pity in my mind.

Whenever people do try to talk to me, whenever people do try to approach me, I reply with monosyllabic words, or arbitrary phrases like: ""Oh wow."" ""Yeah."" ""Gotcha."" ""Mjmm."" Then a nod, most of the time faking how I understood what was just said. Followed by a wave of focusing on what a bland character with no personality I am. I then look at my computer, but I can't work. I can't concentrate. I've got my mind cycling all the shit I think of myself. I have grown disgust when I hear people laughing and coming up with witty commentary because I envy how natural it is for them. I spend hours and hours on reddits and forums reading about this being a consequence of the anti-depressants that made me worse than what they helped me with? Can psychedelics help me, or can they destroy me on this shitty state of mind I reside in? Am I experiencing hearing loss, which has to do with why I can't understand people in conversations? Do I have a testosterone problem? Do I have thyroid problems because my tsh levels are a tad bit to high? Why is my memory so bad? Why is my concentration so bad?  I cry almost everyday, because of absolutely absurd, and childish things like, having an awkward conversation. Laughing feels so unnatural. I can't process information right.

302,"So, yeah, hello everybody. This is a throwaway I've used before for some situations I was in during the midst of a breakdown, so disregard any of my account history please. Anyway, on to the current issue at hand.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's start out with an introduction: I'm a 19 year old girl living in the... pretty mediocre state of Ohio. I do have contact with my family, but things with them are tense seeing as they emotionally and physically abused me throughout my childhood.

&amp;nbsp;

I have many, many mental health issues that are wreaking havoc on my life. Ever since I started looking more inward this past Summer I started uncovering more and more shit to pile on top of my anxiety and depression. Obviously, this is something where I need to go to a therapist or other mental health professional.

&amp;nbsp;

Three little problems.

&amp;nbsp;

One, I've only once had a therapist help me with a breakthrough during my many years of seeing them. Most sessions were ultimately unhelpful. Two, I have out-of-state insurance, meaning no therapist near me will take me. And three, I have no money. Literally no money. At all. I live in a homeless shelter, get gas cards from a church for my car and steal my meals. I've got about nine cents in my purse, if I remember correctly.

&amp;nbsp;

Up until recently, I did have a job. I was making about $300 a week as a server. But the stress of that job lead me to have a major panic attack (that ended in an ER trip) on the clock and I left soon afterwards. I had an interview recently, and got an offer, but it stands to see if I'll pass the drug test (idk if the fake urine is too trustworthy).

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to all that fun stuff, I also have no support system to speak of. I haven't been here too too long, and I have made a few friends, but I'm not too close with many of them, and the one I was close with became a victim of my crazy. Incidentally, this is what happened to all the friends I had back home as well. None of them are on speaking terms with me currently. One has threatened to call the police if I ever contact him again.

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, so, obviously I have a bunch of external problems in conjunction with my internal ones. But I don't have the means to get Medicaid (I have to live in the state for a certain length of time, and they take forever to process applications; I just received a letter back to start the process and I applied three months ago). I don't have the means to get private insurance or pay for the appointments myself. I just don't know what to do.",01Nov2017,1

305,This is really specific and weird but we just got a new AC and the people told us it smells bad because it's burning off oil or something. So my whole house smells like shit and it's giving me a stomach ache. Any ideas on how I could get rid of the smell in my room? ,01Nov2017,2
306,"I'm really frustrated with YouTube cuz I been doing YouTube for two years but I only got 628 subs even tho my videos are awesome. So like does anyone have a channel that has 5000 or 10,000 or more subs that they don't use anymore that I can have? Plz don't get mad at me, I resorted to this cuz no matter how awesome my videos are, I still don't get views and I still only have 628 subs. I have no money so I'm looking for a good person ",01Nov2017,2
307,"I’ll be turning 17 at the end of March and I feel like I have nothing to live for. The only enjoyment I get is from video games but I don’t know what else to turn to. The daily routine that I’ve been following since my first day of freshman year has been: Wake up at 5:30 AM, get to School at 7:05 AM, get home at 2:00 PM, play video games until about 8 or 9 PM,  do homework until 12 or 1 AM, go to sleep and repeat. The only break from that is my Tuesday and Thursday practices, Friday football games, and Saturday competitions for marching band. I had spinal fusion surgery back on July 3rd and that was supposed to be the event that makes me “change my ways”. I’ve stuck true to that in a way by trying to be a better person but I am still this piece of garbage I feel I am. Now my next “event” that will finally set my social life on track is sometime in February (thats when my weight limit is lifted) when I plan to put on weight and workout (I’m 6’7 but only 130 pounds so my goal is 180). I’ve thought about seeing a therapist/psychiatrist, should I do so? I’m in all honors classes 1-2 years above my grade level (Ex: Calcus aka the bane of my existence) and I’m worried that this is starting to finally have its toll on my school performance which will affect my college choices. Any other subreddit I could post this too? I want as many opinions as possible. Thanks for any info you guys provide. ",01Nov2017,2

Then you would say ""Ask for money from your dad"". I have done that what in return? ""Next month ,next week ,next day"".When I ask again he says ""I repeat"".He is daydreaming since I remember.I don't know what he is up to maybe corrupt my 25% life to 100%.If you say he may have financial issue that's not right.He can afford with no doubt.

309,"Hi. I’m in my third year of college and I’m feeling quite depressed. I’ve gained about 35 lbs since freshman year and have absolutely no self esteem. I’ve tried a million times to lose the weight but end up giving up even I want to be thinner so so badly. I’m in a sorority but not really happy in it. It’s a huge group of girls but I constantly feel alone and left out. Yes, I have some friends in it and get invited to go out occasionally, it’s not like I’m totally alone. But I’m constantly feeling left out hearing about other people hanging out together, going to parties I wasn’t invited to, feeling like I’m not good enough. Once that starts I just start spiraling downwards and get so in my head. It sucks. The sorority is my only group of friends and at the beginning of the year I told myself I would join the choir to get new friends and be involved in something else. I of course didn’t go through with it like many other things in life. 
I’m not sure what I’m hoping to get out of posting this, maybe words of advice or encouragement. I’m just tired of being depressed and feeling this way and don’t know what to do to get out of this two year funk. 

Ps. I’m on depression meds and have a therapist but I’m still not feeling good. 

I just wish this was a better time in my life and it sucks college has turned out so crappy",01Nov2017,3
311,"So first off, I don't have a problem with gay people, but I am not gay. At all. But I get the feeling that my parents think I'm gay because when I see them when I'm not busy with university, they always mention how my brother managed to get a girlfriend [he's 17M]. They say I should try and get back into the game because I am turning 21 soon. They have asked me if I am gay on multiple occasions. I think this is because I haven't had a girlfriend since my previous girlfriend of 3 years, who I broke up with a year and a half ago. I've told them I'm not gay, but they always hint that if I'm gay, they will still accept me. What do I do? I'm not sure what to do because I've made it so obvious that I'm not gay. Thanks in advance",01Nov2017,2
312,"Hi everyone, hopefully this is an okay sub to post this in. Just looking for advice on how to calm down and if I shot myself in the foot.

I've been wanting this position for a while now and it's salaried instead of hourly so it's more like a ""real"" career instead of just a job to me. I spoke with the national director of the company today about taking over the position in my region because they're on a hiring freeze right now due to holiday season and can't officially offer anyone the position. In the meantime I'm acting as that position (still getting a raise etc) but if all goes well I transition into the role officially once they're allowed to fill it.

Anyways I made the mistake of updating my Facebook page earlier with the new position title as my job since that's what I'm doing it just could potentially be temporary. I got a text from my boss' partner (no idea how she saw it) saying to please remove the posting asap as it's not an official position that I've been hired into and it's an hr matter. I emailed my boss a short apology and haven't heard back in several hours. I'm having massive anxiety that I jumped into it and they think I'm some kind of idiot who won't deserve the position now.

Any advice is appreciated.",01Nov2017,2
315,"My boyfriend prefers a 9-5 job, he is not so much enthused about starting your own business. However I would like to start my own company and grow it. He thinks it's time consuming and I will not have time for the family, how do we come to a compromise in such a situation?",01Nov2017,2
316,"Okay, so I am interested in planning my boyfriend's 19th Birthday party. I want to do something chill and lax. His Birthday is in February, and I want to do something like I take him out to eat and then bring him either back to my house or his. I know it is probably hard to offer advice because you do not know him. But, I was wondering if anyone could provide any advice or suggestions based on experience or simply ideas. 


Thank You So Much ",01Nov2017,2
320,"I’m 18, I do not have a car but my parents are getting me one in a few months, and I don’t have a job yet but have applied recently.

So at the beginning of October, I had 600 in my bank account because of October. It is now the end of October and I have 90 left. I spent almost 200 ubering me and my girlfriend places since I can’t drive her and she doesn’t have a car or uber, i spent over a hundred on food because i always refuse to let her pay and pay for both of us, and have spent another hundred on entertainment (amc movies are 16 dollars per ticket and i also pay for her so its 32 dollars for every movie plus 10 dollar uber ride to the movie theatre then 10 dollar uber ride back). 20 dollars used to be a lot for me, a hundred dollars used to last me MONTHS but not having a car and having a girlfriend is expensive. I just turned 18, she’s 16 and we go to the same high school so she doesn’t have money either. When I saw how much i spent this month I was just shocked. Idk just venting I guess",01Nov2017,2
321,"Today my fiance and I encountered a huge problem with a medical center about three hours away from where we live. For starters, the specialist my fiance was scheduled to see removed her from her schedule and did not notify us. Normally not a big deal, but it was a three hour drive to get to the facility and her health problems are now delayed another month to actually see the specialist (we scheduled the appoint two months ago, and now we need to wait another month). After she found out her appointment was moved, they scheduled her with a different doctor in an attempt to make her feel like she did not waste her time. As she was asking him questions, she literally saw him pull up google and type the exact question she asked. He even had the audacity to show her what he came across. 

I have already called their PR department and we might be able to get mileage out of their mistake... but I really want to get more out of the deal. I'm a mechanical engineer and we have two kids, so I had to take time off for this appointment to watch the kids. Plus her medical issue will not get addressed for another month and it is already  showing signs of worsening.

Any help or advice would be awesome. Thanks in advanced!",01Nov2017,2
323,"basically this situation is kind of messed up, so i’ll just try to lay it down for y’all. i’m 17, i’ll be 18 in about 9 months. there’s this guy, he’s 21, let’s call him Mike (obviously not his actual name lol). i play soccer, and Mike started helping our high school team last year, because he used to also be on the team back when he was in hs. hes not a coach, but i know he could get in trouble if he ever tried anything. we’re super flirty with each other. at first, i thought it was just how he was, but then i realized it’s only with me. don’t worry, i’m not an idiot so i won’t let anything happen and get him in trouble. i guess what i’m trying to ask is... do i let it go, or do i just hold on until i’m 18 and go for it? it’s just that there’s obviously something there and he’s pretty freaking dope and a great person to be around. just need a little guidance.",01Nov2017,2
