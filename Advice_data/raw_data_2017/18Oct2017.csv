1,"So an opportunity has made itself available to me in another city for work. It's an IT position that would take me from my current residence from Atlanta to Charlotte, and I am just wondering how one would even begin to evaluate the decision. What's the best chance I can look at this? What strategies could I employ?

I have no real obligations within Atlanta. I'm 30 years old, single, no outstanding debts. I would need to break a lease but no other overhead costs besides moving. I do feel attached here, but not as much as I used to.

I'm in Charlotte until tomorrow evening, then I head back home.",18Oct2017,1

So I have been selling some knockoff sunglasses that have been made popular because Gucci created their own pair. I have been selling these pairs for $8 at my school (high school), and one dude (let's call him Shitface) really wanted a pair but he said he didn't have the money. I'm a chill dude so I gave him a pair was like ""Take them, just pay me back"" because he said multiple time he'll pay me back. Well I was a dumbass and made a shit decision, so lesson learned, because now Shitface doesn't want to give me the money after asking him for like 2 weeks.

I told my friend to tell the Shitface that I wanted the money, and my friend also told him that I would keep asking. Well Shitface says something along the lines of ""Oh I was hoping he would forget about the glasses over fall break. If he wants the money then tell him to talk to me and we'll fight.""

Now I'm not the type of guy to pick a fight over $8, so I am trying to think of what to do. I have not had any interaction with Shitface since my friend talked to him about me wanting my money. I have thought of some options. 

1. Confront Shitface and tell him I was being nice by giving him the glasses without him having the money, so I expect the money or for him to give the glasses back - will most likely lead to a hostile confrontation and no solution

2. Tell the school officer that Shitface stole my glasses and get him to try and deal with it (last option)

3. Tell the teacher that teaches Shitface that if he sees that Shitface has the glasses, to take the glasses away from Shitface and give them to me then contact the school officer about the situation.

What are your thoughts on what I should do or the situations I came up with? I don't want to let it go, because I'm selling these glasses for needed gas money. Shitface also has a bad reputation, which I did not know until after I had given him the sunglasses.",18Oct2017,1
6,"Thank you in advance for any replies.

Background -- I work in the banking industry, at one of the very big companies. My job requires a Bachelor’s and Master’s – so I have invested quite heavily in this career path. I thoroughly enjoy the work I do…and so far: the culture, work environment, and relationships I’ve built with both co-workers and the customers that my team serves. Without too much detail, my role is direct counterpart of another role, of which I serve (provide support to) more than one of.

Today I was notified that I will be transitioning to a new area. I will be retaining my current job title, but supporting a new (in the process of being formed) team – with a new (TBA) manager, new counterparts, and new customers.

This new location is 2+ hours away, and “(I) will still have my current office (in the town where I reside) – and am not expected to move (to sit with the new team that I will be serving and working with) unless I want to”. 

Upon initial thought, I was excited at the new opportunity, but immediately became concerned that all of the relationships I’ve worked to build with co-workers and customers in the area, will not be of much use in the progression of my career now that I will be serving a new area and everything that comes with it. To me this feels like I am “starting over”. On top of that, it feels that in order to receive any mentoring/training/guidance from my manager/s (or face time with co-workers, counterparts that I serve, or customers that I serve) – I will need to drive to this new area. I don’t particularly mind this, but as I am paid hourly (based on a salary), I am typically not allowed to go over 40 hours a week. So I seemingly have to balance the importance of getting face-time (which is important to me and what I’d deem necessary to further my career) with my teammates and customers and manager/s, which entails driving 4 hours round trip (and having only 4 “productive” hours on the clock) with working remotely for the typical 8 “productive” hours on the clock. I believe that I will be at a disadvantage compared to people who will be reporting to my same manager, that sit in their office, receive insight from them, and get to see the co-workers and customers daily.

There are a few others with my same role, that support my current team – and I got to thinking “why me”. Of this team, two of our counterparts that we support (I have not worked with these counterparts) will also be transitioning to this new area, of which one that Person A with my current role serves, and one that Person B with my current role serves. Furthermore, the relationship that person B with my current role, and the transitioning counterpart have is very well developed. They work together on a very large and prominent group of customers, and also the counterpart is a strong mentor to person B. They have developed this relationship over a multiple year period of time. 

To me it makes sense, all things being equal, that person A or person B get transferred to the new area, as they at least get to keep some familiarity to some of the customers and the counterpart that they’ve already built upon. 

Person A and Person B are both married, with houses, and I am single and still renting. I love the city that I am in and do not want to move, but it only makes sense to me, if I was in the company’s shoes, that I be the one to be transitioned, as I have the most likelihood of being able to move to that area when I marry and/or find a house. I mean, how will it look to my manager, in terms of how serious I am about my career – if I chose a house in my current city that (continues to) put me at a disadvantage in furthering my career. It is not possible to perform the role that I would hope to be promoted to, while working remotely.

I guess I just am hoping for some input as to what questions I could ask. I want to know “why me?” because I cannot see how it makes sense, unless you bring in the potential of me moving there (could this be an HR issue?). I want to know how exactly this does anything but disadvantage me, and pretty much force me to move at some point in the future, to progress in my desired career path (along with practically ""starting over"" while simultaneously working remotely). Starting over is not ideal as is, before factoring in that I'd have to do it at less than 40 hours a week, by phone call/instant message...

Also, my manager said today, that they found out today, as this came ""from above them"". Am I justified in asking to speak with the person who has the authority to make decisions that affect my career - and receiving answers/reasons directly from them, if my manager says they don't know?

Thank you.

So I meet this girl on Tinder. I was fully intending to have a no strings attached thing. So was she. Well, one thing turned into another, and we've been dating for a little over a month now. 
She is the yin to my yang. She's basically everything I want. She understands me perfectly. Our chemistry is unlike any I've ever had. One problem...she lives 50 miles away. Neither of us have cars. 
I don't get to see her very often. When I do it's amazing. But I find it hard to really bond with her without physically being with her. I mean, we text, we Snapchat, we skype. It's not the same.
I think she might be more attached than I am. I am still in the initial stages of attraction, still unsure about some things. She uses the l word and talks about our future. 
She's a perfect match for me, and I know it. But long distance is killing me.

12,"I've hated college from the start. The only reason I came here was because I never really had a plan B. My brothers went to college and both have degrees at this point. I'm at the beginning of my junior year, and it started becoming a daily thing to think about how I should've just never came to college. I had to leave one of my classes early today because I broke down in the bathroom crying because I have no idea what to do. I'm going for business management but I have absolutely no interest in it. If I'm being honest, I have no interest in anything. A part of me thinks that trade school would've been nice, but I don't even know what I would've done there. The way I see it, I lose either way. If I drop out, I know I'm never going back and I'll be degreeless and struggle with finding a job. But if I keep going, I'm probably going to end up failing because college is honestly making me depressed, and it's pretty hard to do any school work when your only motivation is ""this might get me a decent job someday"".

16,"So, I accepted a job in a place that he never liked to begin with, but with no other stable job offers on hand and considering he was unemployed at the time, our family of three had no choice but to accept this particular position. I could have applied in other districts/provinces, etc, but I *was* limited for time.

Anyway here we are, my SO is a SAHD. My job is a 7:30-4:30 Monday to Friday type deal. We are just *scraping* by. Literally. I'm two days away from payday and today my SO tried to buy bread at the grocery store and was denied because there wasn't enough money in our account. Luckily he has a tiny amount of savings himself so he managed to buy a bit of food.

SO sort of blames our financial problems on the stupidity of our sitation. Of living here. It's a rural place that admittedly doesn't offer much. A handful of restaurants and pubs, a university, schools, libraries, a hospital, a small movie theater, etc. So it's not totally dead, but there's still fewer than 10 000 people living here. SO is a former musician. He's nearing 40. When we had our toddler 2 years ago he was driving a limo out of the airport of our former town. He can't do that here (no airport). He'd be unwilling to do regular cabbing. In our former town he was doing weekly music gigs and traveled a fair bit to do some other gigs. He could only do music *here* if he really applied himself and was willing to travel, but he's not into that anymore. Partly it's because he hates flying and partly it's because he doesn't want to be away from us (particularly our son).  

He's in a bit of a career transition mode anyway, he's been saying for two years. He started a web design course this fall but fell behind with course work and so basically it's all over and we lost $1700. Huge bummer considering he missed the refund drop out date only by a couple days. His SAHD schedule didn't allow him enough time to do the coursework. I guess I believe him but I feel I didn't get the whole story. I mean, isn't online schooling designed for people who have day jobs and stuff? I'm partly thinking he just wasn't into it enough to bother pursuing it any longer. 

We obviously need to get out of this town so we can both be employed. The one-salary thing is seriously holding us back. However, I'm very anxious at the thought of moving to a bigger city where rent can be double, or triple, what we are currently paying. The moving costs are causing me stress already. This would be a huge move and it's proving to be impossible to put ANY money aside.  I know in the long term it could be worthwhile but meanwhile I see it as impossible to drop even $600 as a damage deposit and to pay $1000+ for moving costs. I honestly can't even fathom it. It'll have to be paid for by loans, unless we can figure something out. My SO seems very unconcerned about the financial aspect. I feel we are going to get *seriously* behind and that we'd be smart to plan ahead to avoid this. I would be much more secure with moving if we could at the very least start a little emergency fund or something. 

The thing is, my SO is pretty much unwilling to work in this town. There admittedly isn't much work to be had, so it's tough. He's very intelligent and due to his age and personality, would have a hard time working under some irritable grocery manager's wing, for example. I know he would be insulted if I so much as suggested this. In fact, most work-related ideas I propose for him get shot down. All he wants to do is get out, and ASAP. But the truth is, we're tied down here (due to my job) until June at least! 

I seriously think he should help contribute to our finances in whatever way he can, whether that be music lessons via Skype, working on gigs, or even taking in another child in the daytime. Whatever it takes. But he's not into doing any of this. He complains a lot but doesn't want to do much to change our situation (other than move immediately but of course I am unable to right now). 

So I need advice.. Am I in the wrong for expecting him to find a way to contribute to our income, even if it's not something he's keen on doing? He wants this move more desperately than I do! In fact, I think another year spent here would absolutely kill our marriage. It's getting dire. But how do I approach this whole financial thing with him? It is soo sensitive of a topic.

TL;dr: Husband hates where we are living and wants to get out ASAP. We are scraping by on one income and he can't easily do his profession here so his main role right now is stay at home parenting. But the thought of moving and all associated costs (including big city living costs) SCARE me. We are unable to put ANY money aside. I'm worried about getting set up in a more expensive place. There is no job here he would accept doing in the meantime to help us save up, even if it's just taking in another child from time to time. He seems totally unmotivated in this town, borderline depressed. We need a plan to move forward but it's proving difficult because we are not on the same page about the means to the end. I understand the long term benefits of moving away and both of us being employed but am also caught up in the short term disadvantages. What would you do? ",18Oct2017,1
21,"My niece is a freshman in high school.  Her father has been cheating on her mother over a year, and she discovered it via her dad's social media accounts (he and his mistress weren't hiding anything in the comments sections!). So, since tattling on her father's inappropriate behaviors, he's only stepped up his verbal abuse towards her. Abuse towards his family culminated with protection orders put in the place by the courts, and a divorce is finally proceeding. 

Needless to say, my niece hasn't has the best start her first high school year.  

Last Sunday, she had her first kiss. I don't know anything about the boy, other than the fact that she likes him and they're not dating. He took someone else to the homecoming dance two weeks ago. 

The first day back to school, Monday of this current week, he ""proceeded to go and tell people he wished he could drink bleach after kissing her."" 

I don't know if my niece knows. But her best friend called my sister-in-law to report the gossip and say that she was concerned that this boy is not good for my niece. 

My heart is breaking for her. My sister in law, the mother of my niece, thinks she is desperate for positive male attention. ""She needs her dad - the way he used to actually listen and support her when people are being mean. And I can’t fix that for her. I don’t know what to do anymore. I am worried about her.""

30,"Hi everyone, never posted on this sub before, but I'm looking to gain perspective from other people on this topic.

I graduated college right after I turned 21 and entered the work force immediately. For almost three years now, I've been working like crazy and making/saving a ton of money, but I have not been happy at all. I felt desperate that I was wasting my life away at a desk and that I would regret not seeing the world and experiencing new cultures. I quit my job and went on a month trip backpacking Australia by myself, and it was the best thing I've ever done.

Since I've returned, I have prospective jobs lined up to continue in the same field making a decent amount of money, but I'm feeling pulled to continue my travels while I'm still young, single, and childless. I've done extensive research and reached out to a lot of companies and found that I could easily afford to spend time in New Zealand traveling, work in Australia for a 6 months to save more money, and then continue traveling throughout Asia before coming back to the states. I feel as though covering all of that territory will be helpful because, living in America, it's impossible to go to the eastern hemisphere with 2 weeks PTO per year, but once working I could knock out European countries slowly over time because they're closer.

I am very compelled to do this, but my question is - is this a terrible idea? Other countries deeply value travel and worldy experience, but in the states we seem to feel as though any moment a person spends not working in their field is selfish and lazy. 

Is the risk worth it? Is there anything I should consider?  

I know I can afford this easily with my savings, even in the worst case scenarios I've run through, but something about it is just a little bit nervewracking for me. I truly think it would be the experience of a lifetime.",18Oct2017,1

This guy has been there for 20 years and I know he makes quite a bit. Another guy, who has been there 8 years, still acts like he was just hired. Constantly messing up. Always asking for help. Hes got to be making a good wage at this point. But why when the rest of us have to pick up his slack? The third guy is a huge pot head who pushes off work at any cost. He is actively trying to not do work and push it off onto me specifically. Like holding onto work until the end of the day and then giving it to me when I'm on call.

She told me she saw me as a brother and she didn’t want the friendship to end. I ended the friendship knowing it’d be torture watching her be with someone else and I haven’t talked to her since. I boxed away the emotions over it and just never dealt with them. Recently for some unknown reason I can’t stop thinking about her. She’s in my dreams and I constantly find myself thinking about her throughout the day. I know there’s plenty of fish in the sea and I’ve been turned down and dated several other girls since then. I’ve gotten over all of them but this one girl from two years ago is haunting me. I know she still has this boyfriend, and having the mentality that me attempting to try with dating her again would just be insane and probably pathetic. I don’t know how to get her out of my head. I genuinely want to move on from her. I feel like talking to her about it is the only way to clear things up but I also feel like that’d just create drama and make things harder for me. Should I talk to her again or should I just keep on trying to move on and make no contact with her?",18Oct2017,3

As seen above, I want to wear my Raven costume but I'm worried the amount of thigh being shown might be inappropriate for school. 

However, many costumes that have been worn in previous years by other students have consisted of very high skirts or shorts, or swimsuits/leotards on top of tights (could I do this instead?). As well, our top student council member wore nothing but shorts and brought a skateboard around saying he was Aladdin and he didn't seem to get scolded.

54,"I met Tiffany a year ago through a guy I was dating. They LARPed together and I met her before one of the games. I was warned she had autism and may be a bit weird, but my first impression of her was she just seemed like a cool history nerd who liked anthropomorphic animals/machines. I saw how she could get negative, but otherwise in small doses, there was nothing really ""wrong"" with her.

Now, I no longer date that guy and I've been trying to be a good friend to Tiffany. She has explained that she has scared off a lot of people in the past, so she's constantly worried that I will do the same. I keep telling her I'm not disappearing. But whenever I don't respond to her texts within five minutes, she gets anxious and sends multiple texts. ""Did I say something wrong?"" I've tried telling her that's not possible, but ""wrong"" to her is anything that may make someone frustrated or mad. And I'm starting to get really frustrated.

Every time I message her to say I'm busy, she ""forgets"" and gets anxious. She recognizes it's not my responsibility to keep talking to her all day, but she still ends up upset, which makes me upset. Every time I suggest her trying something different, she's convinced it won't work anyway or just ignores it. So nothing changes. And I'm trying so hard to not be like everyone else. I'm literally her best friend and I can't just blow her off. But having to be attached to my phone and pay attention to the forums we have (she uses role-playing to ease her anxiety) is taking everything out of me.

A little more background: Her home life isn't great. I know she embellishes stories, but she's said her mom physically and emotionally abuses her and that her ""normal"" sister joins in. ""Why can't you be like your sister? You're a burden to the family,"" she claims her mom says. Her dad died of cancer right before she graduated high school. ""I wish I would have died instead of him,"" she often says. 

However she's overcome some odds. Despite the lack of support from her family, she has gone to college (though didn't finish), learned how to drive, and makes all of her own fur suits. I've told her she's inspiring in that regard. I'm blown away by how she patiently crafts her suits step by step to completion, I can't finish a multiple day project for the life of me. But she doesn't give herself any credit.

We started a steampunk cosplay group in our area to try to get people together and to have an option for kids to do something other than drugs. I have been planning events in order to ultimately get Tiffany more friends. The first couple meetings have been a bust but I'm still determined. I feel like if she had more people to talk to that maybe she would ease up on me a bit. But then what if they get frustrated and abandon her like the ones before?

People always ask if we are sisters and I used to be surprised. Now I realise its because I treat her like a disabled sibling. I do things with her when other ""friends"" (from LARP) will not. I entertain her ideas when others dismiss them. She gets talked over a lot and she HATES being interrupted - and makes sure everyone around knows about it.

This has turned into a novel. TL;DR:

Friend has autism, I'm her best friend, but she is draining me of my energy. I know she's not my responsibility, but I don't want to abandon her like everyone else has. What do I do?",18Oct2017,86
55,"Hi everyone, 
For the most part I am happy with my life, but one thing that has been bothering me recently is I don't feel like I command a lot of respect in social situations.  I feel like I am the butt of most of the jokes, people don't listen to me when I speak up, and people are dismissive of what I say.  Is there a way to turn this around? When it comes to joking around, I try to rip on other people too, but it never works.  I can't just ask people to stop doing it to me so much, and I feel like if I try to defend myself people are just dismissive of me or accuse me of taking it too seriously. 
I know there's something to be said about the people you associate with, and I have already removed a lot of negative people from my life.  But I feel like this follows me in whatever social group I'm in.  Even if people are nice and don't rip on me, I still feel they don't listen to me and take me seriously.  
What is the solution? Do I not talk as much? Then I'll just be sitting there not saying anything Do I fight back when people make comments about me? It makes me come across as pedantic and oversensitive. Am I supposed to avoid showing weakness? What am I supposed to do when someone cuts me off in the middle of what I'm saying? Keep talking to myself? Ignore them? I feel like sometimes the only thing I can do is pick on people ""below me"", who are easy targets, but that's not me.  That's not right.

I was in a rush driving to school and in my extreme recklessness, my car brushed against a parked car while I was making a left turn to park in a somewhat tight parking spot left of the car I brushed against. As soon as I finished parking my car in the spot, I got out to survey the damage. 

The parked SUV had exterior paint damage on the left side rear bumper near the tail light and gas tank, but there was no visible dent. The damage looked like a 7 inch dirty smear. My car also had paint and scratch damage near my right headlight. I hastily wrote a note with my contact information and left it on the windshield of the car before heading to class. By the time I was done with class, the car was gone. 

My last car accident, which was also my fault and I reported it to my insurance, happened last year.

87,"So, to start off, I will let you all know that we are relatively young (aged 20 and 21). We got married back in the summer and before that we were engaged 7 months before making the decision to elope. 

At the beginning of our relationship, everything was red roses and sunshine. I had been madly in love with this man since I've known him, which I've known him since our junior high days. I thought we were a match made in heaven...I thought. 

But here recently, I've been having some churning feelings in my heart. I genuinely love him and care about him to pieces, but every single day it feels like I'm getting irritated by everything he does. I'm constantly cooking for him, cleaning up after him, and basically helping him live (note: he has no disabilities). If I don't do these things daily, the house is a total wreck. 

Additionally, some of our past has been rough. It's been hard to admit this, but the man of my once dreams has hit me more than once. I've tried to forgive and he hasn't hit me in almost a year. Still, that doesn't stop me from worrying if he might snap one day. 

Not to mention, I find it really annoying because I feel as if I'm just his ""object"", his thing. He always pets on me, tells me to be ""a good girl"", and is always touching on my breasts or other inappropriate areas. Sometimes, he does this in public. It embarrasses me to no return because I feel like we are way beyond the high school groping act. 

I've tried multiple times before to have a conversation with him about this but all he does is brush it off. I've tried asking for space, asking for a break, asking for help and he says ""Okay"". The next day arrives, and he acts as if we did not discuss anything!! It's getting to the point where I have cried every single day now. 

I'm sorry for this long and unorganized post but I am at my wit's end. I'm just not sure if I should fight for my marriage, or if it's already dead?

The acting service consultant called me at work and apparently there was a miscommunication on which dent I wished to be repaired.  I come to pick up my vehicle and the fender's gaping dent is untouched while I am assured some unnoticeable dent was repaired perfectly.  I am charged $400 for the repair and both consultants and the acting service sales manager refuse to acknowledge the debacle.  

I would like to somehow indicate that my experience with this dealership was incredibly unsatisfactory, but I am afraid of the potential repercussions it might have.  I don't plan on going to this dealership for repairs ever again, but my state only has two dealerships for particular car brand and they both happen to be owned by the same person.  Would it be advisable to contact the manufacturer directly?  Would any concerns about a complaint somehow affecting the status of my car loan/payments be unfounded?  I think the safest bet would be to just keep quiet, but the whole ordeal has been very bothersome for me and has really soured my original excitement that I had accomplished a life goal of purchasing a new vehicle.

96,"So I finally talked to my boyfriend about this yesterday. I can't help but feel guilt/embarrassment/shame for having these feelings, but it has been consistent for almost a year, which is about how long we've been together.

What pushed me to talk to my boyfriend about this was that this weekend, all three of us were at my little cousin's bday party. We were watching baseball on the couch and my sister was sitting next to him. She kept saying how cute the players were and how she wish she could date one. She tells this to my boyfriend. She then proceeds to google and continuously show my boyfriend who she thinks is cute and who is not cute. Annoyed by her attention seeking behavior, I started showing disinterest in the conversation by ignoring her. But she kept talking about it to my boyfriend. Although, he was only paying half attention. I'm in an interracial relationship so my boyfriend is white. My sister says about one of the players ""Ooh that white guy is cute!"" to my boyfriend. Immediately, red flags go off in my head. I get uncomfortable with the fact that these two are talking about my sister's attraction and her types. I find it inappropriate, especially since I wasn't engaging in it. I give her an unimpressed look but she kept going on about it and showing him pictures.

I told my boyfriend how I felt about the conversation. I told him that I'm not accusing him of anything, but i did feel awkward about it. I said that I feel like she seeks this type of attention from him. I also told him that I feel that my sister constantly crosses boundaries in her behavior towards him and our relationship, and whether or not she intends to, her behavior comes off as flirting. I told him that the way she acts around him is not the way a girl should treat her big sister's boyfriend.

He was understanding and receptive, although he said he didn't notice this behavior. He says that I should try to talk to her about it.

How do I do this in a way where she won't deny it and try to make me look crazy/insecure?

Common behavior from her:

-She always has to interject in my conversation with him. Whether or not it's on FaceTime or in person.

-Whenever me and him are having a private, heated discussion, she interjects and says ""Dang, (my name)"". Like she's automatically on his side. I would have to tell her to shut up.

-One time she accidentally slipped up and said, ""I'll take your man"" in front of him. She tried to muffle it once she realized what came out of her mouth.

-There was a time where she literally cornered him as me and him were sitting on the couch (she was standing over him-cleavage out) and she kept showing him meaningless pictures of her and her pet. All the pictures literally looked the same. And she did this for almost 10 minutes after me telling her to move. My boyfriend looked very annoyed and uncomfortable.

-Also she constantly tries to show me and him her Instagram pictures and goes on about how thick and bomb she is. It gets annoying and uncomfortable

-Last week, I left my FaceTime with him on and I went to go get my sweater. I came back and she was talking to him.

-She constantly tries to hit him in a play-fighting way.

-She all of a sudden wants to date a white guy. And is vocal about it around my boyfriend.

-She constantly says how thick and bomb she is around him.

-She constantly says how lonely she is and how she wants her first boyfriend.

Tl;dr: I told my boyfriend how my sister's behavior with him crosses many boundaries. He says that I should try to talk to her. How do I do that without it backfiring on me?",18Oct2017,3
97,"I'll just write it like a list because I don't want to write the whole thing twice.

• Talked to a girl years ago who visited the same place as me once, just friendly talk. At some point I add her on Facebook. I've only met her once. Chances are we have some mutual contacts.

• During some conversation she brings up watching some video about young killers which creeped me out because I said that the video was creepy and she replied ""it's great"", and then I said it was creepy again and she said ""it's great"" again.

• For some reason I remove her from Facebook after this. Maybe connected or maybe I was just cleaning up my friend list. Maybe I didn't have a reason to worry then, but I'm a pretty paranoid person to a tiny degree.

• Flash-forward to earlier this year. We match on Tinder.  Can't be sure if she remembers me, but I end up adding her on Facebook instead of getting her number. This time I felt like the creepy dude asking what she was interested in. I felt a bit ashamed of my behavior and again ended up deleting her from Facebook.

•Yesterday she added me on Instagram and I started talking to her, turns out she lives close to where I live now.

I'm guessing nothing creepy is going on, it was just that one YouTube incident that creeped me out. And I'm always the one starting the conversation.

Am I being creepy or is she? I'm a bit interested in maybe trying to see her, but I'm not sure I should. What should I do? I might be close to getting something started with another girl that's in that case more serious, but nothing like that is obvious yet. We never meet either.",18Oct2017,2

100,"Hi guys
     I know it's early. But I can't stop thinking about this. I'm a talkative senior girl who's never had a boyfriend, and I really like this guy who's a shy Indian computer science guy who's obsessed with video games. I started liking him about a month and a half ago, but I am pretty dang sure that I want him to be my ball date
     The problem is, he's REALLY shy and might not even go to ball. Being as talkative as I am and considering the fact that we have a couple mutual friends, I've been talking to him more and more and walking to class with him. Although our conversations don't extend beyond school, college applications, food, hobbies, and other similar stuff, I really enjoy talking to him. He's not the most social person in the world, but he's an awesome listener and will even ask follow up questions instead of remaining completely silent. 
   I'm just really scared ball won't happen with him. I know for a fact that I'm his only female friend besides his younger sister, so it's not like I have competition, but just that I feel like he might not go to ball. He didn't go on the senior field trip, he didn't  go to a single school dance all throughout high school, and all he does with the few friends he has is play video games.
    I'm just scared he doesn't feel the same way cause it's usually me initiating and leading the conversation. What if he's talking to me only because he's too nice to refuse to?
    I like him because he's a really nice guy. He wouldn't hurt a fly and is fun to have a conversation with because he balances out my talkativeness. I also think he's really physically attractive, even if my friends don't agree.
     Ball is in May so it's months away, but should I bother asking him? What if he says no and I lose our budding friendship? What if he's asexual? What if he gets emotionally scarred?

108,"I'm 32, I've had two dogs since I was 4. The first, Missy, a black lab for 18 years, the second, Jack, a Siberian Husky until I was 28. I lived with my mom and brother until I was 30, so I could pay off my student loans and save for a down payment on a house. My Siberian Husky, Jack, had a chemical imbalance in his brain that caused him to become very aggressive under seemingly mundane things:

*  Shifting your weight.
*  Touching your elbow.
*  Giving a hug to a loved one.
*  Sleeping
*  Various other triggers (food, places). 

We tried various medication's &amp; food (IE: low protein) for the dog, all recommended by the veterinarian, and even paid to have Wisconsin's ""best"" animal behaviorist (according to our trusted vet's office) see our dog on 4-5 occasions. In all, it cost me $3,600 and hundreds of hours to try and fix my buddy, but nothing worked. 

The behaviorist said that in her 17 years of experience working with dogs with behavioral issues, ours was one of the worst. Husky shelters wouldn't take him, nor would any animal shelter. She, the vet all recommended we put him down. I considered moving away from my mom's house to live with Jack without anyone else in the house, but others told me that he was a walking lawsuit waiting to happen and I finally came around to that fact after Jack bit me in the nose while I was sleeping. 

I'm an introvert, so I tend to like dogs more than people. I always took Jack for a 1 hour bike ride around town every night. Always took him to the dog park every weekend. Always had new tricks to teach him, and new toys to give him. I was the primary caretaker, trainer, feeder, etc. So his loss was the worst for me. 

It was the absolute hardest decision of my life. It wasn't his fault he had a chemical problem in his brain, and when he was a good dog he was the best dog. He was also my only friend for years and it ripped out a piece of my soul to give him away to the vet to be killed. I lost control of my legs and it took 10 minutes to find the strength to get in my car to drive home.

For two years after Jack was put down, I thought about him every day. Wishing I was dealt a different hand. Then one day, my mother bought a new dog, a Labradoodle, out of thin air. She tells me with a 12 hour notice that the dog will be in the house. I freaking HATED the idea of another dog. I wasn't psychologically ready. I've had a dog my whole life but this dog I did not want anything to do with. I told her it was her dog, and she had to be the primary caregiver. 

For months, the dog remained untrained a poo'd and potty'd all over my room etc. My mother cared little to train it properly, and my pride prevented me from caring. Every thing I did, I was afraid the dog was going to bite me and for the 9 months I lived in the house with the thing, it never once even growled. However, it was almost 3 years later since Jacks death at this point, and I still thought about him almost daily. 

In June of 2016, I bought my house. It's much quieter now without my brother and mother around, and I feel much more ready to care for another life. However, I've been thinking of getting another Husky. I feel like I need to prove to myself I am not a horrible person and I can bring a Husky up right with all the love, care, time, and commitment necessary for a happy dog. I'm just afraid if it will negatively psychologically make me worse and I'm just not seeing it. 

Sorry for the long post. Difficult to shorten. 

**TL:DR:** My last dog was a Husky, had chemical problem in his brain and bit me 12+ times including in the face. Think I have PTSD from that experience, and 4 years later considering getting another Husky. Bad idea? ",18Oct2017,1
109,"This happened earlier today, but it just hit me what the consequences are as I'm trying to go to bed. 

For those of you who don't know, the FDCPA regulates what debt collector's can and cannot do in regarding to a consumer's debt. Today was my second day of my second week as a debt collector. 

I'm kinda afraid of posting this, in case some lawyer sees it and decides they want to find out all my information and start the lawsuit (can they do that, even if the consumer isn't their client?). But I'm freaking out here, and need advice. 

So what happened is I accidently left a voicemail for a third party. In that voicemail I stated that I'm calling about a debt they have. First problem; they don't have a debt. I thought I was calling the consumer, not a third party. So I mislead them to think they owe us. 

Strike two is when they call back and realize they don't have a debt, they'll know we were trying to contact someone they know about a debt...which means now the consumer can sue the company/me for telling someone about their debt. 

Is my life over? My company now has two potential lawsuits because of my mistake, and they could very well turn around and sue me because of it. I am seriously freaking out right now.",18Oct2017,1

117,"This is front loaded with personal drama because I feel like the context is important. 

I joined a hobbyist group chat about a year ago. The hobby is popular with a wide range of ages, from teenagers to adults, and the group was nice. It was small, pretty intimate, and we all got to know each other really well. Many of us talked on a daily basis. Some of us started chatting in DMs. One of the people I became friends with I'll call M.

M and I were the oldest in the group, and the same age - 27. He and I started chatting privately, since we had the most in common, and eventually we became close. An incident occurred in the group chat that revealed we were both worried about a young girl in the chat, (I'll call her F) who was 13, and the youngest. M and I found out we both had a history of child sexual abuse which made us protective of F. We wanted to make sure that the older users weren't crossing the line with her.

Eventually, M and I had a falling out. He was interested in me romantically, but he lived far away and I had a boyfriend. One night while drunk, he sent me a picture of his dick, something he'd ""joked"" about doing for a while. I was pissed. I felt disrespected and stupid. He panicked and backpedaled, apologizing and saying he'd leave the group. When he did, everyone freaked out (he was popular) and asked him to come back, so I decided to leave for a bit instead.

But the next day, he'd told people we had done sexual stuff in DMs, including the admin of the group chat, and that I wanted the pic, and that's why he sent it. This was a lie, of course. But I felt ostracized. I hadn't been given the chance to defend myself, and even my other friends in the chat were saying ""they didn't know who to believe."" I felt shitty for a couple of days, since I felt like I'd lost a lot of friends at once.

But to get to the point: a few days after I left, B, who is a mutual friend of M, F, and I, told me that M was now in a smaller group chat with F and a couple other people. This freaked me out because of what M had done to me. I worried he would be inappropriate with F. He had once mentioned vaguely that his sexual assault as a kid had left him with a skewed sexuality toward children. At the time, I thought he was speaking in the past tense, but now I was worried about whether that was true. 

I brought up my fear with B, but I don't think he took it very seriously. I convinced myself I was being paranoid and unfairly harsh on M because of our personal history and I didn't say anything to anyone else. 

Now it has been months since I've talked to M or F, but I still worry about it. I follow F on some social media, and I know they're still close. It makes me nervous; he is in his upper 20's, and she just turned 14. He now knows some of her friends too, who are about the same age. Even if he hadn't been inappropriate with me and then lied about it, I would probably be concerned, since an adult man making friends with teenage girls is not good. But I don't know how to bring this up to anyone, or who to bring it up to, or even whether I should. The drama of what happened with me and M was hard to go through, and I really don't want to relive it. But I also worry about this a few times a month. 

Should I just let it go? How can I put this behind me without feeling like I'm letting something terrible happen?",18Oct2017,1

We both monitor the bank account regularly, but I happened to notice he was spending the exact same amount every day (and it was a lot) at the same gas station near his work. I know that's about the price of a pack of cigs so I checked his car and lo and behold, his console is full of empty cig packs. Only the console though, so he was obviously trying to hide them. I confronted him. He apologized and said he started back up again recently and that he was planning on quitting before I ever found out. I told him I was very upset because he lied and hid it from me. (I made sure NOT to say I was mad that he started back up...I know addiction is a strange beast.) He apologized yada yada yada. There were no ultimatums and we didn't talk about him quitting AT ALL. We can get to that conversation another day when he's ready.

There were no other charges (no gas). So he basically he lied to me again, for no reason at all. Like he could have just NOT told me he got home late and I would have never known.

I've never missed a day of class (at least not that class) and I would hate to skip out on class that day solely (no pun intended) because of a minor foot problem.

Though insignificant, it really is distressing for me atm and I don't want to have that conversation with my professor about why I don't want to reveal my feet. Not to mention everyone else will be participating in the exercise while I'll have my socks/shoes on which is equally uncomfortable.

133,"So I'm going through a horrible time period. I had an illness that left me unable to work for over a year. I am now applying at places but it's been more difficult with that huge gap in my resume. I'm broke and lost everything due to medical expenses and I'm staying with my mother. My older douchey brother who was nothing but trouble for our family growing up is now living it up with a hot wife and high paying work from home job. He always had problems and my mom would always attend to him when he went through a hard time. She would listen to him scream and rant about everything. Now that I've fallen on hard times it's like she doesn't give a shit about what I'm going through. She just gives me generic and cliche lines like:





""Be grateful for what you have""


""Try to focus on the positive""


""There are people worse off than you""


""These experiences make you stronger""


""Don't give up""


""Things don't always work out the way we want them to""

She just says the same lines over and over then goes back to doing chores. Her statements seem to be completely devoid of any insight or substance. My brother's only problems in life were due to his own douchebaggery and criminal record. It seems like my mom actually listened to him during his hard time. She would hug him and say ""everything is gonna be alright"". It feels like my brother wore her out for all these years. Now she has absolutely nothing left for me after I've fallen through these hardships of my own. I called her out on it and she said ""what else do you want me to say?"" ""You just gotta think positive"". Really? I feel I can actually make a robot that would literally do the exact same thing. I would just make the robot and program it to say those pre-canned phrases from a playlist at random. It feels like she just doesn't care anymore after all the years of dealing with my brother. She claims she is ABSOLUTELY giving me the same support as him but I feel she just doesn't care. Am I right to be upset at this?



Edit: If she would just admit she doesn't care about my problems in the same way as my brothers I would appreciate the honesty. But she just hides behind these generic statements and refuses to acknowledge anything is wrong.

134,"Sorry in advance - this is gonna be reeeeeaaaaalllyyyy long, so TL:DR at bottom I guess? I'm not sure it can be condensed very well because it requires a bunch of background.

The background is this: I am currently unemployed and having real trouble finding a decent job that I can actually live off of. Importantly, I have never had a full time job - just a) unpaid internships, b) a sales job that worked on commission that I had to quit because I was literally spending more on gas money to get to and from work than I was reliably earning from working, and c) a seasonal part-time job as a receptionist at an internationally-active tax preparation company. This is about Job C, which is, let's be frank, my only really solid job experience.

The tax season (and the time of year where seasonal employees get hours) is from January to April, and last season (early this year) I worked for this company from February to April. Now, I liked the job just fine - the pay was a couple of bucks (about $1.75) above my state's minimum wage and I always got at least 20 hours a week (up to minimum 30 hours a week in April, near the deadline), but the drawback is/was that all employees are strictly seasonal and hourly, so it doesn't offer anything remotely close to year-round financial stability. I also haven't managed to get another job since the tax season ended in April, and I've been forced to live off my meager savings.

Now, this tax company is apparently (last season was my first year so I haven't been through the process firsthand yet) really good about rehiring people season to season if you have good recommendations from your managers (which I have). Basically you're considered an employee all year (just without having any hours scheduled) and your hiring process for the next season is a rubber stamp formality unless you've shown yourself to be an unreliable worker (which I'm not - I've even been told this by multiple people I worked with, separately, that I was their favorite of the receptionists on staff because I was the most professional/reliable). 

The company doesn't offer benefits in the traditional sense, but there are perks for employees: namely that as an employee you can get your taxes prepared for free and can also take all the tax preparation classes they offer (including help getting certified as a tax preparer and the possibility of being hired by the company as a tax preparer right out of the class based on grades and instructor recommendations) for free. I'm currently taking the class because a) it's free for me (and, considering how much it costs for non-employees, that's a really good deal), b) it's a skill to add to my repertoire, c) I might get hired as a tax preparer, and d) since my job hunt was going nowhere, I wasn't doing anything else with my time. Basically I had the opportunity put in front of me and couldn't see any logical reason not to take it.

Because of the way things are going in the class, and because I've been contacted by my old manager asking me if I was coming back next year and responding that she'd be happy to have me in either capacity (receptionist or tax preparer) in the upcoming season, I'm fairly certain I can have my pick between the two jobs come December/January (it is highly unlikely I will be offered both and be able to do a bit of each in the same year, so they're pretty much mutually exclusive).

It's a hard decision (receptionist or tax preparer) because there are pros and cons to each. In a tax preparer's first year at the company, they aren't really trusted with very much because of their lack of experience and the company's quality guarantee. They do get paid a hair more than receptionists do per hour (cents not dollars hourly, not counting a little commission for add-on products/services, but the idea of relying on commission again turns my stomach so I don't really factor it into my considerations), but they're given far fewer hours. Basically you take a hit in your first year so you can advance (get trusted more and given more hours, not to mention getting paid more hourly) in subsequent years.

On the other hand, receptionists might get paid less per hour, but they get more hours than a baby tax preparer so it's an overall gain. However, while there might be slight chances for raises due to seniority with each year of experience with the company, it's nowhere near what seniority as a tax preparer would be worth, pay-wise.

Basically my problem comes down to this: do I focus on the short-term or long-term gains? My instinct would be to go long-term, but I don't really trust my short-term financial situation to carry me that far. It would be different if I had another (even part-time) job, but unless a miracle happens this would be my only income for that period, and who the hell knows what will happen after that and how long I'll have to live on what I saved up between tax seasons. 

I've been worrying myself sick over this. There's an urgency to it (real or imagined I'm unsure) because receptionist interviews are starting NOW (someone has emailed me asking if I could come in this weekend) but the tax course won't even be over for another month and a half, with the confirmation of a potential job in that capacity coming after it's over. So I don't even know for sure what my options are going to be. But I feel like I have to decide quick because I don't want to lie in my interview for receptionist or omit the fact that I might be going for tax preparer instead, because it would be horribly rude and unprofessional to go through the entire process only to pull out at the end/last minute when something else comes along (and it's not like I could keep it a secret that I'd known in advance it was a possibility, considering both options are at the same company). 

I'd be grateful hear some perspectives.

**TL:DR** - It is reasonably probable that very soon I'll have my pick between two jobs at the same company - one with more room for advancement in subsequent years that pays more per hour (but has far fewer hours, meaning much less total pay this season), and one with much less room for advancement and lower pay per hour (but that would offer more reliable hours, meaning more total pay this season). I don't know which to choose considering I definitely need that short-term income but the long-term benefits of the other may or may not be worth the sacrifice. And I have to make the decision very soon, but the deadline for one looms a month before I'll even have all the information about the feasibility of the other (despite being confident in my guesses).",18Oct2017,3
136,"Hello! I am having extreme difficulties with one of my 3 roommates. After being asked multiple times to please not use his dry-herb vaporizer/ pipe inside the house we are renting (We already compromised by letting him smoke in the garage) he says that since he is paying his share of the rent, he should be able to come and go without restrictions. We signed our lease agreeing to not smoke in the house, and we are already allowing him to have a designated area, how do I get him to not smoke in his room? He claims the smell isn't noticeable, but it's noticeable enough to smell in my room on the second floor. It is really frustrating because I have to pay my own way and his parents pay for him to live there, so it doesn't personally affect him if we do get in trouble, yet he says that him covering his portion of the rent makes it fair!

141,"Ok so I'll try to make a long story short. I suffered from a psychotic break down in late 2015 after a series of events unrelated to this, but a major part of it was the thought other people could hear my thoughts and then the delusion evolved into people spying on me. Some crazy shit. I thought people were living in my attic lol. I can laugh about it now since I've gotten myself healthy and learned coping mechanisms. Before I continue, no I'm not schizophrenic. I suffer from manic depression and the episode was a result of drug use. Anyway, during this episode I thought people were using my phone to listen to my conversations and look at me using my camera. My phone would light up, apps would open, after turning my location services off they would be on again it got to the point where I deliberately allowed my phone to get run over by car which is actually a funny story and I'll post that elsewhere, but since then I've gotten a new phone, gotten healthy, gotten into a relationship and went back to school. This is where it gets wild. I'm a pretty conventionally attractive 21 year old female and for some reason as crazy as I was and still am men seem to go nuts for me. Idk, anyway I was writing a paper yesterday and emailed my prof for an extension. She's pretty good about responding in a timely manner so when I didn't get a response I went to check if the email sent. Instead of clicking sent mail I clicked sent messages and there they were. A message to my father and one to my sister from my google account. The one to my father, I'll spare the details, said that I wanted him to know I fuck everyone I meet and I'm a slut and I needed to apologize to him all in first person like I sent them. And this is what really made think something was wrong. The message to my sister said that I had just had a threesome with 2 men and that I needed to confess. But the truth is I have had a threesome with 2 men and my phone was on and in earshot of everything (my only threesome ever) while I was fucking crazy and I've never told a soul. And what's really bugging me is the night they were sent was this August 2nd after I had gotten healthy. I had had a male STRICTLY friend over for some beers after work and I had just gotten into a relationship. My paranoia still kind of lingers and I didn't want anyone to know I was hanging out with my male friend without my boyfriend because tbh I was a slut for a while and I have a reputation so I sent him a couple of texts asking him to turn of snap maps and pull all the way up in my driveway. When he got here I left my phone inside and we sat on the deck. That night around 1am someone used my account to write those messages and frankly I'm kind of scared. My boyfriend and I have a really strong relationship and I disclosed all of this to him and he's nervous about this too. Idk what to do it's really fucking with me and my mental health. It easy to get over things when you know they're delusions but this is real and it's making me relive one of the worst times of my life. Is some guy obsessed with me am I in danger?

146,"Going to try and make this short as possible but no promises. I recently turned 29 years old. Moved from Kansas City to San Diego, CA at 18 to live with my best friend and go to school. School didn't work out exactly as I'd planned. I learned that neither of my parents (both self-employed) had filed taxes in several years and wasn't eligible for aid until I turned 24. In the meantime, I worked my ass off in CA to try and build a life, since my situation back at home was actually worse (unsupportive parents, no transportation and no jobs close enough to walk to, whereas my new apartment had hundreds of businesses within walking distance). I was able to build a very basic life for myself and despite struggling with depression and anxiety, I was mostly happy!

About four years in, I changed jobs from food service to office work. My new boss turned out to be a bit of a psychopath but I was determined to make it work or find something else. Eight months into the new job, all non-management employees were abruptly cut from full-time to part-time. I struggled to pay my bills and often went hungry. Then, towards the end of August in 2011, I was abruptly laid off.

I stayed on my best friend's couch for about two months while I applied everywhere I could walk or ride the bus to. When I was down to the last $100 of my savings, I bought a one-way ticket back to Kansas City at my mom's urging.

For the first year or so, even though I was ecstatic to no longer be hungry or in danger of becoming homeless, I struggled with bringing my anxiety back down to manageable levels. It took me a LONG time to bounce back.

Fast forward to now. Just turned 29 years old. I make 30K, which isn't much, but it's a liveable wage. My job has some upward mobility, but I'm content in my current position for the time being. I share an apartment with my younger brother and I have nice stuff and my bank account is never empty. But I cannot get rid of the feeling that I'm just on an extended ""visit"" to Kansas City, waiting to go back home to San Diego, no matter how hard I try. I blame the fact that I was impressionable when I lived there, becoming an adult for the first time. I visit at least once a year, waiting for the year I'll be there and feel like I'm only visiting and not coming back home for a week or two, but that's how it *always* does feel and when my plane touches back down in KC, I can't believe that this is my life. I dissociate often, forget where I am sometimes when I'm waking up/going to sleep, and feel like time has been stopped for six years.

This isn't an overblown fondness for the city itself. At the end of the day, could care less about the food, the beaches, and the lifestyle. I don't give a shit that it's sunny all year round--that part actually used to bother me and still does! I just miss feeling like I was where I should be, living the life I should be living. I try to recapture that feeling by doing all the things here I would have done there and more and it just isn't the same.

I'm hesitant to move back to that area because I know I wouldn't be comfortable paying upwards of 1400 for a 2br apartment on double my salary (brother would come with and he and I would be sharing, we make the same amount). I would rather move somewhere like Portland or Seattle for the west coast vibe at a more reasonable cost. I'm just sick of feeling like a ghost in my own life and I want to be home.",18Oct2017,1

154,"A few months ago I left my phone in my friends car. I specifically asked him/her to please switch it off and leave it alone, and to give it to me when I was seeing him/her the next day. 

Now let me say that I am bisexual, but I do not make a point of telling people this because it just makes life easier and I don't really see why I should have to tell anyone in any case. However, if someone had access to my phone for an entire day and was deliberately trying to find out personal information about me it is entirely possible that they might learn this.

The next day I just got this feeling that something was up. I sort of jokingly asked if he/she had gone through my phone and he/she reacted kind of sheepishly. Then while we are driving he/she randomly starts blurting out terms like ""gender fluid""; ""homoerotic"" without any context. Then on the way back he/she said rather emphatically ""Don't leave your phone in my car again, because I don't want to see any of your weird shit"", not even in  a joking tone, it was like he/she really meant it. When I got home I looked through my phone and found that their were deleted images in my download folder (I could not actually see the images but the files were still there) that I am almost certain were not there before.

Since then he/she has continued to make subtle allusions towards my sexuality on multiple occasions. I tried to convince myself that I am probably just being paranoid, but sometimes you just know that something isn't quite right and that's exactly how I feel.

In any case I don't think I can get passed this until I'm totally satisfied that this person has told me the truth. I'm about 90% sure that I'm right about this, but if I'm wrong the consequences of a confrontation could unnecessarily ruin our friendship. On the other hand if this person really did violate my trust and betray our friendship then he/she is a terrible person not worthy of my friendship.

155,"This is really hard for me to admit but I think I need professional help but I don't really know how to get it.

I had depression, anxiety, OCD and mild bipolar diagnosed by a psychologist when I was 13 and went to see her once a week for probably a year with no help. I am now turning 18 and still haven't gotten any further professional help for it.

As much as I love my parents, I hate to admit my problems to them regardless of them knowing of them all. I feel like I can't ask them for proper help because it seems stupid. 

Fastforward to today and in the grand scheme of things I have coped pretty well with everything considering going it alone, hiding it from everyone but one trustworthy friend. Over the past year though shit has been fucking terrible. Most of the time my mood is 40% good/average and 60% shitty which is actually pretty good for me. Recently however my mood has been like 50% shitty and 50% fucking aweful and this has been going on for the past year or so. It has been really fucking hard and I started to rely on alcohol to keep me from drowning in my own thoughts.

As much as it hurts, I am not happy with my life, quite frankly I don't like it. It is a constant battle for me to live. Now I know I am not suicidal and I've tried harming myself but honestly it didn't work for me. I have been just getting more and more reckless. 

Currently I am in a happy state and I'm happy for no reason at all. I feel like while I'm in this mood is the best time for me express this and try and get help because when I'm not in this mood, doing anything is hard for me.

How and where do I go to get help? Can my doctor help me with this stuff?

165,"So im 24 female now and have been thinking this for awhile. The older i have got the more i analyze people around me and the people who say they are my friend when actually i feel like its a fabricated relationship. Ive hit a point where i am over pretending to care what these people have to say because i don’t feel any love or compassion from them. Its just me giving the whole time or being bombarded with being posted on social media while we hang when i just want to eat my lunch. I feel like they are getting to me, i feel like i am being caught up in their mess. I feel like they expect me to always be there but when I’m in need they are too busy. Which i never used to mind because i do enjoy my own company.

My recent goal is to save for a house deposit and ive been told that im a ‘loser’ for doing so and that ‘im no fun’. 


Im lost, so i need some advice, is this normal to feel this way? What do i do? ",18Oct2017,6

167,"I'm a 35 year old guy living in Iowa currently. I have no idea what I want to do with my life career wise and lately have just been feeling like going to work is the worst thing ever. About 4 months ago I left my long term employer of 10+ years to take a contracting position that was a very large increase in my salary but cannot stand the job, at all. I wasn't terribly thrilled with my previous job either but looking back, I'd much rather be there than where I am now. I'm a relatively smart person and feel like I could pick up most things given a desire to do so. I've looked into computer programming recently because I'm a very logical thinker and thought that might be a good fit but I just don't have the desire to really learn it. I’m an introvert who enjoys solving problems but not necessarily performing the solution to the problem over and over. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to figure out what I might be interested in. Is 35 too late to get involved in a trade? Ideally, I’d like to find something in the 50,000/yr range so it doesn’t need to pay exceedingly well, but its certainly not entry level pay around here.

My current contracting position is for a very large bank and revolves around reporting and analysis. I do not have any formal training in this but I've picked up much of the skillset from my previous position. I think my biggest issue is going into the office and looking at my day and going ""Okay, how the hell am I going to fill 8 hours with constructive work today?"" I don't feel that there is enough work to fill a 40 hour work week or perhaps I'm just not doing things I need to be doing. The person I'm working with/for began working from home 100% of the time about the same time I've started so I don't get a lot of direction in that aspect. But lately just the thought of spending my day in a cubicle and looking past that, spending my working life in a cubicle is just one of the worst feelings I've felt in a long time.

My previous position was in a warehouse where I helped manage/troubleshoot the warehouses computer systems. Not hardware, but the actual software that controlled the warehouse operations (ie stock, manufacturing, logistics, etc). I got to do a variety of things and there were always places to jump in and help if it was a slow day and nothing much else was going on. May not have been my favorite thing, but at least the hours went by relatively quickly. Now I find myself looking for something new. I don't necessarily want to work in an office setting but I'm not entirely against it, given that there is work and tasks to do that will fill an entire day.

168,"So I was texting a co worker with a funny story that happened at work because A newer coworker thought a nickname we have for a lady was her last name so this coworker called out to the lady using the nickname which she doesn't know about luckily the lady didn't hear her but I found it hilarious. Now this lady is not a cool person she screamed at other coworkers and stressed them out/ made one cry and is extremely rude to children and their parents as well. After telling my coworker this the coworker said that maybe I shouldn't call people names and I said she deserved it with the way she was acting(eluding to the earlier stuff i mentioned that this coworker doesn't know about) and that people call me names all the time and I don't care.

After I've applied for a job or contacted an estate agent, I would be too anxious to pick up random phone-calls. I have to ignore the call, listen to the voice mail/Google the number so I know what it is about, take 10 minutes to calm down and to prep mentally. Only then I call them back.

If I know that I have an appointment with somebody I don't know the next day, I would feel anxious about it throughout the day and that affects my sleep.

179,"
My daughter is very naive and introverted, she doesn't go out much and stays home all the time unless her friend comes around. My daughter and her friend are not your typical party girls of that age. My daughter and her friend love stuffed animals and he bought each of them an inappropriate stuffed doll that had breasts and genitals visible. When i asked him why, he said ""come on man this is hilarious."" Whenever they want to go out (both dont drive we live in upper east) he would quickly volunteer to take them out. He seems to be around my place very often lately but it doesnt seem for me but for my daughter. When my daughter doesnt have her friend over, he takes on her friends role. He would go into her room and ""play"" around. He would take selfies with her and look through her closet and outfits. At first i honestly did not know how to react or what to think of this since he never really did anything harmful and we have been great friends for over 10 years now but it just seems odd to me, am I right? I watched my daughters behavior towards him closely but she doesn't seem to pay him any attention and seems oblivious. When he is around her, she seems cold and inattentive and i just wonder why she doesnt tell me anything?

My last straw was when My daughter's friend was sleeping over and they were doing eachothers makeup, hair and doing their thing and I find my friend in the room sitting on my daughters bed just watching them. I didnt know what to say so i asked him if he wanted a beer, so i got him out of there. When I asked my daughter why she didn't say anything she said ""dad i didnt want to be rude, he is your friend."" When I got mad and pressed her to tell me whats going on. She began to cry and said ""dad he creeps us out"". She then told me about an incident where they were trying on different outfits and he walked in on them changing. She said they screamed and he left but commented that they looked cute. Am I right to be livid at this and find it inappropriate even though they are 23?

180,"I'm 21 years old living in Canada, I dropped out of university for business after completing 2 years of it because I didn't feel like it was right for me. I always liked programming since the beginning of high school, in fact I helped students build websites using HTML when I was in grade 10. My dad knew about this and suggested that I become an electrical technician because firstly my dad was in the field and though that this could get me a competitive edge and secondly programming was involved.

I did a year of trades school which I completed and got my associate technician licence. My dad landed me a job at his company as soon as I finished school. 

I enjoyed the work at first, I was making more money than most my friends who were making minimum wage or were still stuck in school. I was building electrical panels as well as programming. I woke up everyday with a feeling of purpose. Unfortunately, as time went on I started dreading the job more and more. It wasn't the job more so it was the company.

The company is a small to medium size manufacturing company that builds electrical panels to aid companies in quality control purposes. They are very relaxed when it comes to management. The bosses here could careless if you were watching YouTube videos because your work load was light. However, the company is very very disorganized when it comes to ordering parts, scheduling jobs and keeping track of items on stock. Also, my work load for the last couple months has been very low so I have been assisting the mechanical technicians with their work (even though I'm not really of a hands-on mechanical guy) or spend the entire day at work doing absolutely nothing. Going to work and doing nothing is very demotivating because I feel like my skills are being wasted and I don't feel like an asset to the company. These issues have slowly deterioted my patience until I feel like I had enough.

I have been working here for 6 months and want to go back to uni for computer science part time and work at a new job full time. My dad (who got me the job) says this is a bad idea as working somewhere for 6 months looks bad on a resume, and doing work and school is going to be too difficult to me. He is also concerned about the most of student debt I have accumulated on the 2 years of uni and the 1 of trades school. His idea is to ride out the job for a year and a half before transferring to a different job or going back to school.

I don't know what to do, to go with my gut feeling or listen to my dad. I do hope I start feeling like an asset again for this company soon. Sorry for any bad grammar or spelling. I'm typing this very quickly at work. Thank you.",18Oct2017,1
181,"Before the witch hunt begins, I’ve never hurt anyone, nor do I have any desire to.

I was raped/molested on several different occasions before I even turned 11. It really warped my world and it wasn’t until well after the chance to fix it had sailed did I realize how fucked I was. From there, I isolated, ashamed and afraid of what I was. I’ve been living as a NEET for almost 20 years now.

You can read some more details of what happened in my life [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/76xpo4/the_shrug_life_syndicate_now_pedophile_friendly/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/7701i5/why_am_i_a_pedo/). **PLEASE NOTE:** I wrote these while livid at that sub’s top moderator for suggesting that I have a community and was aiming to defame the sub. They contain a good overview of my life struggle, but they also tread over the line of decency.

This was the first time I ever opened up about my problems, and also the first time I ever got any advice about what to do to fix it. One of the users PM’d me, and while chatting suggested that I come here to get more perspective. He said perspective was important. So, that’s what I’m looking for.

I know I need professional help. If you read my one post, you’ll know that I had a therapist who took advantage of me. That makes me very wary to branch out and let myself be vulnerable to one. Also, there’s the fear that they’ll just contact the authorities when I tell them. I’ve heard thoughts from people about both possibilities. I just don’t know what the reality is.

Along with that, what can I do to help myself directly? I want to get into a hobby to take my mind off of my lusts and obsessions. But, I only have NEET bucks and I can’t really invest into anything. What hobbies are worth investing time into that don’t have a big monetary investment?

Any other advice? I just want to improve my situation and hopefully one day get away from this unhealthy addiction. I understand this isn’t a topic people like to think about, so if my existence is distasteful to you, I understand, but please let me surround myself with positivity so I can move myself where I need to be. I’ve lived in a dark world for many years.

Thank you so much in advance. This is terrifying for me, but I know it's something I need to do to get better.

184,"***In spite of what my username suggests, I'm 90% certain I'm NOT going bald. This isn't an ""Am I balding?"" post*** either, if I wanted that I'd go on /r/tressless. 

I've had this fear of going bald one day for a while, probably since I was a child and noticed how I have a very prominent cowlick and M shaped hairline. Heck, I even remember as a teen and preteen getting ""you're balding, dude"" comments when people noticed my cowlick. 

It got even worse when I was a teenager and my mom said something like ""enjoy your hair while you have it, my brothers all went bald by 30.""

It started going into overdrive about two years ago when I noticed that I have high temples, but based on old photos my hairline has always been similar to this. 

Anyways, I'm 22 now and as hair as I can see, my hairline and crown have not changed much if at all, plus 23andme said I have fantastic genes in this regard (it's not set in stone but it's at least an indicator), and my dad, his brothers, and both my grandfathers, had plenty of hair into their 70s.

In spite of all this, I still frantically check my hair line, feel around for differences in thickness, inspect it whenever I walk past a mirror or window, and constantly take photos of the back of my head with my phone or webcam. When I'm around family or friends, I keep asking them if they think I'm balding or not. Seeing stray, shedded hairs on my pillow, desk, or in the shower gives me a heart attack every time.

It's gotten to the point of ruining TV, movies, or even walking on the street because whenever I see a bald/balding man (even one who's obviously attractive like Jude Law), my first instinct is to think ""oh god, I'm not starting to look like that, am I?""

It's not even over fear of not being able to attract a partner. I know plenty of bald men who are married or have girlfriends. I guess it's like being forced to wear a shirt I don't like for the rest of my life. 

**tl;dr: most likely not going bald but I can't help but constantly worry that I am and I want to stop freaking out about it.**

I made an appointment with my college's counselor but there's a long wait time. I don't mean to self diagnose, but I've thought about looking up techniques for body dysmorphia since this seems quite similar. I've thought about shaving my head to say ""see, this isn't so bad"" but I'm worried that would backfire because I have a really oddly shaped head.",18Oct2017,5

189,"So there is this girl I've been friends with for about 11 years, since the 1st grade. I think friendships formed and developed during these ages are usually hard to break and the individuals involved can get really attached. So, my friend and I have had our differences in the past. When we were little, at 5th grade, I realised she was lying about a lot of things and she was always trying to manipulate me into doing what she wanted. Also, stuff we pretended to do, for fun, (like, we would say we were fairies) she actually believed they were true. So I decided do distance myself from her, my then best friend. 
     Two years later, we both developed a strong friendship with another person, which resulted in us being best friends once again, especially after that person moved away. All was good at first, but two years later she started being rude to me (only in front of other people), she became really jealous and competitive and she started copying many of the things I did. I pretended not to notice at first and I also helped her through difficulties she had with her parents and through a breakup. After some time, I also broke up with my boyfriend and she was not supportive at all. She ignored me to be with her boyfriend, who I had also helped through a breakup and who also ignored me. That was when I realised I didn't want to be friends with her and distanced myself for a third time, after having explained to her multiple times what was bothering me. She almost begged me not to stop spending time with her and a few months later we started spending time together at school. 
      Now we are both seniors and for the past two years she gets to my nerves like never before. She is competitive even about the most unimportant things, she never says anything nice, she's extremely jealous and tries to make me sound as if I'm lying when we're in front of other people. Like, she mentions things that have never happened, which had they happened they would contradict what I'm saying. She copies my behaviour and expressions, she tries to change her mind if I disagree with her on something and if I think a person likes me, she tries to find clues that would prove he likes her instead. My mom drives her to school two days a week with me because there is no other way for her to go and she's never said thank you, not once. So I have three problems. All our disagreements have been via social media because she avoids face to face confrontation. 
      1) How should I handle things with her? (What to tell her, how to distance myself) 2) Everything she does, she does it either when it's just the two of us, or really subtly.

My one passion in life has been music - writing, recording, playing live. I was in a band (as a duo) with my ex for a few years. Our relationship ended mutually a couple of years ago, but we continued making music together anyways. Our relationship was often very volatile, and we both sort of knew it was ending, so it was really the right/sane thing to do for both of us. 

There are no romantic feelings whatsoever and we live in different counties, so would only see each other when it was related to performing together or whatever. I'm very proud of the music we've made, and it feels like a child to me. 

I've since gone into a new relationship (together over a year now), and that's caused a LOT of friction on all sides. My new girlfriend doesn't want me having any communication with my ex, which has meant the band coming to an end. My ex seemed jealous of me moving on, though she'd attribute that to her saying that my new GF would somehow get in the way of the band, and not that she wanted us to get back together. 

So really it's a decision of which path to take. A : stay with my new GF (which is a much healthier, calm, stable relationship) and leave the band behind, or B : stay making music with my ex, and feel fulfilled in that.... I know this probably seems ridiculous that I'm even trying to decide between the two and BELIEVE me, I wish I wasn't torn but it's just how it is. 
I've tried making new music of my own, but I've no motivation or passion, and just feel so guilty for throwing away what I had. I feel also guilty that if the band is over for good, my ex would quit music altogether, and I probably would too

Hi I'm a 14 year old and extremely insecure, I hate myself. What do I hate about myself? I hate my appearance, my personality, well everything. Lets start off with the personality, I'm shy yet extroverted, a difficult combo. I'm quiet in class, feel too much of a goody two shoes but I'm much louder outside. I want to be more rebellious and interesting. I do not like that I am not as outgoing or cool. I live in a foreign country, and when I speak my mother tongue I feel a lot more outgoing and confident, almost as if I have a different personality. My appearance is the biggest part of my insecurity what starts it all. My body is slender, like a stick. I have a small waist (24 inch) but my hips aren't that wide, my legs are toned but thin, I wish they were thick and I only have A-B cup boobs (don't judge), my butt is small though thankfully round due to squats. My hair is long dark brown and curly, though some stands are lighter browns or golden brown (not highlighted). My face has sharp features like defined cheekbones and jawline, which cut through my happiness. My lips are medium sized and my eyes are hazel and big like a fish. I have a small button nose, though I want a greek nose. I hate my face and my body most of all. I want to be slim thick, to be curvy but I'm slender and I hate it, I do not feel womanly at all.

214,"Hey guys I’m 16 and just graduated high-school early and am not sure what to do next. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I am very creative and have been producing music for the last 6 years. I am passionate about it and take it seriously. My ideal life is making music for a living. I don’t have my actual drivers license so work is limited by distance right now. I hated school my whole life and couldn’t stand going into general ed right now. I am skilled in technology (building computers, basic IT, web design etc) and can make decent graphic art. I have been sober 6 months and seriously struggled with depression/drug abuse the last 2 years.

Honestly I feel like college won’t help me RIGHT NOW. I want to be happy and free, and the idea of loans and getting a degree “to get the job” is just depressing.

So that leaves work.
I am skilled and would love to be able to get a job that isn’t food service. And I want to expand my social circles. I hang out with 18-20 year olds mostly. 

What kinds of jobs should I look into? How much should I focus on music now? And how much income should I be saving for the future (I only buy nicotine and synths).

215,"Hey guys

So the situation is: I'm 21, in college, and another freshman joined our class mid-term. 

This is the one guy in our class I truly dislike. I get along with everyone else, we may not be best friends but we talk. This guy, though... Imagine a 20-25 year old, above average height, who has rich parents and the nicest car in class, and uses it to drive girls home. I think you may be getting my twist.

The main problem I have with him is that for whatever reason he acts as if he has known me for years. So his tone and attitude are *way* off, bordering on being disrespectful. Why he assumes I will just take it and shut up is beyond me. He is taller than me, but as far as I can tell not much stronger, but still that may be a reason. 

The thing is, he has never outright insulted me or directly confronted me in any way. It's just little things. For example once I was walking behind him and a girl from our class who was asking him for a ride. And he just turns to me while speaking to her and goes ""James also has a car. Don't you James? Why don't you go with James?"".

I had never spoken with him before, wtf. Why is he using me and talking to me like that for? Now obviously in this situation I couldn't try to escalate it, I'd be seen as the bad guy or the white knight who only reacted because the girl was involved.

Another little thing is him going ""James, let's go to class"", in an pretty serious tone while I'm talking to someone else. Wtf dude. I don't know you. If you want to go to class, go to class.

It's not just me. He almost got into a fight at dinner with another guy for the same reason, both of them talking as if they had known each other for years. But the thing that is annoying me is that he is slowly infiltrating my social circle, because some of my friends like hanging around with him.

On the other hand, it's also not something easy to pin down. I can't exactly pay him a drink and say ""I didn't like when you did X"", because as far as I can tell acting like this is part of his personality. 

How am I supposed to deal with this?",18Oct2017,5

222,"I currently work a fairly normal full time job plus have a one night a week job working at a local restaurant. I started working at the restaurant six years ago because I love cooking and love learning more about good food. I've really enjoyed my time cooking at this place but am wondering if it's time to move on to something else and/or spend more time with my family. Working at the restaurant for so long has started to get a little boring and I don't really feel like I'm learning as much as I was before.

At the same time a good friend of mine is opening a brewery near my house and I would love to work for him part time, as I am an avid home brewer. Unfortunately he doesn't need any help doing actual brewing stuff and I could only work for him serving beer. If I could brew for him I'd do that in a heart beat, but just serving beer I'm not sure how much new stuff I would learn or what opportunities I would find for personal growth. The purpose of the part time gig isn't financially motivated, I just like having something on the side to push myself to learn new skills and grow personally, since my full time job is fairly mundane. So what would you do?

Option 1 -- Continue working at the restaurant, try to find new ways to be challenged in this role
Option 2 -- Work at brewery but only serve beer, hope that role may change over time to include brewing activities
Option 3 -- Don't work part time, dedicate extra night per week to family

223,"Hello Reddit,

I'm in need of advice, the problem is: I have no idea how to talk to women who are around my age. Or better: I have no idea how to start a conversation with them. I'm not the type of guy who just starts talking to strangers. 
I'm a pessimist and I live in my own head. I have a constant fear of rejection, I have a very negative view on myself. I'm pretty shy when talking to people I don't know and the first conversations with me are usually pretty boring because I don't know how the other person reacts to some stuff. I pretty much have 3 big hobbies wich are drawing, music and movies, I don't know what else to talk about. 
Well now I'm a 22 year old loner, who never had a girlfriend.

I slowly start to think that I have no interesst in women anymore because it's expected of men to make the first step. I will never be able to do that. I had a pretty depressing past, it's hard for me to build up a connection to people because I fear loosing them (half of my family died within the last 7 years).

I don't work in a job with much future and I'd rather don't talk about that with other humans. My friends can't understand why I'm depressed and have such a negative view. They think I'm a fun guy.

I am tired of beeing alone. I don't look for a perfect 10/10 90-60-90 girlfriend, I just want someone I can talk to. Someone I can cuddle with while watching some movies and every now and then fu**ing my brainz out...

227,"Hi All! I just want to thank you in advance for reading and for offering me advice regarding my situation. I am going to go over some basic non-career related things to start and I promise that they are related to my current situation. 

So my mother has been battling cancer my entire life and she has overcome challenges that most people would perish from. This year in spring I was offered a position at a company. Now this company happens to be located halfway across the country from my family. I was a little leery to move so far away because I worry about my mother and I want to be accessible if she needs my support. 

I asked her if she minded if I moved across the country for a career change and she was very supportive of my choice. She actually assured me that her blood levels have gone down and she is confident that she is beating cancer. So I made the decision to do so. 

Since moving I have come to the conclusion that not only do I not feel that I made a good career change but I also miss my family and my hometown. On top of that my mother is continuing to battle cancer and she is not doing as well as she formerly had in the past. This worries me because I am so far away. 

Since starting this new position I have networked with a friend of the CEO of my company. He has offered me a position working with him and it actually will relocate me to the neighbouring state that my family is from. This will put me less than two hours away from home. 

Now he has made it very clear that he wants me to handle the transition from my current career to working with him in a professional way. He doesn't want to ruin the relationship he has with my current employer and he is worried that they will not take my news so well. 

The lease for my apartment is up in the spring of 2018 and I obviously need to continue working where I am until then so that I do not violate the terms of my lease. I just need to know if anyone can offer me advice on how I can break the news to my employer. The number one reason that I will be quitting is due to wanting to relocate to be close with my mother and I think that is a 100% valid reason. 

Also, the new career choice will offer me a better salary.

Two things that worry me about this though:

1. I am worried that my current employer will tell me that I can just work from home. 

2. I am worried that he will be bitter and works in the same industry that I will be working in the future (New job and current job are in the same industry). So we will most likely cross paths in the future and I would like try to maintain my professionalism. 

Is there a way that I can handle the situation to avoid these scenarios? 

Thank you again.

229,"I've known this girl since highschool, we've always been friends, and she always got on my nerves a little but it wasn't a big deal. We now work together and I see her every day.  
She nonstop complains about her live in boyfriend, about her family, her job, and that she has no money. Meanwhile she drives a 3 year old car that was bought for her, and is going to school with tuition that is paid for, and has a place full of nice new furniture that was bought for her. 
I understand completely that everyone has a different lot in life, my issue is not that she is given so much, but that her family gives her so much and she always tells me she is so stressed because she has no money, and complains about her family, and complains that her family gives her so much stuff. I have friends that had things paid for and they can say that they are lucky and they're grateful and that doesn't bother me. It's the fact that she says all this stuff ""doesn't count"". She tries to act like she's just as hard-off as I am while I'm barely scraping by and my family doesn't have the money to help me out. 

She also used to tell me that no guys would ever like me because of my body type, when I met my boyfriend she told him that he'd prefer someone with a body like hers. I have health problems and she blatantly brushes it off (I have joint hypermobility which makes me flexible but also have some pretty excruciating joint pain, so she says stuff like sarcastically ""ooh that must be soo hard for you to be so flexible"", I'd gladly trade flexibility for a pain free day every once in a while). My boyfriend is older than me by a few years and she one day made a big fuss about how gross guys my boyfriends age are. I pointed out my bf is that age (it's only a few gears difference it's not even that big) and she shut up but never apologised. I can never disagree with her on even the smallest things without her blowing it into a big fight so I feel like I'm always walking on eggshells. 

Today I was pushed too far and pretty much told her it must be nice to have everything paid for and not have to struggle to get an education like the rest of us. Obviously this pissed her off. I know the adult thing to do would be to apologise but I don't feel like I should have to after all the mean things she's said to me and never apologised for.

230,"Hey, 19 year old dude here. 3 years ago I started studying at a technical college, I'm in my last year of school with only 2 months left. I made friends with a dude in my class, also as a coincidence we shared a group of friends outside school. Fastforward 2 years later and for no reason he's starting to become really really toxic against me, as if he hated me for some reason, he constantly heckles me in front of other classmates and does everything he can to annoy me (you wouldn't believe how many times in the past year I've barely held my anger back not to cave his face in, being scared of thrown out of school stopped me).

I've asked him before why does he do that shit and that only resulted in him showing it and laughing about it to my other friends. 

But it's like we're still kinda friends. We sit at the same table still in most classes etc, but I can't stand him anymore. The thing is, after we finish studying we will probably both be working in the same company as interns, which means just cutting him out of my parties would make things very awkward.

231,"Put simply, I'm greedy..very greedy and selfish. Not so much when it comes to money or something, I spend normally and happily assist family with money, but I mean greedy in a ""I want everything, you cannot have these things"" sense.

I'll put it into recent context, it may seem juvenile since I'm going to give an example that comes from a video game, but it perfectly shows what has me so upset about myself and the way I behave. There's a video game I play online (WoW for those curious) with others that has a lot of factor based on luck. Some win, some lose, and it's pure luck who does. What ends up happening with me is when I win and my allies lose (I don't consider them ""friends"" since we only chat casually here and there and only in the game, I don't consider that friendship, but more allies with the same interest) I feel special, like I stand out because I won and I enjoy the praise I get from others. I'm always courteous and humble about it, though, I take praise in stride and don't gloat about my victories..however the real problem and what annoys me to no end is when the reverse happens. Someone I play with lucks out over me and gets something amazing, or gets the same thing I got a month or so ago and now suddenly I lose that feeling of being victorious in the past, I'm actually upset and angry that they got what I have and even though I (obviously) congratulate and act happy for them, inside I am full of anger and upset they got something nice. This is plain selfishness and greed..and I really hate this about myself. The worse part is I can't really think of a way to ""solve"" this? how can I force myself to actually care when others get nice things and I don't? I feel it's certain people just genuinely like seeing others succeed, and others only care about their own success (greed). I just act nice and polite and praise my allies, which is all they need to see on the surface, but I myself am angry and upset every time this happens and wish they didn't get nice things like I do. This is not good and I have no idea how to rid myself of feeling this way on the inside. They never know it, but I'm really greedy and selfish deep down despite how I act outwardly to them.

 I am a college student, depressed. But (by accident) I finally understood what causes my depression/anxiety! It has always been the motherfucking food. Grains. Sugar. Bread, Oats, Rice, Pasta, Cereal, Sugar. That's always been in my diet, ALWAYS.



**And the thing is: the last trip to the grocery store consisted almost *entirely* of this food that affects my mental health.**



I have 1kg of oatmeal, 1.5kg of pasta, 2 loafs of bread, 7 cans of pre-cooked food (chilli con carne, ravioli, lentil soup, etc..), pork sausage, etc.. sitting in my pantry


It's 50 dollars worth of food, that was originally intended to last the next two weeks. Food that I CAN eat, but will make me feel like shit, depressed, and anxious. 

I have a test coming up next week. So I need to start my new diet NOW.

BUT what do I do with the $40 worth of food I just spent?

* Don't toss the food. Keep it there, and eat one of the poisonous items once a week. Eventually making use of it.

  * Downside: I don't have that much space for food storage as I live with roomates

* Give to charity

* If possible, make a deal with one my roommates: I'll give you oatmeal, pasta, bread SINCE you can eat it no problemo. And the roomie gives me non-toxic food in exchange

What always happens is I talk to a girl (i am a guy) and for the first two days I feel absolutely infatuated. I think they are beautiful, i love texting or talking on the phone, I am funny and upbeat with them and I act normal. But after a few days it all goes away and I feel nothing at all. I don't use girls for sex and sex doesn't have anything to do with it. 80% of the time I feel nothing without even making out or getting a hug so that's not it. But texts or snaps become annoying, the idea of sex or even making out makes me nauseous, and I just essentially become the opposite of what I was. Then at some point I break it off, and maybe a week later I'll do it again with another girl. The reason I think its a personal problem and not that ""they just werent the one for me"" is because of the number of times it has happened. I am not a bad person or a user, so please do not label me as one. I honestly just want a stable functioning relationship that lasts more than a few days.

The back story is that the last few years have been a rollercoaster of family and health issues.  As a result there is a huge gap in my resume.  This compounded by the fact that even what's there is spotty at best.  I have Crohns disease and it's historically made jobs quite difficult.   Things are better now, but I'm worried the damage can't be undone with regards to employment opportunities.  I'm not looking for anything in a specific field as I'm not qualified for much, mostly retail /grocery.  Do you guys have any advice on how I go about minimizing the atrocity that is my resume?  I'm very very overwhelmed and riddled with anxiety over it.   I'm not sure if this is the right place to be asking for help and advice, but I think I'll cross post to r/resumes.

247,"The title says it all. But for the sake of details:

There is a guy in my friend group that I was never particularly close with. He reached out to chat with me, and in the last month or so we had a 'thing'. Basically total puppy love (or whatever), lots of sweet messages, and talking all day.

He didn't want anyone in our friend group to know as another girl in the group had a crush on him and he did not want to upset her. Fair enough. 

He lives in another state so we never met, or even spoke about it since it was so early on. But I sent him naughty pictures, which he has saved (despite me asking him not to).

Basically yesterday night his bestfriend (my good friend) messaged me saying he knew we were a 'thing' and I deserve to know that he is only talking to me because he 'thinks I'm hot and wanted my nudes' and for no other reason.

When I woke up today, I called this guy out on it, and it was true. I got played by this guy and I feel dumb as hell. 

I'm also particularly salty about it because he knows I just ended a relationship where I was cheated on.

My question is, should I expose him to our friend group? There are about 10 people in our group, 4 of which I'm extremely close to. If I tell people though, they're going to know how stupid I was and I'll be extremely embarrassed. If I don't tell people, I need to act okay with him in front of everyone.

 not a lot of people like me and i tried to change so much but i just suck at socializing. There are two people who actually enjoy hanging out and talking with me and they are not that liked too.


I tried to change myself so others like me (in terms of looks, which i have improved on and in terms of personality which i can't even after 4 years of trying) and still majority of people don't like me, i won't get into why because i made a lot of posts asking for advice and read ton of articles how to be more likeable and i still can't change.


I am thinking about just leaving everything and to start to not give a shit about others and start really working on myself keeping those two friends who are socially awkward as me.


I am going to wait until highschool (its starting in one year) and will get a fresh start there.


Does that sound like a good idea? I can stop giving a shit about it pretty easy if i ""train"" my brain correctly, i am really sick of constant worry and self hatred that i am not good enough to be loved and to accept that when the time comes i am going to meet the right person for me, in terms of both friendship and relationship.

We had an indecent today regarding a BB gun/rifle. One of our neighbors shot our gardener and he began to bleed and was taken to the hospital.

Now we know it came from the neighbors window, we have video of him shooting cans from his house another time.And he has shot our other neighbors window before.

All of my older siblings had phenomenal test scores and were given full rides so my parents have no experience in what to do. My schools counselors have proved time and time again to be unhelpful.

258,"Hey guys, 

So my boyfriend is from Ireland and I've been living over in Ireland with him since March of this year (I'm American). My visa is only for a year (expires end of April 2018), so our plan was for him to come back with me to America before my visa is up (we were aiming for January 2018) to live and work there. He is a musician and says he wants to leave Ireland anyway, so it works out. I have always made sure from the beginning of our relationship that he doesn't feel like he HAS to go where I go, or move anywhere he doesn't want to. It would kill me to think that I was making him live somewhere he doesn't want to just to continue the relationship. 

Anyway, so obviously the big puzzle was how to get him to America legally. There is a work opportunity that he heard about through other musician friends - a gig in Florida playing at an Irish pub. The job is contract based, and includes a work visa. Perfect. It's ideal for us to get our footing back in the states and figure out what the next step is in regards to legal residency. 

I pushed my boyfriend to contact the hiring manager sooner rather than later because I figured a job like this would be in high demand, and I didn't want the new year to roll around and have him contact the guy only to hear back ""oh sorry we wont be hiring for another 6 months"" or something. I figured we don't know when the contracts start or end or what kind of schedule they're on, let alone the time the visa process takes. I didn't want my boyfriend to wait around in Ireland for months while I had to go back to the states after my visa was up. I thought being proactive about the whole thing would be the best course of action.

Well, the hiring manager got back to him within about 10 minutes of sending the email. They had a position that needed filling ASAP. They want him to be in America November 6. 

My boyfriend, as a working musician, had gigs booked through to the new year, and now will have to cancel them all and find replacements. He has to leave his friends, bail on plans, and pack up his whole life in a only a few weeks. It's what we wanted but I can't help but feel shitty about encouraging him to be proactive and then having this all happen so quickly. And then I feel guilty about feeling guilty, because it's kind of selfish and ungrateful. Beggars can't be choosers. 

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for in terms of feedback...I just feel this sense of discomfort having to leave Ireland on such short notice. I know this is a great opportunity (unless you're a doctor or in tech, you're not getting a US work visa) but I also know he's not going to love bailing on all the plans he made with people. Being flaky is shitty but also life happens... I don't know!! Any advice?",18Oct2017,1

 know?

UPDATE: gave all 3 to her tonight and she absolutely ADORDED them. Turns out the scarfs were on her wish list and I got brownie points for not having any outside help on choosing the gift. She especially liked the yellow because she has been wanting more stuff in specifically the color yellow I got her. She is also leaving for Colombia in 2 weeks and said that while she is down there she will take a picture wearing a set and then send it to me. The rest of her family told me that I nailed it.

261,"Hello, I recently got hired a fashion retail job. It will be my first job, and I am 18 yrs Old. I start on the 21st of October.

My boyfriend lives in a different state, and I want to be able to see him during Christmas time. However, I know that before Christmas, I shouldn’t ask for time off since I am new, and they will need all the help they can get (even though my manager just hired 10 other people). The mall hours will also be extended. 

My plan is to ask to have a week off from December 27th-January 3rd or so. The problem is, I start school back again January 3rd. So really, this is the only time that will work for me. I have to ask for a week because I fly standby, and I have to worry about not getting on a flight in time. Plus, I want to be there with him for 3-4 days. 

My question is, will asking for this be too much? I know for a fact I 1. Will not be asking for ANY time off when I start. 2. Will be willing to work overtime/work other people’s shifts. 3. Will not bring anything but a positive attitude and hard work every day. If I DO ask for vacation time, how soon should I ask?

This is giving me anxiety as I don’t want to be seen as lazy or anything. It is stressful because I want to see my boyfriend, but I also don’t want to make a bad impression on my job. Would it be best to wait until, say, early February? I really would hate to do that but if it means not pissing my manager off, i’d consider it.

267,"I believe someone is trying to scam me and I'm hoping Reddit can provide some insight on whether my concerns are warranted or not and how I should proceed.


TLDR: I got a large (for me) online order from an email that was suspiciously generic and asked if I could ship internationally.  I had a difficult time confirming the order with them and asked where the order was being shipped four times before getting a location.  [This](https://imgur.com/a/qUEmW) is the key email raising red flags for me.  More information below.




Short story long: I've recently started selling artwork and prints through my online store. I have a request on my site to email me for international orders.  I was excited when I received an email asking if I shipped intensionally.  But. I was suspicious of the email address.  It was something along the lines of faith&amp;happiness222 at America dot com (keep in mind this is supposedly an international order).  Their email was signed first name only with what I would call a stereotypically Western name.  I was also put off by some demands in their email (I will do this then you do that then I will do this then you do that)

However, I figured there was no risk in responding so I said yes and linked them to my online store.  I was again excited when they selected a combination of items that would result in my biggest sale yet online or otherwise.  There was some confusion and complication with what exactly their order would be as they selected multiples of paintings I only have one of but after a couple back and forths they ordered the originals and multiple prints.  In each of my responses to them I asked where they were located so I could calculate international shipping for the invoice but got no response until everything else was sorted and my email was literally only asking where are you.  Their response is the one I linked above.

As you can see in that email they have some peculiar and particular requests as to how the order be delivered and an insistence that I get insurance for the order.  I have no frame of reference for the package delivery system in Kazakhstan and no idea whether that's a real issue.

So. I'm trying to figure out if this is indeed a scam or if I'm just paranoid.  And, if it's a gray area, is there a way I can proceed without being at financial risk.  If I send them an invoice and wait for their payment to go through would I be at risk of the payment getting pulled after I've sent the items? Or if they claim they never received the order am I responsible? Can I tell them no refunds?

Please let me know if there's any other information I can provide.  I'd be happy to upload the full email conversation but I'm running a titch late for work and would have to wait until after my shift to do so.

Also if there's a sub that's more suitable for this type of question I would be happy to move this conversation over there.

If you read this whole thing thank you so much.

Some of my friends are telling me that I invited losers although I think they are really cool people.

Things that I was kicked out for have been; occasionally late to class, dress code when seeing clients, participation in class. Two weeks ago they made a remediation plan with me because I needed to work on these things. After two weeks of implementing the plan, they sat me down and decided that even though I have changed and been doing better, that it wasn't better enough. So they decided to kick me out.

I have attempted to speak with all of the faculty to work this out, but they have told me that they are not open to discussing or working with me further.

285,"I work as a dog groomer and in this field, you can work in two sectors: corporate or private. Corporate generally includes the big box stores (PetSmart, Petco, Pet Supplies Plus, etc) and private is everyone else. 

I'm not going to go into which is better in terms of the skills of the groomers and staff. That varies too much. 

Generally, private salons do not include things such as paid vacation days, paid sick days, health benefits, etc.  Corporate salons do. 

I worked at a corporate salon for many years. I was making really good money and I loved the job itself (grooming dogs). The management and staff however made the job, for the most part, miserable. I was constantly on edge because the store manager hated me and was just waiting for me to screw up so she could fire me. As a result I became constantly anxious and sometimes depressed. I put up with it because I loved my return clients as well as the security of the position. 

Well that time finally came and the store manager got me on a technicality. I kept really good records of our hostile relationship so I honestly think that if I fight it, I do have at least a chance at getting my job back. The company has a very strict ""no retaliation"" policy and I've seen managers get into trouble for way less than this. Part of me really wants to do this. I'm in panic mode because I've never been unemployed before. 

I've been on a couple of job interviews and one in particular is very promising and I honestly think I would enjoy working there. It's much more relaxed and I wouldn't be graded weekly on my performance like I did at the corporate place. 

Note: I was not graded on my grooming ability or the happiness of my customers. They tracked my ability to sell upgraded packages to customers, my average ticket amount and the amount of dogs I could groom in a day. 

The new job would pay a bit less, has a longer commute and as stated above, has no benefits. 

I'm not so much worried about health benefits because I'm getting married in a few months. However not having paid sick days or vacation days really REALLY sucks. 

And before anyone says ""just go to another corporate salon,"" trust me if I could, I would. The other major corporate salon within a reasonable driving distance from my home has a really weird method of paying their groomers. Basically, Corporation A (the one I worked at) pays 50% commission on the price of whatever pet you groom. Corporation B work uses an incentive system which means that groomers get paid an hourly wage (usually around $10 an hour) unless you make a certain amount in sales. After you hit that amount, you begin collecting commission. The amount you have to hit though is extremely high and unless you're an exceptionally fast groomer, you're going to have trouble hitting it. I would be taking a major pay cut if I worked there. I'm pretty fast but I'm not going to rush and groom more dogs than I'm physically capable of because that's just not safe for the pets. 

My fiancee doesn't think that I should go back. He saw how depressed the job made me. However I'm trying to think about our future. We want to move out of state in a couple of years and if I worked at the corporate salon, I could pretty easily transfer to a store down there and have a job waiting for me when we go. If not, I'm going to have to start this job hunt all over again.

She is in the final days of terminal cancer, and while it's hard to watch her slip away, it's even harder on her husband, who most days has to be forced to go into work. Recently, he has been making comments about committing suicide by cop or other means after she is passed. I've always been a stout supporter of family taking care of family, but I as at a loss as to what to do, do I contact the police about his increasing comments, do I try and reason with him myself, or stage an intervention?

289,"Hi everyone! To start out, this is an LGBT issue. I am transgender but, I kind of want advice from people outside of the LGBT circles in addition to the advice I get from LGBT people.


So  I came out to my mom about being transgender(male to female) more than a year ago at 27 . She said some aweful things at the time and talked about how I killed her son.

About once a month she sends me a text, sometimes claiming im ruining her life and killed her son, sometimes telling me she loves me but cant see me as female, and sometimes saying give her time.

Im getting a lot of mixed messages and not sure how to approach the situation. 

Id love for her to come around and embrace me as her daughter, but dealing with her in this state hurts. I cry for days everytime she text me

Last time she text was my bday last month. She said wished me happy birthday and but said she will always celebrate who I used to be.

Recently my grandma (her mom passed) and she kept the funeral date hidden from me. She goes nuts if she sees a picture of me (I look 100% woman, ive been very lucky with transition and most people dont even know Im trans at work and such)

Usually she rants about her son being dead when she sees a picture so i can only imagine the hell if I had gone.

For background I came out to her at 14 and she beat me badly, she insulted me whenever she could and made me get conversion counciling. It killed me and I was completely emotionless for years (multiple suicde atempts) she talks about how she was a good mom and doesnt deserve what im doing to her...but other times she shows the smallest hint of trying to come around.

Im just at a loss of how to move foward....do I ignore her until she comes around? Write s letter? Reply to the once a month text? My fiance wants me to cut her out entirely but shes my mom...I love her, if there is any hope of fixing this I have to try....


Also from my end, how to I forgive her for the abuse? It took me 10 years to fix my life after that night.....

If I have to cut ties how to you accept that your mom hates you?

 She hides all of this from us and her family, but not very well, but she even hides her partying lifestyle etc so this was just a surprise to see that it's getting more extreme. 


We care for this girl and she's very young so we're worried where this lifestyle could lead her.

However, i don't feel motivated enough to do any work and the thought of doing hw stresses me out even more when i know i'm unable to do it even with time put into it. The thought of tests don't bother me a bit but everytime, i start working on projects and/or homework, i always seem to get stressed out. Currently, i have one major class which i seriously just can't understand even with help and just feel like failing it because if i resign i have to pay a huge heap of money to not take a failing grade and i don't have the money to. 

Furthermore, I'm currently majoring in comp sci, i have no internships under me but i have studied abroad if that even helps? and i have no idea what to do after i graduate even if i manage to miraculously pull myself out of this rut. i feel like i'm just not a school person as i have never had any study habits. I am however interested in many things such as learning Mandarin/Korean, calligraphy, cooking and etc. I am not completely against doing computer science work, but i feel like it's not what i really want to do and i would rather prefer be kept on my feet doing other things. It makes me wonder if i should've dropped out to go to trade/culinary school instead.

302,"Never had a girlfriend in middle or high school because I was ugly and a loser. Never had a girlfriend in college because I was too shy and also was studying a lot. 

The studying paid off because now I have a good job at a very successful/popular company and make above the national median but that all means nothing because I STILL can't get a girlfriend even with professionally taken photos. 

I get maybe 2 Tinder matches a month if I'm lucky. I get maybe 3-4 matches on CMB *PER YEAR* if I'm lucky. I have a low response rate on OKC (which is where I have the most success) but even then the girls I am interested in rarely ever reply and if they do they ghost me after the first date (and my therapist says my physical standards are not too high at all)

I don't think I'm that horrible looking, I'm in shape, and like I said I have a good job, too. Part of the issue is I live in a conservative area and I'm pretty far left politically. Also not many people really like nerd shit out here (video games, in particular) but that's really the only thing I like. What's frustrating is that whenever I see a woman who does like those things she almost never answers my shit or swipes right on me. 

I deleted all my dating apps and just don't know what to do. I've even tried those horrible professional dating assistant services and it STILL didn't work. 

So by this point I'm still very inexperienced sexually (I've had sex with 4 escorts) so no woman will want to be with me because it'll be awkward and horrible. I just don't know what to do.

310,"For most of my school life, I was putting almost no effort into studying, because I usually understood everything, and somehow passed through all the exams in the elementary school. After I got into high school, things started to get slightly harder. Because I never really studied, I played a lot of PC games or watched anime, and I developed this really bad habit of procrastinating, and I didn't find any sort of system of how to actually study.

The first year of HS was kinda alright, I started to get slightly worse grades, but I didn't really mind(I was always getting 1's in elementary, so getting an occasional 2 wasn't that much of an issue for me now). 

The next two years got worse, and since cheating is kind of easy to do here at my school, I relied heavily on that. I didn't want to study, and didn't know HOW to actually study, I just wanted to pass time with games and crap, so I just took the easy way.

Now I'm somehow in the final year, and I can't keep up in classes. I never studied, and kept cheating, so I don't know a lot of important basic stuff, for example in math. Teachers keep writing stuff on the blackboard, and I just stare blankly, not understanding anything, and just making notes, and the stuff is too hard to do for me even with cheating, since I just don't understand it at all.

Now I realize that I have wasted many, many years doing absolutely nothing for my future, and here I am in the final year of high school, and don't know anything. I realize I absolutely HAVE TO DO SOMETHING about it, but I can't study, and can't stop procrastinating. Heck, instead of doing anything meaningful, I'm writing a post here on reddit, hoping that someone will tell me magic words and wake me up somehow. The stress just keeps piling up. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to change myself. At this rate I might even start thinking about crap like suicide soon.

A month ago i was approached by another big international company that wants me in a role two steps higher than my current one (i already went trough the interviews, have an offer in hand). Recently a senior executive (i will not give any names, but we are all using technologies that he invented) at my current company offered me a position as his assistant for two years as an accelerated training. Both jobs would require relocating.

So, to list the information in a clear structure:

1. first job offer is a logical next step (two steps actually), where i could continue my career, start life in a new country, have nice salary, would think about settling down.

2. the second job offer is not a big step up (would probably be more demanding for a very similar pay), but i would get A LOT of exposure and experience, and after two years, i have a guaranteed position in the company, probably at a similar level as job 1. After the two years, i would probably move to a different site within the same company, so i would postpone settling down for the period.

I couldn't get all the stuff he said or all the things he did to scare me out of my head so when I came back I broke up with him and got all of my stuff out the house. It was so hard but I knew it needed to be done.

We kept in touch after the break up, I knew it was going to be hard for him, and he didn't really have anyone to talk to. It started off alright but he couldn't get it through his head that I wouldn't take him back, that we could only be friends and even *that* would take time. He started texting me all the time and then calling and if I didn't answer or reply he would start telling me I was a whore, and that he'd be pissed if I was hanging out with other guys. Then he'd apologize for accusing me of that, and then he'd get pissed that I still wasn't answering, and then he'd just keep calling. Literally all day and night. I left my phone at home with my brother one day and it was either getting calls or texts every 1-5 minutes for hours so he finally answered it and told him that he was being crazy and was going to ruin our chances of being friends if he couldn't calm down and give me time. When I got home I asked him not to talk to me anymore. The next day I had to keep my phone off all day because he wouldn't stop still. My brother, sister in law, and I finally decided to answer because it was getting rediculous and we told him to stop contacting me. 

He still hadn't stopped days later so I blocked his phone number and on social media. He figured out how to call on a blocked number and kept going. He then figured out my FB password and unblocked himself and messaged me for the 48 hours that I couldn't re block him. Not only that but he messaged all the guys I had been talking to and told them I was a slut, and messaged their girlfriends to invite them to our threesome. After that he messaged my mom and told her that he'd always love me but that I'm not innocent or something. My mom called our Village Public Safety Officer and he contacted me. I told him what had been happening and they had my ex arrested in 45 minutes. He broke our No-Contact order twice and now we have a couple more.

I'm going back to the town this weekend and not a single person- none of the people I grew up with want anything to do with me because I got the cops involved. I never had any malicious intent- he was just out of his mind. Now I don't know what to do.",18Oct2017,1
345,"I knew this guy from primary school (kindergarten for fellow Americans)  i haven’t seen him since then probably about 6/7 years ago now?

346,"This day started bad. I felt like I wasn’t prepared to class. My mom and I were sort of sour to each other in the morning on the drive to the  university because I make it a priority to leave the house by 7:20. The drive is 20-25 minutes. 

Class was even worse. Didn’t understand anything. I skipped the second class because it is very easy. Afterwards, I went and met up with a friend. She invited me to go out to eat with her and well, on the way there, I realized that my wallet was not in my back pocket. Panicked, I start to desperately check my other pockets and tear my backpack apart for any sign of a black trifold wallet. No luck. 

After coming back, I end up re-tracing my steps to check if it was there by some chance. Nothing. No one had turned anything to the library, police department, etc. To make matters worse, my state ID, school ID and $300 of cash were inside. I feel like complete shit. Not only that, but I’m leaving for a trip in less than three weeks and I need that ID to get through the customs patrol unit. 

On top of that, tomorrow I have a test for a class and I don’t have the textbook because they’re all sold out. I’m most likely going to fail. 

This has been one of the worst days I’ve had and I feel like my world is falling apart. I guess I’m just venting. Nothing can fix this. ",18Oct2017,2
347,Alright so I've known my friend for about 4 years now and he's a pretty good friend to me but now we're in the 10th grade and he started doing this thing last year where he just wouldn't put down his phone. He just texts 24/7 and gets in a bunch of drama and says he hates it but he just keeps bringing himself into these things. I have a PE class with him and we go to our weight room every day but he still brings his phone every day even though nobody else does. Anytime I try and talk to him he is just typing away with someone else and doesn't really listen to what I am saying. I just wrote this to ask if anyone knows what I could say or do to see if he won't bring his phone to the weight room or just not get on it. I understand that people do this to get away from stuff but he literally is on his phone 24/7.,18Oct2017,4
349,"Okay, I'm only 14 and I was the youngest sister of two brothers. Now it's only one brother. My one brother whom I was really close to sense we were only a year apart in age. My other brother is 3 years older than me and we aren't as close. But Brandon ( the one that was only a year older than me) was diagnosed with brain cancer when I was 9 or 10. All I know was that I was in 5th grade when the teacher told me i had to leave to take my brother to the hospital. That's when we found out he had a tumor. Then he went through about 2 years of cemo and radiation treatments. Over those years I was with him through every appointment. And watching them put a feeding tube in his nose and his screams.  They told us he was cancer free. But not long after they found out he had 4 more tumors in his brain. He's lost the ability to move his one hand. Then eventually he couldn't walk and had to be pushed in a wheelchair. About three short months later, he died. I was 12, only a month until I was 13. Now I'm turning 15 this month. But not the same sense own birthdays are in the same month. But anyways, Now it's like I can't remember my childhood. Nothing. And if I do, it's a very faint memory. Why is this? I don't understand. I just want to remember the better times. Not those times.

351,"So I'm a sophomore at a good school that's a 20 minute drive from my home. I'm living in an apartment right now that's a 20 minute walk from campus with a good friend of mine, with a few other friends scattered around the campus. I'm also a D1 athlete, so plenty of my time is taken up by training/practice/games/travel.

So rest assured, I have people I know on campus, I keep myself busy, my grades are great, and I let loose and party when I want to.

Thing is, ever since coming to school last year, I've hated living away from home. I'm very close to my family and even though the (intense) homesickness always fades after I come back, there's still something like a void in my gut whenever I'm at school. I feel unhappy, lonely, and just like shit, even when I'm spending time with friends. Hell, I like being with my friends (duh), but this has never really turned into a home for me.

Every day I look at the calendar on my phone and work out how many weeks until I'm with my family again. I try to force myself to stay away if I have a free weekend and am tempted to go back, but whenever our paths cross or I need a car I'll run home for a weekend to just spend time with them. I was super sick last week and needed something to recline in when I slept, so I ended up sleeping at home and driving to school anyway.

So basically, living at home has very few downsides for me. I'm so close that I could stay on the team and go to class easily while saving thousands, not to mention how much happier I would be.

Except for one thing: my parents are divorced and hate each other. So IF I chose to do this, my dad would argue strongly against it. He's of the mind that you need to grow by being independent during college, and that by living with my mother I would do nothing but put myself under her influence and stagnate.

I'm stuck in my lease through the end of this schoolyear, but it's next year and the semester after that are up for grabs. I'm really leaning towards living at home but should I expect anything to improve?",18Oct2017,1

353,"Hi, I am in need of advice for potty training my son who is 3 almost 4. It's not really the using the bathroom part, but more how can I get him to realize his underwear is not his diaper? He has signs showing that he is autistic but because of his age, his Dr doesn't want to label him just yet. He doesn't speak and has a tough time remembering how to do everyday things, but we have witnessed if he does something constantly it will stick eventually. Now he has using the potty down really really good, but my issue is he will only use the potty when he's either naked or just a shirt on and no pants or diaper on. Now my question is, if anyone has had a similar experience how did you, or what did you do to get your child to understand that their underwear isn't a diaper?",18Oct2017,1
354,"I’m 23 and I live in a part of town where I’m surrounded by warehouses and shipping companies in Phoenix, AZ. After HS I got into retail and loved it. When I turned 22 things started to go south and I ended up moving back home to where I am now with no retail environments close except those that are commission based and in my opinion extremely pushy when trying to make a sale. I can’t do that, I’ve hated the idea of it and I care about giving the customer what they want too much. For the past year I’ve tried to work warehouses and such nearby but I’m just not cut out for the solitary and non interactive workplace. I’ve re entry gotten the ability to not have to worry about travel distance with a new vehicle but am
having no luck finding a retail opening. Even with seasonal hiring happening right now. My only income is driving Lyft and I can’t stand it.

356,"Long story short, I had a youthful indiscretion and cheated on my then-fiance, now wife and mother of my two children. She got pregnant, and I was scared at the time. I disappeared. I'm not proud of it, but in my defense, I was only 19 years old at the time. I did not keep in touch but she ended up having a son, who is now in his late 20s. He found me on social media and met me at my workplace. I believe he is who he says he is. He verified his mom's name and physically resembles me. He said he doesn't want a relationship with me but wants financial help. Says he is out of work and struggling. He didn't make any threat of extortion but considering he found me on social media, and also found my kids and wife, I am afraid of what he'll do if I say no. He basically framed it as a moral appeal to me to do the right thing for him. What do you think I should do?",18Oct2017,0
357,honestly I just needed to get this off my chest cuz not gonna lie i feel pretty damn ashamed of it. So I have a crush fetish. The mere thought of a girl stepping on insects just turns me on. Now I know the crush fetish is pretty damn looked down upon this day and age and rightfully so because killing small creatures just to get someone turned on is pretty damn fucked up. But i cant help it love seeing girls step on small insects like roaches etc. I guess I kinda got it from my giantess fetish Now thats pretty much the farthest ill go with the fetish is just insects. anything other than that like cats or bigger things god FUCK NO.Now I just look at videos. Im not gonna ask or buy videos of girls killing bugs. Im not gonna ask a s/o to step on bugs for me etc but at the same time looking at videos of girls crushing and killing bugs makes me feel pretty damn guitly after a fap. Like im cruel for this and karmas gonna get me for it. advice please?,18Oct2017,4

361,"So I've been wanting to move for quite some time now. I've lived in TN for 16 years and have only ever lived in southern United States. I'm 26 years old now and my resume is extensive, I'm only 1 year from completing my bachelors degree in business marketing with a minor in writing and business finance (the classes I have left are all offered online via the college I have been attending in my town).


I've been looking online at websites like Monster and Indeed to try and find a job that might interest me (I'm looking for something at least 20-25k/yr starting) but I just feel so overwhelmed by the whole task. I've tried speaking with my father about this but unfortunately he does not feel able to help advise me in how to go about this process as he ""has been lucky and jobs have always just fallen into his lap.""


My father has mentioned to me that some companies will offer relocation assistance if you are moving to the employment and as my goal is to get out of TN and into a more generally liberal area I think this would be a great thing to look into and without doubt helpful to my goals.


I don't know how to best explain my anxiety about this other than stating that I'm feeling overwhelmed by the process of the search as I am trying to learn how to search for out of state work.


Any advice or assistance or suggestion would be extremely appreciated and much love. I do hope that your day/night goes well and even if you are unable to assist me with my concerns and worries I do thank you for taking the time to read through this. &lt;3",18Oct2017,1
