0,"As stated in the title I'm 20, male and living in a small college town. I've never really had a plan in life and up until recently I've been looking at life through the lens of ""I just need to finish university, everything else is on autopilot"" so I have been getting good grades in all of my classes, but still haven't decided what I'm gunna do with my life.

 I've gotten a point where other than work or study all I do I watch Netflix, smoke weed and game. My social life is non existent and dating life has never existed and I'm just tired of living like this, it's not healthy or normal. I've recently picked a major that I will be starting next semester and plan to stick with it. (Bachelor of computer science) because computers are the really thing I've ever excelled at and I enjoy learning how and why the work. As of tomorrow I plan to stop smoking weed for a few weeks or a few months while I establish good habits in my life, and only use it sparingly with friends in the future instead of a boredom killer. I plan on picking up extra shifts at and getting more involved with studies and possibly start learning to program before I start class. I also plan on living a more active lifestyle from now on. 

My question I guess is: what can I do to get out of this funk I've been in for a few years and get going with a more productive and social lifestyle and stick with it instead of falling back into old habits?",30Oct2017,1
1,"I currently work as IT Support technician for a company that is an outsourced IT Department for many small to medium sized clients/companies. 

I have spare time after work to do extra work on my own, like a freelance IT support for the apartment complex I live in, it is fairly large with a higher priced living area. I came across this idea a couple of months ago and now I'am putting it all together.

I have made a webpage from Googles free webpage builder Google.Sites and also have an online ticketing system I have found from freshdesk.com that I have set up and messed around with. 

Obviously this will never interfere with my current career but something to make a little extra cash at. I have a joy of working on computers and I find this to be a great experience for something to do on my free time. 

Here is my webpage: [Riverstone Tech](https://sites.google.com/view/riverstonetech/home)

It still needs some work and some touching up to do, but I want advice on this. Check out the ticketing system and website to  see if you think it can have potential. I have also made some small flyers from VistaPrint.com to go to door to door through out the complex.

Thanks in Advance!",30Oct2017,1

4,Hey guys! So today I decided that I wanted to gauge my ears. I went out and got 16g to start small. Buuut in my rush I forgot to get tapers. Can I just lube those bad boys up and push them through?

5,"Okay, so on Wednesday last week I tried to turn my mobile phone on, and it didn't work. I know a little bit about tech, enough to figure out that this was not in my control and it was definitely something that should be covered under warranty. 
So I rang up the phone company, they booked a driver to come and get my phone, was supposed to come Thursday but arrived Friday. No biggie.
This is where it gets interesting.
I'm quite proud of how well kept my device is, I keep it in a full leather case (with a flap so it covers the whole thing) as well as a glass screen protector. I got a little paranoid that the repair team might scratch it (I mean seriously, there isn't a single mark on it and it's 1 and a half years old.) so naturally, I took some pictures of my lovely little pristine phone, with the screen protector and case off to show it's full beauty of course. I left all protection off, and gave it to the driver.
Friday I get an email.
Goes along the lines of ""Sorry, this isn't under warranty as has physical damage to the device."" And they attach a picture of my phone with a great nasty crack down the screen. 
I'm furious.
Sunday today so have to wait until tomorrow to call, but what should I say? Do I straight up call them out on their bullshit?
Or do I calmly explain that there is some mistake.
It's even worse now, because my phone was broken in the first place without a cracked screen, and now it has both. I just want my damn phone! If anything, I think I deserve a new handset!
Oh and it's on contract, which I'm still paying.
Any advice in the next 12 hours would be immensely appreciated, thank you.

edit: oh and they said they wanna charge £200 for repairs.",30Oct2017,2
7,"I've been ""talking"" with a girl that's in one of my classes and we went to lunch this past week and idk if I'm thinking too hard about it or not but she offered to buy my food, practically invited me to her dorm, made a couple hints towards me about how she didn't want to tell the people not to put something on her burger (I wasn't sure if she was doing it to see how I'd respond or if I'd actually do it for her. But I did it for her), she handed me a cup while we were waiting to get drink (I would think she did it just to be kind), when we snapchat each other and she don't know what to say back she sends a pic of her(I'd assume she don't know what to say), also she uses exclamation points often when I text her, she's called me her favorite person and sweet when I offered to take her to lunch and pay for her since she basically bought mine (it was a guest meal ticket for the cafe at school), we also watch American horror story but not together. But she was texting me throughout the episode (probably don't mean a thing but idk) that's the majority of things that's happened in the past week and I'm wanting to ask her to lunch one day this week but I would like to know if it sounds like there is something there or not.",30Oct2017,0
8,"I bought some ""highly concentrated"" Starbucks chai tea. The box says it expires next April, but once you've opened it it says not to use it after five days. 
The box contains enough chai to make 12 or so teas. I usually have 1 a day.

It wasn't blatantly clear what it was about but if you just pump it into google it to brings the site up. 
I played it off as having issues with my phone and it wasn't anything to do with me.

13,"So im in my mid twenties and I feel like I somehow missed a vital life lesson.  I only have one friend that I can talk to about most things, hang out etc. Ive  made other friends or acquaintances but it's only talking in class or at work about the class or work, never more.

I also have bad luck romantically as well. I had a 'bf' when I was around 15/16 and he was about 21 but looking back it was silly and in the end he ended up telling me to stop contacting him and let me know that he could buryme, he was in the funeral business. It hurt so bad but I eventually got over him and moved on even when he tried to call me back again. Fast forward I met another guy about 3 years ago but I ended up being a secret again, basically turning into his side chick but hoping it would change. At first I didn't realize, and he still hasn't admitted to having a gf. Anyway he is about 8 years older than me.last night I made the mistake of calling his phone while he was at dinner and I hung up when someone answered , thinking wrong number and then anxiety. He just called to tell me how much he hates my guts and if he was physically near me again he would only want to hurt me. He also said how dumb and stupid I was and that I must be related to a rock how stupid I am. I've left out some of the entire story because this is already long. But how do I be normal? I want a solid group of friends, maybe 3-4 I can just go out with, vent etc. My only friend recently moved to another country and guy wants nothing to do with me.this has happened before with him, even threatening to call police for similar reasons. He has always eventually called me up again after he called down but he says it's final this time and I believe him. I've now had my heart broken multiple times by said guy. How do I get over someone I was never in a relationship with but who was my first as well. I also would like to improve myself and figure what's wrong with me that the only two guys who have ever been interested in me both end up basically hating my guts. Please help me and don't be mean.

14,"I'm a 16 year old junior in high school. I'm planning on taking the SAT two times (to help get my overall best grade) but of course I still want to do my best both times. My SAT date is December 2nd so I have a little over a month. 

Throughout online tests, apps, and practice booklets, I am excelling at reading/writing but for the life of me I just can't get math. I don't understand the questions at all. In high school I nearly failed algebra I (though I got a 96 in geometry). My algebra II class doesn't start until January so I won't have that experience before I take my December test.

16,"I’m 20 and started a new job last Monday, it’s a little bit over an  hour away. It doesn’t pay much (12/hr) and is biweekly pay. 

Not trying to make this sound like a sob story or whatever but I don’t think I make enough to justify the gas cost and tiredness that comes with it. I have to be up at 4am to get there by 6 and work 8-10hrs daily, then drive back (exhausted, it’s very physically demanding), eat and sleep. I have next to no free time. 

Now I have an uncle who’s offered me a job in town where I live but it’s only 10/hr and it’s only like 15 minutes away. The downside to this is he told me there is 0 chance of raise here. 

Is losing 2/hr better than spending that much on gas in the short term? Obviously I don’t plan to be at either of these jobs for a long time and will still be filling applications for higher paying jobs but which is the “better”  choice of the two in the mean time?

not really sure what I want to do with my life either, and having a goal is extremely important to me. I feel like I have to make a big impact with my life and really really help people.

21,"Friday I went to this house party with my roommate and I was prepared to get smashed as hell.  I ended up being extremely drunk and high and running around the house with this random guy that I met who was also drunk. My roommate kept telling me I needed to stop all what I was doing from drinking more alcohol to talking me out of doing lines of coke to the guy taking advantage of me at the side of the house. She was absolutely furious with me. Tearing me away from the guy and yelling at him and yelling at anyone that told her to let me be. I was being an idiot and telling her everything was fine when it wasn’t all fine since I was endangering myself.

I was so messed up in the head that my only priority was to have a good time and enjoy myself. 

My roommate ended up calling my other roommates to come pick us up because she said my behavior was way out of hand and that we needed to leave. I’m starting to feel the guilt and embarrassment come on and I’ve been depressed these couple of days as I’ve reflected on it.

I’ve stayed in my room and haven’t talked to my roommates. I don’t even have an appetite or motivation anymore.

It was just a few minutes ago that one of my roommates called me out on what I did and how I inconvenienced her. She noted that she has a tracker on her car and that I could’ve at least downloaded the Uber app and contributed. But it didn’t even cross my mind nor did it when I was messed up at the party. My parents don’t let me use my debit card for Uber anyway.

All they’re doing is yelling at me. One of them said “I don’t want an apology from you because apologies are empty. You need to prove you’re sorry.”

It’s hard to discuss this because I really wasn’t thinking clearly. I don’t know what to say and feel like I’ve damaged my relationships with people. This sort of thing has never happened to me before- not even close to this level.

My parents don’t know and they can never know for the life of me. 

I literally don’t know what to do. I still reflect on having a good time since my inhibitions were lowered and I experienced some things I enjoyed but at the same time was a complete idiot and annoyed my roommates. 

Acknowledging it just makes me dysfunctional and depressed. I’m a very sensitive person and there are times that I feel like I do extreme things because I’m not happy with my life. I live for short bursts of happiness to feel fulfilled. I keep myself in this bubble so I don’t have any people I trust to talk to. I said some things when I was drunk to this other guy I met that I realized were so depressingly true about myself. Im really not happy with my life and I don’t understand many of the things I do. If I told this to my roommates they would never understand and think I’m making an excuse.

I just want to stay in my room forever. ",30Oct2017,1
22,"and I actually think its killing me.

My parents have hated each other since before they were married. (When I find out why they are still together, I'll let you know...chock this whole thing up to arranged marriages and they fact that they are old)

So I've been stressed over a lot of things, some of which stem from my mother and her combination of anger and hatred towards, well everything. A lot of that has poured onto us, her children. Plus the the stress of daily life, like absolutely hating my job, not having as money as I would like/need, and constant health problems.

This stress has turned into anxiety and panic attacks. Which then messes with my health on a physical and mental level. 

Now, the easier obvious answer to all this is too move out! Well I would like to, but its just not that easy. For starters, I'll be the first to admit, I'm afraid of that. I would be lonelier then I already am. Not to mention, my mother does a lot shit for me cook, clean, etc. Granted that can be done by myself too, but I think we would all love having those things done for us. Also,, I like my siblings. Which leads me to the real meet of why I can't just move out. They need me. I support them. I can't afford two places, let alone all the other things that come with that. Furthermore, I need to save as much money as possible. Barely have enough as is, but I have so many aspirations and what people don't tell you when you chase your dreams, is that it is expensive! One last point to why I can't just move out, is that in my culture it just doesnt work like that. Not only do kids not abandon their parents, but I myself can't abandon them. 

I tried talking to her, today as a matter of fact. She instatnly started yelling at me, like I did something wrong. I was just telling her, that when she does certain things it stresses me out and causes my anxiety to rise. The flipped and stated defending her actions, and was spouting BS about not being able to say anything. I was telling her calmly that, that was not the point nor the issue, but rather just letting her know what I believe is causing my borderline depression. 

I mean I know she won't change, and sometimes I feel like I can't do another second of this and start contemplating life entirely. 

What do I do? ",30Oct2017,1
23,"So I'm a male 23, I had a IEP as a result of a learning disability. 
Technically I had what they call a slp specific learning disability all my life since 2nd grade. 
I never finished high school, I just didn't have enough credits my HS was really bad.
I've never realized how much it affected me as a adult, till recently at a new job with new duties. I mentioned to a friend about my recent struggles to understand and complete certain job task, and she brought up my learning disability ( we went to school together, we had a few IEP classes ) I completely forget all about it, things are just all making sense now, like my math is bad and i mean real bad, my writing is bad I've had issues with remembering basic writing rules, my handwriting is  shit like I'm not playing it's vary vary bad, my ability to multitask or staying focused etc. All these things and many more are just affected and I didn't realize it. 
So i requested all my files from my IEP, records,notes from teacher etc ( the school system here was able to print them out ) 
My only issue is I don't understand these notes, I don't know what a SLP is, I don't know how to proceed with this, like it affects me at work do I need to report this ? I have never been diagnosed with anything at least from what I understand.

(We both needed out of our parents places, so we got an apartment.)  We got a new girl at work (service writer), and her and my roommate are trying to get together.  Now they're both talking about her coming to the apartment.  However, I feel like they're wanting me to be gone when they finally do it, which I understand.  For example, today she asked if I was headed back to the apartment after work because she might come over (she didn't, possibly because I told her I was going back).

My issue with it is that I don't really have anywhere to go out to.  I, like my roommate, am a homebody, so going bar hopping or clubbing by myself isn't really something I could see myself doing.  Additionally, we have separate rooms and a common room, which with previous roommates was never an issue.  I didn't know or work with the girls those roommates were bringing over, but when they came over, I'd give them their space and hang out in my room.

I don't want to be THAT guy, but I also don't want to suddenly start going back to my parents for dinners ""just to catch up"" multiple times a week, especially after working 9 or 10 hours.  I'd rather take a shower and relax.

33," Hi, let me start out by saying I am currently 14 years old just so you know. I am currently on a swim team for my school district and I hate everything about it. I never thought I could hate a sport as much as this. My problem is that my parents give me no choice. I have hated this sport for four years and every time I say I hate it they disregard my feelings and say its good for you and sometimes they'll say ""No, don't say that you love it"". Last time I tried to sit down with them and talk about it alone and try to be calm they turned it into a huge fight and they were yelling at me about how I can't make commitments and how I'm a quitter which I don't believe is true because I am also currently part of my high school's marching band and I love everything about and am sad that the seasons ending.

34,"I accepted a job offer in a new city for when I graduate college in May. Moving to this city would require me to move 1200 miles from the place Ive grown up and all of my friends and family to go to a city where I don't know anyone. At first I was excited about this possibility of a fresh start, but lately I have started to have my doubts.

You see, I have a very hard time making friends, and I am worried that I wont be able to recreate my friend circle in a new place, without the ""friend finder steroid"" that is school, which found my current group. While the city is on paper a better place to live, my city is by no means a dump, and has a better cost of living.

Part of me knows that for me to grow as a person, I need to challenge myself by leaving my comfort zone. Ive never been one to take risks, but this one could result in me finding a group of people I get along with even better, who might make me even more happy. And would grant me the experience of living in a new place, that I may grow to love more than my current city too.

But the other part thinks that is foolish to leave behind all of these people who I have spent years developing relationships with, when I have a really good thing going. Why can't I make friends in my hometown, where it will likely be safer and easier with my current connections?

44,"My best friend got out of the hospital 3 days ago after he attempted suicide. He wasn't allowed to have any social interaction during his time there, so I really wasn't able to talk with him during 2 weeks. He got out last Friday, and I've seen him connected on social media since. I tried sending him messages but he only sees them, and I get no response. I am not sure if something is wrong, we've been best friend 2 years now and this has never happened. What should I do? Should I worry?

45,"Hallo!

I’ve moved from Texas to Iceland, and I am in the process of getting rid of/moving things to Iceland. I have a rather expensively specced 27” iMac I need to move. I’ve read of people selling their computers and buying new ones but this is not an option for me, as Iceland is extremely expensive and a new of the same would cost over double what I paid. 
From what I’ve gathered, it would cost around $650 to get it shipped to me; carrying it in checked luggage is not an option as I’m not sure I will be going back to Texas soon.
Does anyone have recommendations other than these?

Thanks so much! ",30Oct2017,1

47,"So, I had sex with my boyfriend of a year for the very first time. It was my first time having intercourse (don't worry, used protection and all that good stuff), and I feel very conflicted about the whole situation. I’m not an outwardly religious person but Islam is something I carry close to me in my heart and feel very connected to on a personal level. I may not take the hijab or pray five times a day, but it’s something I turn to a lot. Plus, I’m a 1st gen Pakistani, so a lot of the culture is tied up in Islam. If my parents knew I had sex I think they’d be massively disappointed in me, and it would alter their perception of me. I’m not even sure if they could ever look at me in the same way ever again. 

Now, part of me feels fine about it, like I haven’t lost or gained another. I feel closer to my boyfriend, and feel like I’ve been finally getting something I’ve wanted to do for awhile off my chest. However, another part of me feels I’ve done something terrible that I can never fix, and I should have saved it off till I was married. I feel conflicted between my American culture, and my Islamic faith, and I’m not sure which mindset is the most rational and practical. 

Some background knowledge on me. I’m almost twenty-two, an undergraduate student going to law school next fall. I still live with my parents and have been keeping my boyfriend a secret this whole time. I’ve been dating this guy for about a year, and he’s my first everything. He’s very kind to me, and has never pressured me into anything, always has been the most understanding person. I adore him, and he's my best friend on the planet. I never even kissed anyone before him because I wanted to wait for someone I really loved and who loved and respected me, and I’m so glad I did wait for him because he truly is a gift and I’m so fortunate to have him as my partner. He is not a muslim but is in the process of researching the religion. He’s stopped eating pork, fasts with me during ramadan, does wudu, and more. He’s told me he’s willing to convert for me, but I’ve told him to hold off until he’s researched the religion and is sure it’s something that makes sense to him and is something that touches him. I’m 99% sure I’m going to marry him, and we’ve talked about it extensively. The only thing that’s holding us back is that we’re financially unstable, and will be until we both graduate law school or else we’d honestly be married within a few months or so. We’re trying to be fiscally responsible by holding off marriage until we’ve built enough of a foundation to live off of (since we live in NYC and lemme tell you, rent is expensive here). That being said, we have three years until we finish our graduate degrees and that’s honestly a really long time to wait. The part of me that’s okay with sex is telling me Islam was formulated at a time where people married younger, and that’s why pre-marital sex is so taboo, but another part of me is thinking I’m just making excuses and I need to repent ASAP. The only solution I can think of at the moment is to come clean to my parents about him, and have a nikkah (Islamic marriage) with him if he converts any time soon. 

But honestly, I don’t know what to do, or think of the situation. Please tell me what you think, it would be super appreciated.",30Oct2017,2
48,"Ok so basically I’ve been talking to this girl for 8 months or so. We matched on tinder back in March when I was in the states for Easter holidays. We couldn’t meet until I got back to Scotland in April. Now when we first started talking, she’d just broken up with her ex and she wasn’t really looking for a relationship, just companionship really. So over time, as to be expected if you talk to someone every day, we started growing closer and closer . Eventually we met when I got back to Scotland, then we kept talking over summer whilst I went home for holidays, long story short, we’ve gotten to the point of being extremely close, in love with each other, basically doing everything that couples do without the titles.. I obviously just wanna make it official and call her my girlfriend, but she’s extremely hesitant because of the fact she’s had a miscarriage(a year ago last week) and her ex just left her after that. She always tells me that she’s just afraid to lose me and things like that. We even have kinda planned to move in together after I finish uni in June, discussed kids, etc. What can I do to try to put her mind at ease about this? Is it just being there for her and listening and letting the process happen naturally, or? Thank you so much for the help",30Oct2017,1
49,"I am currently working a part-time minimum wage job and also on social security due to Aspergers and crippling social anxiety. I was very lucky to find a job that would put up with my extreme social awkwardness. I’m currently living at home with my parents.

I love animals just as much as he does, but we have had horrible luck with pets. (That’s a whole other post). 

My family doesn’t have a lot of money. I help out as much as I could. The latest cat my dad rescued needed to have a few teeth pulled. Long story short, he got an infection and it’s cost us around $2500 so far. 

I hate living like this. I really want to get a better paying job, but the problem is I can’t make over $1000 a month on social security. If I get rid of social security, I will have a hard time keeping a job due to my social issues. I can’t live off of minimum wage forever.

51,"So, earlier this year, I had to part ways with my old roommate, but I wanted to stay at my current apartment, so I got a couple of people to move in, in place. Both being my coworkers, and one being a somewhat long friend of mine. For my long term friend, it was almost a sympathy invite. Him, being recently out of jail after a suicide attempt/DUI as well as living on his friend's recliner; I thought it would be nice of me to give him a chance at getting his life back together. So, I did. 

He's a good guy, a good listener; would never go out of his way to be a jerk to anyone, but he's just so negative at times. He's a pessimist at heart, constantly getting incredibly drunk in order to hurt himself and spreading his word of a meaningless life. It's to the point where it's a burden to even converse with the guy. It's almost impossible to talk to him when he's drunk. He's drunk every day. 

I really care about him and I wanna see him get out of this rut, but the guy just won't take my advice. The last time I saw him doing better lasted a week. From there, he was back on the drink train, pounding them back harder than ever. 

I feel as if my best move is to just ask him to leave or find myself a new place with new people, but I can't help to be guilted by either of those actions. 

Is there any way I can help him to get his mind out of negativity loop and stop drinking? Or is it hopeless at this point? I'm very concerned and have been getting unclear advice from a lot of people. I've expressed my concern multiple times, but it's almost immediately shrugged off.

Dysplasia is used to describe the abnormality in cells. In terms of the timeline of cancer development (sometimes a long and complicated time line), dysplasia is early and will not always develop into cancer.

HPV is a virus that causes what is called ""insertional mutagenesis"" which basically means that it can cause cervical cancer. Cervical cancer can be caused by several things but HPV infection is a common cause.

Like I said, your cells are displaying a degree of abnormality that merits further review, but that does not necessarily mean you have cancer or HPV.

57,"To get my bachelors degree,  my university forces us to write a thesis. I was thinking if it's worth the extra effort to write it in English instead of Spanish. 


I don't really write much in Spanish (or English for that matter lol) But to be honest, for most of my time English might as well be my first language.  Everything in my everyday life, from gaming to reading I prefer to do it in English.

Writing a thesis in English is not so easy in my country (Mexico). Just wondering if looking for someone able to help me (most professors don't know any other language) and doing the extra paperwork to let my university accept it is worth it.

Do employers care about that? (In other countries ), if I wish to do a master, will it matter?

58,"So I'm in my final year of high school, and I need good marks to get into university. Anyways, my program requires a high average (90-95%) in order to be considered for acceptance. I know that I need hard work and determination in order to get high marks but for some reason, after a few weeks of trying hard, I lose motivation and get bored and distracted. This means that I start procrastinating in taking notes, studying, etc. This has happened quite a bit and frankly, it is taking a toll on my marks. I really hate this inconsistent streak of me burning out while studying. My marks last year aren't the best and so far, I'm very stressed about reaching my desired average for the program.

60,"So I'm 25 and I basically spent years in isolation. I went through college with no friends and can easily say it was the worst four years of my life. After college I got a great job and have been there a couple of years now. I've managed to make one friend at work, who is very antisocial and never likes to hang out. I spent my first year after college working and then working on projects in the evenings. This sent me into serious depression which I'm finally getting out of this year. 

I decided that this year I wanted to enjoy life more. I stopped working on projects and starting going to the gym, attending Meetups, and doing online dating. Through these experiences I'm feeling much more confident in myself. However, I still have no friends and typically spend the weekends with my family. Spending too much time alone makes me depressed since I did it for years. I've tried many things for making friends such as visiting bars but I just don't fit into that scene. I don't know anyone to go to bars with and just feel awkward going alone. 

I've missed out on so many life experiences. For example, I've never been to a party in my life. Every year at Halloween I sit at home by myself. I don't do these things by choice, I just don't know anyone who goes to parties or hosts them. Maybe three or so people tell me Happy Birthday each year. Even on my 21st birthday I hung out with my family, who don't drink. I made it to age 24 without even kissing a girl (finally have been in a couple of relationships this year).

62,"I've never really been talkative especially about feelings or personal issues and this goes for everyone including my immediate family. However when I have been honest with them I'm usually met with disdain which is why I don't tell them what I'm thinking -- overall our relationships are very superficial as odd as that may seem, typically familial relationships are the closest right? Anyways I'll be finishing up my second attempt at university this December and I really want to tell them that I've tried every kind of class and none of it interests me.

I'd also like to explain how I want to take first responder (NPFA) courses and become a firefighter. Knowing them very well I predict they'll feel betrayed and royally pissed to find out I've 'wasted' their money on education I won't be using and also will be asking for money for fire academy.

They also ideally wanted me to be a doctor, surgeon, anaesthesiologist someone that's hauling 6 figures yearly. I don't want that, I've tried telling them I want a modest life but they call me stupid for thinking that way. Mainly because they want me to be able to support a family -- a family I don't want but I'm saving that can of worms for later since that will break them even more.

Apologies for going on and on, so are there any statements or ways of wording things to make them less hostile during the conversation? Any other ideas to make it more digestible for them? Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!

I am a 24 year old female with a degree in the medical profession. I have always been incredibly shy and insecure, and have never had a lot of friends. I fell in love with a boy in high school and dated him for 7 years.

 All of my friends were through him and I liked it that way. I always had somewhere to be and somewhere to go when I wanted to kick back and have fun. And he was always by my side, which put me at ease. 

A few months ago, he proposed, and I totally wigged out. It became clear to me that I had not been paying attention to life at all, who I was becoming, where I was going. I hadn't realized that I had fallen out of love with him, and was carrying on in this sort of bland, symbiotic relationship that was keeping me sane, but brought no real joy to my life. 

I had to end it. I've never been so sure of anything in my life. But ending has brought me into the hardest and loneliest stretch of my life. 

I lost all of my ""friends"", which were never really mine to begin with. I live in a small town where I know everyone, but am close with no one. I don't have school anymore as a way to meet new people, and everyone I work with is middle aged.


I am a young, fit, attractive, hardworking female with a degree that pays a liveable wage. I feel like I could be doing so much. But I spend all of my time in solitude. I stay active and do plenty of fun things, I still have my family and siblings which is great. But I'm watching my 20's fly by, and I want to be laughing and drinking and meeting people, and experiencing life to the fullest.


I want to live somewhere where I can reboot. I want to get a job in a town that has plenty of young ambitious people to interact with. I want to work on developing myself as an individual, something I have neglected.

I came in as a biology major but in high school, I was always interested in programming and wanted to do computer science. But I avoided it because I also wanted to go into premed and people told me they do not go together and that I'd be going through hell with a track like that. So since the middle of junior year, I completely forgot computer science existed and I could say that I lost interest in it as I started to find some interest
(but not as much as I initially had in comp science) in bio.

Except my issue is that I don't think that's my only reason why I want to do computer science. I fear that I just want to do it because my best friend is doing it and I just want to do it with him.
Basically, I don't know if I want to be a comp science major to be with him, or if I genuinely found interest in the field again.

So I met this guy through friends and hey was chill. I guess I put out something to him and well he sent me dick picks and shit. 

Now I blocked him on SC and FB and I would not worry about talking to him again but he is good friends with my friends who I care about.

What should I do? I would never speak to him again but he is good friends with my friends and we are in a lot of situations where we would interact.

85,"To start, this is not spam and I am making this off a new account for privacy. This is also not a cry for help or attention. 
To start... I come from a very wealthy family and most of us are busy a lot. When I was a kid my dad and I were best friends. We did everything together. We hung out every day and he loved taking me and my friends places. My mom did the same and I was nourished my whole childhood by them and many other people. As I grew up a lot of the people started to disappear and I just took it as a part of life. Slowly my parents started working more and I found myself at home, alone, every single day. The friends I had started to disappear. I got into a two year relationship with a girl who I considered to be my whole world. It ended in her choosing my best friend over me. After that I picked up the habit of smoking heavily. After that happened my life went downhill every day. I lost almost everyone I had ever considered a friend. My parents never had time for me anymore. My interaction with them day to day was the money they left on the counter and food they would get delivered to the house. After losing my long time girlfriend, best friend(s), and parents, my grandma died. Shortly after that one of the few people I still had contact with got into a car accident that left them paralyzed from the neck down for the rest of their life and severely brain damaged. I lost all sense of reality and I was constantly thinking about death at this point . My grades all dropped to failing, I quit all the sports I played. All I did anymore was smoke every day. I spent all of my money smoking. All the money I had saved up. I sold cameras my parents bought me, computers, anything I had to just to make sure I could stay high all day. I stopped texting anyone, I stopped using social media, and have basically become a recluse. I used to be a very outgoing person. I loved going to concerts and parties and living it up. Now all I look forward to is the next time I can smoke. I take no interest in meeting new people, or doing almost anything. I hate smoking and I hate what I’ve turned my life into. My parents stay away from home even more now, and when they do come home they hit me or abuse me verbally. Their marriage is falling apart, my dad wants to sell our house and move somewhere without my mom. My mom doesn’t want anything to do with me. They blame everything that’s happening to them on me. I am entirely alone and I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m going crazy in my own mind. I just sit at home all day with nowhere to go and no one to talk to. This is the first time I’ve talked about any of this. Again... this isn’t a cry for help. I just wanted to leave this here and see if anyone might have some insight. I just needed to let it out.

86,"She asked me if I was going to (it is Junior Prom which anyone at my high school can go to). Which I told her I was probably not going to. She replied ""That answers my next question."" and she seemed kind of bummed out. As I left the event we were at, she told me ""If you decide to go, let me know."" I'm pretty flattered that someone even wanted to ask me (I'm a 5'5"" 140 pound dude who wears nothing but rock and metal shirts and a leather jacket when it's colder). 
I'm not sure if I want to go. She is a senior and I am a sophomore.  She is pretty and I'm on the low side of average.
I am hesitant to go (with her) because she is kind of notorious at my school. Last year she cheated on a guy I know and tried saying he was at fault. She has also faked seizures multiple times and she has been known for lying about multiple things.

90,"[Remorse]

**Background:** Grew up in an upper middle class family and had an easy life. Held 1 summer job for one summer during high school and that was it in regards to work. Never really had to work for much growing up, never did chores, blah blah blah you probably get the picture. High school was a good experience for me, I wasn't super popular or anything but had a solid group of friends and had a pretty good social life outside of school. Graduated with a high GPA but never really thought about life after high school. Suddenly I am graduating soon and have no idea what to do but my parents encourage me to apply to an in state college which I do and I end up going there mostly since a lot of my friends are too. I decide to go Greek because lots of new friends, parties, and meeting girls sounds great, right? 

Well idk what happened but I just couldn't get out of my shell since I was so used to high school life and not having to make new friends which I was never any good at, so I ended up going to the dorms in a private room (not your usual college dorm experience), and just continued to hangout with my few friends from high school who weren't busy creating their new college life/social circle. After being sick of feeling like a loser and meeting very few people while everyone around me seemed to have this thriving social life and meeting their new best friends, I transferred schools after a year and changed my major. I didn't really know what I wanted to do so I tried to explore and find what I liked to do, because I never really did much growing up and didn't have any hobbies/passions. That 1st year was pretty good school-wise. The 2nd year was pure shit for my grades. Got into another private dorm situation that year and met literally zero people and the isolation was really getting to me, and my grades suffered.

Re-reading that paragraph it really sounds like I fucked myself with my living situation, but to be honest I have always liked time to myself. My upbringing probably contributed to that a bit and there was none of that in the Greek system for example which was definitely a contributing factor to my leaving it.

**Now:** I've changed my major a few more times but I'm finally taking classes in a field that I can actually see myself working in professionally so that part is good. But it's been more of the same really. Constantly transferring schools half because of trying to find a good program for new majors, half because I would get sick of being alone and spending my days in my shitty apartment, probably another year and a half of near total isolation, now I'm currently at my 5th college if you count community colleges. I'm turning 24 in December and I have zero real friends, at least where I live now. 

Over the years I've grown pretty comfortable with spending so much time alone, but sometimes it really gets to me, like last night. Since Halloween is on a Tuesday this year, Saturday was the big party night and as I'm sitting in my apartment drinking alone (something which I've taken to and do almost every night, mostly out of boredom and I know it's not good), there's a party going on in another apartment in my complex and I see near 30 people walk out, wondering how they all even fit in what I assume was a 2 bedroom apartment, and of course all the hot ass college aged girls in their slutty outfits. That's what did me in I think. Thinking back on how I could've been socializing with girls like that if I just wasn't such a shy asshole and stuck with the Greek system but instead am getting drunk by myself and have no friends.

Anyway, that kept me up last night and got me thinking about how pathetic I am, almost 24 and mommy and daddy are still paying my rent and tuition, and I've almost bled them dry doing it which I feel terrible about, meanwhile I see 18 or 19 year old kids in my classes who weren't as fortunate as I was and have full time jobs while paying their way in school part time or doing both full time, and the most I've ever had in my bank accounts at once is probably $2,500.

So I'm probably a 300 pound neckbeard who only plays video games and jacks off to hentai right? Well, yes and no. I definitely need to spend less time on the computer as most of my days do consist of just entertaining myself via Netflix/YouTube/Reddit/movies, but I consider myself pretty attractive and am in above average shape thanks to the more frequent trips to the gym, but how the fuck am I supposed to create a new social circle out of thin air when I am older than most of the 18-22 year olds around me? I'm trying to be involved in school activities and clubs but for example the one intramural sports team I'm on consists of all freshman except me which makes me feel even more out of place. The thing is, I really want to get good at integrating myself into social circles or creating them because I plan on doing a good bit of international travel after school if at all possible. Mostly I am eager to just have a group of friends I can call myself a part of and finally get started in my professional life and finally be independent.

Its been 4 months since we broke up and this friday we both went to our own partys. I ended up doing coke and i was already drunk, i hit her up n she was still up n off molly so i biked to her house late and cold. We were fucked up just talking, our proximity was way closer than usual. we sit down on a bench, and  start to cuddle a bit, after a bit  we decided i should go, we hug for a bit, and we kinda stared at each other. Then in my head i said fuck it, went for it. We kissed n it wasnt a one n done either then i went home we talked for an hour just about life. Then that sunday we hungout again and watched a movie, and we acted how we did before that night. Which is very understandable. I realize this will be a long situation, and i need to just go with it. She may have had a time of weakness and let old emotions condume her, or she has feelings growing for me. I guess my real question is how do i keep my headstraight and stay sane so I can give this my best shot, because i do love her and want to be with her. My biggest enemy is myself because im so tempted to just go ask her, but thatd only make things worse.

To give insight, me &amp; her met in an LGBT group chat over Kik. We instantly clicked, as we were both home bounded from school due to health circumstances. We talked continuously for hours every night. We would play cards against humanity online, share &amp; make real cringeworthy memes, &amp; chill &amp; talk about some real shit every now &amp; then.

We still talked regularly, despite me going back into school in the middle of the year and her having to take multiple summer school classes in the summer. Ava &amp; I had each other's back, and she felt as the twin sister I never had (i have a twin irl). Our birthdays were literally only 6 days apart.

However, she completely went offline last December. I think she has been grounded and it wouldn't surprise me. I have only gotten one message since she went AFK forever saying ""go away can't let them know I'm on phone.""

98,"I've adopted a young Siamese mix cat about a month ago. I love cats and wanted another one since my parents and I had to surrender our last one a few years back. For months I searched for a cat that would fit into our family and found Olivia at the SPCA. 

My Mom and I went to the SPCA shelter and spent some time with her. She's very sweet and affectionate. When I adopted her I thought I would be very happy, but, it's turning out to be the opposite. Olivia is VERY clingy (which is typical for a Siamese cat), she won't leave me alone, I can't let her sleep with me at night because she keeps waking me up, and, while her voice isn't loud, she's very vocal (again, typical for a Siamese cat).

I have currently put myself in what I consider to be a very bad situation.  I met this girl on Tinder and we went on a date last week. It went really well, and yesterday she invited me to a party. We were making out and had a really fun time and later hung out in my car. Today we watched a show in my room and eventually got more into it.

Here is the bad part. I know I can't date this girl seriously as My family has very strict guidelines as to who to date due to religion, and unfortunately she would never be allowed. I know i have to let her know this information immediately, but I'm not sure what to do. I fucked up big time and my conscious is killing me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

102,"My best friend just took the board exam again for the 2nd time. When he told his family that it was so hard, harder than the 1st one last year, and he thinks he may not make it again, one of his family members told him to just quit it and just look for another job or study another course since it seems like it's not for him. I wasn't able to talk to my friend in those months he was studying because he was so focus about it and he worked his ass off so that he'll pass the exam this time but we're talking about board exam. A lot of people know how hard it is and failing is, unfortunately, part of it.

So yeah, he was so depressed when he told me about it especially because that person told him that it's okay to take his time. That it's okay even if he fails so many times, just keep tyring and trying until it's no longer allowed by the law (limit of the board exam). He just found out recently that that person was telling him one thing (showing support when that person knows he's listening) but telling his other family members another thing (like what a disappointment he is). 

I don't know why there are some family members who act like this. Family should support each other. What happened to my friend somehow made me realized why a lot of students commit suicide nowadays. Why there are people who would rather die instead of seeking help. Why someone would rather ask his friend's or a stranger's opinion (like the people internet) about important things instead of his own family.

106,"I'm a person who really needs/values time off and a 2 day weekend is a critical part of that. While this isn't my first job that infringes on that occasionally (I have had to travel for field work so that = 7 or 14 or more days in a row sometimes, etc) this is the first time I will ever have been required to kiss goodbye to every Saturday for the forseeable future. This also isn't an important job where I am somehow improving the world or the life/lives of others so I find it hard to take any solace in that.

I tend to respond poorly to working ""a lot"" where I waste my evenings because I'm tired and/or stressed and then Sunday will be an utter waste as well. This is what I would like to avoid, since my Saturday isn't a loss since, in theory, nothing that great happens before the evening anyway and I will be home in the late afternoon anyway.

Trying to apply earnestly to other jobs I see is difficult because its hard to find the time to really search effectively, much less rewrite my resume objective and CV per position. Then trying to schedule interviews is incredibly hard due to being needed in the field or otherwise to where they won't let me off on the type of short notice an interview is. I can really only come down with sudden violent illness so often before its suspicious and most companies tend to do more than one interview with very short scheduling notice.

The last time I got drawn into a work situation like this, I only escaped by taking the ""I quit"" plunge abruptly one weekend and thankfully was back working only a few weeks later. This time I'm not an exempt sucker on salary so the OT is going to add up incredibly quickly. While for some people that is a huge motivator, I'm not big on generating extra money at the expense of my time/life.

Anyone have tips to improve my mood/attitude, live effectively and in general be happier to where I can weather the storm? It SHOULD calm down by spring, SHOULD, supposedly. Possibly in February, or March, but there's no promises. 

I could just save every cent, and with the ~20 hours of OT a week it won't be hard, to where I can build up a slush fund in case I have to quit to hit the job trail hard again, but it seems pointless to do that. Wasting a hard few months of work so I can find the next job that might end up being shitty anyway isn't going to get me ahead on luxury items, hobbies or savings.

The root of the complaints is them receiving negative reviews due to errors (surprising!) and that my team is asked to assist with another group who is behind. Us being asked to help support another team isn’t that big of a deal, considering our workload varies quite a bit leaving us time for tasks other than picking and packing orders. We are all technically one department even though we are split up by teams with different coordinators (me) and supervisors. They feel that it’s “not their job” and when we are asked for help repeatedly they say “I’m not doing their job for them any more”.  Now, I’ve tried to convey to them multiple times that they are all compensated very fairly to be at work, and we are all paid to do what is asked of us by our superiors. That’s literally what work is. They are complaining a lot and escalating the situation by going over the heads of their direct supervision to upper management, and management is getting sick of it. I know this because I am in the meetings with them. Nothing reflecting poorly on my leadership capabilities, considering they were like this long before I started. Going back to them being great people, they are! When they are not constantly complaining to me about the smallest things while I am busy, they are great. They’re complaining aside, they are all good human beings and I would hate to see anyone terminated. How can I convey to them that they need to be more constructive or they may be out of a job? Some of them seem not to care, even though I know they need their jobs. It’s hard to watch someone take the rope and hang themselves with it. Does anyone have any similar experience or advice?

So I would ask her if she liked him in that sense, and her response was “no” every time.
So fast forward a couple months, and we finally got to see each other. However, Joe and I got into an argument that lasted a week, and when Ally found out, she blindly sided Joe.

Then I confronted her and asked why she did that, and if she didn’t wanna be loyal to me then tell me now and I’ll stop speaking to you, and that’s when she snapped. Ally threatened to commit suicide, and when I got worried and reported it to the authorities, she covered it up and denied the suicide threat. Then, I asked her how she’s doing, and she said that she can’t tell me because she doesn’t trust me and she can’t call me her friend anymore. So I made up with Joe and everything, and I tried talking to him about this, but we kind of lost that connection because we don’t have Ally on our side anymore. Damn it I need help, Reddit.

115,"My mom and I are having a lot of issues and our relationship is unhealthy. I just want to fix it, by doing the right thing.

Her boyfriend lives overseas. We live in the US. They're in a serious long distance relationship. He suggested that she come and spend Christmas with him and his kids (between ages of 18-22). 

I'm an adult so technically my mom doesn't owe me shit &amp; I need to move out anyway (which I will, next year im off to school), but Christmas I thought was supposed to be about family. 

Can't help but think it's my fault and because of our unhealthy relationship she doesn't want to be around me or my siblings. More so me. It's a long story but basically her boyfriend thinks she didn't raise us right. I'm in a bad place right now but my siblings aren't. My mom still thinks that she should've raised all of us differently despite my siblings not being fuck ups like myself. She was raised by a strict mother and her boyfriend thinks that we don't do enough for her. I'm not saying it's my fault for a fact but my siblings feel the same way (that she is sort of running away from us). One of my siblings actually suggested this before I realized that I felt the same but on a more personal level. 

My mom missed thanksgiving last year to spend it with him. So it was just me and my siblings for thanksgiving. It was kind of shitty tbh. Now she's missing Christmas. She told me to think about it and tell her what I honestly think but I don't want to be honest because I'd just say something selfish like don't go, but I want her to be happy. It just makes me sad that she wants to go. And I'm pissed off that her boyfriend suggested for her to miss Christmas with us. I doubt he'd miss Christmas with his kids but I don't know for sure. 

We aren't little kids anymore, we're adults but it just feels wrong you know? Am I wrong for feeling this way? Felt really really shitty after she told me and hours after we spoke she even mentioned that I was mentally gone hours and asked me if I was alright. I wasn't but I didn't mention it. Or maybe I'm just a selfish asshole?

**TL;DR** Mom wants to spend Christmas with her boyfriend and his adult kids. Me and my siblings are also her adult kids but I still feel shitty about it.

I do have a car and drive but hate driving in the city so the bus would be my only option. I’m really indecisive about this whole “distance” thing and how it’ll play out.

121,"hey I have a roommate who is having what I believe are some troubles with social anxiety. he is a very nice polite and talkative person but sometimes he seems to struggle to get words out. (this is more so than the average person I know w/social anxiety - he will be in the middle of a convo and then suddenly pause for like a full minute or more trying to find the right word. but then if you figure out what he's thinking and suggest it he will continue on.) sometimes he will go to social events and kind of stand on the sideline or even outside of the event, sort of an extreme version of a wallflower, and will generally be extremely unresponsive at this time. i.e. you can ask him direct questions and he will not respond, while looking you in the eye, sometimes nodding or shaking his head, which seems to be easier for him. oftentimes, he will stand outside for hours, just kind of in this frozen state.

today, he, i, and a friend went to visit someone else. when we were there he seemed to be struggling, he would talk but then seem unable to finish pretty often. the person we were visiting was not the absolute best about this and was much more visibly bored during these pauses than I considered to be polite, which may have made it worse. afterwards, he left with us, but kind of just stood outside the door, in this state. we asked him if he was coming, tried to get him to come with us back home, but he just stood there, so we ended up leaving him (we had stuff to do, we have had to do this before and he always ends up alright). we didn't see him for a few hours after that and then he came back home at around midnight, with a policeman who explained that he had given him a ride home after finding him about a mile away at the top of some stairs, in a non-responsive state.

I'm worried about him and what I should do. I talked to him some tonight and tried to make it clear that I cared about him and he could contact me if he needed a ride, I wouldn't judge or anything, etc. but he was mostly unresponsive. the weather is getting colder here and I don't want him to freeze one of these days. I also don't really know what I can do to help him, what the best ways to react to his states are, how to help when he's ""pausing,"" anything like that. I'm trying my best but I could be messing it up.

123,"What’s going on everyone, I’m currently residing in Los Angeles, CA and was wondering if anyone has ever done anything like this before. 

I don’t have a permanent residency here, I’ve been staying with my girlfriends grandmother helping her since I first relocated here almost 2 years ago. I had my DL’s changed from my Georgia DL’s, got myself a mailbox where I could receive mail so that I wouldn’t flood the mailbox here where I’ve been staying. I even went so far as getting healthcare, here in California. I don’t want to ramble on, but I basically have everything but a place in my name and my own car. 

I initially came here because of my girlfriend, and after a lot of back and forth.. I just ended up giving up my condo in Atlanta and came here. For a while we discussed moving back to Atlanta after a couple of months, maybe a year or so. Here we are 2 years in, and the decision has been made for us to move back. 

I would be going ahead of her since she is currently a full-time student, and would have to wait for the semester to be over in order to transfer... if she doesn’t decide to finish out the next two semesters here in California, and then transferring to a University in Georgia. 

Since I work over the road, and make my own schedule I can go and come as I please.. which means I’ll be back and forth from California to Georgia quite often. 

Now my question is this, is it possible to obtain an apartment out of state.. being that I have already lived there before, even though I have a California DL’s and will be back and forth from Georgia to California days maybe weeks at a time.",30Oct2017,1
127,"I've made some researches and no one seems to have experienced what I did, but maybe one of you did? Or can help me understand?


I've had my first real heartbreak a couple of years ago, it almost killed me. I thought he was my soulmate, but turns out we were too crazy together. The weird feelings I'm talking about are the following:


I was feeling like he was right next to me. I wasn't seeing him, I was feeling his soul. If I looked at my right, I could have swore that he was at my left. And when I turned my head, there was no one. And sometimes when I was having sex with someone else, I was seeing him litterally and it was freaking me out so I had to push them away and say that I wasn't feeling well.


The other feeling is a weird pain. I know that everyone feel physical pain during a heartache, but it's always in the chest, right? I was feeling that, but also something else. It's like someone was cutting my belly with a knife and tearing it open. I was screaming of pain because it felt so real. Or sometimes it was like I was being stabbed several times in the chest and belly.


I'm sorry if that's weird, but I had to ask.",30Oct2017,1
128,"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting here and actually talking about this stuff with strangers online so please bear with me.

About six/seven months ago I feel like I've hit a roadblock in life. I want to say it was due to the fact that the promotion I was lined up for at work was given to someone else over a particular circumstance. From there on it feels like things have slowly started spiralling down. The only high I've had was travelling overseas for the first time in my life in July but once I got back things started to head down again. 

I work for a video game retailer and video games are what I love but as of late I don't believe I'm truly enjoying them. That may be because it's the only thing I do outside of work. Occasionally I'll travel about an hour and half to meet up with friends to play D&amp;D for a night but the travel really takes any energy or motivation I developed from the aftermath of a game out of me. I have also started to notice that I have been eating a lot more junk food than normal and I don't seem to be doing anything about it. 

What I'm trying to say is that I believe I have no desire in life, no passion to work towards. I know for a fact that I love entertaining people. Whenever I'm with friends I try my best to make them smile or laugh or feel something. I studied acting for two and half years and while the skills I learnt from my course made me who I am today I have no need to continue pursuing it. I would like to travel more and I would like to meet new people as I feel some of my close friends aren't all that close anymore. I would also like to study more but I have no idea what TO study. I don't want to fall into the trap of a student loan that I know I will probably never be able to pay off. I live with my mother and I can't afford to move out due to being on a casual wage. 

So my question to you guys is what do I do? How do I find something to be passionate about? How do I find a source of ever lasting motivation? I know there are off days and maybe what I'm saying sounds ridiculous but I just feel so lost. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that part of me may be holding back on doing anything because I'm afraid of the risk of disappointment or failure.",30Oct2017,1

135,"   I picked up and moved from IL to AZ for my freshman year of college. I am terribly home sick and I don't feel the sense of belonging that all my other friends feel at their schools. I have known that I wasn't happy here for a little while, but what started my deep need to transfer was a falling out with someone who I considered my best friend. 
  This girl and I got into a huge fight and we no longer are friends like we once were. I'm not completely alone. I have other close friends out here, but this falling out has made me realize that I was forcing myself to like it because I didn't think leaving my best friend here was an option. There were signs that I wasn't happy here even before this. I am unable to sleep through the night, I have nightmares almost every night, I have intense anxiety (associated with things other than schoolwork), and waves of depression. These are all things that happened to me when I was younger (about 9-11), but I had worked very hard and progressed to a point where I wasn't like this. Being at this school has made all of this come back.  
  The people and vibe here are so different and I just don't fit in very well. I feel like this experience has made me grow a lot, but I'm also becoming a person I don't want to become. I didn't know who I was or what I wanted my senior year of high school, but now I know myself more and I can't see myself spending my next 4 years here.
  I have a history of making impulsive decisions out of temporary sadness so I'm scared that this is one of those things. I want to switch second semester, but my mom thinks I should wait out the rest of the year and see where I'm at. I just want to get out of this situation because I want to be able to get back to a place where I'm happy. I'm also scared I will end up not liking my new school, but I think knowing people who go to this other college and being able to go home will help with adjusting. Advice? Thoughts?

136,"So a few months ago my brother got out a book from the school library. Fast forward and it has been a month and he still has not returned it (he forgot he had it) so our parents got an email saying to give it back or pay for a new book, so my brother returned it (I was with him and saw him return it). Now come to last week and we get a bill from the school saying we owe $50 for a replacement book.

* I saw my brother return it.

* $50 seems a lot for a book.

* Our parents don't believe us that it's returned.

* Our parents will make my brother pay for as that's a good lesson to learn, but he has no money at all. (If it comes down to it I'll pay for him &amp; he can pay me back)

Anyway, my brother goes to the library to say that's it's already been returned but the library teacher doesn't believe him. So My brother goes off to find me so I can tell her that I saw him returning it as I was with him. She still thinks we are both lying so we end up pretty annoyed because well my brother is innocent and anyway he can't afford to pay bill (and I'd prefer not to lose $50!). This is were it all goes wrong... 
So we get into a heated argument with the library teacher. (Yeah, I know, we should have stayed calm but it just happened) Anyway, we get kicked out of the library; but then I had an idea of finding the book on the shelf to prove it is where it belongs. So we go back in, but as soon as we are seen in the library we got re-kicked out and banned from the library for the rest of the school term.

* I think the school makes a profit off the bill as they didn't seem interested in finding the book by just simply looking in the shelf, so now we have nearly no way to prove it's in the library.

* We both need to use the computers/books in the library to complete school work but we no longer have no access for the next 8 weeks.

Neither are spayed/neutered whatsoever so of course the pets keep on breeding/inter breeding with each other. I feel absolutely terrible for the cats as they're being neglected 100%. The only thing that's done for them is food and water. The house smells like urine every time I visited them.

This just kinda shows how little or none of human interactions that they had. My friend is a dog person so the cats are just . .there.

138,"First a little background:
I have always loved film and acting. I loved making films as a kid, writing them, performing in them, editing them. I never did theater or anything because I was too shy. I only goofed around with my friends and cameras. When I got to high school I for some reason stopped. I didn’t film anything. Didn’t act in anything. Senior year rolls around and my high school introduces a film production class. I joined in an instant. The class brought back so many amazing memories. I made videos for the class. When acting in them and editing them my happiness was at an all time high. It reminded me of how much I love doing this stuff. As I go into college I still have no idea what I want to major in. When people ask “so what do you want to do” I immediately think of the film industry. I would love to work in the film industry. When I watch Netflix or a movie I imagine all the work people do and how awesome it must be (and how hard). And I always thought it would be cool to be an actor. 

I realize that the acting industry is pretty unforgiving but if it’s what I want I might as well give it a try right?  I have never acted in an actual serious production. I took a theater class freshman year of college. Now I’m a sophomore, still no idea what I want to major in (my school offers no film stuff/theater stuff). I always thought about chasing my dream of acting. In my head I think, okay, First I’ll take some classes to introduce me, blah blah, see if I like it then I’d try to do this then that and It’ll equal X and Y. I still haven’t done a thing about it. 

As a sophomore in college I feel like I need to do something to start this path. Instead all I do is think about it rather than doing it. I’m afraid I’ll think about this dream and never do anything about it, just keep living my life thinking I’ll someday be an actor and before I know it I’m 50 years old. And this applies to other stuff too not just my acting dream. I show so much optimism and excitement for these ideas of mine but I never do anything to achieve them. It scares me. Like I can’t even sign up for an acting class. Pathetic.

I was initially thinking that the it guy might have installed it on his own, but then i checked laptops of my friends and colleagues and the key loggers are installed on them too.

They already have net nanny softwares installed to block and monitor net usage.

151,"I'll do my best to stay on point here as I tend to ramble.

Short and not-so-sweet. I really don't care to talk to or contact my family.

I'm a 35 year old male. The only close family I have left is my mom and sister. My sister has her kids and husband. Beyond that there is no one I'd ever really consider visiting. Right now it's coming up on 8 months since I last had contact with anyone. This weekend my sister tried calling me, she even went as far as finding me on LinkedIn and sending me a message on there.

I don't feel close to them at all. Not sure if I ever have honestly. I know we would hug whenever we did meet, but for me it always felt forced or because it was the expected thing to do. My family wasn't bad at all. No abuse. No drinking. My only real complaint is I was a lonely child. My sister was ten years older than me, and anywhere we lived I was the only kid. I was picked on a lot in school, so for a few years there I was very much alone. Alone at school, alone when I went home. I'd go ride my bike for hours after school. Family dinner was pretty rare. We took a few big vacations, but those hardly fill the gaps needed for healthy family bonding.

My dad died when I was 17. My sister was living with her husband and first child. So it was basically just me and my mom. She shut down almost completely. I don't remember my last school year at all. We had moved my senior year so I was without my friends as well. It was not a healthy way to transition into adulthood. So again, basically alone. It took her about a year to get through her initial funk and thought about dating again. After HS I had thrown myself into work and had two or three jobs at a time. Not for money, but just to keep busy. I would say I was almost in a daze still for a very long while. During this time I had reconnected with my old friends and then promptly dropped them as soon as I realized I was basically only invited around because I knew a lot of girls who liked to hang out. So again, alone.

I don't remember precisely when, but very quickly my mom told me she was going to move a couple hours away and that it was time for me to get out. In a normal situation this would be normal. But I still felt like I was stuck and didn't know what was going on. But...I moved out. Another two years of working and living by myself flew by. Phone calls to her were rare. Every couple months maybe. I had no relationships really. That was my fault. I didn't know how to be serious back then. One day somehow I ended up in a recruiters office and enlisted. Did 9 years. During that time phone calls were still only every couple months. I think I visited them during the holidays once. 

My life has gone vastly different compared to my sister and mom. They both met their husbands in their teens. They moved out of one family life into another.  Not a day of solitude in between. That's all my life has been, solitude. I do want to meet a nice lady one day. One who does not want kids. But until then, I'll be by myself. And honestly it's the only way I'm happy. 

I never understood how people could want to be around their family constantly. Or miss them so much. I've come to the conclusion that even though we are blood related, maybe we really aren't meant to be family after all.  We get along fine when around each other. But I'm always relieved to be gone once I leave. Like a big chore that's finally done for a while. 

I don't need to be told it's okay or maybe I should just suck it up. I'd like to hear more about ways I can bring this up to them. I've tried before when I was younger, but I didn't have a good handle on my thoughts then. Their response was maybe I just need therapy. That's not going to happen. I know there is no happy ending in this scenario. My end goal is for no contact. I want to be the estranged brother. I just have no idea how to bring this up. I'll probably end up talking to my sister first. She's more understanding. My mom is the one that would tell me to suck it up and that I'm a selfish prick. She has a hallmark idea in her head of what a family should be. We've never been that. At all, not even close. So I wonder if its shame or something that makes her angry that she can't make it work that way with me. 

So ya. Wall of text. It's almost 5 am and I haven't slept yet. So this are some early morning ramblings.

So. Happy to hear any thoughts. Comments. I assume some bashing will take place.

152,"Recently I was walking along a reasonably busy street at about 5 o clock  , and two lads one around the same age as me(16) and one a few years younger , walked down a street ahead of me , they looked at me had a quick chat and then slowed down till I caught up one crossed between the cars and waited on the other side of the road the other waited on my side slowly walking , I stopped refusing to cross waiting for the small lad to cross , he said something incomprehensible when I crossed they walked with me , the tall lad asked could he make a phone call on my phone , I obviously said no , it's out of battery , cause I have a tiny bit of commonsense , so he proceeded to tell me to give him my phone , I said no , he said he was going to beat me up and take it from me , for some reason i said don't do that and he asked why and I told him that wouldn't be nice , I luckily caught up to two friends I'd just been with who were 20m ahead of me , for some reason the two thugs let me catch up , so I joined my two friends and then the two assholes continued to try and get all of our phones until my lift arrived and they departed , i don't know what I should have done if the two people ahead weren't there my lift wasn't arriving , any suggestions , they didn't like stop me  or threaten with a knife or anything  , they didn't seem very good at it , the small lad just kept telling the tall lad to beat me up , or kill em , or throw a right hook , idk any suggestions , I live in a nice smallish town so not used to this , but much better outcome than other peoples stories , thanks , long story , I know , excuse anything only setup reddit for this , so first post , and yeah just looking for any suggestions on what to do if this happened again , Thanks

The past week i've had some sort of awakening that i need to be doing something extremely different but i just dont know what and its killing me inside with anxiety about what the future holds for me. I need a job for the money but i feel like such a failure looking at jobs, the ones i'm looking at are just boring jobs i know i'm going to hate and its making me so depressed thinking about it but i just have no choice. Its sad this is what society is majority of the population are doing jobs they hate and thats how there spending there lives.

160,"There's this one dude at my school who everybody hates. Every day he goes down the hallway singing. Not good singing either, like the worst voice you could imagine. My dad used to talk to his mom, and his mom knows she failed as a parent with him, so she doesn't care to tell any of his secrets. She said he has no mental issues whatsoever, he's just an attention whore. Everyone has told him to stop but he won't. The other kids, the teacher, and the principal. My school's principal is one of the most chill people I've ever met, and this was the only time I've ever heard him yell. I'm surprised no one has whooped him yet. Any ideas for what to do.

161,"Hey so 2 nights ago I was back at a mates house after a night out partying. Everyone had gone to sleep apart from me and another friend, she was really drunk but not like I've seen her before it was different like something was really off. She was acting really strangely and then she said something along the lines of 'hey wouldn't it be funny if one of your friends drank these bottles of wine and topped/killed themselves'. I asked her what she meant and then she went out into the garden and started sobbing for 5 minutes I went out again and asked her if everything was OK and she just completely blanked me as if I wasn't even there so I went back in. A few minutes later she came in and then downed 3 bottles of wine in like 2 minutes it was almost like she was force feeding herself it I've never seen anything like it then she went and finished a few bottles of spirits off what were pretty much empty couldn't find anything else sat down and started crying then passed out. I think if there was a whole bottle of spirits there she would of drank it all aswell. The next day when i left she woke up and basically said she couldn't remember anything from the night before she must of been really drunk I don't know whether this is true or not. I had been out raving so I was pretty fucked up myself and half asleep when it happeed, It wasn't till I got home I was able to think back and piece it all together that this may of been a suicide attempt. She's had depression before but I didn't know if it was this bad. I really don't know how to deal with this and who to tell so could do with some guidance, thanks. ",30Oct2017,8

I swear it wasn't related to the fact that she was a girl, I didn't even see her face. If it was a man a I would have done the same thing. Now she looked at me (I admit she s beautiful like a model or something) and giggled and said ""Are you sure? thank you"". I knew at the moment I had made a mistake. The cashier looked at me as if I am doing this to impress her. She thought I am gullible or something. I paid and I was expecting for her to offer to pay me back with a bank transfer. I wouldn't have accepted her pay and would have told her to do the same with someone else.She just went away with no consideration to what I've done whatsoever. Now, I feel even more embarrassed and stupid being in this situation. It didn't feel right to follow her and ask her to pay me back (and I don t want her to pay me back), but I was in this situation where everyone is looking at me as if I am stupid person who fell for her.

168,"Hello, I need a bit of help.

Quick background: I got depressed and very very out of shape after first year of college (7 years ago), spent 3 years in a misarable state before, 4 years ago, turning my life for the better. Shred 100 lbs, got an interesting job, got my degree, got into paragliding, got a new amazing girlfriend, rented a house, got married, had a wonderful daughter.

Now I feel things are getting bad again and I am very, very afraid of getting stuck in an unable-to-react-before-shit-comes-again state.

I dumbly changed job to purse a much better paid one that is fucking miserable, basically no human interaction, (but I need it for the high-pay) moved away from the city for this job and feeling alone. My wife has no hobbies that means that having no time for myself is becoming equal to ""abandoning her alone"", so no more flying nor gym. I`m seeing my friend less and less because of distance, I am getting out of shape again and feel again I have no energy to purse dreams. 

I really loved how I managed to pull myself out of the shit last time, I would like to react now to this downward spiral but I feel I need to hit the bottom this time too to be able to react.

169,"Like when he doesn’t like how something is, instead of confronting the issue or dealing with it he’d rather just do something else so they “get the message”. And really has problems speaking up about stuff. Like if another friend asks him for a favour or if he could do this, he might just not respond and make it weird or come up with an excuse rather than just saying no, even though no one cares/minds if it’s a no. He also thinks every little thing is drama or would be dramatic. Like if someone tells him something and we ask him where he’s going or why he’s doing this thing he’s doing. He’d act as if someone just told him something very important or gossipy as if he can’t say, even if it’s something we all know, but he doesn’t know we know. It’s like, dude.... 


And yeah, he gets mad at a lot of the little things, and acts like he doesn’t notice,and then will give you the passive aggressive treatment, or even the silent treatment if he doesn’t know what to say. I mean, he’s 19 soon and the oldest of all of us friends. But yet he’s he most introverted, shy, passive, passive aggressive person I know and it’s very annoying. He’s the youngest of 4 siblings so I get it but not to this extent. 

For example, he’s very attached and kind of a suck up to his cousin that we all know, she hangs with us a lot too. She hangs out with a lot of people and is a really outgoing person. But our friend here who’s related will always act like he’s above everyone when he’s with her like it’s a big deal being with her and he really likes being her number 1 I guess. Anyways, one of our other friends who’s a lot more outgoing has recently started getting into a friends with benefits relationship with her and fucks her on a regular basis. 

Now our passive aggressive friend really doesn’t like this. He obviously won’t be the one to burst the elephant in the room or say anything, And when asked by our friend who’s seeing her if he’s good with this, he says it’s fine, but then he be’s a bitch about it and steals his box of condoms and hides them. Caused 2 weeks of not seeing each-other or the cousin between him. But of course he saw it as the biggest deal when everyone else couldn’t give less a shit. So yeah, how do we deal with our friend here, feel like we’ve been putting up for him for too long.

Reddit,
My step sister was given a dog that is about 5 months old about 4 months ago. It was playing outside yesterday and within an hour, it's back legs stopped working. My step sister could not afford an emergency vet, so I took care of the bill to make sure it got help and was told she would need surgery on her spine and an MRI as soon as possible. I was told this is going to cost about 2K to figure out the problem.
I am a huge animal lover and I also feel for my sister deeply. She can not afford this treatment and neither can I. As far as we know, the dog has all of her shots, so the dr did not know the cause.
But...what the fuck do we do now? She's super attached to her, but obviously willing to give her up to get the helps she needs for her health.
Do you know of any places that would take her in? Who should we call?
Thanks for the help.",30Oct2017,1
173,"Hi, I'm going to be taking a 2 month trip across the United States on foot and by bus. (New York to California) I prefer not to stay in motels, but if I'm desperate I will. The trip is mainly for me to enjoy the outdoors and go ""off the grid"" but I'll have to take a few buses because of time issues.

The main goal for me is not to become a victim of a crime. Robbery, Rape, Assault, Etc. I'm a girl travelling alone so I'm not sure how safe it'll be. I'll be travelling light. Pepper Spray, Clothes, Toothbrush, Water Bottle, Phone, Laptop, and Contacts, and will add more when I think of them. I'll be travelling with a minimal amount of cash.

Some of these are replacable but others are not. I'm also doing this until January so it'll be winter for some time in which I would have to find somewhere warm to go. But anyways, how do I prevent myself from becoming a victim of a crime when travelling all that distance alone?",30Oct2017,3
174,"My SO has a smallish group of friends who have for the most part socially rejected me. We've been living together in his hometown for 2 1/2 years. That's how long this has been going on. 

When I see them in public, most of them do not acknowledge me even when I wave and say hi. They’ve explicitly asked that my SO not bring me along for get-togethers, game nights, parties, etc. I was given a laundry list of reasons, like their dog doesn’t like strangers, the roommate of the guy who hosts their get-togethers doesn’t like having people he doesn’t know in his house, they’ve already got a large group, etc etc. But then a trusted source, later on, told me two things:

A truth: The real reason they stopped inviting me was because they are friends with my SO’s ex, and my SO’s ex was refusing to come hang out anytime I was around (note: this girl was already dating other people...). Her SO has been invited to join their clique despite no one liking him. Soooo... You’re okay with your ex being around while you bring your SO around, but their SO isn’t allowed? Sounds like some issue with her ego. I’ve been told she can be grudgey. 

A lie they told my source: They said that they invited me to participate in their game nights but I didn’t put in any effort. They *never* invited me to join them, I *never* joined them for a game night, so how could I put in any effort?

I was invited to their Halloween party. It’s smallish, so it’s not like I’ll be lost in numbers. I really don’t feel comfortable going. I’m already a socially anxious individual, so I especially don’t want to be where I know I’m not welcomed. I wasn’t even formally invited. It was a ""Oh I guess you can bring her along too if you want,"" kind of thing.

I'd really like to spend Halloween with my SO, I really don't feel comfortable being around people who have rejected me for no valid reason. My trust source (another friend) has invited me to hang out with them if I decide I don't want to go. What would *you* do?

Before it's asked: 

""Why doesn't your SO say something or turn down the invitation?""
Because I don't think even he knows the real reasons why. He can be a bit oblivious. He really likes to play tabletop games, and these are the only people he can regularly play with.

""Have you talked to him about it?""
I will when I make a decision. I also promised my source that I wouldn't tell anyone in our circle of friends that I know.

""Your SO's friends rejecting you isn't a good sign.""
Well, they aren't his only group of friends. This is a group of 8ish people, and from what I've been told: two of them do like me, four are indifferent (but will side with anyone who dislikes me for the sake of loyalty), two I know do not like me.

**TL;DR:** My SO's group of friends indirectly invited me to a party despite socially rejecting me for the past couple of years (because they're friends with my SO's ex). I'd like to spend Halloween with my SO, but I also don't like to be where I'm not liked. Would you go if you were in my situation? ",30Oct2017,1

Imagine... an Ignatious J Reilly or a John B Macklemore type person.

My parents basically ignore the problem, and have completely stopped asking him about his plans to find work and move out.

My partner [M/25] and I have been together a little over a year, I love him more than anyone else I've ever been with and he always expresses the same. We have a great relationship and have grown a lot together as people. Over the past year he has really opened me up sexually and has helped me push personal boundaries too. 

However, over the last month or so my partner has pushed for a threesome. We're long distance and haven't met yet nor had sex yet he is already suggesting this. I'm very insecure about other women getting involved in our relationship because I feel I won't be enough in the long run for my partner or I will get jealous. I've said this and we have talked about it but he gets fed up trying to defend himself and our relationship and I just cry. I'm not interested in anyone else other than him and do not want a threesome with another man but he wants one with another woman. 

I said that I would try and see because I believe our relationship is strong enough for this and I believe he wouldn't do anything to ruin our relationship. So we agreed to my friend and I doing things together on camera for him. I went to my friends house to kiss her and show my partner but I had to leave after 2 hours of which nothing happened despite my attempts. My friend was very nervous and didn't make any advancements towards me. I said this to him and he just got angry at me.

184,"I am in a huge nostalgic rut right now even though logically i know everything in my life is going great. I can't wait for it to be over as I feel like im missing out on actually enjoying what I have and I would love some advice on getting through it.


I lived in the same general area from first grade through college, but after I graduated I had a major breakup, I had no money and nowhere to stay. I moved to the opposite side of the country so I could live with some relatives to get back on my feet and start my adult life. That was 7 months ago and now I have the best paying and easiest job ive ever had, Ive made some new friends, I have an apartment, a new boyfriend and new cat. I go out to events and explore my new city, everything I needed to build my new life I did rather fast and im thankful I was able to get back on my feet so easily. 


But now that I have all that together I am feeling a bit depressed and alone in the background of everything im doing. I really still dont feel like this is my 'home', and I compare everything here to where I came from. Walks around the neighborhood here are nice, but the ones I took there seemed better. The food here is great, but my favorite resturants back home were the best.  My apartment is good and cheap but my last one had a special feeling. I like getting to know new people but I miss my friends from college and compare the new friends to them, and they always come up short. I could go on forever! All this comparison is sucking the happiness out of my life, I feel like its a downgrade from my past.


 I also understand that I am romanticising the past, if it was really so great I wouldn't have left. My last boyfriend was uncaring and a bit abusive, I dreaded going to work and I could barely afford gas and food. I was originally so excited to start over but now that I am settled here im depressed. The worst thing is how guilty I feel that when im going on dates with my new boyfriend, im not present with him. He is always taking me out to show me around the city but Im stuck in the past and silently comparing him to happy memories with my last boyfriend, who i thought I would be over by now.


Another aspect of it could be that I have my first 'real' 8-5 job, with an hour commute to and back every day. I used to have a lot more free time and fun in college. Im anxious this isn't the 'right place for me' but If i went back to where I moved from all my friends have moved on with their lives to other places, and there is no good paying work back home, its not really an option. 


 I wish I could erase my memories so I could enjoy things here without having the past to compare them to. I want to love my new life here! ",30Oct2017,2
186,So I used a VA loan to buy my house 4 years ago but my new job is an hour commute so we want to sell our house and move. Problem is apparently there is a class action lawsuit against the company that made the tiles for our roof so we now have to put a new roof on to sell the house. On top of that I was dumb and did a hero loan to install windows In the house. With everything being said I have a buyer but my realtor is saying that we either have to come up with 20k or short sell the house to get out of it. Can someone with experience fill me in on the ups and down on this decision. I know it can hurt my credit but how bad and since it's a VA loan what repercussions are there? ,30Oct2017,1
187,"Fellas, every time I am interested in a girl I have over come the barrier of approaching her, but the number part is a huge issue for me, I've had no success. 

For example, recently I approached a girl I liked. Very pretty (my type) and shares a lot in common with me. I went up to her (after weeks of her in my class) and made small talk about class. Eventually, I told her to take down my number. She did, but I haven't gotten a text. I truly believe I fucked myself over for giving out my number to her rather than taking her number. Because now, I don't have her number, but she has mine. The ball is in her court. I also had her add me on social media but she has yet to friend me, while I have her friended. It's only been about a day, but she certainly uses her phone a lot. 

Did I fuck up by giving her my number and not taking hers? Did I fuck up by adding her on facebook/snapchat but not making her add me first? 

Is it better to let the ball be in a girls court or yours? Is it smarter to giver out your number / social media, or ask for theres?",30Oct2017,4

I do not have a loud keyboard or mouse. Despite this, he is demanding that I either sleep when he does, or leave the room while he sleeps.

My roommate, however:

- Snores all night about three times as loud as any noise that I make

- Stands in front of the sink washing his face and other things for about 30 minutes when he wakes up, as well as constantly opening/closing the door

- Refuses to use earplugs even though I've suggested it, and even though I use some to deal with the noise he makes


So my plan is basically to tell him it's an unreasonable request if I can't expect the same level of noise reduction from him, whether he can help it or not. I'd like some objective opinions on whether or not it is reasonable of me to do so.",30Oct2017,2

F and I were in the phone the other day and she was telling me about how she stopped caring about E, and how the less she cares the more that E helps her out and sucks her asshole. I think it’s really shitty of F to do that to E, especially since E is my best friend (my number 1) and E constantly befriends and gets fucked over by the shittiest people Bc he’s somehow attracted to assholes (I mean he hated me at first in my defense and now we’re as close as can be) on top of F saying that about him. F said that she’s going out with the guy that rejected, lied, and broke Es heart and just for fun to get high and shit. E doesn’t know what’s going on because F didn’t tell him, and the guy blocked E on snapchat.
   I’m afraid to tell him all of this stuff because every time I talk about her doing bad crap behind his back E says “whatever” and I don’t think he wants to be reminded of that guy.

Looking back, there were plenty of red flags, but I woke up one morning and ended things seemingly out of nowhere. This has been my experience in all of my relationships, and because of my habit of casually and abruptly ending serious endeavors in general, I've developed a deep mistrust of my emotions and feelings in any given situation. What I love today, I could hate tomorrow. I know I don't want to work in the field for my major, but my major would be good for law school, which I don't want to pursue right out of college. I've recently been seeing someone new, and things have gotten serious quickly. It feels right now, but this scares me. He lives an hour from me, but may be getting a job a few states away. We've agreed that we'd try long distance, but I have no clue where I'll end up when I graduate. My anxiety is really crushing my ability to logically lay out my options and view my situation from a reasonable standpoint. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated. I'm just at a weird place in love, my parents are getting divorced as well, and I have no clue where or what I'll be doing tomorrow let alone a month from now. To put it into perspective, if someone were to tell me I'm going to drop out of school and move to another country in the coming months, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

One of my coworkers processed some of my orders for me in the system (also a common thing to do in my industry) and she discounted their bill by $17.50, which is the cost of the service she signed them up for. Her intention was to cancel the service before it billed for the second month. This helps her meet her quotas for the month. Although the customer did not pay anything extra for the service (because of the discount), they are upset by this (understandably so).

193,"Hi all, this past weekend (Friday to be exact), my brother threw a halloween party in our basement (like, 40 people or so). All was good and well and the party went fine but our basement was a disaster zone. There were candy wrappers everywhere, stuff everywhere, and in a little back room we have that we use to store basically office supply stuff there was A. Writing (and dicks, classy) on the walls and B. A hole in the wall that someone had punched in the wall. Someone also wrote ni**** on a chair in marker. Of course, my brother didn't clean any of this and I wanted to watch TV in the basement so I cleaned up the wrappers but nothing else. Later that day, I helped my mom vacuum and clean up and such and all my brother had to do was try to get some gum out of a carpet. He looked so miserable like we were torturing him and it infuriated me that he thinks we can just clean up after him. The only reason we do is because we know that he will never clean up and so it will turn into an eventual dump and we all like to hang out in the basement. But even his room has writing everywhere and it's just angering thinking that I try to take care of things and try to keep my room tidy (It's pretty good (for a 14 yr old boy lol)) whereas he's able to just throw things around and not have any responsibility. He's also failing a class and doesn't do his work. In school otherwise hes a C+ B- student average and that also makes me mad because I've been working really hard in school (All honors and 1 AP) and have straight A's but it feels like my hard work is invalidated because he's able to slide by fine.

I'm not the kind of person that like anything related to Biology. In high school, i always preferred Maths, Physics and Chemistry. I really wanted to study programming; but that turned out to be a bad idea, because i can always study it beside anything else, either alone( internet, which seem what most people succeeded at) or courses, so Chemistry is my best option to go for.

While i don't like my current studies and i'm completly unaware of what we're studying, i feel like i want to finish because it's a very nice job to have compared to anything else, Being able to help people and save their life is very satisfying, and i can't really abandon it like nothing.

I [F26] broke up with a guy [M28] about a month ago. I liked him a lot but realized there was no future and even though we were having a lot of fun I decided it was best to end it before I got too invested. 

Anyways, all is fine on that front. I thought it through and am happy about my decision, both of us agreed it was the right thing to do and it ended very nicely. My issue is that now I keep dreaming about him?!    

I don’t think it’s every night but it’s enough to have me wondering wtf is going on? When I’m conscious I don’t think about him too much (obviously I’m reminded of him here and there)  and I never talk about him with my friends but he’s clearly on my mind? 

The dreams are very mundane and nothing memorable happens but I’m so angry when I wake up in the morning! I feel like I’ve done everything correctly to get over this in a mature and reasonable way and here is my subconscious cheating and setting me back a few steps!

Particularly, last weekend when he visited.. my boyfriend decided to meet up with him at a bar and his friends drank with him which pissed me off. I found in a way, it enabled Rob even more to drink, gamble in that environment. If Rob's friends cared, wouldn't they steer him clear of such an env where he feels more enabled towards his vices? I brought this up with my boyfriend and he claims I'm crazy, made him feel like shit with my comment. But it makes me question my boyfriend's + friends' character. Rob was on drugs when we went to the bar but no one knew what. Is this good judgement on his friends' part? Does it not feel like they're giving up on Rob, more inclined to have a good time with him then to cut him off? Rob's dependencies are on the far end of the scale, might possibly need rehab.

Anyways, I was drinking w/ my good friend and her supposed good male friend we will call ""mr. douche"". Now, my good friend and I we've been through a lot I slept in the same bed as her and had a few shares of intimacy, took care of me when I was intoxicated and vice-versa, a shoulder to cry on both ways, and we're practically the same age 19ish. Now Mr. Douche over here is a college dropout in his late 20s with an ugly ass stubble that represents his whole personality, drives a 2nd hand corolla without any papers, lives off his decaying modeling career, still financially dependent to his parents, rarely takes a bath(doesn't even put deodorant on), never pays the bill, and hooked to every drug known by man. 

Where should I start? We started drinking and having fun at around 8 PM, talking about life then we started talking about how we are in life. Mr. Douche started his statement w/ how he found an uplifting euphoria through yoga and buddhism. Of course being a great guy just started to tag-along w/ his mind games as he clearly got my friend's attention then he proceeded to make an ass about me, how I should start practicing minimalism and how I quote when he said ""You ought to know when you're spoiled in life or when you're financially dependent to your parents."" Now that was the last fucking straw he fucking knew that I was that guy, so I grabbed him by his wrinkly oxford shirt and didn't let go. My friend pleaded to let him go but I told her this simple statement ""if you're hanging out w/ losers like him you'll end up just like this piece of shit of a human being."". I was just really bummed by the occurrence and the worst part was that she told me ""That I choose him."".

I’m going to list our options and some pros to each one. If you guys have any similar experiences, please share as I am interested in them.

A) Dallas-Fort Worth
Pros: good economy, good cost of living, my family is located there and will be able to help us when we are ready to have kids
Cons: not as nice as Austin (we both prefer Austin and an opinion from my time growing up there), my bf will have to drive almost double the amount of time to visit his family which is not only inconvenient but brings along a slightly higher chance of an accident happening (more time on the road, higher chance of road fatigue, etc.)

B) Austin (where we are graduating from)
Pros: quickly growing economy, nicer area overall in terms of environment and lower crime (better place imo to raise a family), access to multiple higher-tier postgrad-medical institutions in central texas(my bf intends on enrolling to become a medical practitioner), middle point between our families (bf doesn’t have to drive as far to see his family)
Cons: no family support in raising kids (have to put careers on hiatus), more expensive than DFW, traffic is worse as of now

She loved picking me up and going out for girl days and seemed to really enjoy my company. She had a husband and I had a long term boyfriend and we would all get together for couples nights and have a blast. After months of getting to know each other like this, my dad died and I basically lost my damn mind for several months. I tried very hard to hide it from her, but I just couldn’t handle interacting with anyone and basically was a shut-in for quite a while. She seemed to have some stuff happening at the same time too that she needed to deal with so I figured we’d deal with our stuff and naturally reconnect when we both felt better. 

At one point she asked me if I wanted to visit the farmers market with her, so I forced myself to go but had trouble speaking and was sort of lost in my head the whole time. She didn’t seem bothered by it and I figured she probably understands that I’m going through something. So she drops me back off at my house eventually and another couple months go by before we talk again, and basically I texted her to check in and see how she was doing, I apologized for being out of touch for a bit but that I’m feeling better. She doesn’t text back until a few days later and simply says it’s fine and she’s been going through some stuff too. So I tell her I’d love to buy her lunch sometime whenever she’s able and we can catch up. She just never answered me.

A while ago someone called me lackadaisical and it's stuck with me ever since because I know it's true. :( 

Basically all my life I've made stupid careless  mistakes and I don't know how to train myself to stop. 

Maybe someone has some tips/apps/advice that could help me please?

I'm not a couch potato that can't be bothered to tidy or go out. That's not the problem I'm trying to tackle it's that I make stupid mistakes that once they've happened I can't believe I didn't notice. And it's not just a one off here and there that I'm beating myself up over it's EVERY DAMN DAY. And I feel stupid and I look stupid to everyone around me for doing them. Here are a few examples of the kind of problems I'm talking about:

Copying figures and information incorrectly even when I've read and reread and checked whatever information I've got them from. 

Having typos on my presentations at work even though I proof read them myself AND use a proofreading app. 

Forgetting my laptop to take to work even though I have a picture of a note that says ""don't forget laptop"" as my phone background and a note on my mirror. 


Even reading this I can't believe how stupid these mistakes are and I sound like a nob head. How do these problems keep happening?! How does everyone else stay organised and I make these ridiculous mistakes??? 

Help me Reddit please :(

222,"I bought an order of several makeup items a couple of months ago from a store online and had it delivered to my home. The order was totalling $568, which is a lot of money for me.

3 days ago I got an email from this store saying that I made an order and it would be delivered to my house. I absolutely did not make this order! 
The items list was identical to the order I made 2 months ago, and total was $568. 
3 days ago I got the email, and yesterday they charged me on my card for this order that I didn't make. 

The mistake is that they are trying to resend me the $568 order that I actually made 2 months ago but never repurchased. 

How on earth could this happen? 

I know they will give me a refund but am I entitled to get any free products or free store credit for the mix up? If they don't at least give me a written apology or something for the mixup I'd consider never shopping there again. 

I'm really upset, inconvinienced and confused that my debit card has been charged with so much money, I desperately need that money for life this month.

223,"My girlfriends birthday is in three days and I realized this morning that I lost one of her gifts!! 
I have a bundle of small things that Im giving her because I liked the idea of having that pile of presents but the stuff was really leading up to the main gift. 
I had ordered a cassette tape that is really hard to come by and I've been keeping it hidden in my closet in a bag for a good month. Sometimes I took it out just to look at it but I would always put it there or in a drawer. I recently cleaned out my room and I didn't see it misplaced anywhere - When I get home from work I plan on tearing the room apart. 
Not that long ago I had also acquired a free Polaroid camera through filling out multiple surveys. My intention was to always give it to her because I know just how much she's wanted one but I'm hesitating for two reasons. One she's really humble and if I find the cassette I'm afraid I'll make her uncomfortable by also giving her the polaroid camera.(We're both first-time college kids so like money doesn't necessarily grow on trees for us) And like I don't want to make her feel obligated to get me nicer stuff next time something rolls around. Also, I could just wait for Christmas to gift her the camera which would also be convenient in case anybody else in her family gifted her a polaroid camera. But I do really want to give her that feeling that all of us have wanted kids on our birthdays, seeing a pile of presents all for you.

My ideal situation would be a small farm who just kills the animals instantly, with a gun or something like that.

225,"So I have this friend that we'll call W. About 2 months ago we were bored in class and decided to start doodling our most hated teachers doing nasty shit. I ended up drawing a pretty expicit depiction of two male teachers blowing each other. We had a laugh and I told W to throw it away. By the way, W had this Nintendo DS that he used to mess around with  (the school took it away from him, I'll explain in a bit) so keep that in mind. Fast forward 2 months and I get called down to the main office where they ask me if I drew Mr G and Mr F doing, well, you know what. I ask to see the evidence and they show me W's DS with a picture of my drawing. Turns out that W took a picture before throwing it away (it wasn't even that funny). Why did they have his DS? Earlier in the week it had been confiscated after he tried taking pictures of teachers without them knowing (I dont fucking know why). My dad is supposed to meet them tomorrow morning, although they can't reach him since they don't have the right phone number. How do I explain this to my dad without causing too much damage? I'm not a troublemaker at all and he's already in a bad place considering he recently lost his job, I feel like this would just add more shit to his pile.

I’ve been in a couple other relationships between now and then, I’m now 23, but none of which did I even BEGIN to open up. I was incredibly emotionally unavailable and dated them so as to not be alone (terrible, I know I know). I recently started seeing someone new, a week after starting therapy for my PTSD. I like him, we want the same things in life and he makes it easy to be myself. That being said I still get triggered around him, constantly, but I know I need to face these things and process them rather than shutting down or abruptly ending things without explanation (also a bad habit). At first I thought I wanted to keep this to myself until I got it figured all out, but I’m starting to see that if I really want a true relationship I need to share the bad things too, and allow him to be my partner through the tough times. However, I do NOT want his help in the actual healing if that makes sense, I just want him to play his role of my supportive SO that I can openly tell what I need to help the triggers, and have him there to learn about me, but not to expose my trauma to (at least not yet). He has no idea about any of my issues, and is dating has triggered me dozens of times, all of which I’ve been able to mask well and have gone undetected as far as I know. But I want him to know this about me and share that part of me with him.

231,"My boyfriend and I just moved into a small one bedroom apartment in August. We are on the lower level with the only other apartment touching ours being a couple and their dog directly above us. I need advice about some sort of action to handle our upstairs neighbors noisiness in a polite manner...

1.  They are constantly walking around all day long and the floor boards creak loud where I can hear every single step they are taking. 

2. We have a bad habit of falling asleep on the couch and every single time that we have woken up between 3 and 5 AM to move to our bed they are awake and walking around loudly (minimum 20 times) I have been either woken up or had trouble falling asleep because of this late night activity. 

* they are not actually being loud it is their constant walking around and loud creaking sound on their floor/my ceiling*

3. They have a dog that does not stop barking and every single time someone walks past the apartment it runs around and barks so loudly it is very annoying and hard to tune out. 

We bought a white noise maker to try and mute the sound and it is not loud enough, I have also tried earplugs at night but do not wake up from my alarm unfortunately with them in.  I do not believe that I am being over sensitive to this because every single time that I have had guests they comment on how loud the upstairs neighbors are.  

I know I cannot tell them to walk around less but I know they can do something about the dog barking and be more considerate walking around in the middle of the night. 

The only major problem and reason that we have not done anything about it yet is because if we go to management, our upstairs neighbors could mention our weed smoking because they definitely smell it through the vents every night.

237,"We viewed three units at this apartment complex in mid-September. All three were vacant at the time. We were told the carpets were being replaced in two units, and their agent told us that she ""wasn't sure we'd want those units because you have a cat"". We chose the one that wasn't getting new carpet anyway, because we liked the layout better.

After applying, we submitted a reasonable accommodation request. Our cat is an emotional support animal (I know, I know, but we are legit with letters from our local doctors), and we wanted to secure her rights there since in recent years, that apartment changed their policy and booted dogs. After this, everything changed. Suddenly we were delayed, the unit we wanted had to ""get the carpet replaced"" (that carpet was in perfect condition and I 100% guarantee the carpet wasn't getting replaced). So we got the apartment next door. We walk in on Saturday, our move-in day....and the carpet is disgusting. Not cleaned, has stains, completely worn in the main areas....it's shocking the difference between walking around the apartment, and standing in the corner by the window. 

I suspect we were given this place because they were pissed about the emotional support animal thing, and saved themselves the money on replacing the carpet. Our lease is troublesome for illegal clauses, as well, and as soon as we get a copy of the lease, we're bringing it to our lawyer. (We were not allowed to see it beforehand or bring it to the lawyer before signing). 

TL;DR: We were told the carpet was getting replaced in the unit we were given. The carpet is old, disgusting, stained, and worn very thin - definitely not replaced. Should we raise a fuss with the landlord, and if so, how?",30Oct2017,3
238,"Ok, so me and my friends were playing basketball at our local rec center.  I have been playing ball here for years never had a problem or caused a problem with anyone, I’m not the type to even try and fight people, I consider myself a very patient and friendly person.

 Anyways, me and my friends played a few 2 on 2 games and sat down to take a break. After awhile I got up to just shoot around. There was only 1 other guy in the gym with us. This is the guy I would eventually punch. 

He ran to our side of the court and tried to layup the ball, coincidentally I was shooting a 3 pointer. My ball hit his and he immediately started yelling at me saying “have some fuckin respect, that’s bull shit you know I was shooting the ball fuck that” stuff like that. 

Me and my friends are in shock because I obviously didn’t and would never do something like that. Even if I did who gives a fuck? It’s not that big of a deal. He continues to yell at me and starts getting closer to me, I have never been in a fight, but I am definitely not the type to let something like this go down.

 Regrettably, I stand up and say some cliche line like “well what’s up then?” He says to me “you ain’t gonna do shit I know your type, you’re just all talk” So I push this dude, he doesn’t go very far. He’s got about 4 inches and 130 lbs on me. I’m a pretty small dude. Although, I’m in really good shape, and I have a lot of speed. 

(Please understand I’m not trying to brag, I feel like a total shit head, just trying to paint the picture). 

He then starts running at me, so I step to the side and jab him with a right. He folds immediately. He gets back up and continues to yell at me saying he’s gonna stab me and shoot me and all kinds of stuff. 

A member of the staff comes in and kind of calms everything down. Apparently this guy gets crazy with people often. I feel so terrible because I don’t think this guy was all there. I know with my speed and strength he had absolutely no chance of hurting me.

239,"Hi,

I'm a freshman at a really large school. I had a blast my first week here because the social scene is pretty party oriented and there were no classes for the first week and a half after move-in. I met and know by name everyone on my floor and a ton of other people around campus from classes/parties/I don't even know. I greet everyone I know by name, spend a lot of time in my floor's den, and stop by people's dorms every once in a while. My issue is that, despite knowing so many people, I don't actually have any close friends.

Now, I attribute this with two things mostly. First of all, I broke my humerus (badly) around three weeks into the school year by getting hit by a pick up truck while skateboarding. I'm a fucking idiot and ran a red light. I was out of the dorm for a little more than a week really early in the year and I haven't been partying since (which is pretty much the only thing the people on my floor seem to do on the weekend). I was on some pretty heavy duty pain killers for the first week or two so I couldn't drink anyway. After, I decided to continue avoiding alcohol because there was a good chance I'd aggravate my injury while drunk. I feel like this distanced me from the people on my floor, it's not like people are calling me out for abstaining but I'm just not spending as much time with them as I was before. 

Second, I've been spending most of my time with my girlfriend because I have no idea what else to do. She's the only person I feel close to because she was one of the few people who I told about breaking my arm, and she was my only recurring visitor while I was recovering. I was extremely embarrassed because it was entirely my fault and it was a stupid way to get hurt so I avoided telling anyone. I'm worried because I feel like I'm putting all my eggs in one basket, my relationship with my girlfriend is good right now but we've only been dating for a month and I can't predict the future. If something were to happen I would feel pretty lonely. 

I'm pretty sure that I'm overreacting, and I think it's because I'm getting tired of the sudden lifestyle change that breaking my arm forced upon me (I'm usually pretty active, but can't lift, run, or skate for a few more weeks), but I think that some of my concerns are logical and I would love some advice on how to address them.

240,"I have a supervisor that is above my direct supervisor. Well, about two steps higher than that. He is an extremely handsome man. I think he is married, as well. He has always sort of watched me but, I'm a very hard worker, so my assumption is/was that it fascinates him that I work so hard and so well. A couple of weeks ago, I realized how often he looks at me or at least in my general direction. It's the sort of thing you do in grade school where you wanted to see what was going on without looking like you were actually watching...I think. I tested him a couple of days later just to make sure I'm not making a big deal out of nothing. So, he was standing somewhere speaking with somebody and no matter where I went, he was always facing me. I never catched him necessarily looking directly at me but, his entire body and face would be towards me. 

I thought maybe he has a crush on me but, I'm not too sure now. He will hold convos with everybody around me and his response to anything I say is always so delayed like he's shocked I even spoke to him. Not exacerbation but, like caught in the headlights. It seems, also, that he will quite overtly go out of his way to outright ignore me. 

Another thing he does is corrects anybody around me. He's only ever really half heartedly told me to stop talking and get back to work but, he is a dick to other people. Like, he'll start micromanaging whoever is in my direct line of sight. 

I don't know if the guy is just immature and has a crush on me or if he is just fascinated with me in a kind of disgusted sort of way. I DO believe he is the reason I got hired on so quickly. I think it was his personal recommendation. However; it's so hard to tell what's going on with him. He is very hot and cold. Accept the staring. It's become something else now...where he doesn't really stare at me...not since I caught him getting a gander from the other side of a computer. Now, he often stands in my line of sight. Or is always just passing by. But, it's always right where I can see him. WTF is going on? I want to connect with him. I mean, I think he's handsome and I'm not trying to cross the line but, I'd like to develop a decent work relationship with him but, he's so inaccessible and this staring/ignoring thing is making it impossible for me to gauge how to behave with him.",30Oct2017,1

      We were talking about Derek, and suddenly, my friend, (Let's call him Rodger) said that ""He said he's going to bring a bomb into the school tomorrow"". Rodger jokes around quite often when I talk to him, so I didn't think much of it. However, around 10th period (an optional extra help period) I was just walking around and I saw Derek. I turned into another hallway, and he's now behind me. And behind me, I think he's talking to himself. I'm not 100% sure, though. I don't really think he has many friends, either.

Also, in order to go to university i told my worker and foster parents that i did not want to be an electrician at all and created a whole life plan revolving around university so it will be a back hand to them to say i want to go back to being an electrician,it was also fully paid for by my agency and have already applied for a number of scholarships that my worker has predicted i will be receiving possibly, i already found an apprenticeship and am looking at all the gear i would need in order to become an electrician, i also have prepared a resume and got my official certificate from my school in order to fully prepared if i follow through with this plan.

i dont know what i should do, what would you do, and how would you go about doing it? being a person in care is rough because your life goes from having all the help and assistance you need, to needing to make full blown huge life choices in a matter of a year or two, and even if you dont make those choices you lose all the support you had behind you and are expected to live on your own.

However, I think I have deeper issues (in addition to low self-confidence) that are keeping me from reaching my full potential and achieving my goals.


My main distractions are women. While I wouldn't say I'm addicted to women, I have allowed them to slow down the path to my goals. The moment I find out a woman is interested, I pull out all the stops to seal the deal. i.e, spending an absurd amount of money, sweet talking, game, etc..

I'm starting to think that because my parents, particularly my mom, never emotionally supported me or were ever affectionate, that I always look for validation from women: them telling me I'm pretty/me sleeping with them. I've probably slept with ~50 women in the past 2 years. The constant need for attention/validation drove me to make chasing women a priority during this time. In retrospect, this drove me to be deeply in debt today, with little to show for it. 

Although I've had success with many women, I haven't come close to wanting a serious relationship with any of them ever since I broke up with my ex 2+ years ago (almost married her). I'm starting to think I will be single forever, which I have no problem with...I think...


Do I have mommy issues? Am I just a high libido guy in his 20's? AM I addicted to female attention? Help :(







TL;DR: I've lost a lot of money chasing women (successfully), I get a ""near high"" from the validation from women. I think it might be because I have mommy issues.

254,"First of all, I'm sorry if my grammar isn't 100% correct as I'm from Austria. 


So, where do I start.. I'm currently 18 and I'm still in the austrian equivalent of high school because I already had a job once and I've also been to multiple schools before that so my résumé is pretty effed up already. It's my second year at this school right now and I just began to realize that i actually hate almost everything and everyone here. My classmates are pretty garbage and really childish and a lot of teachers have very questionable ways of teaching. (catholic school btw)


The other thing is my mum and stepdad. He's a dick, and my mum is a cat lady. I'm also an only child so I don't really have anyone to talk to at home (Fun fact: I felt more at home at my ex girlfriend's family, and they weren't that great either). 


Now, there's one stupid idea that I had today. I could move to the city (that has always been my dream, never felt at home in this rural area) and switch to a course based school which would maybe only take me 1 1/2 years to finish and I'd have the same qualifications as if I'd finished the school i'm currently attending. (Still 2 1/2 years) Let me know what you think.

255,"I have to email the video, because I don't know what else to do. My sister was driving and pulled over for not having a sticker. From what I understand, her husband got out of the car. The officer told him to get back in the car and he said that he didn't have to. Then the officer said he was resisting arrest, but her husband said he wasn't driving and didn't do anything. Her husband swears a lot during the encounter. Her husband's hands were up the whole time. The officer injured him , threatened him with a taser, and kicked their car door a couple of times, frightening their son. When the officer found out they were getting footage from a store, he dropped the resisting arrest charge, but kept the disorderly conduct one.

256,"Throwaway for reasons that will become obvious.

My friends and I are all guys in our early thirties and we have been friends for a long time.  In some cases the friendships go 20 years or more.  In our late teens and early 20s we all got heavily involved in drugs and by and large until last year it has always been a positive experience.  To quote the man 

""Never murdered anyone, never robbed anyone, never raped anyone, never beat anyone, never lost a job, a car, a house, a wife or kids...laughed my ass off and went about my day""

The drugs were varied and many but the main drug of choice for the gang was cocaine.  

These days the long party weekends are a thing of the past and it has been probably 2 or 3 years since we were all together and let our hair down.  So we planned a weekend at our friends house to live it up and enjoy ourselves again



Now if I may introduce the players in our sorry tale:
 
Animal: Previously a monster now settled down and only comes out to play rarely - really looking forward to the coming weekend.  Would have been considered to have a big coke problem in the past but now happy in a relationship and settled.

Fozzie Bear: Big lovable man who will be our host for the party and will always go with the flow of what the group decides.  Never had any drug problem.

Beaker (Me): Used to be a big cokehead, on it most nights but quit 7 years ago.  I can now take it or leave it and i am happy with my relationship with it. 

Swedish Chef: Uses cocaine still.  At least once a month maybe twice but always on a weekend and never when at work. Manages his usages extremely well.  He does now have a new group of friends he continues to do cocaine with regularly as we have stopped

Gonzo: The problem in hand - came out last year as a cocaine addict to his family - got sent to rehab and N/A and kept doing it.  His wife kicked him out because of his drug use.




Gonzo pulled away from the group about the same time he went to rehab and lied to us constantly and to his family too, he was sacked from a job (but quietly due to his uncle being the director) for stealing cash and ran up loads of debt to drug dealers, some of which we had to go talk to on his behalf.  He turned down all invitations to hang out with us even when we assured him there would be no drugs at all

He hasn't hung out with us in a long time and originally he wasn't invited to the weekend and that would just have been the normal.

However I was speaking to him about something else and the topic came up and i invited him to come and party with us.  He seemed excited about hanging out with us again and has said so on several occasions since.

My reasoning is thus.  I know he is an addict and he has a problem, however his family and counsellors haven't changed anything.  He is in fact in a worse place in his life (having lost his wife and home) than he was before he went to rehab.  He does the drug by himself alone most nights using a teaspoon to get the coke out of bag in his car before he went home.

I believe that he has forgotten the social aspect of narcotics and the enjoyment of saving it for a special occasion and the camaraderie that comes with doing it with others.  I am certain this is not the most healthy of attitudes but I am also very certain that it is healthier than doing it by yourself.

I don't know if this will have any impact on him at all but what I do know s what he is doing now is not helping him at all, i ran into one of his dealers the other week in town who told me he had run up more debt with him again.

I just feel that if we don't change our approach to how we interact with him we are going to keep getting the same results.

Animal and Fozzie Bear are happy with the idea and would love to hang with Gonzo again.

The problem is that Swedish Chef is refusing to come now.  He says he doesn't want to give positive reinforcement to Gonzo's drug use and says he will not be a part of it.  

What do I do denizens of reddit? I have to choose one of my friends  as the Swedish Chef is effectively saying that he will not be around Gonzo anymore if he has drugs.






tl;dr Should I do drugs with my drug addict friend?

260,"I really have no idea where to go with my issues right now and I don't know what else to do so for some reason I've decided to go to the internet to seek some help. I'm a mid 20's male who has has road block after road block in life whenever it comes to going to college or finding a decent job. It always seems like something comes up and these last few months have been nothing different, and it's getting to the point where it's causing my physical and mental well-being to suffer. I'm in a relationship with a girl who makes me very happy and I help to care for her baby while she's at work. Financially she supports me 100% at this point, food, bills, car. Everything. When we entered the relationship I had what I thought was a stable job but I ended up getting laid off and she's been more than happy to help take care of me since. I decided that I should attempt to go back to school to broaden my job selection and I picked something in the medical field because I enjoy helping people. The schoolwork came pretty well to me and it was just about time to wrap up my first semester when Hurricane Irma came through and knocked out power/water and most of our house in the process. This was the week of my finals. I did all that I was able to and took the ones online that I could but I wasn't able to make it to the in-person final I had for obvious reasons, so I had to do it make up and it all worked out ok. However, because that last week had a lot of assignments due I wasn't able to get them all done in time with the lack of power and internet. This caused my A's and B's to drop below 78% which is my schools fail threshold. So I was failed, on all but one course. I tried everything to get some sort of help from the school, even trying to make an appeal to the teachers and dean and was denied because ""I had missed a few other assignments during the course and it wouldn't help"". All of my missed assignments aside from one were in that last week. But they wouldn't consider me further. Now I've started a new semester and was put in the same courses but wasn't told about it during my appeal process and because of that I was kicked out of the courses for ""2 weeks of inactivity"" and I have to completely re-enroll. I told my family that everything was going well, that I had passed and that I was going to my next semester with no issue. Now they're receiving mail that says that I'm no longer a student and my insides feel like they're going to explode. I can't handle letting everyone down again, and I'm pretty sure my gf would kick me out and dump me if she knew. I screwed myself over in that regard, but I was terrified of the initial reaction I would receive from everyone after being told multiple times by multiple people that ""You better do good, this is really like your last chance."" I'm a failure, and I've failed again, and I just feel so defeated and scared. Scared that people will find out, and I know at this point that it's inevitable.",30Oct2017,1

268,"My boss and my mom have been friends for at least a decade. They are around the same age while I am a teenager. Recently while on the job my boss has begun bringing up my mother.

She told me that my mom secretly tries to compete with me for attention, is jealous of me, and wants to be me. She basically said that my mom lives through me and is way too hard on me for making ANY mistake, which has been what sparked my self-hatred and harsh critique of everything i do.

My mother was a very very pretty girl in her prime. She's now in her 40s, and I'm 18. My boss told me that my mom is jealous of my youth and my beauty, and tries to copy me. This bothers me a whole lot because I've begun to notice it.

This past summer, she bought a ton of teenage string bikinis and left them out. I thought she had bought them for me, but found out she bought them for herself. If I mention something about how I like straight hair, she will begin straightening her own. She bleaches her hair blonde, wears clothes meant for someone my age a lot, borrows MY clothes, and points out when men stare at me as if she looks for it. I was offered a bar tending job, and a few weeks later she told me shes thinking about bar tending, at MY job, alongside me. This is a 40 yr old woman. It took days for me to talk her out of it and explain why I don't want my mother working at the same place as me. She gets angry at me if i EVER sleep in and tells me that i have no life and can't do that, as it's wrong for no other reason than that she can't experience it too. Just this morning she made me feel guilty for sleeping in again, and it honestly sours my mood for the rest of the day. She has never been able to sleep in as she is very much a morning person. 

Her tendencies to hover over my shoulder, waiting for me to mess up have really fucked me up a lot. If I'm being honest, I spend most of my time staying as far away from her as possible, as being around her just sucks all of the energy and happiness out of me. She is VERY invasive of me and my brothers privacy and VERY controlling. She acts purely on emotion, as if she's still a teenager herself. Sometimes I feel like she's less mature than me even though she's twice my age.

I love my mom, but hearing this stuff from one of her friends, who has known her for so long, confirms that my beliefs are not in my head. I've really started to resent my mom for how she treats me and acts around me and I don't know what to do. I've tried bringing it up, but she doesn't see what she's doing wrong in the least. Her defense is ""it's because I love you."" I've also tried bringing it up with my dad, and he doesn't see it either. But everyone on the outside does. I feel very stuck, as I'm now an adult and trying to form my own identity, yet my mom doesn't seem to want that at her core. She says she does, but actions speak louder than words.

I guess what I'm looking for is advice on how to cope with her.",30Oct2017,0

277,"so I'm currently a junior in college majoring in  Electronic commerce which​ I initially pursued b/c my goal was set at earning a bachelor's degree and jumping into the job field soon after. Now that I've had a taste of what a possible life would like with this degree I've come to realize that I'm not fulfilled with the idea of this potential lifestyle. The subject is interesting enough to go through with  up until now that my lingering thoughts about what I really would like to do are surfacing in my consciousness. So the dilemma is  I'm trying to decide whether to pursue psychology or sociology bachelor's to start off and then work my way up Masters or PhD if needed ...or maybe I'm looking at a different bachelor's degree I'm not aware of. I have this  strong yearning for learning the way the mind of the individual works because I look around me in this world and see the harm that we as people put on our selves and believe that we do this because we lack the psychological knowledge to help ourselves carry out a more holistic life. Its no secret that our species is  variedly flaw  so I think that by studying a theory or strategy that promotes pyschological intervention (better suited at a younger age while the brain is developing)  of humans, we can  make a huge impact on our psychological well being as humans. I think the idea has a stronger emphasis of self help but more so targeted with children because it's their  malleable brain's prime to absorb this information and hopefully carry out these teachings for the rest of their life. IDK If I should aim for researcher, clinician, policy advocator, instructor or what? 
And at the same time I compare the trade offs,if I just if I stay with my e-commerce degree I only have about 2 years and I'm out of school and I can start my life BUT if I decide to pursue either psychology or sociology I see myself in school for another 8 to 10 years and not to mention the cost since Im currently paying for half of my tuition out-of-pocket so that's also something to consider as well. And yes every person that I speak to about this they all say just do what makes you happy and to not fixate myself with the time process but this is a very very important decision to make about my life so now I'm juggling with a list of pros and cons.

278,"Hello friends, my mother who has always drank has become more and more irresponsible as the years have gone by. Now she is seeking help and I want to be supportive but I'm struggling to find the words.
  A little background - 
My grandfather (her dad) just passed away this week so I flew home for the funeral. I am only able to make the trip about once a year so I tend to be less informed than I should be about family affairs. That being said, I have heard from multiple sources both within the family and elsewhere that her drinking has been getting out of hand in the last few years. I have many stories of her drinking to much in social situations or sneaking alcohol (very obviously) and lying about it.
When I got home the first thing I noticed was her face had bruises on it and she had a black eye. She claims she fell on the stairs but my dad indicated it was a drunken fall on the porch. At the viewing she was obviously grieving but not drunk. About halfway through she disappeared and returned with slurred speech and glazed eyes- clearly lit. She did this same thing the following night at dinner. She was gone less than 5 minutes and was suddenly very drunk.
She is dissatisfied with her marriage to my father for several reasons- some of them legitimate but she chose this dinner as the time to openly talk about it in front of me, my 2 brothers, and my uncle and his son. It was painfully awkward.
Later my brother took her aside and had a long conversation with her in the other room. When they came back she cheerfully declared the two of them had solved all the world's problems. About 4 hours later, in the company of another uncle, she basically repeated the same behavior from earlier. 
Today I fly back to Colorado and as I sit at the airport she started texting with my brother and I.  She claims to have gone to a ""head doctor"" today who told her she was supposed to tell my brother and i she had gone to said head doctor and she was told to take the month of November off from drinking. 
My request is advice from people who have been through this. What can I do to be supportive when I am not around? Is there anything other than kind words I can offer her? Thanks for listening.

I have SEVERE social anxiety disorder, and I live with my boyfriend and his parents. His mother has no issues with me and I've very slowly opened up towards her and gotten to know her as a person. His dad on the other hand... well. His dad has MS and was forced to retire early, he's always at home too, and is extremely cold and intimidating, and the only social interactions I've ever had with him have been negative.
He reminds me of my own dad, who was extremely emotionally and physically abusive, and it scares me a lot.

I struggled for a long time to get a job, due to not being able to drive, lack of qualifications etc... when I finally did, my boyfriend offered to drive me to work whenever possible and would ask his mother if he couldn't do it, and said at worst I could get an Uber or something to work. - Again, SEVERE social anxiety, meaning I can't get the bus without having a full on breakdown. That and, I don't know the area at all. 

Now I've always been... a slower person for developing than others. What would be considered tiny steps for others are often monumental steps for me. Things like going to the store alone. And I made the most monumental step of my life by getting a job as a waitress for social events. (I have breakdowns just thinking about it okay) 

So fastforward to my partner asking his mother if she could take me to work as he has college at the time. she says yes, and his dad gets furious, yells at all of us individually, and causes me to have a serious meltdown, crying and the likes - babbling about how huge steps for me are never good enough for anyone else etc. 

He's one of the main people in my life that I can never please, yet my brain tells me that he's super important to please as he's my lovers father (whom does not get along with his dad anyway.)

How do I go about this without ruining my work environment? I have no intention of quitting and plan on being as professional/polite as possible, I just have no idea how my friend will handle it. Has anyone ever gone through something like this? Should I cut my losses and find a new job or should I grit my teeth and deal with the awkwardness? 

Thank you for any help.",30Oct2017,1
292,"recently me and this girl have been going out. We hung out both days this weekend and because I knew of her fear of falling for someone I let her decide on whether or not she’d make a move. Turns out she did! We went to a basketball court nearby and after a terrible shot by me she came walking toward me and we kissed(On Saturday) However today (Monday) she’s seemingly way more distant about it and seems to really not want to be with me. We had been flirting back and forth for awhile now and she had a day where she was really feeling upset about her last relationship however after a few days she was flirting with me again, I talk to her friends whom I am also good friends with and they have told me that there isn’t someone else.",30Oct2017,1
293,"So i’m 15 and my mother considers me playing 2-3 hours on weekdays and sometimes 4-8 hours on weekends to be too much.the thing is that she gives me no reason why this is too much. Because i pretty much fill all the charactheristics that gamers usually don’t have according to a lot of parents/adults which are

Being fit: i work out 1-2 hours 4-5 days/week, take the bicycle to school everyday aswell and i eat very clean sometimes buying a snickers bar about once every two weeks, and i.m currently at only 10% bodyfat percentage

Do good in school: i work on homework/study usually between 10 mins-2 hours per day depending on work load and manage to get all A’s and B’s with the occasional C. And I’m currently top of my class

Socialise: in school i socialise a lot aswell at the gym (usually go there with a friend) i also usually spend a few hours with friends every weekend and sometimes in the week days if i have time( i also talk to friends while playing viseogames)

Sleep: i get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a night.


So do you guys have any suggestion how i can convince my mom it’s bad and if you have any article that would benefit me doesnt matter if it’s fake or not my mom follows everything she reads in an article and follows it like a blind sheep as long as some ”study” or ”proffessional” says something.

295,"I'm under 18 and often feel an urge to watch porn every few days and often I cannot overcome the temptation. I have noticed a negative change in my behavior since I've started watching it and therefore want to stop. 

I wouldn't say I'm addicted but I'm getting to the point where I could become addicted to it. And any restrictions that I or my parents put on my devices simply do not work as I know how to bypass them too easily. 

Thanks!",30Oct2017,1
296,"If I talk about people at all, she looks them up on facebook. She feels free to express whatever opinion she wants to me about my friends. Whenever I have friends over I feel like she talks to them more than I do. I want my friends to be my friends and her friends to be hers. Just like how I don't get involved at all with my parents social lives. I recently had a friend over and he is kind of poor and he needed glasses. My mom took him to the eye doctor and paid for his glasses. She's not rich either. Where do I draw the line with this? Should I tell her anything?",30Oct2017,1
297,"So recently I bought a Ethernet cable on Amazon so I can install Arch Linux without tehtering my phone's data. It arrived today, my dad told my mom to not give me the package because he thinks I'll gain admin access to the router (I was planning on plugging it in on the modem). He set up a system where I have to login via a web browser (Arch is CLI based and can't login with a browser)  I haven't talked to my dad yet, he's a tech guy like me but he has no experience with Linux. What should I say to him?",30Oct2017,1
299,"(Read first before giving out Lame Advice)

2 years after High School. They never seek out for a job, chase their dreams or do anything. They are just at home playing games every single day and occasionally their friends pick them up to hang out. 

At first I thought they wanted to be Pro Gamers, Youtuber, Streamer and such. So I got in touch with a popular Youtuber to help them out but my Brothers don't bother to ask them for advice. So that's down the drain.

As the oldest and with my observation, I think one of the main reason they are like this is because my parents always give them free stuff where as I have to go earn them. 

I figured that I'd ask them why they are not going out to set up their lives and they all responded ""What is the reason for getting a job and doing that? I'm comfortable where I am.""

So then I thought it is because they need to create a reason to go out and pursue their dreams. 

I asked them, why they think a job is important to have and they all say the obvious thing. To feed themselves and pay for bills and I told them... ""Do they think our mom and dad will continuously pay for their lifestyle forever?"" They all say ""No"" and I asked them... wouldn't that be a reason to start now before it gets hard? They said ""yeah"". But then their action never support their answers. From this point I am starting to think they are just saying what I want to hear to get away from me ASAP. (By the way I always speak to them in a clam voice)

Then I thought maybe they don't know how to respect themselves and love themselves. So I taught them what it means to take care of their bodies and how to do so. In the beginning they were beginning to see results of themselves losing fat and they were happy. Then suddenly they reverted back to their old self. 

At this point I told them that they now they have the knowledge and power to do what they want as I am a living proof and they themselves have had small success with the knowledge and power they have themselves. They have no other excuses.

I also told them that because of what they know and have the power to do....the only reason they are where they are now is because they ""Choose"" that lifestyle and I explained to them with logic and so on and they agree. 

At this point i'm starting to think that they know how to get what they want in life but they just choose not to and just choose the path down and that there is nothing I can do about it but wait for despair to hit them hard where they will experience what it's like to be in deeeep shit and that will wake them up and give them a solid reason to pursue their dreams or learn basic things like get a job for bills and such. 

The reason I said this is because I myself have experienced what it's like to be in deep shit with no help and thus therefore I am running my own business and working a job on the side. That was kind of how I got there. 

My Brothers are Reactors and not Assertive people. They let life around them dictate how their life should be.... Tsk tsk. 

Anyway, what do you guys think? Any pointers?",30Oct2017,1
