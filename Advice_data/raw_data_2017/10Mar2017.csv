3,"Ok, so this maybe an easy decision to make for most peoole. But I'm not most people and tend to have a lot of difficult with a decision. So I'm asking what would you do or what do you think I should do in this scenario? I am 35 year old female, single, no kids. I have a full time job, which I love. But I am desperately trying to save money, go back to grad school, and have a social life all at the same time too. I've been working as a care taker Mon through Fri for an elderly person, who is very depressed, lonely and needs companionship. I really feel for this person, but feel overwhelmed and stressed at times. The elder person can be grumpy, but can also be really lovely. I'm so tired on my days off working late m-f and early morning work schedule. Hence, not making friends or meeting anyone due to playing catch up for myself with my own personal errands on weekends or chores for elder person on weekend. I am saving money on rent, in exchange for helping elder person.

My question, would you think it would be better for a person in my position to get a part time job that has less demanding hours and where I could be out in public more meeting people my age and living with roommates to save money? or stick with elder care, which feels isolating for me. I also have been so stressed I'm not going to gym as much and taking care of me.

In ideal world, I wouldn't need a second job and could go back to school easily.

If you can take my poll to help me as silly and ridiculous as this is I would be so appreciative!!

Thanks!!!!",10Mar2017,1
4,"I'm almost 21 years old, I work, get home, play video games and nosh off my E-cig all night, maybe text a few people, eventually get ignored and go to bed.

I go back to a time when I was 14, I had a dress sense, I played guitar &amp; sang, I played for a semi-pro football academy, I was so confident with girls, I had so many friends in and out of school, I was artistic, just.. interesting.

I've had a pretty dramatic 4 years, Homelessness, abuse from my father, money problems etc.
Anyhow, I've just moved to a new town 6 hours away from my old hometown, I'm completely isolated, I have no past here but I like it, I want to get to know local people and become a new person, sound easy, it probably is, but I'm having some problems.

Because of the events of the last few years I have become demotivated, I don't laugh or joke as much anymore, I gave up all instruments, art, I don't care about how I look, I have gained weight and haven't even shaved for weeks. I can't really go to the gym because I now suffer with reactive arthritis, I can walk and do upper body weight training but can't do cardio so I'm gaining weight. Hence, lost confidence speaking to girls and just i'm just generally pretty boring and lost any looks I had. 

Where do I start, to meet people, feel good about myself and become somebody interesting? there's too much to focus on, I usually end up ignoring it, waking up the next day frustrated I'm not self improving when I should be. 

if you've got any advice I would really love to hear it, thank you x",10Mar2017,1

I was not okay with this whatsoever and removed myself from the situation, later explaining to her that it was not okay for her to be laughing at jokes about death when it seriously happened.

13,"This is throwaway account because my main has some identifiable information. 

Anyway. I'll be 32 this summer. I'm married, I have a daughter, and I own (read the bank owns) a modest house. I live in a Univesity town of 20,000 in the United States. Honestly, I never saw myself living here for the past 12 years. 

Anyway, I am living in a interesting situation at the moment. About 6 years ago I helped to found a non-profit organization dedicated to alleviating poverty while working at another local non-profit. I essentially worked two full time jobs making $30,000 a year.

2 years ago my wife had a medical emergency and spent 30 days in a hospital 2 hours away from home. Non-profit job A (the one paying me $30,000) at first gave me the time off, paid. This period in the hospital made my wife and I closer than we had ever been. 

While tending to my wife, Non-Profit A shut down all of my programs without telling me. When I got back to work my boss and board president ambushed me and told me my last day would be the end of May. A week before my last day, my wife went into labor. That was the end of my time at Non-Profit A. 

Even though I had spent 5 years at non-profit A, I was only offered 2 months severance. 

In response to not wanting to lose me, Non-Profit B (without a stable funding source) offered me a job at Medicaid Level (138% of federal poverty line) while my wife finished college. 

It's been 1.5 years and I have realized that I am burned out and I'm not doing a great job. In fact things have gone to hell and we can't make payroll in 2 months. THe main reason I seem to be staying is that I am 3/4 of the way through a $100,000 Homeless Shelter renovation. I still have $25,000 left to raise.

I don't know what to do. Being the head of a non-profit has been my dream for the past 10 years. Now that I've gotten there, I am terrible at it. 

I don't know where to even start. My wife keeps telling me she will support me no matter what. I just don't know where to start. I also don't know if I should finish the project or quit now. I don't know if I should stay in NPO's knowing that I am terrible at what I do.

16,"I have a coworker that is very manipulative and constantly lying. He lies about every single thing. We work with college students, and he is constantly belittling an older coworker to the customers. I find it reprehensible, and I have reported it to our boss, mildly ""scolded"" him myself...it didn't matter and seemed to make it worse. He then seemed to start talking about me the same way. 

I came home from work super pissed about it one night and angrily put his name into Google, and his Twitter was one of the first things that came up. Well guess what? Here he is tweeting about a person he works with and some identifying mannerisms of the person that he has greatly exaggerated. It all came across as super douchey, and I went all ragey and screenshotted it all because he did it on the clock. (We are all hourly.)

I then sent all the screenshots to my boss in a text with the message ""what the hell? What an asshole."" She was quick to agree, and days later, she had a meeting with him with HR. Needless to say, now he is totally paranoid and trying to figure who ratted him out. (The meeting also addressed several other infractions as well, such as wasting time at work by socializing too much, and wage theft.)

But now I am starting to think that my boss, and more importantly, HR must think that I'm a crazy stalker. I have vented to my boss several times about my loathing for this guy since all this went down, and I'm afraid that she will start to think I am crazy too.

17,"I live and work in California. On March 1, 2017 I put in a letter of resignation with the company I work for. I decided to use my remaining sick pay and PTO before I left, instead of being cashed out in one lump sum. My initial date that I gave my employer for my last day was March 17, 2017. 

My employer gives PTO at the beginning of the year under the assumption that the employee would be with them throughout the entire year. To me, this is a generous perk allotted to the employees of this company. If I was awarded 2 weeks of PTO in January, and wanted to take a vacation in April for that amount of time I could do so without earning the vacation time. 

However, since I placed my resignation and decided to use my PTO my employer decided to process my resignation early. Even though my official date of release was slated for 3/17/17, they changed my resignation date to 3/7/17. In doing so, my vacation time that I had planned is now prorated to what I accrued from January - March. I lose out on 3 quarters of my PTO.

I feel like they forced me out to save the money that I would have gotten from the use of that PTO and so that they could officially open my position up. Can I fight this for that remaining money that I would have received? In my mind, I had the right to go on vacation regardless of if I wanted to quit later on. As well as take my sick days because I hadn't been in the right state of mind for a while and I needed a break. Even if I did get my PTO in January, if I used it in April, but quit in September, would it be any different because I planned on leaving after I used it in my current situation?  Should I fight this if I can? Since they forced me out early by processing my release before I intended for them to do so, can I collect unemployment?

21,"I need to know if I need to cut my only sibling/family out of my life.

I just need a different unbiased perspective on this.  I'm 24 years old (male) I live with my girlfriend and her daughter who we only get parting, and my brother is 27.  We both grew up with a difficult alcoholic father.  Dad owns a body shop, well off financially, and we have both grew up working in it.  Difference is, my brother took a much stronger liking to the trade than I did.  

Okay there's some backstory

I came to help my dad at his shop last summer.  About 8 months prior to that, in a drunk rage cornered me with a very large knife, threatened my life and told me I wouldn't disrespect his house anymore (i admit, I was a bit messy from time to time, dads also an con on a 7 year stint in the 80s so everything comes back to respect).  He eventually went back upstairs and I took the hell off, we didn't speak for about 6 months.   We made up like usual, and after an employee announced retirement he asked me to come help out.  Mind you, I'm degree-less and trade-less.  Factory jobs and vehicle detailing have been my gig since 18.  Well when I went back I didn't realize he was drinking still.  After about a month he would be at work towards the end of the day drunk.  (He's not a pleasant drunk at all if I haven't made that clear yet).  So, I'm kind of trapped at this point and just deal with it because I'm making better money than I have in quite a while.  Eventually he hires someone to fill my position and I don't have to be around him as much, also he's now not drinking at work anymore because he needs this new employee more than they need him.  I accept he's a very troubled soul, and a very bitter man at times, but he does have a big heart, he's just not a very good human to be blunt and fair about it.

My brother is just like my father, without the prior experiences to make him that way.  Father had a very abusive childhood and I mentioned his prison stint above.  Brothers main concern is himself, I hate to use the term narcissistic but it's sadly accurate.  My relationship our whole lives has honestly consisted of him making sure I know he's above me/better than me,  being belittled and harshly criticized over the smallest of things. Hasn't ever really done anything notable for me in times of dire need. (I have been homeless a few times). I give him rides all time time, in the past was eager to do things for him.  Would never receive anything in return and all my favors would always be written off.  Not that I expect anything back so to say, but to be put down if I need something kinda sucks when I would and did do just about anything for him.

Okay, part two. 

Brother comes to work at shop, he's been managing another in a different city so I haven't had to be around him much at all or be bothered by him, it's been nice honestly.  Anyways, he comes to start taking over the shop.  I'm just detailing there until I can find another job.  I have a few I'm waiting on openings on and I'm jumping aboard.  My life is miserable now.  It's affecting my home life and attitude and my girlfriend (future wife, without a doubt).  I hear his comments everyday, and now he's my boss.  X2 the shit situation.  I just feel like I need to get away from them.  It came to a tipping point where I ended up just clocking out and leaving.  I'm done.  I've tried avoiding it and swallowing my tongue too many times now.

I feel like I need to completely cut my brother off, and distance myself from my dad.  I just don't know how, or know if I'm being over dramatic.  I'm not the same as them at all.  I'm so different it's stupid, and they're so much alike.  What do I do about holidays? I love my mom and she's with my dad still sadly.  I'm just stuck in a shit place.  Any advice or words of wisdom would be overly appreciated... 

So sorry for the wall of text.. I feel a little better honestly even if no one reads it.

If I need to add more background details just ask, I'll add them in.

22,"So I've been homeschooled all of my life and, since the beginning of high school, I would usually complete the first couple of weeks work on time and then start to fall behind. I haven't stopped it since. At the beginning of each semester, I promise myself that I won't fall behind again, but I keep doing it. Once I do I tend to let it all slide until due dates are about to hit and then I'm stressed out and my mother is stressed because she bitches at me all the time for not being caught up on my school work. It doesn't help that my teachers always send my mother passive aggressive phone calls about me being behind, while she's at work and dealing with issues of her own.

I in no way am upset at her or anyone else. I'm a senior and I'll be heading to college soon and I don't want this stupid cycle to follow me there because I know it won't be tolerated. I hate myself for this everytime, but time and time again I let it start back.

I can be turning in assignments on schedule one day then have a difficult assignment the next day that stalls me and then makes me procrastinate and anxious. I really really want this to stop because it has affected several parts of my life the past four years, even being held back from playing sports the last two years because of my school work behind far behind.

I'm currently in my second semester of college, and so far I feel like if nothing changes, there's no chance I'll get into medical school. I've completed one biology course (111) with a B and I'm currently taking bio 112 and anatomy and physiology (bio 201). I'm averaging a B in both of those classes as well., and I know it's because of my low test scores.  I put in the study time, but I also have to work full time. I know I'm not one of those naturally smart individuals. I have to study very hard for every class. And I feel like I'm really putting in the work to get A's in these classes. I set aside time to study when I'm not at work. I don't take too high of a class load so I don't overwhelm myself. I'm just honestly a terrible test taker. I feel like I grasp the material well enough and the test doesn't seem hard while I'm taking, then I get it back and it's a C. 
I'm beginning to get really nervous, because the B's in my sciences of all things becomes a trend it's unlikely I'll get into a medical school. 
I'm by no means trying to throw myself a pity party or anything. I don't need reassurance from strangers. I just need advice on how to throughly prepare for tests. What study methods work best? How can I manage my time better? What can I do to raise my grades and keep my grades elevated? 
I know that going into the medical fields, as a physician in particular, you're choosing a career full of increasingly hard tests. The work doesn't scare me. I'm just afraid of failing. How can I improve my test taking skills to help get me through with A's??

30,"As much as I'm confident in social environments, I'm pretty frequently judged for having some bad habits.

Texting is the most tangible example I can think of right now. People frown upon me because I ignore texts or I reply very bluntly. It's a combination of laziness and distraction, but it becomes a problem when I miss out on plans with friends, or I'm asked a favor that I don't get to actually reading until a week later. This happens outside of texting sometimes too, like at school or with friends I don't always feel like chiming in or listening. My mind is always wandering on other things.

On the flipside, I have the complete opposite problem in other situations. I find myself sometimes sending entire paragraphs when I'm heavily involved in a discussion, posting online, or I'm talking with my girlfriend. Even just small talk with her I think I'm pretty quick to my feet, and I'm pretty sure it annoys the fuck out of her to find the entire script of Braveheart in three separate texts in the middle of small talk. To extend this even more selfishly, when I ask someone a favor, my interest immediately spikes and I am quick to their attention. I feel like a prick.

Normally I'd like to use my ADHD as an excuse but that wouldn't make sense because this happens even with my medication. My mind is either out the window or in swift focal magnitude, and it hasn't served me any good.

Most of my job search to date has been filled with rejection letters, but I recently narrowed down my current options to two possibilities that I think I would enjoy (as they both involve traveling).  Unfortunately, my anxiety over choosing the wrong one has almost completely halted my application process on either, and I can't figure out which to apply myself to.

The first option was suggested to me by a friend, and was to do a 1 year masters program at the University of London (most likely SOAS or LSE).  I have never been to Europe before, and I think that the chance to go would be fantastic, and would reportedly be very desirable on my resume for future job searches.  Unfortunately, the lowest cost for tuition alone is several thousand more than I even have in my bank account.  Most of the scholarships that are offered have either closed, or I am not applicable for.  By my calculation, my only option would be to take out a federal loan, of which I have heard horror stories in relation to paying back.  I haven't filed a FAFSA report since I graduated, so I don't even know if I am applicable for one.

The other option would be for me to take an english teaching job in Asia (the program I am looking at is through ICN Teach and Travel).  This would also be a great travel opportunity, but the pay is very poor, and I do not believe that there would be anywhere for me to go past that job.

So she was telling me that she both slept with a co-worker and was bi (something I have no problem with, but had no idea of before).

I want to decide this year what school I'm going to for high school. Because if I decide to come in later cliques have formed and whatever. Currently I go to a homeschool school. We go two days a week and they assign work and then we do it at home. I don't really like it because it's less time at school and more time doing homework. I feel like I thrive more in the opposite situation. It's also a very small school like 100 kids in elementary through high school. So I don't really have a group of people I'm comfortable with and acossiate myself with anyone. My mom also works at aforementioned school and it kinda stresses me out to have a parent watch over me at all times. Even though she doesn't like to admit it she's a helicopter parent constantly fixing my clothes and things of the sort. Also at this school we don't have many class options or a big drama group which is what I'm into. I would love to take French, psychology, and home economics but this school does not offer them. I tried to ask my mom to do them on the side but she forgets and it doesn't happen. I also find myself being lazy with this work method as in not caring how many I miss because I'll have an a anyway. I've despised most of my classes this year and just generally not had much fun. But with public school I lose the freedom. I won't be able to live in the morning on Friday to see a concert, I won't be able to eat fast food for lunch on a Wednesday. I also won't be able to do the college program my state offers. Where you can take college classes in high school and knock out your freshman year of college. I also will miss the few homeschoolers I know. And especially my favorite teacher. I also will have a controlled amount of abscences and stricter dress codes. I can't take as many family trips. I won't have as much free time. I won't be able to do this program thingy my church does. I'll have to wake up early and only get a break on the weekends. And I have to start standardized tests which as a homeschooled I didn't have to do. I also have to get physical education credits or whatever and I'm very non athletic. I'm sorry for this whole rant. I just really need to some advice. I've gone from being really sure of one then flip flopping to the other.

I have trouble relating to other females in general but seem to have no problem befriending men. I've lost so many friendship opportunities because of how blunt I am (when in reality I'm trying to be funny) or because a lot of the girls I've met tend to be a little high maintenance.

I've found that I've never really been attracted to men in any way though, its not the same as when I look at a woman. When I look at a man I see a man. When I look at a woman I see a person I can become romantically/sexually involved with. I'm sometimes hyper sexual with women, its all I'm thinking about lots of the time. 

 I've recently watched some gay porn, and have ejaculated to it but have felt extremely sick and disgusted afterwards. Not the same guilt you get after watching porn. This was like ""ew, I really just did that"" kind of feeling. Idk if it's because gay sex is just kind of taboo and I find that hot? Or if I'm actually gay? 

 I've also have lived with a mother and sister for most of my life, so I'm more feminine. Alot of people say I'm closet homosexual but I just don't see it? Am I giving tells subconsciously that I'm gay?

 It's also worth noting that I was sexually abused multiple times by different people in no relation to eachother when I was much younger. First starting with a black kid named uganda when i was about 5, who bullied me, and would beat me, take me to the bushes and rape me. These memories I repressed til about a year or two ago. After that I was brutally sexually abused by my father at 6 or 7, multiple times, so much so that one of my testicles was permanently damaged from it. The last time was about 9th grade, when my cousin would get me high/really drunk, and would have gay sex with me while I was very inebriated.

 For those wondering, I'm generally a very sad person. I've gone through life with a general emptiness/detachment. Btw I go to therapy so don't bother recommending it.

107,"I feel so stupid. 

I started a new job this week which involves me staying away from home for the week and returning home on weekends. It's a three person team, 1 manager and 2 juniors. 

The manager has been there for about 3 weeks and is new to the area. We got talking and agreed it can be boring and lonely in the digs but the financial benefit makes it worthwhile. 

To me he says we should ALL go to dinner and I agree. 
Later on that day the boss is talking to my colleague and offers him his phone number as he has to go off site and then adds we should swap numbers too. This is not uncommon in my field of work. 

That evening I get a message from the boss asking if I'd prefer dinner or a movie? I think it's odd but I explain it away and plump for dinner. 

We are all in neighbouring accommodation and he offers to drive to the restaurant. Except when I get in the car my other colleague isn't there and now isn't coming, and when I look at my boss he's changed clothes and taken off his wedding ring. 

We go to dinner and my boss is a little flirtatious. He talks about his children, siblings and parents and never his wife. I make a show of talking about how I'm saving for a wedding and the only comment he makes is, ""you're not married yet"". 

I skip a starter and dessert, don't drink any alcohol and grab the bill as soon as it comes to pay it. He makes a spectacle in front of the waiter about being a gentleman and how the ""lady should never pay"". I've got the heebie-jeebies and just want to go home so just play along. When we are finally back on site I shove some cash at him, sprint for the door and essentially shut it in his face. 

The next day my colleague said he never knew about dinner and is now super suspicious of me. Our boss hangs around all day and when his phone rings ""sweetheart"" comes up and he's clearly talking to a woman. 

Other than this it has been a nice place to work and I'm earning 25% more but I don't think I can keep working with this guy. I keep wondering if I'm reading too much into it and second guessing myself.

However, I spend a lot of time on the computer and the house isn't very large, if I mention her actions at all to anyone and she hears me, she gets extremely upset. The other day she broke a bunch of glass in the tub and I mentioned it to a friend and she got extremely upset with me just for saying it. Tonight, I mentioned she was naked in the main room, and she again got furious.

It feels like if I mention any of her actions, she gets irrationally upset.

115,"Tldr: physics


I'd like to start off with a little about me. As of writing this, I am 19 years of age and am a male. In university studying Theoretical Astrophysics. I'm a very happy person. I love to play video games and I love martial arts, I have done a variety over the years including karate, Muay Thai and Iranian wrestling.


I have a family who loves me deeply, I'm not in a relationship but am in love with my best friend and she knows it. She's honestly the most beautiful person to walk this earth. Inside and out. And she knows me more than any other person ever has or will. I can't even come up with the words to describe how absolutely amazing she is


I have the greatest group of friends a guy could ever ask for, they're like my second family, a bunch of 6 guys who have been on the most amazing/hilarious adventures with me and cherish every moment I spend with them. We don't smoke or do drugs. Also, I don't do alcohol. Never have 

As you can see, I have a VERY happy life and everything for me is just perfection. I also understand that this is rare so I'm prepared to get allot of hate from people saying I'm not grateful etc..


I absolutely LOVE what I study, physics has been the most fascinating thing to me since ever (excluding my best friend). I love everything to do with Quantum and alternate dimensions and time. All that theoretical stuff hahaha


I spend allot of my time having very philosophical and deep thinking sessions with myself (mostly to and from uni because I have to ride a train for over 45mins each way) and have had some ideas about death and consciousness. None of these have been proven but here is my perspective on it.


Firstly, I am not afraid of death. I know that everybody dies at some point of their life, and I don't understand the point in grieving over the death of someone close. I've had people close to me die but I never grieved for them since my perspective on this is very very different go everybody else's.


The way I see life/death is like a transitional phase between dimensions and realms that go further. I've spent allot of time researching and studying the 4th dimension, the time dimension. And came to a realisation that, because the 4th dimension exists. Everything that has happened and everything that ever will, within the realm of time, is scripted. 


For clarification. A being who lives in the 4th dimension, perceives time differently to how we do. We only experience time in ""slices"" at a time, like we experience time in seconds. Once a second is over, we move onto the next. And so on. We cannot fast forward or reverse this since we are only beings in the 3rd dimension. However, if we were in the 4th dimension. We would be able to freely age (forwards or backward) at our own free will. We will also see time as a long tube where we can see everything ahead of us and behind (time wise) 


So in my conclusion, everything is set in stone ever since the big bang. Every atom in existence has it's own ""Destiny"". I also believe that the events that triggered the big bang happened outside of our dimension, which is why nothing existed until then. Because an external force or energy has been applied to our universe causing to lose its ""stationary"" state.


I went a bit off tangent sorry, so to go bAck to my main point which was about me committing suicide. It is because I have a huge curiosity for what happens after death. Where does our consciousness go. I know that the atoms that make up who I am will return to the universe. Which is where I borrowed them from. But what happens to our consciousness? I am almost certain that we will transition to another universe, so certain that I'll bet my life on it (pun intended)


 I think death is a beautiful thing, which seems to be taboo for most. It's a way of achieving the ultimate enlightenment, ridding ourselves with our desire for small pretty things such as money or emotions, once I'm dead, none of this will matter anymore. Since we have severed ties from this universe. 


The only thing stopping me is my best friend. I care about her more than anything else in the world (and all others) and I just know that once I talk to her about this, she'll understand and respect my decision. But I also know that she will be in allot of pain because of this. And pain is the last thing I'd want to wish on her. I can't even bare the idea of her being in pain because of me and am torn between my love for physics and my best friend. Also congratulations on making it this far, for you have read my whole essay even though it's full of grammatical errors and such. 


I just don't know what to do. I know allot of you are going to say that there is no need to rush things, my time will come. But I am fully aware that I'll have to go through allot of hardships and emotional obstacles in life. But for what reason? I'm going to die anyway, and so will you. And after you do. EVERYTHING that you did in this life will disappear along with your consciousness. The car you worked hard to be able to afford is going to be sold off to someone else, house, to the bank, and all other personal belonging are going to be burned or as sentimental objects for people around you. I'm having trouble grasping the meaning of life.


To wrap things up, I can't decide weather to stay or go. And am having trouble finding a real meaning in life. 


All advice will be much appreciated and be taken account, what you say could end or save someone's life (Hahahaha it's not a big a deal as you think)

122,"I just turned 18 years old and I'm currently working as a Audiovisual Mediadesigner in a Advertisement Agency, this was always my dreamjob and I'm really lucky that I got that job since I have one of the worst educations you can get in my country since I only went to school for 9 years. 

Me and 2 other guys started a fun project 2 years ago and it slowly started to expand into more and more serious business. 

Right now I'm on the point where I have to decide if I want to commit to it fully and move there or leave it. Its 1500Km away from where I currently live so I would have to leave my family,  my great girlfriend and friends.. 

The business has really good chances to get really big, however It could always also just fail. And then I wouldnt really have anything. It's also just gonna work if I move there.

I would have to take a big risk but also with a big price if it works out, as I already mentioned, there is really big potential in the company we are building up and I mean how cool is it to start a huuge company with 18 years. 

Im thinking about this for 3 weeks now already and I can not come to a conclusion and hope that anyone has suggestions, thoughts about this.

They have no carpet and when he bangs on the table my entire ceiling acts like a drum and amplify's the noise to incredibly annoying volumes.

I work at night so i sleep during the day and i have not gotten a full nights sleep in weeks. My landlord is a useless idiot either wont or cant do anything about it. Ive called the police but apparently its not loud enough for justify giving him a fine. And even though he does it for hours at a time they wont do anything about it.

137,"I've been studying in city A for one semester, studying psychology. I've been commuting but it's very stressful so I want to move. I wanted to transfer to city B, where the uni is better, I like the city, AND several of my friends and my boyfriend live. The two are about an hour train ride apart, so I can visit regularly, but turns out I can't transfer, because city B's university doesn't accept psych students in higher semesters. I can't apply for the same major again either (otherwise I would have gladly redone the first semesters).

So basically I'm going to move to a city I dislike that offers me nothing. I don't enjoy the place itself, I have no friends there (most of the people in my classes are significantly older than me, and my uni sucks bad enough to have barely any extracurricular activities at all). I already struggle with loneliness now, too, so I'm genuinely scared of what living there will do to me if I don't somehow make myself feel at home fast.

I don't know what to do. Transferring would have been a nearly optimal solution, but I've contacted uni B about it and made sure there's absolutely no way. Seems like I'll be stuck here for two and a half years (bachelor's degree in Germany). Would living in some sort of student dorm help?

142,"Dear reddit. 
Backstory: 

* Be me: 18, male, wannabe software developer, 

* My bother finished university about a year and a half ago; he stayed there for a year after graduating and has been living with us (me, mum &amp; dad) for about half a year now.  He is very isolated and doesn’t talk/socialise much with the family. He doesn’t like it here and is just waiting to move back as soon as he can. He spends his days playing “overmeme” with friends online. 

* Mum was (might still be, unsure) very depressed at one point. 

* Dad is a vet (not the animal kind) and works in IT.

* Parent’s don’t really have any friends. Dad pays the bills, mum cooks and cleans, end the day with some bad TV. Rinse and repeat…

Over the years me and my mum have grown closer. She has always been the one to come and get me when I got anxious in school, talk through my worries etc. whereas me and my dad haven’t really found much to bond over – dad and brother watch *sportsball* together sometimes but that about sums up their relationship. With my brother wanting to move out ASAP (think he moves in July), and me looking for junior development positions (none of which are near by) I worry about my parents. There has been talk of my mum getting a job for years, but nothing has ever come of it. She’s never actually applied anywhere.  She is constantly complaining about the house, all the mess and how no-one “sees” or “appreciates” her. And since I am the closes thing she has to a friend, of-course I’m the one that gets the brunt of that. Me and my mum talk a fair amount about me moving out and 9 time out of 10 the topic is about this or that technology/technique I need to know before applying to certain jobs. But whenever we discuss her opinions or worries, it’s always about me leaving her. And I always have to be the one to say “yeah, but we can’t have that stop me from moving forward in life can we?” which is nearly always followed by a “I suppose, not” followed by silence until one of us thinks on a new topic. I feel like I’m under a lot of pressure, I don’t want my mum to dwindle down into deep lonely depression, but I also want to move out get my head straight and find out what I want from life. It's also maybe important that I only really have one friend, and he's quite an assh0le. So my mum is also probably the closes thing I have to a true friend as well (which is quite worrying to me).

So this post doesn’t really seem to have much of a point. I guess I just want your opinion on what I should do if anything.
Thanks.

143,"I work in a caring profession. I thought maybe feeling this way would pass but it hasn't (it's been building up for maybe 2 years tbh), although I have to say it isn't a constant state of mind, it comes in phases. I've considered talking to my clinical supervisor (like a counselor provided by employer), but I've seen what's happened to other people who have done so and it's really putting me off. People who have told have been forced to change role for a time (to something boring and unfulfilling) and when they are back to their normal role they are watched like a hawk. Every time they are off sick they're scrutinized, management automatically assume they are lying (because apparently depressed people can't get flu?!). I know that this is the case as a manger myself, so am party to the conversations. Unfortunately I know that the reason for their scrutiny is not from care for the individual, but from a 'cover your back' mentality. In various ways a culture has emerged (or maybe it's always been there, I don't know) that is not conducive for openness. Our work can be very emotionally demanding, yet no-one, and I mean NO-ONE, talks about that in any real way (until it's reached a point of depression - which isn't necessarily due to the work). Everyone is fine...apparently. Not fazed by the work at all, ever.  

Logically I know I should probably tell them, but I fear it will actually just make it worse. I feel conflicted because on the one hand I am worried they'll penalize me in terms of career progression, but then the way I feel makes me just want to quit anyways.

I have struggled with mental illness and addiction my whole life, but I've never hurt anyone and I've never done anything that would make me considered a threat to any individual or the community. Since I've moved back I have been harassed by the police constantly. There are 3 officers on duty at all times in a town that is 3 square miles, so they have nothing to do. They sit directly outside of our house constantly. There is almost always an officer within 100 feet off our property just sitting and watching. They follow me almost everywhere i go. If I go to get dinner or a beer they are waiting to follow me home still. They have pulled my cousin's, auntie, and friends over after they've left our house and searched their vehicles (they found a small amount of pot on one of my cousins once so it's not like doing this has been a success for them or anything), when they aren't sitting directly in front of the house they are driving up and down the street over and over and idle past my house.

153,"Little background on me: I'm  introverted, suck at social interactions, and I'm awkward as all get out.

Also, I apologize, this ended up longer than I thought it would.

Sooo....I'm a pharmacy technician that works in a pharmacy inside a grocery store. We and the regular store team share a break room, and I commonly have to run things like paperwork, cardboard to be compacted, etc to the ""back"" of the store.
 
So even though I spend most of my day in our ""monkey cage"" I run into members of the regular store team semi-frequently. 

A couple months after I started, a bagger, ""Brennen"" started going a little more out of his way to say hi or whatever.

Fast forward a few more months, he's switched to some position that keeps him in the back more, so I see him more often. He starts actual conversations now, he seems cool enough, so whatever.

I obviously keep my husband updated on how my days go, and tell him about Brennen. He says I should tell him I'm married, which I don't take seriously. I'm the heaviest I've ever been, have 0 self esteem, and this guy hasn't said or done anything blatantly flirty.

Until, he freaking stops me in the hallway one day and the conversation goes somewhere along these lines:
""Hey, so what are you doing Thursday?""

(Thinks to self: Fuck, did he really just ask that? My husband was right. Dammit. I hate this) ""Ha. Ummm....why?""

""Because I was thinking of buying you lunch at [insert name of fancy, snooty wine shop/restaurant that charges $12 for a salad and barely gives you any food]""

(Thinking to self again: he has somehow missed my ring, and I'm sure I've mentioned my husband before.)

I take a few seconds, then,
""Yeeeaaaahhhh, I'm married, I'm flattered really, thank you, I appreciate it, but I'm married""

He's obviously embarrassed makes some joke I barely remember that may have had a bit of truth based sass in it, I say see you later, and I walk away.

So my problem, I see him enough in passing that I don't want things to be weird. And like I said, he's pretty cool to talk to, and it's nice to have someone outside of the pharmacy to talk to nonpharmacy things about. 

How do I let him know that there's no reason to be weird or awkward about it, I'd still like to be working friends, and we just move past it? 
I'd also like to apologize if I somehow did something to make him think I was reciprocating feelings. I'm super bad at social interactions, and have apparently done this is  the past. I've worked on being more aware of how my actions and words are perceived, but there's still a chance I did that.

154,"(sadly due to forum rules I cannot state my real first name.. so I'll add random characters to it.)

So since my teen years, I registered to school with my birth name and had my teachers/professors call me by the birth name, let's call it *xRahulx*, but I always introduced myself as *xRayx* to my peers and anyone else. The reason being is, on paper, my foreign name was often mispronounced and every time it annoyed me. I know its not anyone's fault. I just hated the debauchery.  

Anyways, I just got a job offer out of college and now I don't know if I should be going by *xRahulx* or by *xRayx*. I've always kept it separate from work and play, but since I know how work politics work, I feel as if I should just go by *xRayx*, for ease and higher acceptability. Since I am born to immigrant parents, I know how my name looks, and I don't want to experience any shortcomings. 

The biggest reason why this is difficult for me is because my nickname is NOT a shortened version of my birth name. So its NOT like Johnathan is Jonny or Jon.. its different and I don't know how that will be taken in a professional environment.

The thing is I started working a new job a couple months ago (originally to make money to move), and the situation now means I could potentially work here and not move with him, so I can avoid the whole ""leaving a job before a year"" issue. 

I'm still considering each option. I would prefer living with him because I know he'll be VERY busy and I'm not sure I'm okay with only seeing him once a week/every other week or whatever winds up happening. I think it would stress the relationship a lot more than if I lived with him and he was busy all the time, because I'm fine with just presence more than attention. He's also NOT much of a text/call type so I imagine it would legitimately be mostly only talking with him when I see him in person. 

But maybe I'm mistaken in thinking that moving in with him would be less stress. I don't want to hurt my career record if it won't actually ease anything if I lived with him. And I could potentially move in after a ~1 year at this job. I'm just not sure what that will entail and if I can handle it for that time period. 

Also worth noting that so far I do really like this job and I know if I leave before a year I HAVE to stay at the next job at least 2+ years so I don't look like a job hopper. 

Lots of factors, I know, any advice? ",10Mar2017,3
157,"Hi Reddit,

I am recently married and I am having a hard time dealing with my in laws and I need some advice about how to not care, or distance myself from the situation.

For context, I met my wife through her sister (I'll call her ""sister"") who set us up. Sister was really cool with me at the time and we were friends. Unfortunately my wife's mom is crazy and refused to help with our wedding or talk to my parents in any way. My mom in law also is verbally abusive and manipulative and hates sisters husband and is always talking shit about him (he is not an incredible guy, but at least he loves her). We have always stood up for them, etc.

Now my sister in law has decided to talk a whole tirade of shit about me to my wife. Saying that I curse a lot, that she only does what I want to do (I am really careful that this is NOT the case), and that I am a bad influence. I work hard 9-5, I am a college graduate, and I am applying to medical school in June with a very very good chance of getting in. Occasionally I smoke weed but sisters husband is a hardcore pill addict. Also, they are Mormon, and we have left the church so she talks shit on me for that, despite the fact that we just don't believe in it at all. 

How do I not care about this? It just pisses me off? Should I text my sister in law and tell her off? 

Thank you in advance ",10Mar2017,1

I'm a university student in my second year who has been suffering from depression for around 3-4 years. Long story short, it has gotten to the point where I don't leave the house for days at a time, often confined to my room, only leaving to make food and occasionally hang out with my housemates.

I recently missed a deadline and it has suddenly woken me up to the fact that I'm letting the best years of my life completely pass me by. As I have very few friends due to isolating myself completely for a very long time, I'm struggling to figure out how to put together a healthy social life.

161,"I LOVED this job until about 4 weeks ago, so I was willing to show them some leniency. Last month they wrote me a reimbursement check that bounced. They implied it would be sent out with this months checks - So I bitterly waited. It was not, but they did cover my charge-back fee. In the meantime, some policy changes had me hand in my resignation (I work with special needs kids) The main one being It used to be a requirement that the kids be non-violent to be in this program. Not anymore and I have the bruises to show for it.

172,"I'm 29 years old. I am a former Army Ranger with a BA in Criminology, and no internships to speak of. I didn't pursue any internships because my general plan was this: to work for a security contracting firm like Academi (formerly Blackwater) for a year or two, make a boatload of cash, and then eventually make my way over to the FBI or some other federal job. I figured with my background as a Ranger, I would be a shoo-in for the FBI or at the very least some police department.

I graduated college in May of 2015 and have essentially been living at home since then. I didn't look for work right away as I wanted to do some traveling when I was done, and didn't want people reaching out to me while abroad. When I got back from Europe in October '15, I started applying to contracting firms. Right away one of them expressed interest, and we went from there. In January '16 I was told it would take 3-12 months to obtain a security clearance for the program. I got a job as a security guard in D.C. for something to do in the meantime.

The months rolled by, and still no clearance. I was told to be patient, and that they were looking into it. I figured nothing of it because it was still within the one year time frame I was given. Being a security guard was pretty lame, so I quit that job to head to Asia for a month. I let my prospective employer know of my travel plans and headed out in November, hoping that by the time I got back in December, or soon thereafter, I would have a clearance.

I have been back for three months now, and it is becoming increasingly clear that I am not going to get this job. It has been well over a year, and they just keep telling me that they're looking into it. Also, I anticipated doing this as a single guy, but I've recently met a girl that I am crazy about. I am starting to wonder if I want the security contracting job at all, as it would have me out of the country for months at a time which would likely kill any hopes for a relationship with her. As great as things between us have been so far, within a couple days of meeting her I began to feel this horrible anxiety. It's like I am finally feeling the weight of my current circumstances, and I am afraid I am going to lose her.

I am 29 years old, living at home, and unemployed. All of my friends that I went to school with are getting jobs at places like Deloitte, and things are looking up for them. I can go ahead and start applying to places like the FBI, but it will likely take another year for something like that to come to fruition, and I'd rather not become a security guard again while I wait. I definitely do not want to continue living at home for much longer. **I was looking at getting into some entry level consulting, however my GPA is abysmal (2.96), and as I said: no internships. Am I deluded to think I could possibly have a chance of getting a junior consulting job at somewhere like Booz Allen?

177,"Please excuse the length of this - but i really hope someone takes the time to read this as I am not coping very well.

Ever since my brother (i am his younger sister by a couple of years) of currently 30 years old left the Army (a number of years ago), he has has difficulty holding down a job. He refuses to work as he is a big conspiracist and 'can't be a slave', and asks the family for money all the time. this has been going on for a very long time. it was a running joke of how he would get a job, and he would quite within a few weeks.

none of us can afford to help him, yet he repeatedly harasses everyone for money, when we say no and that he needs to earn his own money, he lashes out saying we don't understand him and that we are his family and we are supposed to help him. we have enabled him in the past by giving him money that we can’t afford to give - it never comes back to us, despite him saying it will. (we all know he can never pay it back as he has no source of income, yet he still lies about giving it back 'on Monday’.)

it is getting progressively worse since he hit 30 - what is causing me a great deal of anguish and stress, is he will send me weekly/fortnightly messages telling me to give him money - the reasons change - he is in a 'bad way', he hasn't eaten, he's going to hurt himself, he's going to hurt someone, telling me to do something. he lives with his pregnant girlfriend about to give birth, and her parents (he has a child from a previous relationship he can’t afford to pay for) so I find it very difficult to believe when he says he hasn’t eaten for a few days. i am coming to the conclusion he emotionally manipulating us all. we have all said we will support him emotionally not financially, and we tried to encourage him to seek help for what we believe to be a mental disorder/clinical depression affecting his ability to work and function but he refused after one visit to the doctor, and said he doesn’t agree with anti-depressants, therapy etc and said he was too far down the rabbit hole, and that no one can help him - this terrified me. however when he and his girlfriend visit my mother, he tells her everything this fine and doesn't say these worrying things to her. he does still ask her for money though - knowing full well she is broke after my father left her.

i am exhausted and sick with worry and stress that he will actually hurt someone/himself - is he being serious when he says this? he’s made threats in the past, and nothing ever happens. at best, is this how it’s going to be for the rest of our lives? My father messaged him, and my brother’s girlfriend said it’s our responsibility to give him money/help him, so now i feel she is encouraging the behaviour and that’s giving me a whole new set of worries. I don’t know if all of this stems from his experiences during service in Iraq (he won’t see a therapist about this)

i have blocked his number, and i know that sounds incredibly selfish, but i find it incredibly hard to function with the guilt and the worry when he contacts me. i can’t do it anymore. I am working full time, studying and have a flat, a life to pay for - I just don’t have the emotional resource anymore and i feel terribly guilty, to the point where i am becoming depressed myself.

what do i do? how can we help him if he won’t help himself? how do i stop him from hurting somebody? he is the least violent person i have ever met, and i don’t think he’s ever even been in a fight, but i am still terrified that he is suddenly saying these things. has anyone else had this kind of experience with a sibling?

187,"So, here goes:

2 weeks ago I got myself a part time job. I'm 18 years of age (male) and a full time student; turning 19 in 4 months yet this is still my first ever job. Now, my parents have decided that they would like to take a religious holiday for 2 weeks during the Easter holiday. That's in about 2 weeks. 

Since I just got this job 2 weeks ago, I am still on a probationary period and therefore I asked my boss if he would deny my vacation request, and he did. He wrote a written letter to my parents informing them of the reason I cannot take the 2 weeks off.

Some backstory on why I asked my boss to deny the vacation request: 

My family is being evicted from our house sometime this month, we have no idea when. My younger brother has GCSEs/Finals coming up in April. I am planning to go to university this September and I would like to sort everything out for that. Considering these things; my brothers and I have been telling my parents that it's not a good idea to go on holiday now. Nevertheless; my dad is adament on going and has not cancelled the trip. 

As he's not going to cancel the trip and my boss has denied my vacation request, there's a clash between the 2 of them and now my family is telling me to leave my job. I like this job already because it's based around computers and that's the field I'm currently studying. I'm also planning on studying Computer Science at university. Therefore, as well as me liking this job, it's also quite important to me as it is going to help me gain a lot of experience for the technical aspects of the course.

Another thing, My family (Mum, Brothers, Uncles, and Aunties) have been berating me to get a job since I was 16. I have been dropping CVs in so many places over those 2 years and everyone rejects me due to my lack of experience. This is the first time I can gain experience and already I am being forced to leave. One thing that pisses me off is that, although my mum and brothers have been berating me to get a job for over 2 years; none of them seem to care that my dad told me to quit. In fact, they are all siding with my dad and not one of them cares about how important this job is to me. Albeit, my brothers were on my side when we were all telling them to delay the holiday until we find a house.

My dad is beyond reasoning with, I came home and told him I can't leave my job because 1) My boss has rejected my 2 weeks leave and 2) My boss has already got me covering for one of the main staff who will be away during the 2 week holiday. My dad simply said: ""I don't care. You're going on this holiday with me. If you lose the job it doesn't matter"". 

So, i'm getting 0 say in this matter when it affects my life a lot. Any advice with this issue reddit or am I screwed?

188,"Last Saturday I was having lunch with friends at a restaurant in my city.  My car was parked directly in front of the restaurant in the shopping center's parking lot (owned by the real estate company, of which this restaurant was a tenant.)

This portion of the parking lot is built in two levels:  an upper and a lower level, with nothing but a retaining wall between them.  There's no barrier to prevent a car from driving off the top level and landing on the bottom.

Which is what happened:  a 90-year-old driver was turning around in the upper lot, backed up a bit too far, tumbled over the edge, flipped over and landed upside-down on top of my car.

My car was totaled by the insurance company, and they're in the process of determining a settlement amount to offer me.  I suspect that amount will not be enough to pay off the loan that I'm still paying on the car.  (I'm three years into paying off the five-year term of the loan.)

She's actually a great dog. My roommate works but maybe 18 hours a week, and that's a generous estimate. He stays up until three in the morning every night and therefore doesn't wake up until noon. None of my business, but when I get home from work (I work nights) most days the dog has peed on the floor, and now it's starting to poop on the floor. He doesn't feed her until sometimes 4 PM. and then I guess he feeds her before he goes to bed (I'm usually in bed or gone so I'm not positive).

208,"So long story short, I've had a very rough couple of years, and that's understating it. I've accepted I'm depressed and there's not enough positivity in motion within my life. Eg. Not exercising, not socialising, not performing hobbies, not taking care of health or appearance etc. 

So, what's a sensible first step as to snapping out of depression or a rut? The whole scenario is a large scale to conquer, I feel like I need a breakdown, step by step guide and generally some motivation to get in the right mind set and do things in a sensible order. 

Any sort of advice is appreciated  ",10Mar2017,1
211,"So to give you the basic rundown, I'm a 23 year old man In the North-East of England who still lives at home. Whilst I love my mother and my kid brother to bits, I feel as though it's getting to the point where I need to stop living off the back of my parent and get my own place. For the past couple of years living at home  has not been great for me personally; Hell, I can't even bring home potential girlfriends since my room is pretty much the size of Harry Potters cupboard.

I work full time for minimum wage (UK) in hospitality which doesn't bring in a great wage but It's something to save and start with.

So I suppose my question is what the hell should I do? The housing market seems to be beyond bad for someone of my age at the moment, but renting a 1 bedroom flat would drain me of a third of my monthly wage (that's not including tax, food, petrol,  furniture I'd need initially etc) but I feel as though it's time for me to take the dive into the real world, so to speak.

If anyone has any knowledge of websites that show you how to budget/handle money effectively/make solid investments I would be grateful. I would be grateful for any advice in general really.

Forgive me if the question seems rambly, but there's only so long you can live with your siblings/parents before you start to have a mental breakdown.

216,"Hello r/Advice!

I have absolutely no idea how to maintain a relationship, and be a cool boyfriend but that's why I'm here :P

So I've been friends with this girl for about 2 months and I have felt so happy around her that I'm planning on asking her out, but I don't know how to.
Do I say that I really want to extend our relationship outside of school (or do I say friendship?) by taking her to go get ice cream (please don't judge me, I didn't want to be the mall guy, so I thought ice cream would be cooler!) over text? Do I say I'm really happy around her and want to make her happy too? And if she says yes, does it mean we're official or do I wait until our first date is over to ask her if she'd like to be my girlfriend? Other than that, I have no idea to be a great boyfriend :P

However on the other hand, if she says no, do I say I understand and that I don't want this to ruin our friendship? How do I handle that? 

Thanks so much Reddit, if I feel like I have a plan and enough responses and confidence, I'll ask her out to ice cream in 2 hours! And I'll update my post with wha she said! (Or do I make a new one?)",10Mar2017,5
219,"Here's the thing: Everything tires me. I'm a 16 years old boy who's about to start his adulthood. I think I'm ready fot it. I want it to start. But everyday since I remember I've been a quiet person, and right now, in mid/high-school, everything tires me. I don't know if I have a slow metabolism or something, but everytime I try to do something, the idea of doing it tires me. In addition, this tiring life is preventing me from doing everything I can. For example, since I was 14 I've been trying to lose some weight because all my life I have been a little overweight and in the last 2 years I tried a lot of times to start doing exercise and start a diet, but I just can't. And with that I just want to show and example, but I could tell a lot more of this.

224,"Long story short - I'm going to be moving to a new city for work in a few months time, tryin to decide whether to get a room in a shared house or get my own place.

So with a bit more back story - currently, I live in a shared house with 4 other people. Its been great, apart from clashes with one particular person and the general inconvenience of sharing the communal areas. So I'm looking at flats/houses just for me, realising that I can get my own bathroom (I can keep my toothbrush in the bathroom rather than having to keep it in my room cause I don't know which sink will be free when I need to use it), I can have more than half a drawer in the freezer so I can actually do all the cooking I want, I can sit naked on the sofa etc etc. 

Now I'll be crazy busy with work, and I plan on joining plenty of local activities to build up a social life in this new place, but I'm concerned that by choosing to live alone, I run the risk of becoming socially isolated. And it could be that if I chose to share a house again I'll meet my new best friends and my experience there may be far better than my current living situation... or it could be ten times worse. I'll save a bit of money by sharing, but I have budgeted to allow myself to be living alone. 

So how do I decide? I feel like I'm trying to make a decision based on a lot of 'what ifs?' which I know isn't sensible... it is just that both ways are based on what if statements. ",10Mar2017,1

So,to introduce myself,my name is Peter(Petar),i'm from a not so large country named Serbia(more specifically the town of Niš),i'm 16 and i have quite the dillema that im hoping reddit can help me with
I'm currently going to high school(Cullinary school) and to be totaly honest,im not quite a great chef,i'm skilled and smart but i don't know any recipes,i have to read everything and i can't remember what the teacher says,but i'm trying atleast :D,i never left Serbia that much,a couple of times to Montenegro,once in Tunisia,and most recently,and the most important part to this story,i went to London,my grandma lives there so we decided to visit for the entirety of August of 2016,it was nice,i liked it,and the main thing,i met a good friend of my grandma's,who just so happens to be a chef,the main chef as of recently,and we talked a little about am i planing to work soon and all that,but nothing came of that then,i went again for New Years,and then we talked a little more seriously about it,and he offered me to work with him for this summer,he said he would notify me about the details,fast forward to about a month ago,my grandma came to visit us in Serbia here,just for a short while,and she said that i should send him a message about the job because he's the main chef now and a possition is going to open at the start of the summer break this June,and at the moment i thought,yea great,let's do it,he said for me to call again to talk about it more and to make it official,and here is where thing get tricky
I was sitting with my very good friend at like a bar type place and we started talking,about all sorts of things,about life,about basketball(we used to train together but he quit i continued training(keep that in mind))and we got to me going of to work for the summer,and we were talking and talking and we came to the conclusion that it might not be such a great idea to go,here's the thought process
These are my ""golden years"",and as cheesy as that might sound,it's true,i think about my childhood so far,and there's not much to it,basketball in the neighbourhood,drinking a bit of beer with the mates(it's perfectly acceptable to drink with 16 here even thou it's ""illegal"") and those kinds of things,but not a lot of stories,stories that i would remember my whole life,there are some,but not many,and my thinking is that i want to:
A:Have fun while i still can,make memories,fuck around and that kind of thing,maybe it's a little to soon to start working,especially for 3 months(the whole summer)
B:I'm just starting to improve in my basketball skills and i dont want a year of training to kind of be negated by me not training for 3 months(i'm not that good to begin with)
C:There's always next year,maybe i can work then
Not to make this story any longer,that's about it
Would really apriciate some advice,opinions and even questions i will answer all of them,but im really not sure what to do

226,"Hi all! Im 18 and plan on going to college for the 2017 fall semester. Currently I have 3 options lined up.
1. State University. 
This is a very good school, and it's incredibly cheap. I have family living in the town that it is located in, and an entire house waiting for me rent free if I choose to accept. The 2 biggest issues that I currently have with it are 1, I have never really liked the state. The scenery is totally unappealing, the weather (especially winter) is terrible and the state is incredibly unpopulated, making the towns small and the spaces in-between cities multiple hours apart. 2. I am currently in a long distance relationship with someone from another (very distant) state that happens to have a University 20 minutes away from it... and that leads to option 2,
2. Out of state University. 
The location and scenery are everything I could have asked for. My type of weather, environment and seasons. This is definitely my first choice of college and having my significant other so close is another huge bonus. The University is very nice and has every major I could hope for. The only problem is the cost. I would realistically have to take out a $40,000 student lone to afford out of state tuition for a year with the price dropping to $14,000 after my first year. I come from a lower- middle class family meaning I have no help paying for college. The cost listed above is with student aid calculated in. Option 3 is very similar to 2
3. Out of state University -pt2.
This is in a neighboring state to option 2. Again, perfect weather, scenery and seasons. Great school, awesome majors, and within a days drive of my SO. The problem again is expense... the exact same cost as option 2. 

Im looking for advice. I needed a new pair of eyes to evaluate my situation and possibly suggest what they would do. I understand logically that option one makes sense. A full D-1 university for practicality nothing, an entire house for me/ friends, and good majors. But the thought of telling my SO that we are going to have to wait another year before we can see each other more than a few times a year sorta breaks my heart. 
•I plan on majoring in Aeronautical engineering, or astronomy( fairly well paying professions if I can land a job.)


Thank you so much for any input! I am very lucky to have these choices in front of me, not all are so fortunate. ",10Mar2017,1
227,"Hello
A little bit about me. 
I'm 19 studying to be an electrician which I have no interest in. I'm unmotivated, tired all the time, I don't see a point in life, I don't feel suicidal but I don't exactly fear death or want a long life. Everything seems like a hastle it even takes me half hour to work up the energy to get out of bed. I'm very anti social I have 2 friends I talk to regularly other than that I struggle to start a conversation with anyone.
Im living with my dad who is forcing this electrical apprenticeship on me, he won't leave me alone about it, he will text me, everytime we see each other he will lecture me. Which I wouldn't have too much of a problem with I just hate the fact I'll be locked in for 3 years. I want to leave my cold wet country. I feel like I'm imprisoned with no escape. 
I always hear my dad talk shit about me behind my back and when I tell him I want a gap year to work/travel he just says you not having a gap year to laze around you need to grow up.
I just don't know what to do to improve myself anymore. I hated all subjects in school I was a mute all the way through it. I just feel empty and I don't know what to do. 
I do sport, but when I'm not there I just find ways to waste time. My dad blames everything on me being addicted to the computer when really I'm unmotivated and addicted to wasting time.
I'm looking for a part time job but my dad just wants me to volunteer for work experience at an electricians. 
I understand my dad can't control my life but I have no other plans or career options. I'm just empty.
We got into an argument and I told him to fuck off so he got really upset and I apologized. He is just trying to think what's best for me, but I just don't know what to do!

(pressed same floor button while having a conversation) he said oh hey where have u been? and she said hi i went to downtown and he said oh with whom? and she said with her friend. then the elevator stopped at 6th floor where both of them took off and went to same house. she could be a friend of that family, an exchange student, traveling my country and did at that house or else, i dont know for sure; which means i am not sure she stays there from now on or just for days or months. im not worried but not also being curious and  not being supicious. but u know... things can happen at anyplace at any time... should i just visit the house tmrw any say hello , just to get to know each other?? or wait  and ask her later when i see her again at the elevator? or am i overreacting?",10Mar2017,1
232,"To keep this fairly short, I have a handful of hobbies in which I have interest in but aren't very passionate about. For example, I used to draw a lot a couple years ago, though I was never stunningly good, and I used to be proud of myself whenever I finished something even if it wasn't my best. Now I no longer have the drive. When I look at wonderful art, I get a sudden inspiration to draw but once I get my tablet out (mostly digital artist) I lose my motivation, have a giant lack of ideas, and just am not happy with what I churn out so I never finish the drawing.

Another example is photography and videography. I was in a photography class for the last three years of high school where I was praised by my teachers for my work. As soon as I graduated, my passion for it began to diminish and I don't ever feel like making myself get up to take pictures, even if I do have an idea.

This happens also with my interests in video gaming(used to be a huge gamer, can barely sit for longer than an hour now), filmography(love expanding on the creative aspects of films but often enough don't feel like actually watching the movie first), and makeup(I used to love doing, wanted to start a youtube channel, wanted to buy all the new products, etc. Now I wear it only occasionally and don't get as excited). 

I have no clue what to do because I feel that I have a large range of interests and being passionate in at least one should be possible. I'm only 18 and in the second semester of my freshman year in college, so I feel like it's a bit early in my life to lose all interests. At the same time, between work/school and a tight budget, I don't have the time to explore any new activities. Any ideas?",10Mar2017,1

236,"I'm a not so social guy in 9th grade (15yo) and I've had this friend since 7th grade who has a very similar sense of humor. In the beginning he was a cool guy but he's slowly turned into an absolute asshole.

He verbally harasses and abuses me on a daily basis, he calls me cuck, pussy and idiot whenever I screw up some social interaction and he constantly calls me retarded if I make a mistake. I don't think he's ever given someone a compliment. Several times he's called me ugly and said that I look like a caveman. 

Besides that he never accepts defeat or that he's wrong. If he gets a fact wrong, it was a joke and I'm retarded for not getting it, if he's wrong in a discussion he never accepts that he's wrong, he buries himself in his original opinions and eventually calls everyone not supporting him idiots. 

He also blames others for everything, most of the time he blames me since I'm easy to blame. 

Sometimes when someone talks to me or asks me something he'll just step right into the conversation and say that I'm socially inept and scared of people so I'm awkward to talk to. He has no reason to do it. I think he just wants to show how much better he is. 

When he's hungry or hasn't slept well he gets irritated. When he's irritated he begins punching and kicking me. It fucking hurts and he tells me in weak for saying that it hurts. He also says he should be allowed to hurt me since I'm irritating him. 

I've been wanting to get rid of him for a while now but for some reason I'm unable to. Today I tried to ignore him when he was running around the classroom chasing his friend but eventually he came up behind me and pushed me for some reason. I lost it and told him to fuck off and go away and act like a normal human being. He told me he's normal and I'm a socially awkward idiot who just sits in the corner and cries like the cuck that I am.

Previously he's taunted me and joked about me being depressed. I was. 

When I confronted him on his aggressiveness and rudeness he told me he doesn't have to be nice, it's a choice he himself makes. 

Please help. I'm desperate...

The head was still attached however there was a rag over it, but I could still make out the shape of the face- that really bothered me. The vagina was still there, the only part which wasn't ""skinned"" and that brought in a reality check that this was a person with a life, and now they're a hunk of meat like in a butcher shop. I've been nauseous all day. I am looking forward to my career and am aware of the situations I will deal with (I am currently a caregiver and have faced many challenges with cleaning up feces/vomit, seeing genitals, bathing them, feeding them etc) but I have yet to deal with death. Especially when the skin has been removed and I'm practically putting a probe into a corpse. I can't look at food in general without wanting to vomit, and meat makes me want to pass out.
