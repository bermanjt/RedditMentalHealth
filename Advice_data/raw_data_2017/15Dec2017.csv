1,"I've been trying to eliminate porn in my life for a variety of reasons, none of which are important here.

I find that the porn that I end up searching for is either mom/son porn, or male/male/female. (Dp, no homosexuality). Here's the thing. I've never seen my mother naked, never been inappropriately touched or advanced on by her, no flirting, nothing. I'm in no way attracted to her AT ALL. 100% normal mother /son relationship. And yet, the porn does it for me. Same with the mmf stuff. Hard as diamonds when I watch the porn, but in the two occasions where it wound have been possible in real life, I was loathe to let another man touch my wife. Why does porn excite me that would disgust me in real life? It's not so much frightening as just baffling to me. I'd love to know if anyone can shed light on this. ",15Dec2017,1
3,"A little backstory: I started a new job just about exactly 2 months ago. So far, I like it besides the majority of managers. We have a LOT of managers where I work. I'm a cashier, and it's an ok job where I have to interact a lot with these 4 managers.

One of them recently has started always wanting to talk to me, and so on. The other day he asked me on a date and being my socially awkward and anxious self I replied with ""uh, i don't know, I have to go help someone"" and walked away. 5 mins later he basically begged me for my number and it was in front of like 7 customers all watching me and I felt so uncomfortable and trapped so I gave him it. He texted me and I never replied, and deleted the message. I'm 99% sure I've mentioned my BF before while talking to him. Anyway, lately he's been calling me cute, and so on and I just ignore it. It makes me uncomfortable. 

Today at work was the first time I saw him since he asked for my number. He was rude to me, kept bossing me around, said ""you need to SMILE!!!!!"" like 7 times in an hour, and was just being demanding and uncomfortable and rude. I told my bf, of course, and he was enraged.

Now he's texting me nonstop trying to get all the details about this guy to get him fired. He said if I don't tell the highest up manager I'm being sexually harassed that he'll do it. He wants to find all his social media and won't stop asking me details about him. I honestly don't even know the guys name, his name tag is ripped in half. I don't want him to lose his job especially since he's been there years and I don't want problems. I keep telling my bf to stop, that i'll handle this on my own and if he's demanding and/or flirty again that I'll tell him to stop and if it doesn't I'll tell the store manager. Wtf do I do... I feel like I should have never told him. It's extremely uncomfortable how he talks to me, and today I believe he was angry I never replied so he was being extremely demanding, mean, and so on. I guess maybe I'm ranting more than needing advice, but I feel trapped and don't want issues at work. I'm finally at a job I don't mind, but don't want anything to happen to the guy even though he's harassing me.",15Dec2017,1
4,"I've been taking 200 mg caffeine pills for the past couple of months, but I believe I've built up a tolerance since I can take 3 pills (equal to 6 cups of coffee) and it does nothing for me. Any advice on what I can use for energy instead? I don't want to overdose on caffeine so I limit myself to 3 pills/day (either take 2 then 1 later or all 3 at once).",15Dec2017,1
5,"I won't delve into too much detail here but I had a very serious relationship with a guy that I work with. We broke up for reasons related to bad timing but I never lost my feelings for him. It was one of those relationships where I could see myself marrying him and I'd never felt that for anyone before. He's already in another relationship but I just can't seem to get past what him and I had and it's been driving me crazy. He's been promoted since we broke up so now he has an office and I have to report to him most days. Plus his office is filled with pictures of him and her and it hurts me every single time I have to go in there. I don't think as highly of him since we were together and I still agree with the reasons why we can't be together... but I just can't stop wanting what we had. 

I would change jobs but I'm in a rotational program at the company I'm with and I don't want to have to ruin my potential with my company because of personal reasons. 

I've also been on dates and tried to start moving on but I'm still so hurt from that relationship that I'm having a really hard time opening up without getting terrified and pushing the person away. 

How can I get past this while he still has to be in my life? 

TL:DR how do I get over someone I had a serious relationship with that I have to work with and constantly see and talk to every day without leaving my job?",15Dec2017,0

9,"I work for a company (let's call it Company A) that currently is on contract to help Company B with their database systems.  At a social event hosted by Company C, another company contracted by Company B (which, by the way, is in a different industry than Company A), I met an interesting girl that I want to get to know better.  I know friending work colleagues on Facebook is almost always a bad idea, but is there enough degrees of professional separation between us that it would be fine in this case?  

Just FYI, I would probably see her once per quarter at most otherwise, since I work at Company B's office, while she works at Company C's, and the only time all three groups kind of get together is for stuff like the social event Company C hosted.  ",15Dec2017,1
11,"We broke up and havent spoke for at least 6 months, I realised how toxic she was and since I was going to uni I ended things. I moved across the country to uni and so far I've had an amazing time, I'd be lying if I said there weren't times were I missed her, but even then i miss her as a friend and I regret ever getting together, never thought once about being with her. 

The holidays are here so I went home for them, but right before I left I heard from my friend who's still friends with her that she's been talking about how 'I still message her saying how much I miss her and being together.' I haven't messaged her since we broke up, why is she even talking about me, I've moved on why can't she. 

Before I left for the holidays I thought I wouldn't mind seeing her, like maybe we could reconnect as friends or at least clear the air about the breakup, but now I just don't want to go out on the off chance I see her, as if I wasn't already worried about coming home.",15Dec2017,1

I hate confrontations so I agree with everything.

When people make fun of me or insult me, I just laugh it off or walk away or pretend I didnt hear them say anything. 

In highschool I was the guy everyone liked, but didnt really have any REAL friends. Fuck my life. 

I tried being assertive and not-nice but it just felt awkward to me.  

Like one time a classmate from college insulted me so I called him a ""midget virgin that loves anime"". 
yeah i know, thats a shitty insult but the sad look on his face then his nervous laugh afterwards to pretend he wasnt affected by what i said, just made me feel like an asshole.

16,"I’ve met a girl online through a game, we live 1500 miles apart, we talk normally at first. I hardly interest in her because I had a bad break up with my ex few months ago.

However things changed when 1 day she offered to play the dating game. I discovered my feelings for her.

Then I started to get clingy, she said she has feelings for me as well and that was the reason she wanna play it with me. Then there’s this barrier that stopping us, she can’t deal with LDRS.

I’m now at dating phrase with her (?) we talked almost every night.  Assure her that things will work out if both parties try their best. Not sure if she’ll take it seriously.

But somehow I’m still have the feelings that she’s just playing, tossing me around. She goes mad easily for instant if I over-teased her or I was unable to pick up her call.

I really want to know her answer if she wants to commit on this, but I just don’t know how I can get her to spit out the truth. It’s a very sensitive topic and both of us has been trying to avoid talking about it.

Maybe I've accepted it
Maybe it's been too long
It's tied to me like the ink of a tattoo
Didn't I let go when I saw you'd moved on?

In the images that play
Why do you still haunt me
With the memory of our days

Sometimes your not there
And I'll almost seem to forget
But then I see the colour red
And suddenly I'm in your arms, your bed

Do you feel the same way
Are you faking this content?
I was sure i meant more to you

19,"My brother is getting married next year, I am his only brother. He has asked two different friends to be his co-best men.

I didn't really expect him to ask me to be his best man, so I was sort of prepared for that. But it kind of hurt that, not only was I not his best man, I'm not even the runner up. I'm not even sure if I'm going to be in the wedding party and don't intend to ask.

I feel like there is no one I can vent to about this. I don't trust my parents or sisters to keep a secret and I don't want to add any drama to the events.

I know this event is about my brother and his future wife, not about me. My brother and I weren't particularly close growing up but have become much closer in the past few years. I can't help but feel that despite knowing I shouldn't let this bother me too much, it is going to shape how I feel about our relationship going forward. I won't hold it as a grudge, but I'll just know where I am in the line up of his world, and that hurts.

I have two sisters. They weren't very close growing up and still aren't that close to this day. Regardless, when one got married (despite having lifelong friends that easily could have been her maids of honor) she asked my sister to be her maid of honor.

When my cousins got married, they asked their brothers to be their best men. I don't know enough about weddings to know how common it is to choose a friend over family, so am I maybe overreacting a bit?

This is part-question, part-venting because - like I said - there isn't anyone else I trust talking about this with. The last thing I want is for my brother to involve me more than he planned out of guilt.

Thanks for any responses.",15Dec2017,0
20,"I have been an "" Assistant network engineer"" for about 5 months at a startup. It is a multi-million dollar company that has been around for about 8 years. There are around 30 employees. 

I currently live at home. I do pay little rent, my parents said they would understand if I left work.

If I stay at this job then I keep a steady paycheck, I work with one of my best friends and it looks good to have more experience as a ""network engineer"". But here is whats up with that:

* Was/ Is Little to no training
* Threatened with termination frequently. (If x isn't done by the end of the day then your fired) (I want everyone on X or your fired)
* boss says to do something, we do it, he gets mad and asks why we did it that way
* everything is high priority, current fires are set aside to try to fix new ones
* everytime our software team ""fixes"" something another thing breaks
* Promised bonuses for taking over work. My co worker is leaving in two weeks and ill be taking over three of her projects. No one ever gets a bonus


If I replace work with getting my certifications for Networking

* If I train for 6 hours a day I can finish 2-3 certifications within 28 days. 
* I'm not garunteed a job after I complete these certs.
* Not to mention I could get outside and work out.
* I would not have any income until I find another job.

I don't know if I am just being too sensitive about how my co workers and I are treated or if this is close to being a hostile work environment. Everyone hates it except for a select few.

Do I just say fuck it and be a trailblazer and have 100% confidence that I can quit?

or 

Do I play it safe, keep the job, hope for more experience and suck it up because thats life.

22,"Background: I have been working at the same place for about 2.5 years. I can't say I've ever really loved it, but it's my first ""real"" Mon-Fri, full-time job that pays quite well with good coworkers, and so I've stuck around. The work deals with technical, engineering related topics -- something I have no background in. 

I can't say I ever wanted my boss' job and made a plan back in September to look for new opportunities in the new year. In October, my boss unexpectedly quit and so I was given his job on a temporary, acting basis until spring. 

Fast forward 2 months and I simply hate it. I am completely burned out and very much suffering from the imposter syndrome. Despite my knowing what's to blame, I truly don't feel like I have a solid handle on the technical aspects required to be successful. This lack of confidence is causing me a lot of stress that is starting to really affect me mentally and physically. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. On one hand, I'm going on a 3 week vacation and maybe I'll come back in the new year refreshed and ready to tackle things head on. On the other, I really am over and disinterested in the work I'm doing and don't want to do it long term. Should I consider throwing in the towel? Stick it out a while longer? If I stick it out, I'm not sure I want the full position when my acting tenure ends in spring.

27,"Ok so I have a friend and he is a very good friend of mine, he is super athletic and super into working out so generally a bit of a meat head but nonetheless a good guy, we'll call him dylan. so kind of recently he got a girlfriend. and his girlfriend introduced him to weed, something that he said he would never do. I am totally not opposed to weed in fact I smoke a little every now and then. so the first weird thing I noticed that he did was I was in a plaza with my friend and his brother getting mcdonalds, and he has a little moped thing and he had his girlfriend on the back and he came up greeted me then pulled me aside and said he was high. now that was only his third time ever smoking so i was a little shocked when he told me he took his moped there, even though it is just down the road. i kinda didn't think too much of it but obviously i thought it was dumb. then maybe a week or two later i smoked with him and i was just chilling and a little high and he just kept taking hits from this little pipe. i thought it was a little weird but still didnt really think too much of it. then i havent hungout with him since but never smoke during the week because of school and what nots and i just generally dont smoke that much. and i notice he is contiously smoking during the week which he honestly shouldnt be doing because he isnt the smartest guy. so then recently he kept just talking about picking up more and more weed and then i kinda noticed something seemed a little off so i thought back and remembered he used to do the same thing with shoes last year he just wanted more and more and he would spend all his money on shoes. which obviously isnt a bad thing but just portrays how he can such an addictive and obsessive personality. so i knew something was up so i told my close friend who is also close with dylan. the exact same day dylan came up to me and told me he tried aderall for the first time, which honestly isnt the worst thing in the world but its still abusing prescribed drugs and thats obviously bad, that night he hit me up over text basically begging me for my aderall that i am prescribed, me and dylan are good friends so it was a pretty uncomfortable position but i put my foot down and said no. so then i told my friend about what happened and he said dylan hit him up also begging for aderall but he also said no. so today my friend that i previously told about dylans obsession texts me and says basically we need to talk, dylan told me today that he stole $100 from his parents and he is going to guy buy 10 grams of weed, and he also told me that apparently he stole another $100 the week before and spent it all on weed. this is concerning to me and my friends because we are all very close with him and dont want bad things to come for him in the future because at the moment it seems like he is going down a slippery slope. but the thing that is difficult about this is that dylan is the type of kid that will get super defensive when you tell him to stop doing something and my friend earlier today told him that maybe he should cool it with the drugs and now dylan is mad at him. so me and a few friends plan on maybe pulling him aside tomorrow at lunch tomorrow to tell him this stuff but we really just cant think of what to say. i need some tips on what to say and maybe just give me advice in general for this situation. thank you so much in advance if you read all of this. and if it helps we are in 10th grade in highschool",15Dec2017,1

31,"He met her through a friend of his. Because they have the same car. She asked for his advice and what not. 
Well one weekend he invited me around to his place to spend time together. Which is usual. But without saying anything he invited this girl over so they could work on her car together.  In itself, inviting someone over isn’t the problem. I wouldn’t have come over when I had if I knew he had other plans, because I hate feeling like I’m getting in the way of his plans.  Because of plans and not having a lot of free time lately, we haven’t really had much of a chance to spend much quality time with each other. 

So I think that was the reason that I was upset when he spent all day in the garage with someone else. I mentioned to him that morning that I was a bit upset and asked if it would be easier for him if I was to go home, and maybe come back over when he is less busy. This is when he made a point to say that no it won’t take to long and that he would really like it if I was there when he was done so that we could settle in and watch a movie and eat dinner. He kept reminding me that he’d only be working on her car for an hour max, then it’s us time. 
Turns out it took longer than that. He was in the garage for over 7 hours while I was at his house. I was getting more and more upset (in hindsight I should have just left). Because he knew I would be upset, he choose to stay out longer. And the whole time he kept saying that he was just busy working on two cars and that he lost track of time. 

But he later admitted that they sat there all day just talking. He avoided me.  When the girl eventually left we talked/argued a little. But everything seemed like it got resolved.

But then again I was sat waiting for him in his room. He recently got a new phone. So his old one is sitting on his bedside table. Still connected to everything. And I feel so so guilty about this and I know it was so wrong. But the messages from messenger was on the lock screen. It kept on buzzing a lot. And I saw it was from this girl. 

They were mostly basically insulting me and encouraging him to break up with me. Calling me lazy and a c**t. I’m not even sure what I did for that to be said. I have no idea what he said to her and if he agrees to any of this. I’m just hurting so much from this. Because I don’t know where he stands on the topic. 
I’m becoming very jealous because she’s also calling him best friend and they’re planning trips and things like that. And for him to go to her house before work at 7am. 

I don’t know how to bring any of this up because I know i shouldn’t have looked at anything. But I’m also really hurt because he says he loves me and cares for me but now I’m really doubting it all.


To clarify though. He has many female friends. And I like them all. I’ve never been the type to stop anyone talking to anyone. This is just so different.

Is it wrong to want your SO to stop talking to just one person when this sort of thing is going on? Or should I just end it so he can be happy with her. I’m so unhappy right now. I really don’t want to start a fight with us. The last few days have been good with is, this is just eating me away inside.

Also so sorry this more like a rant then anything and I’m on mobile. It’s probably just a wall of text ",15Dec2017,1

- flows nicely when said (so-lo-zil-yana)

- This con might be me wayyy over thinking this but i feel like when i see solo and then zilyana i think of some cam girl on a porn site. maybe i watch too much porn
- less established

AncientWyvernShield:
- longer name
- looks kind of bulky
- a little harder to flow when pronounced

37,"I don't know why but this week has just been weird. Maybe it's because I had a cold or just this winter weather but I've been feeling weirdly on edge or anxious. It's been about a lot of different things but it comes down to the main point that I have trouble just existing and being at peace.

I have diagnosed OCD and general anxiety I'd say. I am currently seeing a doctor and I will get his opinion on this too. He's told me to start mindfulness mediation which I really got to stick to but I'm so bad at keeping up. Either way, I just have trouble existing in the moment and being okay with knowing I got my own timeline on life. I don't need to compare myself to my friend who has the seemingly picturesque life, or all my friends who are traveling the world and doing cool shit. I'm capable of doing those things too and will when the times right. I gotta believe that and relish in the shit going on in the moment but I have trouble for some reason. 

It's not like I'm breaking down crying, I mean I have when my OCD gets bad, but I just feel like there will always be some doubt or uneasiness in my head, even in the good times. I just wanna sit back, relax and take it all in and be with it! I mean nothings necessairly wrong in my life it just feels like I'll always find something that can be a new anxiety point. I get that this is partly because I have a doubting disease but regardless I'm sure there are some ways I can practice being in the moment more outside of my therapy. I just want to do more to be productive and more involved in my own life! 

I'm also writing this because it's not like I'm a lazy person. I do a lot, commute to the city every day and I lead a high functioning life. But I still could use some perspective on how to snap myself out of these weird moments. Especially now that I'm going to make the big move to Brooklyn! I'm excited about it and think I need it but I want to make sure I'm soaking it all in and being productive with my time and growing myself. ",15Dec2017,1

40,"This is a long and repetitive story, but if I don't provide a backstory, I'm only going to look like a jealous asshole. Apologies in advance. 

To start, one of my closest friends started dating this new guy around September of this year. After finding this out, one of our other friends warned her that he wasn't a good person, considering she was close with one of his exes (he's dated a lot of people). She didn't listen.

They only ""dated"" for a week before breaking up since her dad didn't approve. Literally a day later he starts dating this other girl, and my friend immediately becomes jealous and wouldn't stop complaining to us about him. Another few days passes and he dumps the other girl to get back together with my friend. This was the first warning sign that, hey, maybe you should look into the fact that he's able to move on so quickly and then dump that same girl without even considering her feelings. I think she thought it was so gentlemanly or some shit, I just think it's being an asshole.

After being together longer than a week, I start to accept this new guy into our friend group. I see that they clearly like each other and that it might actually be something that lasts, so I'm happy for her.

That is, until he said ""[my name], you're such a fucking cunt"" in front of our whole lunch table. I only laugh because I'm shocked, but after he repeats it, only my friend and him are laughing. The rest of our table is just looking at each other in disbelief. And yeah, yeah, it's just a joke, but frankly I find that word disgusting and after I express this and am told to calm down, I get a little pissy. 

So my grudge against this not so new boyfriend begins. He's apologized twice through my friend, and when he finally says it to my face, he's laughing. I don't really take it seriously, especially after I hear that he says it to other people all the time. I tell my friend about this, and she simply shrugs it off, saying that he apologized and I should let it go. This sets me off even more, and I end up dropping the subject. At this two, I decided to avoid the pair. They're both in my gym class and I was so sick of third wheeling with That Guy Who Called Me A Cunt.

A few things happen after this. One of my /other/ friends tells me that he makes a lot of racist jokes about how he thinks he's black (he's not), and has almost said the N word. He comments on this other girls post something along the likes of ""Love you *heart emoji*"" which I know isn't really something to stress over but since she's someone who has complained about this in the past I was a little confused when she blew it off as ""oh they're just good friends haha"". Really? A good friend that he buys a necklace for and shares clothes with? Damn, I need to find me a friend like that then. 

I sent her one last desperate text explaining that it's not just me who doesn't like him, but a majority of her friends who have seen the same things that I have. After she replies with a mere ""but he's nice to me!"", I gave up. This was about a week ago. Things were doing somewhat okay until yesterday, and now I'm at the point where I no longer want to associate with her. 

Long story short, she tells her friends that ""[my name] has attitude"" and avoids talking to me. I sit next to her and her boyfriend anyway, trying to explain myself but give up when I see him literally all over her. Shortly after, he calls a girl I missed the name of a whore repeatedly. I am fuming at this point. Then, when we were hanging out on campus, she says ""Oh, I'm gonna go get [boyfriend's name] ahhaha"". I end up leaving with some of our other friends because we cannot stand him. 

Once we leave, we get a bunch of texts from her about how when they were walking home, a bunch of other kids were making rape jokes and slut shaming. She allegedly went off on them, with her boyfriend butting in to save the day. This pisses me off SO much. She tells us that ""this kind of talk isn't acceptable"" and some other stuff that completely goes against her own boyfriend's behavior to her friends. I end up crying, being so hurt from her hypocrisy. 

I didn't say anything about it, but I've been holding a grudge since. I have no idea what to do, considering she refuses to listen to me and the rest of our friend group. Please, please, please help me out.

TL:DR; my friend is dating a horrible person who has called me a cunt, made racist jokes, but since ""he's nice to me!"" it doesn't matter how her friends feel. Please help.",15Dec2017,1

43,"Hi !

Basically, I'm in some sort of theater class (I don't know how it's called outside of France but that's basically just an option I've chosen to do at the beginning of the semester), and for wednesday, I have to choose a monologue. It can be anything, the monologue can come from a play, a poem, a movie, a show, literally anything, it doesn't even have to be a monologue actually, as long as I'm alone while I recite my speech. Even if it's in a foreign langage, I just have to translate it.

Also, I must have an accessory on me, and I'm supposed to use it somehow (I can't just put on a hat and never touch it for the entire speech). As for the speech itself, I don't necessarily have to say it, I can sing it if I want, or I can dance while I do it (I'm expected to move around and not just stand there as I talk), or a mix of all these !

Basically, there are no limits to what I can do, and because of that I'm kinda frightened. There are very good chance that I'll look stupid, and I'd rather avoid that to be honest. I'm pretty good at making funny stuff, so I thought about something really silly, such as reciting a random wikipedia page (like the Platypus one, or the Couscous one) with a very dramatic tone while a sad piano song runs in the background.

I've actually recorded myself doing exactly that a few years ago, and all the friends that listened to it found it funny. So I thought ""ehhh, I could do that maybe"". But I'll be talking in front of the entire class now, and I have to last at least around 5 minutes. What if the joke stops being funny after the first minute ? AHHHHH

I'd really appreciate, well, anything you have to say on the matter. X)",15Dec2017,1
44,"TL;DR: My boss sucks and I don't know if I should go to HR. What would you do?

Apologies if this is ends up being a disjointed rant. I am admittedly ignorant of anything HR related. I've been told that HR is generally there to look out for the company's best interests, though I'm not sure how true that is.

My manager is an ignorant, crazy asshole, to be blunt. She's said SO many awkward, reprehensible, creepy things to me and the majority of the people I work with directly. Early on, I think my manager thought of me as a confidante...I perform well and am easy going, so I think she got that idea that she could be “real” with me. She's incredibly paranoid and does not trust many people. I don't really want to make this a massive list of the bullshit she's said, though I could, so I want to start by relaying a few of the more concerning elements.

To start, I'm a marketing assistant at a global tech company. I work in a small department within the company HQ. The department is about 10 people, and we all share the same manager. I've worked here for four years. The majority of us are “millenials,” and our manager is in her 50s. I am part of the team that trains new hires, and am therefore involved in the interview process. Over the course of a year, I attended the interviews of at least ten male candidates (I am assuming gender here). Without exception, my manager has said something like, “I only say this to male candidates…this is not your personal dating pool” to each male candidate. (Side note: the majority of my colleagues happen to be female.) My manager does not say anything like this to female candidates. Several members of my team have noted that, beyond this obvious bias in interviews, my manager seems to hold additional bias when choosing who to hire. We debrief after each interview and it seems that any positive comments regarding male candidates are brushed aside.

To be clear, my manager makes no secret of disliking men. She won't ever say it explicitly, but the jokes she makes, the offhand comments, the stories she tells all paint a picture of a someone who does not like men. Things that, if the genders were swapped, 100% not be OK. In one of our interview debriefs, my manager, in the presence of three other colleagues, wondered aloud if the candidate was transgender. When we reacted with a mix of confusion/discomfort, she said something along the lines of “Did you see his hands?” The implication being that his hands were too small to belong to a cisgender male.

Another part of my job is training contractors. A particular contractor was granted part time status due to a medical issue. This contractor went incommunicado for a few days. My manager pulled me aside and asked if I would be willing to drive to a neighboring state during work hours (the state in which the contractor lives) to see if her car was in her driveway. Presumably, my manager wanted to find out if the contractor was working a second job. My manager specifically said to not mention anything to her boss (the department head) about this. I declined to help.

Recently, a coworker and I were tasked with training an entirely different department at another site. I headed up several similar trainings in the past without issue. My manager didn't attend, but the department head did. On the first day of the training, the department head took pictures of me and my colleague without our knowledge and either texted or emailed them to my manager. That night around 11pm, I received an email from my manager relaying how inappropriate our outfits were, how we had “disrespected” her, and so on. She kept using the word “disappointed.”

I...really don't think what I wore even got close to inappropriate. I've interned in corporate environments, worked in them, participated in mock interviews, ASKED for feedback on my attire and I just feel like I KNOW what to wear in a particular situation. The outfit I wore was in my regular “I have an important meeting” rotation. I'm saying all this because it was just so incredibly bizarre to receive the feedback. I emailed both my manager and the department head to ask if there was something specifically inappropriate about my outfit. The department head responded saying that my dress was “a little short.” I decided to accept that and move on. The next two weeks of training went smoothly.

A week or so after the training, my manager called me into a conference room. After discussing something unrelated, she asked “what happened” with the dress issue during the training. I stated that I wasn’t sure what she meant: it seemed clear to me that I screwed up, rectified the situation, and delivered the remainder of the training without incident. She asked me at least three times if I had spoken to my coworker the night before regarding what to wear. I stated that I did not and that I could not speak to her outfit choice. My manager finally admitted to me that she felt my coworker and I “colluded” to “thumb our noses at the ‘system.’” It was a heated conversation – my manager is intimidating and she knows it. I defended myself and kept my cool, and by the end of it she admitted she was much more upset with my coworker's outfit than mine.

This is running on a bit, but here are some more examples...in many of these cases, my manager only said these things to me, alone, NEVER in writing: 

- Commented on a coworker's sexuality (“She has a strong sexuality, I like it.”). Same coworker who “colluded” with me to dress inappropriately. 

- Stated that she wished a former employee was gay, presumably so she could date her. 

- Given me unsolicited medical advice, like to not get vaccinated for an overseas business trip in a tropical area. 

- Complained openly to me about every single other person we work with. Not about their work, though sometimes that comes up, more like “so and so's husband is an asshole...” just gossipy shit.
I kind of feel like I need to go to HR but I'm having some anxiety about it for a number of reasons. I feel like so much of this is hard to back up. In many cases, I can point to at least one other person who was in the room, or I can pinpoint a date/location, but she NEVER put anything too nuts in writing. I also feel guilty for not approaching this sooner.

I know I should be looking for another job and I am. But, 1) for the industry I’m in, the job search can take some time…meaning many months. 2) I really love my job. 3) I don’t feel right NOT saying anything…in talking to my coworkers, the majority of us have been made to feel uncomfortable and are honestly afraid to say anything because she has shown retaliatory behavior in the past. I also, perhaps stupidly, feel like this is the right thing to do. There I have been to many times where I thought “holy shit, I have to go to HR” and then I didn't because I was afraid.
The thing complicating this is I live in an at will state, which I understand means my employer can fire me for any reason at any time. So, given that, is any of this worth pursuing? I fully believe that if HR approaches her with this information, she will retaliate against me. She will KNOW I went to HR and went into specifics about conversations we had. There are very specific things she can “take away” from me that may not be perceived as retaliation, but will absolutely make my job hell. She's done this twice before to other people. (I can't really get too specific here.) I'm also worried that the company would simply fire me in order to not have to deal with this. 

What would you do do in my situation? What do I even say to HR? Should I just keep my mouth shut and look for work?",15Dec2017,1

47,"Just today, I received my 13th F and here's my story.

I am currently attending the University of Houston and previously attended a community college in New York City. My first semester was great, I received an 'A' on all my classes but everything went downhill from there. Generally speaking, I do really well on math/sciences and all of my computer sciences courses. Since the beginning, I have focused on all math and physics requirements along with all the computer science courses required for my degree. Every ""Core Corriculum/Common Core"" class has been the death of my GPA, reason? motivation. I can NOT for the life of me get motivated to go through ANY course that does not have ""MATH,PHYS, or COSC/CSC"" in its name. 

I have Received an 'F' on the following courses:

2 F in HIST ""101""

2 F in HIST ""201/102""

1 F in Federal Goverment

2 F in Arts

3 F in Social/behavioral sciences

3 F in Language, Philosophy and culture


On the other hand I have passed everything else relatively easily.

A on Speech

A on both english courses

A and engineering physics 1 and 2

A on calculus 1 and 2

A on Linear algebra

B on Modern physics

A on probability and statistics

A on Discrete math

A on every computer science course up to operation systems(400/4000 level course) including intro to automata which I am currently awaiting the grade and expect an A. 

Its quite simple, I absolutely feel no need or want to learn any of the material in the other courses I have failed, and I can not get myself to be invested in them or care enough. I TRY to study for all my courses, but I can not stay focus at all in these other cources. Currently my GPA is 1.9 as a result.

What would you guys do in this situation? I am planning to simply drop out, try to build some projects and apply for jobs.



TLDR : 'A' on classes related to Computer science, mathematics, physics, and english. 13 'F' on everything else. GPA 1.9

49,"So for many years I’ve been single, (since 15, which isn’t a real relationship anyway but still), and I’ve found myself more depressed over the years.

I’ve got a couple close friends from work (Starbucks) that I hang out with occasionally but none of us are close enough for me to just share everything with.

52,"My family and I are going to Mexico for Christmas - we had the trip purchased and planned since April. In September I took a new job at this hotel bar that is going to be open on Christmas for guests staying at the hotel, as well as general clientele who wish to go out to eat on the holiday. I spoke with my manager a couple weeks after starting the job (so I wasn't the new guy coming in demanding time off right off the get go) about taking the holiday time off. I explained that the trip was already booked, we have non-refundable flights and rooms that needed a certain amount of time if changes to the itinerary were going to be made. Needless to say, two weeks before my stay, they are not allowing refunds to the room. It would be a LARGE waste of money to not go on this vacation, and I have worked all holidays since I started there. I was assured the day I spoke with the scheduling manager that as long as I requested the time off with due notice, there wouldn't be any problems.

Fast forward to tonight, when we were given the schedule for next week and for the week of Christmas. I'm working Christmas Eve, as well as the day my return flight was scheduled. 

What should I do in this situation? I mean I've taken thanksgiving shifts because my other coworkers wanted to be with their families, I stay for doubles when I'm not scheduled because management FORGETS to schedule someone (has happened twice). 

I realize that it was just a time off request, and it wasn't guaranteed, but since there is more at stake than just driving to see them after my shift, and the loss of money, I really don't see how I should sacrifice this vacation that was told ""wouldn't be a problem"" to me by the same manager who scheduled me for Christmas Eve?",15Dec2017,0

73,"Hi Everyone, 

Asking for some general advice here as doing a Google search hasn't yielded very good advice. This is something I have been dealing with / trying to work out for a while now. 

I should start off giving some background information. I am a 30 yr old male in Sydney Australia, happily married, degree qualified, have a house, have an okay job (not super high paying about average), prospects of a kid on the way soon, I should be pretty satisfied with life. 

However I have never been someone who has been satisfied with life. I have always written out 'goals' documents where I set out what I want to do with my life, however I have very rarely ever seen any of my goals through. 

Lately I have been feeling so tired / unmotivated / lazy, like I can't really be bothered doing anything. At work I kinda just do the bare minimum to stay employed and at home around the house I can't be bothered / don't have the energy to cook, do dishes, washing etc, same goes with gym, even video games which i love I feel like I can't be bothered doing. I find myself wasting time on the news, reddit, youtube etc.

This is not constant, some weeks I do feel motivated and work hard at things, but this is becoming more frequent over the course of my life I think. 

I guess the advice I am after is, do other people feel this way? Where you can't be bothered doing anything? I don't even feel bothered to play video games lately. If others do feel this way, what do you to get yourself out of it? Is there a way you motivate myself, do you think about how good it would be to have the things your goals will get you?

I have a lot of things I feel like I should be working on / harder on at the moment and i really want to get myself to the point where I feel motivated / like I want to work on these things:
- Completing my Masters Degree
- Getting a higher paying job
- Buying a second house
- Having a Baby with my wife
- Being more consistent with my gym / diet to get in shape.


Any advice on self motivation or on how to feel more energetic etc would definitely be appreciated. Part of me feels like maybe I need to start something new and aim for different things, maybe things other than more money and work etc.

87,"New to reddit, needed to find a place where I can get some solid advice about renting/dealing with neighbor complaints. Also on mobile.

I rent a studio apartment with my boyfriend, we have a cat and a dog (both are under 20lbs.). Our dog has a potty problem and wears diapers indoors, yes this is relevant. The past few days our downstairs neighbor has complained twice about water dripping onto her porch from our balcony. Let it be known that we only have a table and two chairs outside, no plants or bowls to collect and drip water. The balcony isnt big enough for anything else. I also live in the PNW, so yes the weather has been cruddy.

She has come to us twice about the water - the first time we inspected the back and came back with nothing (the balcony was dry, nothing was holding water). The second time (yesterday at about 3pm) she proceeded to huff and puff and raise her voice at my boyfriend to ""fix it"", before claiming our dog was peeing off the balcony. Hence why his diapers are relevant to this - he cannot pee from the balcony all wrapped up. We wouldn't allow that anyway as it is disgusting and rude. We were floored that she would make this claim since we always got on well with her husband and she was suddenly acting like we were trying to spite her poor porch.

We were reported to management today while I was at work. For our dog peeing off the balcony. Now I have to go to the landlord and have him inspect our door to prove that there is and never was dog urine anywhere on the balcony. The sad fact is, I won't be home long enough to have them do an inspection until Monday - what happens if more complaints come in from them considering the door leaks whenever the apartment gets warm?

I'm not sure how this will affect our relationship with this neighbor as we've always been very reclused renters, we don't make a lot of noise and clean up after our animals and we're definitely not the nosy type to be treated this way. Will this hurt my appearance to management? What if the claims don't stop? Is there anything I can do to calm this neighbor down? I don't have the right (landlord's call and all) or the money to replace an entire glass sliding door just because it collects condensation.

Tl;dr: My downstairs neighbor reported my boyfriend and I for letting our dog pee off the balcony. The water on her porch is from condensation on a glass door, not the dog. Is my name at risk as a renter because of this and how do I fix this problem before it gets worse?",15Dec2017,1

93,"So, a bit of a backstory: My parents got divorced when I was 14, now i’m currently 17, and I lived alone with my mom in a small town for roughly three years. While living with my mom, my dad chose to live 10 hours away from us.

During this time I met my boyfriend [18] and we’ve been dating for about 2 years now. Which, I must say, he is most definitely someone I see a future with. I don’t want you to see this as a “silly high school boyfriend,” he is someone I truly care about and would do anything for. I’ve met pretty much everyone in his family: parents, siblings, cousins, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc., whereas he’s only met my mom since we had no other family around.

In the summer, my mom decided to be closer to family and we just recently moved in with my dad. Weird I know, but whatever it doesn’t matter much. So now, being ten hours away from my boyfriend, I wanted to do something special for the holidays and visit him for a few days. This is something I’ve done before in the summer where I went and stayed with his family for a weekend, which caused no problems among his family nor mine. This time, however, it’s different.

My dad wants to meet my boyfriend and won’t allow me to go until he does, which means he’s wanting my BF to visit me rather than me going to visit him. Despite how badly I want to see him, I’m worried how things will go if he does decide to come for a weekend.

Everyone will be here for him to meet and my family just isn’t the greatest when meeting someone new, especially if it’s the first boy i’ve ever introduced to them. My BF as it is isn’t much a fan of my father, since he’s heard many stories about him during the divorce and stuff, so that isn’t great on top of what my family could be like so the idea just stresses me out.

I don’t think my boyfriend has considered the idea and I was going to run it by him but I’m just worried which is making me reconsider if I should even mention it or not. Should I ask him to come visit me? Any advice would be very much appreciated!!",15Dec2017,3
94,"I'm testifying tomorrow at my ex's university hearing to appeal his suspension from school after a domestic violence offense (against me.)

This will be the first time I'm not defending him, and I'm nervous. I have 5 minutes to speak but I feel that my statement is plenty long (it's a bit over 3 minutes.) 

He's already been suspended but this is his opprotunity to tell the school they messed up. His argument is that the investigation was held unfairly. It wasn't, but the school is required to allow one appeal hearing. For background, we traveled together over summer and all of this happened right before we left. I told a school investigator that nothing happened because we had received a grant from the school and I was scared they would take it away and we wouldn't be able to go.

**My current schedule:**

M: 11:30am-4:00pm DSP
* 1/2 4:30pm-7:00pm ABA

T: 11:30am-3:30pm DSP
* 1/2 4:00pm-7:00pm ABA

W/Th: 11:30am-3:30pm

Fri: 3:30pm-7:00pm ABA

**Introduction:** Let me preface this by saying I do not, in any sense of the word, have it ""rough"" in terms of being a social worker; I do not have a heavy case load, nor do I work terrible hours, and my pay is really quite good. In short, I work with individuals who have intellectual disabilities and require a wide variety of care, which I provide on a daily basis. But like all social work, it is rarely intrinsically gratifying and seldom does acknowledgement happen, which can leave people (me personally) frustrated and, eventually, depressed. 

**Backstory:** I work roughly 17 hours/week as a day staff to a great non-profit organization. I've been working here since I was a junior in college, and I'm a graduate now, so it'll be going on three years this summer. I've never missed work days, my co-workers like me, my coordinator is all too happy with my work, and I have a good relationship with the main day program family I service.

When I officially graduated with my Bachelors Degree, I started looking within the company for additional hours, as I'd also decided I would eventually like to pursue a career in counseling. I was pointed into the direction of ABA therapy (short: applied behavioral analysis therapy). There's more to the story of why I didn't go straight back to school, which I don't even know how to summarize, but the short version is: parents got divorced, we moved three houses (brother's, mine, parent's), I lost the car I'd paid for (it was taken from me, RIP), opened a new SUV lease, had to pay house rent, dumped my no-good boyfriend (who paid half the rent), etc, etc. Ergo, I needed the cash for like $1,000 in bills a month.

On the surface, ABA therapy seemed everything I wanted: I went to school to be a teacher, and always wanted to work with at-risk youth, but I'd found a certain success with my two-year client (who is on the autism spectrum with several other learning disabilities). This job seemed to offer that but in a different manner, which sounded good to me (because I wanted out of my comfort zone, expand my resume, etc). I go into a home, I work with ID individuals, and I use ABA to do it. In my interview for this position, I clearly listed what I felt I could offer their team, and what I was hoping for. 

*Here's where things went sorta... wrong?*

**Early June: I apply/I interview/I'm hired.**

I wanted the remaining hours (I only needed 12 from them) to be considered full time in my company, so I could receive benefits (healthcare, including dental and eye, as well as an opportunity to pursue a second Masters degree), and a way to explore a behavioral branch of psychology. I was told this would be no problem, even with the other program I ran. I gave my skill set during the interview (young adults/teens in need of guidance in social, academic, at-home, and individual growth). When I got the job, and during the interview, the supervisor made it seem as though I would be able to work with the types of adolescents (my area of expertise) that I felt I was best suited for. I was lead to believe a new program was opening up, which I would be the head ABA therapist on (spoiler alert: this went on all summer and into October, it never happened). I completed 40 hours of online training in 15 days while working my day job, and then started shadowing several clients. Everything seemed to be going well.

**July: Shadowing other ABA therapist's clients.**

When my three sessions of shadowing per client (three clients, 3 hours each two times a week over the course of the month) were completed, the hours stopped. I wasn't getting any feedback except for, ""yeah, this program is coming along, we're just waiting on the BCBA to touch up the programming."" I received no further training save for the 40 hours under my belt. I was growing frustrated, yes, but my LDR partner was coming up for the first time and I was also excited for that, so it wasn't the worst thing in the entire world (note: this is a recurring theme, which is one reason why I've stuck around this job for so long: it's flexible with time off and pays well). But when other ABA therapists would call out, I would get called in to cover for them (more on this later!)

**August: Nothing, though they tried to call me in while I was on vacation.**


**September: Still nothing.** 

No set hours, no clients, no shadowing (I uselessly spent 5 hours at an infant family's house, only to be told afterwards there was no possible way for me to work with them as it did not fit into my schedule), no training.



**October: I'm offered two permanent clients at 6.0/6.5 hours a week.**

FINALLY! The supervisor offered me a position to work in a team with two other ABA therapists on either a Monday or Thursday (we each take different days) on a permanent basis. Except... after I'd agreed for Monday, wait, one of the veteran ABA therapists started earning HER degree (or certification, I don't know), so she has to do every-other-Tuesday, so I have to hop from Monday-Tuesday every other week. Week One I'm working Monday, Week Two I'm working Tuesday, Week Three I'm also working Tuesday; it's totally random, but I shrug my shoulders--thankful for the hours--and say sure! I bought a planner! I search our master schedule and map it all out! It's chaos, and I just... I don't do well with chaos or without organization. I just wanted a 9-5 job, something else I made abundantly clear. This job? I work 11am-7:00pm, all day. I have one good friend now (lost the others with the relationship split) and I rarely see her because I work all day and I'm in bed at night.

I'm 23, by the way.

On top of this, I'd been shadowing another family of a nine year old, and children aren't my thing. I can't play with them, I don't know how to really talk to them (my own nephews aside), and they're not my specialty. In this job I get kicked in the shins, stomach, I get nearly bitten, etc. Regardless, I suck it up and I go through with it, and... well, I'm decent, I guess? I don't have any real training in ABA that I feel confident with, so I pretty much read what I can online, watch videos, watch other therapists, and learn as I go (which is humiliating for me, as I have a fear of doing things wrong and embarrassing myself). Most of all, I just want to know I'm helping and not doing more harm than good. Anyways, this client also becomes a permanent fixture in my schedule (Friday 3:30pm-7:00pm).

At this point, I do a whole whopping 6-6.5 hours of ABA therapy work a week (Monday/Tuesday fluctuate by .50--yay!). I work two days a week.

*This brings us to November-December...*

**November:** I'm going to see my boyfriend at the beginning of December, so to make up for my (two day in ABA) absence, I take all of the hours I can get that they offer me. I take up the shifts of other ABA therapists who've called out and the week before I leave I work Monday, Tuesday, Thursday (more on this), and a 3:30pm-9:30pm Friday shift (my normal is 3:30pm-7:00, but they asked if I would accompany them on a family trip [[essentially to babysit]] and I agreed, because I was pressured into it. I sat in the backseat of a sports-car [[with no real middle seat, it's just hard leather]] with two kids, and the mother decided halfway through the hour and a half drive that ""they'd all just gotten over a terrible illness just yesterday."" Thanks for that.) 

Monday, Tuesday, easy. Thursday? I was shadowing for a new client, an aggressive client (note: aggression is NOT in my realm of knowledge, I can't even lift 30 pounds; this client is a 2:1 and I don't know why on Earth they'd put a barely trained therapist on them); anyways, the family cancels on me last minute because it's too busy at the house. Understandable, I agree, totally get it (and I'm slightly relieved!). Then I get a text thirty minutes after I'd made an appointment that they want me to cover for another therapist/their program the very same day who decided to call out of their shift last minute. I tell them no.

While I'm with the family on the Friday before I leave (12/1), I get an email from my supervisor informing me this family that I'm with would like additional support the week after x-mas (kids are out of school). I am not asked. Oh no. I am told I can either work Tuesday morning (before my day program), or a longer day on Friday. I think something in me snapped? I didn't respond until I got back to work this week (12/11). 

I said I would be happy to be with the family on Tuesday (day after x-mas) from 9:00am-11:00am (my day shift starts at 11:30am!) and my normal hours on Friday. To this their response was, ""... Do you not have Fridays available anymore?"" I told her I had misunderstood her email (thinking it was either or, and hoping an early morning Tuesday would be more merciful), but due to family coming up for the Holidays, I really couldn't work any earlier on Friday (12/29). 


**Today:**

I woke up to a text this morning asking me to (last minutely) cover someone's shift today, 5:00pm-7:30pm. It's with the family I don't really even mind, but I was so overwhelmed due to a bad night's rest. I work 11:00am-4:00pm. I was going to do it, I really wanted to say yes because I could use the money, but my best friend was flying into state and I haven't seen her in two years, so (after a lot of stress, talking to boyfriend, more stress, indecision, etc.) I told them that I couldn't do it. I still regret it now, by the way. In case you're wondering. Yay me.

Anyways, that's when it clicked. My supervisor treats me like I'm **on call** while not even *full time.* They literally think they can call me in whenever they want. I don't mind if they ask, and most of the time I'll say yes with enough notice (I have to mentally prepare), but am I insane for thinking this is entirely unprofessional to be doing once a week? I asked someone for their opinion on this, and they essentially told me, ""Well, you want the hours to be full time, but when they're offering you hours, you deny them. How can you expect them to give you more hours when you deny the ones you're given?"" And you know what I say to that?

**No.**

Because first of all, those hours that people give up, which I take on? They do nothing for me in the long run, because they don't count towards the 30 hours I need per week to be considered full time. I just become the scapegoat for people to shove their shifts onto without any of the benefits they're reaping, IE: the things like healthcare I desperately need. 

I already have the job. I do my job. I'm on time, I'm professional, I'm prompt; I do paperwork, I get along well with my co-workers and the families I work with. I was hired on the pretense I would be full time. My interview was where I proved myself, my covering for other ABA therapists and never missing my own shifts is when I prove myself; I shouldn't feel guilty or bad for not agreeing to cover someone's shift because at the end of the day, I'm only human, and I have a life. I constantly feel like my LIFE is being centered around whether or not ABA is going to ask me to cover a shift, and I'm not even full time! Yet they practically have me on-call! It's absolutely ridiculous. 

Am I crazy in feeling this way? I've been constantly putting myself in uncomfortable positions for the sake of this job (aggressive clients, young kids, backseats of sports-cars), hoping it would work out, and when I got back from vacation this week I told my partner and mum I was seriously going to reevaluate my stance on this job. 

I really like working with one of my clients (Monday/Tuesday), but on Friday... I just dread it so much. I have so much anxiety about it. Even thinking about going there now is making me want to crawl under the covers and never come back out. But I need the money so badly, and it pays so well, and the time off works great for when I want to visit my LDR partner. I've never quit a job anyways. I could go get another job. I have a degree. I just really like one-half of my job and not the other half... and the other-half isn't all bad all the time. I'm lost and don't really know what to do.

Also, as an edit: I have a literal email outlining every day one of our fellow ABA therapists cannot make work. This month? She can't make it at all. Why do they still have her hired? Why don't they just give me this client permanently so my hours are taken care of? I have no idea.


*I don't even know how to summarize this in a TL;DR.*

**TL;DR:** I like most aspects of my job, even if I'm not treated as fairly as I think I should be (I have good pay, flexible hours). Other therapists call out and I'm called in to take their shifts, but I'm not even full time. It feels as though their needs are put above mine (inevitably affecting my work schedule and persona life [when they call out]). I'm still not full time after being hired in June. I'm bordering on depression. The kicker is... They want me to start up with that aggressive client, and the hours are 4:00pm-8:00pm with the occasional later night. How do I tell them ""no""? I guess if I had to ask for advice, it would be on these three points:

1.) Am I crazy for thinking they're using me as a scapegoat for their hours on programs where veteran ABA therapists are calling out on? Is this not fair to me? Because it sure feels unfair.

2.) Do I seek an alternative way to get healthcare (I don't even know how to go about this, I've been on state healthcare while in school) and just keep the one client I really enjoy working with, then seek more gratifying work elsewhere on a part-time trial basis?

3.) When they ask me to work with this 2:1 aggressive client, and I agree to shadow... if I feel I can't do it, what do I say? 

Thanks for anyone who read this. Really. I know it's long. I hope it's in the right place.

Happy Holidays.

I can't for the life of me find a way to want to do school work, or go to class, or study, or do anything with my university career. I got a 50% on a final I wrote a week ago and now I have a final today that I haven't even studied for, I'm probably going to fail the class anyway since I haven't gone to the mandatory seminars at all and got 50's on all the quizzes. I want to do well and school and I want to limit my consumption of the internet but I don't know where to begin, I'm scared I'm going to throw my life away because I can't commit to anything that is school.

119,"Hi everyone,

I am currently 23 and live in a suburb of Philly. I went college in Massachusetts that had a great public transportation system and even lived in Dublin, Ireland for a semester where public transportation was my main means of getting places.

Even at the age of 16 and having a permit I had a hard time of even wanting to get my license. I was never in a bad accident so there is really no direct cause for this. Outside of school I didn't do much, as for a job I did work around my neighborhood throughout the year for money. 

As I'm now starting to get into a professional life and looking to being a career, I keep facing myself as my issues with not wanting to get a license. I've always felt that I had trust issues towards people on the road just because I don't believe they even know what they are doing most of the time. I also feel like I get distracted too easily while driving and I would seem to have a fear of something bad happening because of this. My parents always had SUVs and I never felt comfortable behind the wheel of them just because I felt they were to big and was in complete control.

The solution that I seem to believe in right now is with a smaller car like a small sedan (hell I've thought of a mini cooper) this might negate some of my fears and allow me to mentally accept driving.

Any input, advice, or personal experience would be greatly appreciated.",15Dec2017,3

124,"Back when I was in High school I met this guy through a school club and we started to talk a lot even though he was a senior when I was a junior. He also had a brother in my grade that I was friends with too. He used to pay me compliments like saying my hair looked nice (a certain way etc) and I looked good wearing certain things and light flirting. I don't know if I was naturally attracted to him or his compliments caused me to become attracted (No one really paid me compliments at school so it was a thrill), but I developed a big crush on him. We used to talk in breaks if we came across one another, share drinks occasionally at performances and school games and I used to try to make these sort of situations occur as much as I could, like a typical love-sick schoolgirl. He had a girlfriend the whole time so even if there was any mutual attraction, it wasn't possible. He graduated and moved away to college and I haven't seen him since (it's been years).

Fast forward to now and I am in college too and he is in grad school. A few months ago, out of the blue he messaged me on FB asking what I was up to/what I was studying/where I was studying etc and let him know if I come to catch up... and my crush for him which had never truly gone away but laid dormant like a spring bulb in the winter, inflamed again and I haven't been able to quell it. I found him on LinkedIn (as you do haha...) as he was suggested to me as a link and I looked at his interests and they are very similar to mine, I never knew we had so much in common, even when we were friends physically. Anyway, my college doesn't offer the subjects I want to continue with in the final years of my course and I found a college that did upstate in my state capital where the male friend is in college (in a different college). He doesn't seem to have a girlfriend at the moment and I have been commenting and discussing topics on his posts on FB occasionally in an attempt to reconnect somewhat but haven't told him about my plan to move (it's not certain but looking likely). 

My question is, should I continue to comment and message him to try to reconnect or would that be annoying  (say once every two weeks) ..he seems to replied in a friendly manner each time? If I do move , should I, and I hate to use this word as it sounds predatory, pursue him- try to catch up and watch him play and see where it goes or just leave it as people change?

TL;DR: Developed a big crush on an older guy when I was in junior high, we got on well but he moved away to college and we sort of lost touch. My crush for him has never really gone away and due to circumstances with my college subjects I need to move to the city where he lives. He messaged me recently out of the blue and stirred things up again. Should I reconnect or leave it be?

125,"Posting here because r/relationships is a cesspool.

**I got invited to a private motorcycle track day on the weekend of my birthday in a few months.** I learned that my GF and her brother (who greatly dislikes me even though I've only met him once) and a bunch of our mutual friends had been invited by someone else and were planning on going. I asked my girlfriend if she was going to go and if she would mind if I came and she said she was planning on it, and did not mind. I thought it would be a fun thing to do for my birthday with my GF and our friends with the added bonus of getting the chance to try and soften up her brother. So the next day, I pay the $225 it costs to attend, and notice she hasn't paid yet and it's almost full, so I remind her to pay and she tells me ""I'm not going because you're going"". I'm completely taken aback and I ask her what her problem is and she says ""You're just going to make fun of me for being slow and I don't want to be around you and my brother at the same time. I know I'll have a shitty time so I'm not going"".

**Now I'm upset because I wouldn't have paid $225 had I known when she said ""Yes I'm going. No I don't mind"" she meant ""Yes I do mind. No I'm not going"".** I complained about her failing to communicate and tried to reason with her by promising not to make fun of her and asking her to come and be with me and our friends for my birthday and help smooth things over with her brother (who I would very much like to be friendly with) and she said ""Let me talk to my brother"", which I took to mean ""I am considering your request"". Today, I ask her if she talked to her brother and the conversation goes like this:

&gt;Me: did you talk to your brother?  
&gt;Her: yes  
&gt;a few minutes go by  
&gt;Me: and?  
&gt;Her: he's still going  
&gt;Me: You already told me he was going to go even if I was there, I'm asking about you  
&gt;Her: Oh. I already told you I wasn't going.  

**Now I'm fucking pissed at her because it seems like she just mislead me about her intentions to end the conversation.** I made a bit of a mistake tonight when she came home from work and tried to come to bed, I raised my voice at her while explaining how inconsiderate she's being and how mad I was at her and ended up telling her she was being a bitch. She just sat there in silence for like a solid minute and then said ""I don't wanna talk about this"". So I told her to go sleep on the fucking couch then and all she had to say was ""I don't want to"" so I told her ""I don't care what you want. See how it feels?"". She just sat there in silence for a another minute staring at me and I said ""well? go"" and she just got up and left without trying to have any amount of discourse throughout the whole thing.  

**I'm so fucking mad because she does this all the time.** she never communicates or considers how her actions effect me, she does whatever she wants without thinking about me and ends up inconveniencing me or hurting my feelings. Then I get mad or upset about it (tonight's outburst was probably the most mad I've ever been at her), and I try and talk to her about how her actions effect me and she doesn't even try to explain herself or even placate me, she just sits there silently until I drop it or says ""I did what I wanted to do"". This time I even asked her in advance about something potentially awkward or difficult for her and she both couldn't be straight with me, and then didn't care how it effected me when she changed her mind the next day, and when I got pissed off that she made me waste $225 to go to an event with her that it turns out she wasn't even going to, she didn't even care that I was mad, she was just annoyed at me.

**How the fuck do I deal with this? What do I do now?**

Normally I can think of a constructive way to handle these situations but I'm just angry and see no good path forward that isn't ""just give up and stop being mad"".
We've been together for 5 of the last 6 years (broke up and didn't speak for a year, got back together 9 months ago) and we live together and have a bunch of mutual friends so I don't want to break up with her but it's like she just doesn't think about me ever and is totally incapable of working through problems, and when I calmly and reasonably explain this to her she goes into silent mode until I give up. If I ask her why she isn't saying anything she says ""I have nothing to say"" or ""I don't know"".",15Dec2017,2
126,"I am a 20yr old Computer Science student attending a state college. I haven't wanted to rely on my parents financially (or much in general for the sake of independence), but they were insistent that I do not work so that I can focus on my studies. After some time I found my passion, programming/computers, and have been pursuing that.

However, this past year has been a mess. Several key things happened:
-Dad lost his job and can't pay child support to mom
-Mom changed her job and had to move
-Mixture of medical/family bills/debt

I typically worked entire school breaks, and worked when I had a job. As of now I do not, and my mom was insistent that it has been okay as long as I am still trying/looking.

I got a 3 day notice for my lease to pay or quit today. I brought it up to my mom and it turns out for the past few months she had been hiding the financial problems. Lying to me about the reasons we were late saying it was simply a scheduling thing with her paycheck/had a surprise bill, but that things would be okay. I am grateful for the opportunity my parents have worked hard for me to have, and I don't want to make it sound like I am bashing them, but I can't help but feel like if I had known sooner I would have been able to do something.

After talking with my dad, we came to the conclusion that I will likely have to (at least temporarily) be removed from school and have to move back with my mom and work until things are more stable financially. I am devastated, I will be 13 hours from my girlfriend who I love, and have spent 2 1/2 years at a college and feel like I have nothing to show for it except debt.

My question is this:
What do I do?
-Do I try to bide my time and work while living with my mom and hope things turn out okay?
-Do I still try to pursue my passion while I am not attending college?
-Will I be able to make a comeback? I can't help but feel like things may not go well in the long run.

130,"Hey guys,

A lot of people may say that Reddit probably isn't the place to right now but any advice would do. For measure, I have already spoken to academic counselors and they have not been very helpful.  

I am a student at a so-called 'very prestigious' U.S university. I worked very hard to get into my 'dream school.' I transferred here in 2015 and it was my first time leaving home.  

I was 19 at the time and in my junior year. I did quite well in the beginning. Things went downhill from there, and I had a serious bout of the darkest depression I've ever been through. 

After finally seeking help, I was diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD. All related to my past life. This isn't one of those 'feel sorry for me' and my childhood trauma fucked me type of posts. I just wanted to note how I guess that affected my academic life/life in general. 

After getting incompletes in some of my classes for 2 semesters, I withdrew for a year and spent the year abroad. I felt a lot better and thought I'd come back refreshed.

This semester was my first time back and it has not gone well. I spend most of my days sleeping in and crying. I have a final tomorrow and am pretty sure that I will fail it.

I have what I assume to be a B in one of my non-major classes.
I have a 42% in one of my major classes and I was given an extension on my final paper after having an anxious breakdown. He told me I would probably get a B if I turn it in on Friday but I still have not done that...I feel like I am stuck in a frozen and dazed state. I literally have it done and just need to edit but I STILL have not turned it in. I feel like there is something seriously wrong with me. 
I have a C- in my other major class and am almost positive that I will fail this class.

I went from being a student leader, arriving with a scholarship, with excellent accolades to a 1.88 GPA and on academic probation.


I started off strong this semester (even got As on some papers) but it went downhill from there. As always. 

I am a first generation student and I realize that my mental health and not 'being strong enough' has caused me throw my life away. My parents are 'proud' of me but I feel like I am a fucking liar and I hate myself so much for doing this to myself. I can't stop crying about this right now. 

My goal would be to go to a decent grad school like Oxford but I scoff at myself because it is the most unrealistic thing to say. I want to stay in academia but I feel like it will be impossible with what I've done. I am working on getting a paper published but I feel like my efforts at this point are futile. I feel like if my GPA was better I would take myself more seriously and maybe feel more motivated to work on 'improving' it but I have worked myself so hard into the ground now that I am not sure what to do next with my life. 

Any advice?",15Dec2017,2

I'm 17 years old and living at home with my father. I'm finishing high school online and I have a job that I work about 20 hours a week at. A few months ago my 21 year old decided to move his girlfriend into our house. He's living at home because of some issues in life he's had. Our house is relatively small but we all have our own bedrooms but there's not a whole lot of space and it's easy to hear things throughout the house. I barely know the girlfriend as she won't speak to me unless she wants something from me. The main problem I'm having is she bitches and moans about everything going on and she acts very entitled despite not paying rent, paying for food, having a job, doing any chores, or contributing whatsoever to the overall wellness of the house and family. I keep a little bit of an off sleeping schedule since I work in the afternoon so I usually go to bed around midnight. I was talking moderately loud to one of my friends at about 10:30 at night which doesn't even happen often, whe my brother wanted to talk to me about something for a minute. So I start talking to him and she storms out of her room bitching about how it's so late at night and she has a class early tomorrow morning and how everyone is so disrespectful to her and that I'm being hostile towards her for talking to my friend so late at night despite previous nights of her staying up until 3 am watching netflix I was just somehow supposed to know that she had a class the next day and to keep quiet. She won't just calmly talk to me its always screaming and bitching generally throughout the house.

Point is she very loudly complains about my habits and what I do (That was just one example) despite the fact that she lives here for free and does nothing. I've talked to both my dad and brother about it but no one seems to care and I'm at a loss at what I should even do besides not be home as often as possible.

I brought a female friend of mine (more an acquaintance at this point; no romantic involvement) to a music festival in the beginning of September. She made it clear that she would pay me for the ticket, but seeing as we're into December now, it seems unlikely that I'm gonna be reimbursed.

I haven't seen her since then, and I've made no mention of it to her, presuming she'd have the decency to pay me back. As more and more time passed, I kept feeling tempted to remind her of it. However, she's one of these people who literally shares everything on social media and constantly goes on about her hardships. I felt that if I asked for the money while she's going through her own hardships, that would be poor form.

However, from what I've seen, she has enough money to get tattoos, fly across the Atlantic and sustain herself in an apartment in a fairly rich area. And this ticket was fairly expensive as well. And if you're thinking, ""oh but you had a good time with her at the festival"", she literally ditched me half the time.

It was great, even though we had our own businesses because of college and distance we texted and a few times met up to see eachother, until one of my friend's birthday came around. It was him/her eighteen birthday and we had made plans to go out. That same day I was busy in the morning bc of college + tired, and I told them to make the meet up sooner bc I wanted to make it home not so late (I wanted to rest badly). The birthday friend said she couldn't changed the time, so I wrote ""Well now idk"" and explained I was tired and that I knew I would fall asleep while at the movies. Him/her took it personal and cancelled the plans. My intentions of me cancelling weren't to ruin the plans, but for them to say ""Oh you're tired? It's okay, go rest, the rest of us will go because we can"" I mean, that was my logic (I hope I'm not the only one here). After that him/her was hostile with me, whenever I texted him/her ignored my messages and kept talking to the others (it's a group chat) about other topics. I apologized, I wrote a testament about how sorry I was and that I'd make it up for him/her, him/her said it was fine and that he/she would forget about it. I also apologized to the rest of my friends, one of them said I was selffish but that it was okay, another friend wasn't even bothered by what had happened (he was chill because he had college stuff too/was tired but didn't say anything). The friendship was weird after that, it was sometimes good and other times he/she was back to hostile. Right now it's still like that.

It's weird bc it's just a feeling I get whenever he/she texts. He/she makes plans, but doesn't insists on me going anymore, he/she mentions it to the others and I'm somewhere like ""Hey what about me? Why don't you ask me personally if I wanna go like good ol' friends do?"" He/she now refers to others directly and doesn't mention me like he/she mentions the others, making me feel like an extra in that group, like a plan B if my other gals are busy. Personally, I had changed a lot with the few college months I had finished, I'm more realistic and if this friendship is no longer then my presence won't be either. I won't insist on something that isn't 100% just because of a 1% I did wrong. I wanted to share because I needed to write it out and I need others' thoughts on this. What do you think? What would you do in this situation? Thanks a lot for reading.",15Dec2017,2
151,"I'm 13, in a family of 5 (me, mother, father, older brother, younger brother). For awhile now I've had a problem with lying to my parents. I don't want to, I just do. Imagine the pettiest, smallest thing I could do, like spilling a little bit of something, breaking a cup my parents never even cared about by accident, and when they confront me about it (they aren't even upset), I craft a lie even though I would get in zero trouble if I just said,""Yeah, I broke that, sorry."" And it's just for my parents. I love them unconditionally, and they never abuse me or anything like that, they do all they can for me, but I hurt them with my idiotic lying that I cannot control. I don't know why I do it, or why it is just to them, because I am very honest with my teachers and friends and other relatives, but my immediate family that I live with, nope. Recently I've kinda got it under control (barely), but I have really shattered my parents relationship with me. They barely trust me, and even when I tell them the truth about something (which is hard) they question it. I have gotten I trouble for telling the truth because I've lied to them so many times they thought I was lying.

So I’m 19 F and in college. Every job I’ve had up until this point has been either waitressing, retail and other customer service sort of jobs. And I always suck at them and feel really incompetent to the point where I quit or I get fired.

I got fired on Sunday. The funny thing is that I felt relieved when I was told I was fired. The reason I’m worried is because if this is happening as a student, and I’m constantly quitting or getting fired, is this something I will have to worry about when I get a professional job after college? Or is retail/customer service not for everyone and I shouldn’t be worried? Is this recurring thing telling of my personality? Do I have something wrong with me?",15Dec2017,2

172,"I'm currently studying to become a mechanical engineer, and I'm pretty sure it'll work out, but I always have occasional doubts like most young people do.

I'm technically considered a junior (almost a senior) in college, while also being a senior in high school (I'm dual enrolled). My college GPA is a 3.37 (should go up to a 3.5 next semester if I get all A's) and my high school GPA is a 3.45, which puts me on the lower end compared to other engineering students. Also, I pretty much have little to no chance of transferring to Georgia Tech, but the other engineering schools in Georgia look like decent choices.

I live in a small town in Georgia, and there were never any opportunities for young people to get exposed to engineering when I was growing up. However, that shouldn't be an excuse for me not getting experience because you can still do many engineering-related things on your own (like designing a car that ran on alternative energy). But, I never had the intuition to do so.

I applied to 3 internships at Gulfstream recently (an aerospace company in Savannah), and they'll decide on interviewing me in January. My only redeeming qualities as an engineer are that I tutor math at my local college and I know how to draw decently and make origami structures, and the latter isn't too relevant to engineering.

178,"So my mother is an attractive lady... She was a model. Long story short: You could say she's a dick head or just a woman with a lot of emotional baggage. I suppose both are true. 

Growing up she's always stressed on how I'm the ''attractive'' child of the family and put needless pressure on me. Growing up, her subjective point of view was confirmed time and time again by my life experiences. 

So today I was in my work uniform and I walked past a bar (Friday night). There were a lot of drunk rowdy guys up on the balcony shouting out obscenities at passers-by. Things like faggot, pussy, and cunt. 

Obviously, this isn't okay. But I didn't take it personally — they were drunk. I just continued walking home. I'm an adult, mind you. 

I get a phone call from my brother saying my mother told him that *''I need to stop acting queer''*. And then tells me my mother saw me getting called a pussy. 

So I drove to my mother's house to confront her on it. She outright denied it, but my brother insists she said it. The word queer isn't in anyone else's vocabulary other than my mother's, so the fact my brother being so specific with the phrasing suggests to me that he is likely telling the truth (other than that he really has no need to lie). 

She then breaks down in tears and starts screaming saying that everyone always picks on her. 

I try to reason with her and she gives me some baloney hokus pokus about her just being ''worried'' about me. Her words, *''I am an attractive woman, when I was younger women were jealous of me and did awful things to me like try to set my hair on fire out of jealousy. Just like me you stand out and so it's only natural that guys are going to be jealous of your good looks. All it takes is one drunk guy and the girl he likes to say you're cute and you'll be beaten up''*. 


This was all very emotional, but it sounds like bullshit. I am basically not meant to walk around outside because I might get beaten up by guys who are ''jealous'' of me. You could get hit by a car, but that's no excuse not to go outside. 

My brother also insists that she said *''I need to stop acting  queer''*. 

Now, not only is this incredibly offensive. But I have no idea how anyone can even be queer simply by walking home. 

What should I do? How should I approach my mother?",15Dec2017,2

199,"A general background: I [23F] was raised in an Italian immigrant, super Catholic household in which the parents ""own"" their children--even when they're adults--and have ultimate say over everything, from your appearance to your religious and political beliefs. For years, my relationship with my mother has become increasingly strained. I am 23 years old and she still tries to exert total control over every aspect of my life, and it has been extremely detrimental to my mental health over the years. My family has a group mindset, so it's basically all of them against me.

My mom, grandmother, uncle, and I all live on separate floors of our triple-decker apartment home in Boston. My boyfriend and I are recent college graduates and live on the third floor, paying my family relatively cheap rent. There has been a great deal of tension since we moved up here. My mom keeps wavering between playing the ""landlord"" and ""parent"" card, choosing whichever one suits her reality best in the moment. In one instance, my boyfriend grew frustrated at her for trying to exert control over HIM and she literally told him, ""I am your elder. I'm above you.""

Things have gotten progressively worse in the past year. My mom met her new boyfriend last January and he moved into our house a month or two later. I was still living downstairs in my mom's apartment at the time, and she didn't even run it by me when this guy she barely knew started staying over our apartment every day. He started moving his stuff in, and I was getting shifted out of my own apartment for a guy she just met.

I have a RIDICULOUS amount of issues with her boyfriend. From the very beginning, I noticed that he was incredibly insecure, controlling, and manipulative. Here are some highlights:

* He would always make disparaging comments about my deceased father, who my mom divorced nearly 2 decades ago.
* He demanded access to my mom's social media accounts and constantly monitors and tries to control her activity. One time he logged onto her Facebook and deleted a bunch of people that he didn't like.
* He uses money as a control method and always buys my mom expensive things, mostly technology (GPS enabled technology. Hm.)
* He gets excessively jealous when she talks to anyone and demands her attention. One time he was at his condo and my mom was on the phone, so he called her house phone (which she was talking on) and she didn't pick up. So I heard him call her cell phone. Then I heard the Facetime tone. Then the text tone. Then the cell phone again. Then I heard my mom switch the house phone line to him, ensuing in an argument. He got mad at her for not picking up and when she told him that she was talking to a friend, angrily asked why she needs to talk to her. Yup.
* He gets angry when she goes to the gym, which is pretty essential for her because she's overweight and wants to get healthy.''

He also tries to exert control over our entire household. My mom includes him in ""family meetings"" AKA interventions with me and my boyfriend, and he tries to run those conversations. She lets him have say over everything from the bills to the dogs' health care to the state of our house itself (if my mom and uncle should sell it, ect.)

Beyond that, he's also just a horrible person. He constantly makes rude and inappropriate comments that my mom writes off. I have facial piercings, and one time he asked my boyfriend (who was at the table with my family; I wasn't there) ""what else [I] had pierced."" My mom claims to not have heard this, but she still defended him and claimed that it was just a joke. Yeah, let's just completely disregard the blatantly sexual comment your shitbag boyfriend made about your daughter while she wasn't even there to defend herself. Swell.

They've been together for almost a year and this hasn't changed at all. She's lowkey acknowledged that these are ""red flags,"" but she's desperate for a relationship and is willing to let him mark his territory all over our home and lives. I thought their chances of breaking up were slim due to her desperation, but then I got that miraculous text a few days ago.

My mom told me that she had broken up with her boyfriend because she found a tracking device in her purse. I was ready to kill him, but I couldn't help but feel thrilled that this had finally made my mom snap to her senses. I was worried that he might end up doing something, so I ended up contacting his son on Facebook and telling him, ""Just wanted to let you know that our parents broke up because your dad put a tracking device in my mom's purse. You seem like a good guy, so I wanted to make sure that you knew the truth."" He responded, ""Okay, thank you for telling me."" I did this as a security precaution, just in case he snapped and ended up stalking or hurting my family. I know that it was brash, but I never expected my idiot of a mother to consider getting back with him.

Less than a day later, she said that she had spoken to him and that it was all a misunderstanding. When she confronted him, he said that he wanted to try out the tracking device and put it in her purse, but got called away for a family emergency--that last part is true--and ""didn't have a chance to tell [her]."" Mhm, sure. Because him putting a tracking device totally doesn't align with the fact that he's insanely possessive and controlling and insecure, trying to domineer every aspect of her life. He also has a penchant for ""spying"" technology: he owns drones, cameras that he has installed at (ONE OF) his ex wife's house to ""make sure she isn't touching [his] stuff,"" cameras in the front hall of our house, ect. He also owns guns and constantly brags about them, so that's a huge stressor on my end as well.

My idiot, desperate shit of a mother believed him, or tricked herself into believing him. I was furious. This was the absolute final straw for me. Everything about this guy has been a giant red flag, and I was infuriated and worried that she was willing to go back to him. I've been concerned that he would snap and potentially hurt my mom or one of us.

We got in a major argument and I laid out every single red flag that I've seen in this relationship. My mom started complaining about how she ""can't be alone for Christmas,"" and she basically admitted that she was settling for him. I explained how he could potentially be dangerous, not just to her, but to her family, and she completely wrote off my concerns. She kept saying that I was ""hurting her"" and asking me if I loved her, AKA ""will you keep putting up with my shit because I'll throw a tantrum if you don't?""

When she found out that I had messaged shitbag's son, she went into a rage and started accusing me of ruining her chances with her ex/still boyfriend. She claimed that both his ex wives are ""cheering to get him back"" (yeah, okay) and that I am making it harder for her to leave. I told her that she made her decision to leave based on the tracking device being the final straw (not the only issue) and that she should stand by her decisions and trust her instincts.

She also claims that my grandmother ""loves"" and ""trusts"" him. Let's just note that my grandmother doesn't speak English, so she doesn't comprehend what the hell is going on in their relationship. My mom hides all of the bullshit and puts on a facade, so obviously my grandmother is going to think that things are all peachy. For all sakes and purposes, she's oblivious.

When my mom told me that she was giving the shitbag another chance during Christmas, she said, word for word: ""It was all a misunderstanding. He showed me how [the tracking device] works and it is so cool. Behave yourself for my sake!"" I told her that if she wants to keep this stalking, controlling piece of shit around, then I won't be sticking around for Christmas.

Then come the guilt trips and the bullshit. Oh I'd be ""killing"" my grandmother if I wasn't here for Christmas. I'd be tearing apart the family. I need to ""have a serious talk"" with my mother for god-forbid disobeying her.

She's been spamming my phone for the past day. I managed to sneak by her on my way home from work yesterday, but she has been obsessively texting me, telling me that she needs to talk to me. She even got my uncle to harass me. When I finally responded, I told her that I wasn't feeling well and didn't feel like talking. She kept pressing the issue and trying to force me into a conversation with her, which I know will involve her trying to force me to respect her wishes and play nice with her shitbag boyfriend, but I'm not having that shit.

I've literally been having chest pains, migraines, and panic attacks because of my mom's bullshit. I can't afford to leave. My boyfriend and I both work full-time, but our student loan payments alone are the cost of rent. We're stuck here for the time being. I literally don't know what to do, but I'm becoming increasingly more anxious and depressed and I feel like nobody is in my corner. My family is putting so much pressure on me that I'm starting to feel like **I'm** in the wrong.

200,"Hi,

I dont even know where to start... I was a happy, motivated, hardworking and positive guy that everyone liked and suddenly 8 months after breaking up with my gf that killed me inside I just started playing videogames, smoke, gain weight, avoid my friends and any social life(school, work).

2 years has passed and im still the same. I didnt even graduate(last semester)  because i would always stay up late and just sleep through the day to kill time faster. 

I dont want to hang out with my friends because I dont want them too see me what i've become... i have been avoiding them for 6months now. 
I dont have any confidence, i feel the start of my hair loss, not motivated to lose weight and the MOST important thing, not motivated to work in this country.

I feel extrenly useless, ugly and weird. I even hate going outside to buy stuff because of not wanting people to look at me..

I want to get out of this country(CZ, prague and before that to lose weight and work my looks to gain back my confidence, but how do i do it... how do I abandon the comfy online world of online people that adore me into going back to the real world where I hate my bare existence.....i hate my self so much.

If anyone has any experiences with this or amy tips of how to force my self to do something and grow up i would really appreciate it...",15Dec2017,2

204,"TL;DR - the question from the post


Basically don’t know where to go from here. At one point I was an excited accounting student making straight A’s, then my wife left me, switched to business, family craziness, now after all my credits have been completed I have a 1.8 gpa and won’t be graduating... honestly college lost its luster after all the personal things. Thought I could push through but obviously couldn’t. I’d give another semester a shot but this is the end of my fifth year so i’m pretty out of options funding wise. Idk that I really wanna go to school anymore though. It just sucks I’ve put so much time into this without receiving that piece of paper at the end. 
I’m pretty lost on where to go from here other than to get a job at Walmart as a stocker and try to work my way up (I do actually have years of job experience but have a year gap in employment).

I'm a 22 year old guy, and starting about two months ago, I have been receiving prank calls to my phone. It started as harmless jokes from a ""girl"" (guy) named Debra, and them became more frequent. It happens periodically, every week or so, but once I tell the person to leave me alone, they won't, and they will call back 2-3 times a day before it ends.

I'm looking at my call history now. There are 7 calls from this restricted number alone, not counting other numbers they have called from. I have told them that I will call the police if they don't stop, but they don't listen. I got a call at 11AM this morning.

220,"Hello /r/advice. I have a buddy, my best friend actually, who has recently come out as bisexual and has begun to crossdress. I have no problem with this and will support him no matter what his sexuality is. However, my issue is that ever since this revelation, he's begun to turn almost every outing into a crossdressing opportunity. It's never about us hanging out anymore, it's just about seizing the opportunity to crossdress and doing something. This is compounded by the fact that both of our families are pretty conservative, so we always have to sneak out of the house after he gets ready (basically him coming over with a duffelbag and spending 45 minutes prepping in our downstairs bathroom). 

While, again, I'm happy to support him as he explores himself, I'd really like us to be able to just casually hang out without our encounters centering on whether or not he can crossdress, but I don't know how to express that without sounding intolerant or offensive. What should I do? ",15Dec2017,1

234,"I dont really know how to go about this but im gunna take a swing at it anyway. (Disclaimer, I have bad grammar so I apologize in advance.) 
So I have a friend who is 21 years old and has been been brought into this world by psychotic Manipulative parents.  She has never been allowed to have anyone spend the night at her house when growing up, nor allowed to go to other kids houses. She lives in my hometown which has a very friendly community so there really isn’t an excuse there. Her parents are pretty messed up, they have 4 children, her included and they hide the oldest one from everyone (because she is mentally challenged) and the other 2 are under the age of 10. The mother had cheated on her husband when my friend was at a young age and thus caused the father to go into some phycotic controlling state, instead of divorcing her.
So ever since high school her abusive father had decided to make their house a fortress that nobody was allowed to leave. So the dad had decided to put my friend in complete responsibility of everything in the house, she is the one who cooks, cleans, take her younger sibling to school, feeds the dogs, does the grocery shopping, everything.  She was fine with this because her dad promised that it would be a way for her to work for her college tuition, he promised that he would send her to any university she wanted. Well when she had finally graduated expecting to go to a university (also her parents didn’t go to her graduation only me and her grandmother did, her parents where at home and didn’t feel like going..), unsurprisingly she had been let down because her dad (who makes A LOT of money) came to her and said “Im not made of money, you’re gunna have to go to the jr college for 2 years here in town.” WELL two weeks later he decided to kick her out and send her to her grandmas (the only family she is allowed to communicate with)  because she snuck out to hang out with me. Well when he didn’t have his house keeper for 2 days he decided to pick her up from her grandmas IN HIS BRAND NEW CORVETTE STINGRAY ($70k+) and she went back to her prison of a home. Well she is 21 now and still in the same situation. She just finished her associates and has still not been allowed to get a job or move out. She was never allowed to have friends growing up (Still not allowed) she only has me and one other. Im 23 so I can’t really help her for I have started my career and am trying to get my life together so im not much help haha. But she can’t seem to find a way out because she won’t be allowed to have the car he bought her. She has ZERO work experience and is an extremely shy girl. However she is really smart academically. I have been giving her as much advice as I can but she doesn’t seem to think that it will work. Have told her to reach out to her family who has never really met her and see if she could offer them her services as a housemaid until she can find a job and start working on building her resume and getting her life started. She won’t have anything when she leaves, so she would basically be homeless. 

(this is only a brief summary of her situation I could write a book about this haha)

So, is there any advice that someone else may be able to give? I have run out of ideas and she has lost motivation due to being consumed by depression.

236,"Hello! I need a little help. I am currently in a gap year for college and I’ve moved back in with my parents while I am working and trying to save money. 

I want to go back to college next fall, but I don’t want to live in the dorms because honestly, I hated it. And it was more expensive than I can afford with all the other tuition I have to pay (I go to a private university). I took a gap year because I realized I wasn’t mentally ready to go back to college and I wanted to explore the world a little bit and travel around which I have done and am doing, but I think I’m ready to go back to college and take it more seriously than I did my first year. 

Both my parents supported me taking a year off and then going back, but now they are trying to talk me out of going back to my college and instead going to a college that is closer to home where I’d have to live at home (bc I cannot afford to live here on my own) and saying things like “well you didn’t do very well, how do we know that your current college isn’t too hard for you?” And dropping hints that if I choose go back to my college they won’t pay. Which is fine because I’ve got scholarships coming out of my ass, and my school is very generous with helping figure out student loans. But their attitude is a complete 180 from where they were during the summer. 

So I’ve decided to move out whether they like it or not. I live in the Bay Area in California which is a wayyy too expensive place for me to live. I want to move closer to my university which is an hour and a half inland, and in a town where rent is much cheaper. However, I don’t know how to start the process of looking for an apartment, finding roommates, figuring out the best deal, especially in a place that’s far from where I live. 

There’s also the issue that I live paycheck to paycheck, as I have to pay car insurance for my job (I drive a company car), cell phone bill, health insurance, etc. On top of that, the only thing I don’t have to pay for in my house is rent(thank god). I have to buy my own food, toiletries, clothes, which I am honestly okay with because it helps me feel more independent. 

My job is great and it’s in a field that I’m going to do things with with my degree, but the hours are extremely inconsistent and sometimes I make less than $400 a month with no benefits. I don’t want to leave it, but I think I might have to find a new job if I really want to get out. 

Do you guys have any advice for what I should do, or where I should start at least? I’m at a total loss, and I don’t know what to. Also sorry this is a little long. ",15Dec2017,2
237,"My SO ordered two pairs of shoes from the Adidas main website. Each pair shipped 1 day apart. She entered our apartment address without the apartment number. When she realized this she immediately opened a ticket with Adidas. The first pair that shipped arrived in the Luxor box at the apartment. Our apartment leasing office does not accept packages directly, they have the carriers go to the Luxor holding boxes near the garage. So the first pair arrived, without issue, girlfriend got them from the box.

The second pair shipped and the FedEx guy texted my girlfriend the morning of the delivery to confirm the apartment number since it wasn't on the package. She immediately replied with our number and the carrier never texted back. The package claimed to have arrived according to the FedEx website tracking later that day. The package was not in a Luxor box nor inside our bigger mailbox boxes.

Adidas website says wait 2 days before contacting them about shipments not received after the tracking date. We wait two days and contact them via website. No email is ever received from that contact. 3 days after that (5 days after the supposed deliver date) we call Adidas on the phone and get a lady. We tell her our story and she proceeds to file a claim with FedEx. She said the claim may take up to 30 days as FedEx will need to look into it.

Do we wait out the FedEx claim process? While I know my SO is partly at fault for forgetting the APT number on the initial order that seemed to be rectified since the first pair was delivered successfully. My biggest fear is that at the 30 day mark FedEx comes back and says ""oh you didn't put the address fully, sorry, too bad"" and then she's fleeced out of $100.

Should I leave him? And before you just plainly tell me 'yes', please keep in mind that I have been with the guy for almost 7 years, since I was fifteen. This isn't easy, which is why I'm turning to strangers on the internet (lol). Hope someone can understand and help... I really need it...

243,"My ex and I had been dating for 9 months and honestly we had a good relationship despite the normal arguments couples have. I even started going to therapy to help me gain some more confidence and self-assurance that wouldn't come from him. I was working on becoming more independent and secure with myself and he was being super supportive of it and we were doing much better. But I went away for a weekend and I was kind of afraid that if I did go away, he'd end up breaking up with me for some reason.


I came back and he did break up with me, but this was after we went on a dinner date (that we had planned to have when I came back) and after I tried to instigate physical intimacy. At first he turned me down by asking me if he could just hold me that night. But then he tried to distract me from asking him if everything was okay by going down on me. I knew something was up and I finally asked him if it was us and if he was breaking up with me. Literally the one thing I was afraid of happening happened and I was devastated.


We live together and we've been civil and he even calls me his best friend. We agreed to a year of living our own lives (our lease is up in march so we'll be seperated for a while) before we ""try"" again if we're ready for a relationship, but I'm honestly on the brink of hating him and just constantly being frustrated with his reasoning for the break up. He said he wasn't sure if he wanted to be in a long term relationship and that he needs to figure it out, but we got into this relationship with long term goals in mind and he had been so excited about it and had told friends and family about us.


I feel like his reasoning may make sense to him but he doesn't seem to understand why it's torn me up so much. One of his past relationships, the only other long term relationship he had wanted, the girl had been cheating on her bf to be with him and had said all these things about wanting to be with him long term and talked about a future together. He told me he ended up wanting that with her because she was so convicted of it but then she moved away and basically married her job and they drifted apart.


But with me, he says that my intentions were always clear and that my love for him never died so he knew it was genuine. And we honestly still act like we're still together, he still makes time to spend time with me and he and i still game and eat dinner together and whatever we did before. But I'm honestly very depressed and torn up about this because I was really ready to settle down with him (eventually) and he was set on that too with me and now it's all gone.

I felt horrible, because he made it seem like I don't care about how she's doing and only call for selfish reasons. In no means did I ever intend to make everything about me. Just because my mom has cancer doesn't mean that she isn't my mom anymore and can't help me out with problems that she otherwise would have. In fact, treating her like a sick patient would be the opposite of what she would want as I know she still wants to be involved in my life as she was before. 

Anyway, this is just kind of one example of what happens regularly. My father is extremely manipulative and openly jealous about the relationship I have with my mom. It really hurts to see him so dismissive about me and my brother when he was like this to my mom for DECADES. He would repeatedly call her stupid, lazy, and made her so anxious that when she got diagnosed with cancer she was afraid to even tell him out of fear of how he would react. I just hate his toxic presence in my life and I don't know how to deal with it and help my brother out too. Our relationship is honestly toxic as every time he yells at me or belittles me he makes up for it because ""it's just tough love"" and he'll go out and buy me a car (SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED). I feel awful because I literally can't stand him. How do I deal with this?",15Dec2017,2
249,"So I am the youngest in my department, but I’m almost 25 so I’m not really all that young.

A woman who works at my department who is over 20 years older than me has a huge heart for everyone there. She worries about the staff and jokes about it being the mom in her.

Yet when she expresses this about me, she feels the need to add a disclaimer that it’s not because of my age and that I’m not that young, and that she’d be this way toward the other people too. Then she starts pointing at other people like I’d be this way towards x, y, z.

This makes it weird, like it’s drawing attention to it when I hadn’t thought about it that way, or that she feels like I had to be told. Like I’d prefer it if she either didn’t express her worries at all or if she felt she had to that she didn’t feel the need to make this disclaimer, that she felt it was established that we are peers and that I understood this as just her personality toward everyone.

So I’m wondering could I be doing anything to make this weird? Can I make this less awkward?",15Dec2017,5
251,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend and I are both first semester freshman and pretty similar public universities, however lately she has been feeling like she has made the wrong decision to choose the college that she accepted. 

She was admitted undeclared at her current university, and her academic adviser told her that it would be a good idea to take four really heavy technical classes in preparation for transferring into her preferred major (biology), however she feels like she is under-performing in all of her classes and will not be able to achieve a GPA required to transfer into biology at any point.

We both come from an environment where kids are basically indoctrinated to believe that college degrees are the only gateway to success, and any minor setbacks equal imminent failure and she absolutely hates the academic environment where she is and gets so nervous and upset every day about her performance.

I was just wondering if anybody had any advice on how to get her motivated to keep going. I know her very well and she is a very bright student, but she struggles with accepting that just because she isn't the top 1%, that she will go nowhere in life. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",15Dec2017,6

257,"(Note: sorry for my broken English; it isn't my first language as you will notice)

I graduated High School unsure of what I should major in; I always liked art and drawing, so my family figured I should major in Design, right? 

I wasn't really sure about it though, and I wanted to take some time off to figure this out, but my mother forced me to immediately apply to the most prestigious and expensive school that offered this major. I really didn't wanted to take this route because my dad already had 3 credit card debts, and adding something that expensive would make his life more difficult. (Here in my country, college/university isn't that expensive compared to the U.S., so you can afford your education without those dreaded student loans, but my family doesn't have a lot of money, and we had to get one so I could get in the ""most prestigious"" design school of my country according to my mother.)

The thing is that, over my first year, I figured that I really wanted to major in Psychology; it was (and still is) something I'm passionate about. I even considered majoring in it before going with the Design option, but my mother told me that only ""crazy people"" majored in that and completely shut the idea off. I didn't defend my choice, because I used to be super insecure and I used to think that I was always wrong and everybody else was always right. I eventually outgrew this (over my first year) and I talked to my parents not only once, but several times during the course of my major, telling them I didn't feel comfortable majoring in Design and I wanted to change to Psych; but my mother said no every time.

Now, almost seven years later (yeah, I took that long) I'm about to graduate, and I completely hate my major. I can't see myself working in anything related to this. I just want to get a simple part-time job, while I major in Psychology like I wanted from the start (this time, I would be paying for my education, not my family), but I feel super guilty because my family spent a lot of money so I could graduate from Design, and I don't want them to feel like they lost their time or money on me.

Any advice?",15Dec2017,5

259,"Going to try and not make this so long. My boyfriend in the past has continuously searched women on his social media accounts. It could be anyone he finds attractive, he will stalk their page. He stalks his ex fiancé, girls from past relationships allll the time. He knew how much it effected me when I first found out and he claims that he has stopped however. So I went through his computer (I know I shouldn’t have) but it was obvious that he was still searching for the same women!! It’s been 7 months since this first happened and he’s still doing it yet looks me in my eyes and acts as if he’s talking from the heart when he tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he’s not searching women anymore. In the back of my mind i know he’s lying because I saw it in his computer already. What makes things worse is he constantly deletes his search history and he even told me he does it because he doesn’t want me to “worry”. Which makes no sense to me. Yes I may have some insecurities  that I’m dealing with due to my past but I’m working on it. However I just cannot get over the fact that he’s constantly searching women like WHY!? I just want to know what the crazy obsession is with constantly searching females. Is it just a guy thing? Should I not be worried ? I mean  He will try hard to find them on fb/IG. Never messages them. So thats why I feel that I honestly shouldn’t be worried about it as much but sometimes he even tries to find women who he’s had encounters with at the car dealership, or females who worked at the dental office he went to. For example his searches looked something like “Cassandra monarch dental” and “Cristina Hyundai” and there will be multiple searching trying to find these women. I shouldn’t worry but at the same time I do because it’s like what do these women have that I don’t? Why is he so obsessed with constantly stalking their pages and pictures. Im probably way over my head with this but it bothers me and I need to find ways to stop worrying so much about this. No I don’t want to leave the relationship I want to be with him. He is a great guy and I know there’s potential for our relationship. I just don’t know how to deal with this social media stuff. We have talked about these things in the past and to be honest his communication skills aren’t very good. He has anger issues and he would be instantly set off if I tried to talk to him about this so that’s why I’m reaching out for advice on ways to just let it go and stop worrying about what he’s doing unless I happen to see signs of infidelity which I honestly don’t think would happen.",15Dec2017,2
260,"Hello everyone, thank you for reading. I am turning 28 today and I realize just how incredibly crazy I am. I have a full time job with benefits, I get along well with my boss and coworkers, I pay my taxes, I pay my bills, I have an HSA, I have $30,000 + in savings, I workout to maintain a healthy BMI, and by all accounts I present myself to the world as a normal woman. 

However, if anyone was to look closer they would see there is something very wrong with me. I have no friends. I haven't had a friend in over 7 years. I politely refuse invitations to events because I'm terrified of people getting too close to me or knowing too much about me. When social contact is unavoidable, I lie about myself in order to 1) distance myself because I will not be able to continue knowing them since the lie will be unraveled 2) to ease social tension, since the truth would make everyone uncomfortable. The funny thing is that I can be very charming when I lie, and ironically I make people feel welcome/at ease with me while simultaneously pushing them away (they are not getting close to ""me"", they are getting close to a lie). It's like I am in some sort of pathetic spy movie where I need to pretend to pass as a normal person. 

It goes without saying I don't have a SO, but I fully acknowledge it is probably for the best that I don't have one. I can't even allow myself to get close to people as friends; I probably would implode if I tried to open up to a SO. I am honestly intimidated by men, but I can put a mask on in front of them and be completely normal around them. I can even flirt and pretend I am totally unintimidated, but internally I am planning escape routes to get out of social interactions like these.

Anyway, I would like advice on how to start fixing this. Therapy is definitely something I have considered, but I am not really sure how to find one? I have insurance that will cover some of the cost (I checked) but I am not sure how to find the right therapist for my situation. Any tips? I am afraid someone will just say to ""get out there"" but the thing is I can go out and talk to people, I just constantly lie   and adopt this alter ego persona of a ""normal woman"" to avoid reality.

281,"I brought my mother to a psych ward in the middle of the night two days ago. She thankfully consented to voluntary treatment. Now that she is there, I have so many questions. I'd like to get advice from any professionals in this field, or anyone that has gone through a similar experience. 

How do I interact with her? What information should I be requesting from the hospital? How should I handle her workplace, mortgage, and all of her other bills? 


**Warning: long text incoming. You can stop here if you just want to give general advice about the questions above.**

I called her workplace and the bank that handles her mortgage and informed them that she is in the hospital. Tried asking for her medical records, prescriptions, and the names of her case worker and primary doctor. Unfortunately, the only person privy to this information is my sister, who is 600 miles away taking final exams. To make matters worse, my sister is going to Ecuador for most of winter break and then immediately back to college. 

Efforts to persuade my mom to sign a release form for myself or her sister (who is a nurse practitioner) have been unsuccessful. I intend to bring my sister up to speed and have her request all of this information after she finishes her finals. 

Aside from my sister, my mom doesn’t trust anyone right now. She claims that her boyfriend is threatening to send her to prison and steal her house for helping him commit benefits fraud. She has a multi-unit home and he asked her to claim that he is a tenant living in the floor below. She insists that her phone calls were being monitored and that her co-workers, my father, and I are all cooperating with this fraud investigation. 

She called my sister in the middle of the night and told her that ""whatever happens to me, the house will belong to you and your brother (me)."" My sister begged her to get help and then called me. My mom actually drove herself to a hospital shortly afterwards and that's where I met her. I then took her to another nearby hospital that specializes in mental health.

First thing she asked me is if I was there to commit her or take her to jail.. also borrowed my phone and started texting my dad and others without telling them it wasn’t me, asking them why they think *I* should commit her and to tell her information about the fraud reports on her. 

The most bizarre thing that she did was asking my aunt what she has to do to get committed. She is convinced that by pleading insanity, she can escape these fraud charges. She also asked my father to seize control over her mortgage if she gets committed. 

This makes me think she could be putting on an act, but she most definitely is not well. She has provided no proof of this investigation she is talking about. No one is conspiring against her and it makes absolutely zero sense for her boyfriend to blackmail her with the threat of revealing that she helped him get disability illegally. That would be self-incrimination. 

Even if they crossed a few lines, she does not need to go through these lengths. I’ve tried explaining that there is legal recourse she can take. Her boyfriend has a history of domestic violence and I personally wouldn’t doubt it if she felt threatened into falsifying documents. Furthermore, I don’t think the punishment for disability fraud is as severe as she thinks it is. Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems that the typical punishment for first time offenses in the US is paying back any funds received with an additional fine tacked on.  The fraudulent beneficiary would also lose the ability to collect for 6 months. Jail sentences seems to be reserved for medical/insurance professionals, repeat offenders, and individuals who are stealing benefits meant for the children &amp; elderly.

My mom has always had severe anxiety and has left multiple jobs because of unfounded suspicions of her co-workers gossiping about her or trying to get her fired. Mental illness also runs in our family. My mother's father was schizophrenic and one of the doctors I spoke with yesterday diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder and acute psychosis. It apparently was not the first time she had been there, but I’ve never seen her this bad.

I don't have the best relationship with my mom and honestly don't know how to talk with her. I’d like to know what I can say or do to help her get out of the hospital and set her up to succeed when/if she gets released. ",15Dec2017,2

Now we’ve been together for about 5 months and they still talk which honestly I felt abit weirded out about as they FaceTime and he bought her a testy on his holiday etc... but I didn’t really say much.

Then she let me look on her phone and I discovered he had previously sent her texts how he would like to wake up in bed next to her etc, she never really replied with anything flirtatious but he was clearly keen.

Fastforward to now, they were still talking and FaceTiming regularly which I am extremely uncomfortable with, at like 1/2am! He then sends many messages with flirtatious undertones and plenty of “;)” emojis. She hasn’t sent any back but allows it to continue and he knows she is with me so I find it very inappropriate and discouraging that she isn’t stopping it. He then complimented her drawing and asked her to “draw a picture of him ;)” and he “can send one ;)”. Now I honestly think that is a joke.

I told her I am extremely uncomfortable with this all... I don’t want to start an argument. After the picture drawing text she admitted she finally realised he was being flirtatious (after only 7 months only realised now) and she understands. But says she feels bad if she stops talking to him.

I don’t know what to do or how to react. 

She is talking to, FaceTiming a guy in another country in the early hours of the morning, recievejg gifts of him, allowing him to flirt with her continuously. And makes me feel in the wrong if I speak up telling me I can’t tell her who she can be friends with

Granted, this has always been a question/concern of mine, but recently it’s felt more vital that I figure this out. I’m still living at home, but have plans to move in with my girlfriend next summer. I suppose I’m scared by the thought of getting stuck working a job I hate but can’t afford to leave due to financial restrictions.
 
My first “real job” was working for an IT company that my Dad works for. Although the beginning was very stressful, as I knew practically nothing about computers when I started, things evened out after 4-6 months. After another year and a half though, I started to hate the job. They’re a small company and a lack of employees left us spread thin. Not only that, I just started to resent the work I did. My job brought me very little satisfaction aside from the money I was making.  So I quit.

The plan was to take a month or two off, do some soul searching, and then find “the right job.” Flash forward 7 months. I’m still unemployed. I was having a hard time deciding what I should even be applying for. Most of my passion lies in music, yet I know that’s a hard field to find a job in. I thought about applying at a music store, but I feared it would be more retail than music. On the other hand, I felt reluctant to start another job I had no interest in, fearing I would just leave and have to start over. Then one day, my Dad comes home and tells me one of his company’s clients have a job opening. I gave them a call, and they took a chance on me. I knew I needed something, so I accepted. 

Now here I am, roughly 4 months into this job and feeling similar to how it was before I left my last job. I know I can’t just quit like last time with nothing to fall back on. Not if I want to still move out by summer. 

So I find myself back at square one. I know I should probably be happy with what I have. Surely other people would kill to be in my position. Yet hear I am. I’m not sure what I’m asking here. Should I just keep hopping jobs until I find something I like? Has anybody found themselves in a similar experience? Thanks.

I have extremely bad social anxiety that only seems to get worse with each failure and I feel like I've gotten to a point where I'm judged and rejected for this being a virgin at this age, especially since I'm not that ugly; keep my body in shape, have a six pack etc.

It's really fucking with my head at this point and was wondering whether I should just get a hooker and get it over with.",15Dec2017,2
295,"The title sounds kinda dumb, but hear me out. I understand what I'm saying, so I'll try to make as much sense possible

I met this person 5-6 years ago, and we dated for 2 years, remained best friends for 2 years, broke off friendship.

Now last time we got in touch, I broke our friendship because I was brutally depressed to see her with her boyfriend so lovely and in touch, it fucked me up hard for 2-3 months. And therefor, she sent me a long nasty message telling me to kill myself &amp; whatnot ( Which she NEVER said anything like this in her life, and YES it was my fault )

So it's been a long time, and, looking at her past streams, I kinda miss this girl. She's so cool, always was, funny as FUCK, and at one point in life, it was just me &amp; her that were best friends, &amp; no one else for a LONG time. In other words, we were close from skin to bones.

What's your advice? Thanks!",15Dec2017,2

298,"Okay so I'm having some issues working out whether or not i am justifiable owed anything (for want of a better word) based on the circumstances that have arisen as of yesterday.  There is a lot of information so i am going to try and write down in a bullet-point like format chronologically.

- Based on my own advice/desires, my father and I mined Litecoin together as a joint project way back in 2014. We mined 110 all up and they were stored on my fathers laptop. The current value of the Litecoin is $30,000 - $15,000 of which I would deem to be mine if we had them today. 

- My Dad sold the laptop, presumably he forgot about the coins or didn't deem the value to be worthwhile keeping. (Admittedly, until yesterday I had also forgotten about the coins.) There is no backup and no conceivable way of getting the coins back.

- I recommend that my Dad buys bitcoin - he buys two for the price of roughly $2500. The value of which, when you add the other benefits that have accrued, sits at around $40,000.

- I have been sending my dad regular updates on the price of bitcoin over the last year and urging that he attempts to recover them (with guides/suggestions of how etc)

- My dad has attempted, then given up on recovering the bitcoins and assumed that they are completely lost.

- Yesterday, just on a whim, I decide to check to see if we had any Litecoin left. I find the ledger, contact my dad and find that the laptop has been sold and they are not recoverable. 

- In the process of uncovering the Litecoin, I found some information on an old spreadsheet which sparks an idea for search terms for a new attack on finding old Bitcoin wallet backups. I find an old wallet of mine (with an insignificant amount of money left on it) and excitedly email my dad instructions on how to find his wallet and recover the coin.

- My dad recovers the coins, amounting to roughly $40,000 worth.

This was late in the evening, and then I struggled to sleep - playing over in my mind the $15,000 I could have had if there was only a back-up of the Litecoin wallet / the laptop was still in my fathers possession. And then thinking of the $40,000 that I had found for my dad when he showed no signs at all of trying to find them further. He had completely written off those Bitcoins, or at least refused to enact any further recovery methods.

I have a feeling of being owed 55 Litecoin ($15,000), but am unable to work out if that is justifiable or if that is just my inner selfish human nature showing.

Thoughts?

Edit: I know legally it's his and he can do with it what he wants, I just think I'd act differently if the tables were turned.

Edit 2: More thoughts uncovered from a reply below - I would be happy to write off the lost Litecoin as an accident. In this case though, the process of me trying to recover those Litecoin, directly resulted in the discovery of his Bitcoin, and that's why I'm conflicted. My Dad wouldn't have any Bitcoin without my actions - and we would both still have the Litecoin if it had not been lost as a result of his actions. If the tables were turned I would feel obliged to offer to replace the lost Litecoin - or again, perhaps that is selfish human nature blinkering my perception!! I'm certain I would least offer a finders fee for the Bitcoin regardless of the Litecoin.

301,Girlfriend claims she wants to save up money to move in with me so we can both move out of parent's houses. How much is enough to move out safely? Looking at spending maybe 300 each for rent possibly? She says save up for a couple years. ,15Dec2017,2
302,"So I just turned 17 and I got a job in March this year at a restaurant and I don’t make much. My parents who I love deeply, ask for money a lot and say they will pay me back but delay it or sometimes forget until I remind them. Most of the time it’s like $20-$50 but on some occasions it is $200+! They pay for my phone, some groceries, and the roof over my head but not much else. I pay for my clothes, computer for my school, and most of the food I eat because we can’t afford groceries most of the time. I don’t have a car because we can’t afford to get my license so I ride my bike to work. Recently they borrowed $200 and they were supposed to pay me back today (12/15/17) but now they won’t pay me for 2 more weeks. When I was on the phone with my dad I was getting upset that he wasn’t paying me back for 2 more weeks and then he snapped. Yelled about how he pays for my phone and the roof over my head and how I am sad about not getting my $200 back for another 2 weeks. Then he apologized later but begs me not to tell my mom he snapped at me because she will get mad at him. I am really stuck. Can’t leave or not say no because then they will take away my electricity and phone. What should I do? ",15Dec2017,2

How bad is it if I tell her I've already bought my own gift and bring in some nice Christmas cookies from my local bakery?

I've never been asked, let alone told, I had to contribute for a gift for my boss before.

There are five of us in the office not including my manager (who I assume is also contributing) so that is over $300 for a gift.

Update: So I told my manager I would not be participating and this was her response:

""Hello, are you sure you don’t want to be a part of it? A christmas gift is a thank you for being generous to us for the year, as he is to all of us with what he pays us. Its up to you, but I just want to be sure! ""

This office is extremely small (7 people), the boss is sketchy (wasn't w2ing anyone until I complained he was trying to 1099), and run by some very young, naive, girls that simply don't know what a normal work environment is like (aka - you don't give your boss $50+ dollars for a gift).

How do I fully forgive a person and let go of the past? This person is very involved in my life and has caused me a great deal of pain. They feel very bad about what they have done. They have apologized and they have for real changed and haven’t hurt me like that since...

So why do I still feel SO bad about it sometimes? It’s like I relive it in my head on some days. And then I end up feeling angry and hurt all over again.

I can't even do things that I love anymore, most of the time I just lay in bed. The last few weeks I've stayed at home more often than not. The work that I have to catch up is getting overwhelming, which triggers my panic disorder even more. I try to take as little of xanax as possible, as I don't want to get addicted and will get new antidepressiva soon.

The problem is I've developed feelings for her but she is a happily married girl and even if she wasn't, she'd never see me in that way. I think about her often and daydream and it hurts to not be with her. Feeling this way is unhealthy and also unfair to her so I want to get over it. The first thing everyone says is you should distance yourself from your crush in order to get over it.  
   
So I avoid her, keep answers to yes and no, and try to keep it as curt and professional as possible. But she's asking me if things are wrong or if she's hurt me somehow because I'm acting differently.  
   
Obviously I can't tell her how I really feel because nothing will come out of that and it will just ruin my career here, but I'm trying to stop our friendship without being an asshole.

319,"My great grandmother used to host christmas. A long table which everyone sat. She used her best china. She had large crystal bowl which she would put eggnog in with matching cups. It was really nice.

My mother has been doing christmas for some years now. Last christmas she used paper plates and had chairs around the house for people to sit with their plate in their lap. Ultimately everyone scooted the chairs to a table so they could eat.

Mother has been getting angrier over the years. She has always had an angry sullen way about her. Last christmas she was grossly angry because I told her not to speak to me in a certain way. Very controlling and stubborn, quick to become irate.

Sister is a lot like mom. In part because mom is as she is. Sister lives in the same city as mom and Im sure is frustrated. Mom doesnt treat her right. Never goes to her house. If we attempted to have christmas there it would probably be all hell.

They recently were going at it in dm's on facebook about the time and day we would have dinner. Mom not budging on the day when there is no reason not to accommodate sister who has work.

Earlier, before that argument, I let it slip to mother that I was really offended that we used paper plates last year and no table. People made remarks. 

I have to take trains and planes to get there and it usually takes a half day or more to get there. 
I feel slighted that the one day we have dinner she cant use regular plates. It seems trivial as all hell for me to make an issue of it. 

But then I think its also trivial that we cant have some level of decorum for christmas dinner given the effort and expense I take to get there.

As well mother wants to serve barely any food at all. Like a ham and appetizer type foods. I told her I will pay for all the food and cook everything. Her, sister and niece can clean up.

Last year it became a big issue because I bought a cooked turkey to add to the ham. Mother became angry because I bought a turkey.


Given the fighting between mother and sis which has already erupted and this seemingly trivial issue Im thinking Ill just go skiing. Maybe have christmas dinner at a hotel in my city.

tldr: Moms getting mean and wont make an effort at xmas or allow anyone else to. Spend significant money and time to attend lazy christmas dinner?

So I got into this month long course in London, and it has helped me a lot, but I just know that, now that it has finished,  I'll go home and fall again into that routine of ""Oh I can do this easy I'll wait a bit"" and that is a thing I don't want to do, also, since I work at home, I'll have access to all of my games, and well of course internet.

321,"Context: I am a 21 year old Latino male. My mother is in her mid 40s and is divorced. She basically raised me as a single mother. She is extremely over protective of me. She does not drink or smoke. She has had a history of depression. She lives alone and is often lonely. 

My mother only works a part time job as an instructional assistant for students with special needs. She very heavily depends on my father financially. My father works like a dog 6 days a week, getting up at 4 or 5 am every day to work. Meanwhile my mom only works part time and she often goes on shopping sprees at Ross or other stores. Her closet is full of clothes and shoes she doesn’t even wear.  A family friend paid for my mother to get a bachelor of science in human service. She has a college degree now, however she will not apply to any full time positions. She refuses to use technology (online applications, cell phone apps, medication or medical procedures). She is extremely superstitious. She only works Monday through Friday and she receives all school holidays as breaks (including all of summer and Christmas/winter break). She spends every day after work in front of the TV for hours. She is barely active, she only walks for exercise. I am trying to teach her to stretch and exercise but she is very impatient and lazy. She is about 30+ pounds overweight and she is constantly complaining about her body and aches and pains, however she is not willing to exercise more or count calories. She has no self control when it comes to eating. She is also a hoarder, she has her apartment chock full of useless junk that she refuses to get rid of. The apartment is a shithole but she is too lazy to clear out her living space.

What should I do in my position? All she does is complain about her financial situation, her messy apartment, her bodily pains, and the fact that she is overweight and lonely, but she will not make any effort to apply to jobs, exercise more, or count calories using the my fitness pal app I have been trying to get her to use. My mom is slowly killing herself. She is miserable and in a rut and no matter what I do she won’t get off her ass.

We have a daughter together and she has three kids with her husband now. He had a daughter from a previous relationship whom this is about. She is 11 years old and may be a lesbian. She has mentioned being jealous because of her “girlfriend” at school. I put girlfriend in quotes there because she’s 11 and I have no way of knowing if this girl feels the same way.

326,"If you read my post history you're likely to tell me that I'm mentally and emotionally unstable. I would agree this is true.

I was going to school in a town about five hours away from my home city. I spent the entirety of my first year of college there, enjoyed it, but there were also some very negative things which happened there which ultimately led me to PTSD. I ran away from school and responsibility as a result of this and lived out of a van for several months. Eventually, I had to come to terms with the fact that mental illness was ruining my life, and I moved back home with my parents to recover. 

Fast forward to now, and I've been doing a lot better. I'm on medication, working a job I love, and in general, starting to feel a little bit more like I actually might have a place and a role in the world. However, the whole time I've been home it's been with the goal of recovering from mental problems so I could go back to school at the same university.

I just got an email from the housing office confirming that I've been placed in the dorm I signed up for. They gave me all my move in details.

Suddenly I'm terrified. Feelings just flooded in. Here in my home city, I've become rather happy, almost. At least as close to happy as I feel is possible right now. I am in love with my work, really like my coworkers, and really enjoy being in this city as an adult. I'm realizing that this is a place I want to live and work long term. I feel like at this company I have a future career waiting for me (my boss has been suggesting this a lot and I believe him) doing work I love. 

That, along with a lot of negativity that kind of revolves around the geographic location of the university I'm now signed up to return to, has me feeling like going back might actually not be that good of an idea. It might not be good for my mental health and it might not be good for my career path in general. I feel like there is a good chance I'd be way better off staying here, going to community college to finish up my degree, and keep working for this company to move up the ladder.

If I stay here, my path in life feels more predictable and comfortable. If I leave, there is a chance I'll have a blast but also a real chance I'll just sort of freak out again.

I really don't know what to do. I can't focus on anything. I'm in a panic. Help.",15Dec2017,1
