1,"Hi, 
I'm currently in Grade 10 and in the pre-IB programme. I have course selection coming up soon in February, and I have 'most' things figured out. At my school, there are IB packages offered instead of courses,

1.IB11L1  Life Sci. (Bio)    Psych HL, Chem SL, Bio HL
2.IB11L2  Life Sci. (Bio/Chem)    Psych SL, Chem HL, Bio HL
3.IB11l3   Life Sci. (Bio/Econ)     Econ HL, Chem SL, Bio HL
4.IB11E1  Engineering/Physical Sci.  Econ HL, Physics SL, Chem HL
5.IB11E2  Engineering/Physical Sci Psych HL, Physics SL, Chem HL
6.IB11S1  Soc. Sci/Business(Bio)  Psych HL, Econ HL, Bio SL
7.IB11S2  Soc. Sci/Business (Physics) Psych HL, Econ HL, Physics SL

I'm planning to major in physics, so I'm planning to take either package 4 or 5. But the thing is, I'm not sure on whether to take Economics or Psychology. I've talked to a bunch of people, and they all say to take Econ, mainly because it's easier, and it's more 'math'  rather than just plain memorizing. Apparently, Psych is more harder and it's more understanding of the concepts. I'm trying to look at both of these courses with equal views, but I'm stuck. Psychology to me, seems harder, more interesting, and more respected. While Economics seems like the course where it's math and business orientated, and a course where everyone can get easy marks. So the question I need the answer to is....
Should I take the course with the chances of getting easier marks, or should I take the course that's harder but more interesting? Thanks!

3,"Hello, everyone! So.. Let's start from beggining. I'd this girlfriend, I was at 23yo and she 27yo, living a distance relationship, at some point she got pregnant. So I ask if her could move to my the city that I was living, where I had a good job and a promising career. she said no, because she would like to stay close to her family. I understand, since we're just together for about a year and then a I come back to my city and move to her house to stay close to my son and her as well. months later, our soon was born and we remain together for a year. at this point, discussions were starting to become disrespecting and I decided to broke up to preserve my son. I grew up in a enviroment with many discussions and fights and I do not want this to my son. She came to me many times talking to come back but I was decided and said no everytime. we dated some times too. one year late, I was really drunk and called her  saying tons of bullshit. she got really upset and decided to never come back to me again. I fall in the dark, realized many times the shit that I have done and how I could make the things different, but this time she was decided too, and said many times too me that we will never be together again. I understood the fact based on the shit that I had done. one more year pass, she started flerting with me, but everytime I tryed to talk with her about our relationship, she always runs from the argument saying that dont know about us and is conviced that will not work. okay.. everytime that happens I fed wishes and hopes. that happed about three times that year. meanwhile I was getting out with friends and meeting other people as her as well. I always noticed that when this happen, she asks me questions about my personal life. another year pass, now our soon has 4yo, and same thing happened two times. this week, is the second time. she said that love me I replied and again, she asks about my new year celebrate and if I was with one girld that I've met. I was not with this girl, so I said. Again, I start feeding whises and hopes.

4,"In a week well both be 17, Sorry if this is messy as it is written in The middle of a sleepless might.


Hes been been passionetly in love with me for long and ive been unsure about my feelings, for months weve had this ambivalent relationshib claiming to be be friends but with sexual/romantic stuff happening and me asking if it was ok i saw other guys, and then feeling guilty and never doing it despite having permission and me Also feeling guilty for stuff happening (hurting him) but him insisting it was ok/stopping would hurt more and me having Poor self control and that it juust seemed to happen.

sexual stff was actually the simple part as i tried to keep that rge down, but i also wanted to shower him witth love and see him smile, and do everything to be kind to him (while he grewemotionally dependant on the intimacy) without feeling like i was leading him on or otherwise hurting himm.

The thing is, one one hand i had a strong drive to to experiment, and i know That he isnt perfectly what im looking for on the other i love him so fucking much i think of him constsntly, i fall asleep to the thought of cuddling him and i masturbate to the thought of him. I am a person of fantasy and often  daydream about idealized relationships with both him and others.


The thing is, my love goes deeper than just attraction, weve both recently lost decade long former best friends and we help each other in life and aside from the pseoudo relationshib Its proberly been the healtheist friendship we/i have had for a long time. He wants to know me for many years, and plantonically or not i want the same, and i deeply love him.we communicate about everything and he knows all my doubts mentioned here.


Tonight i finally have in and became his girlfriend, he was overjoyed but i felt nausous and regretted It, it was as if all attraction to him died right there and was replased with feeling trapped.

We said we would fiqure out the rules (wheter i was allowed to pursue others, and how much info he wanted about it later) and go to bed and i couldnt sleep.


Now after i was finally starting to calm down, attraction starying to return and feeling we could fiqure it out without me beeing a terrible piece of shit i stumbled across the ""worst reason for breakup with you"" thread on askreddit and ""im so afraid of loosing you lets be friends instead"" being the highest upvoted with all but one reply agreeing that was impsoble i researsed and the first thing i saw agreed as Well.




Are we just young and stupid or is there ANYTHING i can Do to avoid loosing/hurting him?.




Plantonically or not i love this man and i want to know him for as much of my life as possible, i dont want to treat him badly and i am TERRIFIED of loosing him.

5,"I live in the UK, and I’ve been on the waiting list for a government job for over 6 months. Today I got the call. I was very excited as it became apparent that I was being offered the job. I’m pretty much unskilled on paper, and my current earning potential in the private sector is around £16-17k, at maximum. My last job was £14k and I’ve been unemployed for over 6 months. I’m in some pretty decent credit card debt (which I’ve totally curbed in the last few months), have no savings and still live with my parents. I don’t have a driver's licence and never went to university.

&amp;nbsp;

The job I’m being offered offers £23k to start. So you’d think I’d be over the moon and wouldn’t have trouble accepting. But I do.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is, the job requires me to completely relocate to a different part of the country. I’m OK with dropping my entire life in principle (I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago, I’m unemployed and my friends have almost all moved away over the past few years). My issue is that I don’t know how to get started in a new life and it produces a huge anxiety. As I said before, I have no money in the bank and have no idea how I’d just “up and move” to a new city, which is a pretty big initial outlay for someone with no money in the bank. I’m confident that I could borrow the money in several ways to get started, but the idea of borrowing even more money creates anxiety.

&amp;nbsp;

The other problem I have is that this is a government job. I truly know that I won’t get many social opportunities from it, because I roughly know the demographics of my potential colleagues. They’ll mostly be 15-20 years older than me. Which leads to an image of me in a one bedroom flat/apartment in an unfamiliar place with absolutely no social life.

&amp;nbsp;

So what should I do? I don’t really know what I’m asking. Has anyone reading this ever moved for a job? Was that job pretty unsocial? I just need someone to look at my situation from the outside and tell me if this is a no brainer, I guess.

&amp;nbsp;

TL:DR - I have been offered a job way away from home, for more money than I could earn anywhere else. Do I change my entire life and live a potentially lonely existence to pursue it?

6,"Hello /r/advice. I come to you seeking help... First some back story - I'm a 16 year old, who due to circumstances had to start work as soon as I left secondary school (aged 16 in the UK). 8 months down the line, it's become apparent that although I like where I work it won't last long. They are just capping me currently and preventing my career progress. The advice I need is regarding changing jobs. 

Being only 16 means I don't have A-Levels or a degree, only experience. The level of which I know is high, but to employers in the IT industry isn't meeting entry requirements as I can't display my skills on paper. 

I guess my question is where do I go? Dose anyone know any tech companies looking for a python developer or hardware specialist based in the U.K.? I'm willing to travel, where should I start looking for placements? I've sent out 40+ emails so far with little to no reply... and I'm starting to lose faith in my future. Can anyone lend any advice? Thank you, Greg.",05Jan2017,1
8,"My girlfriend has trouble sleeping and it makes it hard for us to spend time together. She often can't get to sleep until morning (~5 AM) and then sleeps until the afternoon. If she tries to go to bed earlier, she still sleeps just as late. If she tries to wake up earlier, she is either tired and napping throughout the day, or will stay up all night and still go to sleep in the morning.

I wanted to go over to her house and hang out tomorrow from about 8 AM-3 PM but she said she would probably be asleep the whole time. Whenever she comes over to my house she goes to sleep as well.

Is there something she could do to help her sleeping patterns? Is there any way I can help her? I don't know what to do but it just makes a lot of stuff hard.",05Jan2017,1
9,"I wouldn't consider myself an avid reader (though I would like to be), nor would I say I dislike it. I do actually have the motivation to sit down and read a book, I even keep a pretty decent list of literary works I want to look into. 

But holy hell, I cannot stay awake long enough to finish them. 

I find myself drifting off within the first few pages of any large body of work. I'm completely fine reading small things like articles online (which is actually kind of frustrating now that I think about it), it's mainly just books that put me to sleep. I would say though that I am more prone to tiredness than the average person in general; pulling an all-nighter is nearly impossible for me, and I have had trouble staying completely alert while driving (maybe the problem is bigger than just reading books...)

My girlfriend mentioned that I might just need glasses for my reading problem, because of something to do with straining my eyes... I don't know if that is a thing or not. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Thanks! ",05Jan2017,2

13,"Throwaway time! I asked the same question on /r/AskReddit, but apparently it wasn't appropriate (too specific) so it was removed. Basically the only serious response I got was something along the lines of ""if you can't work, you can't fuck"". The argument was that if my mental state is such that I cannot work my emotional state must therefore be so volatile that I would impose undo stress upon whatever woman decided to interact with me, or that I am unable of handling the stress of engaging in relations. Even a ""casual"" situation, to use the parlance of our times, would be impossible for me as I lack the necessary emotional regulation to maintain behave in a manner that would be appropriate for the level of commitment.

23,"I am really fucking up at life right now, I really want to change. I recently lost my best friend of 8 years due to my behavior towards her. I was an asshole and I often took out all of my frustrations with myself and my life on her. She ended the friendship. Just now, my older cousin just ended his friendship with me due to my behavior, the way I treat ppl, and the way I live my life. My mom has told me multiple times that if I wasn't her daughter, she would have cut me off by now. My brother said the same, he would have cut me off if I wasn't his sister. I grew up with an abusive father and picked up his habits. I emotionally abuse ppl, manipulate them, and use them for my own selfish needs. I'm extremely selfish and I don't really care about other ppl and their needs. I have a really bad temper and I often say really hurtful things to ppl that I later regret. This morning my mom woke me up to do the dishes. I almost yelled at her and told her that I'd take all the dishes, put them in a trash bag, and throw it outside so that it smashes on the concrete. I wasn't actually going to do it, but I was close to saying it. On top of how disrespectful I am to my mom, I'm still living off her. She pays for EVERYTHING. I'm in college &amp; I have an unpaid internship, but I still feel shitty about not taking care of myself. I'm also terrified of being independent. 

I get why ppl don't want to be around me. If I was them, I would want to cut me off too. I'm so frustrated with myself and my life rn. I was thinking about ending my life, I won't do it but it crossed my mind. I hate the way I act and I hate myself. I don't have any friends, I don't know how to make any friends because I have low self esteem. 

I know everything that I'm doing wrong but I just can't seem to stop. I lost the best friend I've ever had in my entire life because I couldn't stop being emotionally abusive. 

I'm 22, ppl around me are talking about having kids, but I can't have kids if I'm this type of person. I have been trying to change for a long time. I fully accept everything that I've done wrong, and I know what I'm doing, I don't get why I can't just stop. 

This is driving me crazy. Im supposed to work out, mediate, eat healthier, have better hygiene, but I can't seem to keep up with everything due to lack of motivation. Not to mention my bad weed habit.

It is about 2 hours away so I would have had to live on campus. My parents were dead set on having me attend school A. Their main reason was money and they said that if i didn't like it i could transfer. I disagreed and paid for my deposit at school B myself. They then got infuriated and basically forced me to remove my deposit and pick the local school. They promised me a newer car in exchange to make my commute better. I knew I would hate school A but i figured the lower cost would soon justify it. Fast forward to now. I have just completed my first semester at school A and I have not received a newer car, I am absolutely miserable and I have developed a fairly unhealthy depression. I also was able to see the cost of tuition for school A on my account and it is only slightly cheaper than what school B would have been. I want to transfer but every time I bring it up, my parents flip out and act really strange even though I tell them they agreed to let me transfer. I have saved up enough money as to where I can afford an apartment at school B and am looking to transfer but I am afraid of my parents reaction and I feel as though they would stop helping me out with tuition.

42,"I'll try to make this as short as possible because there is so much info to cover. Long story short, I recently moved away to college and roomed with two of my friends who also went to the same college. (I know I know, you're never supposed to room with friends but I was moving three hundred miles away and wanted to have someone I know close) About three months ago one of my roommates, let's call him John, got a boyfriend. Over the three months his boyfriend, we will call him Will, has proven time and time again how much of an asshole he is. For at least the past month John has been trying to move Will in to our apartment. Even after telling John numerous times that we don't want him to move in, Will has been staying the night every night. This finally accumulated at New Years Eve when Will messages me and went off on me. I then told John I didn't want him in the apartment anymore and he didn't say anything, and two days later he has been staying the night again.

I'm going to describe the many texts he sent me because a lot of it dealt with things I had brought up with John.

1) Said he had an issue with me because I had quit my job a few months prior and apparently John has to put more money in for rent and utilities. This is untrue because, while I didn't have a job, my fiancee did and we put in the amount John specified.

2) Said that he was ""stressing all the time"" making sure that John had a ride. I've told John multiple times that we will give him rides if he wants, and that we gave him rides before Will and can do it after. 

3) Then said he will pay rent (despite me saying time and time again that I don't want him moving in) but said ""do not force me to do chores like go get cat food and then y'all get rid of them."" Firstly, we never forced him to do anything let alone asked him to get cat food. Secondly we are getting rid of our cats because we don't have the time to take care of them and all they do is make messes that John refuses to help clean up. 

3) Claimed that he ""as a guest"" he took out trash and washed dishes. I know for a fact he didn't because me, my other roommate, and fiancee are always taking out the trash and washing dishes constantly. 

4) For a few days a few months ago one of our mutual friends came to visit. Me and my fiancee paid for ingredients and she made us dinner. Before she came over me, my fiancee, and my other roommate cleaned the house spotless. The next day he asked me to move some of my stuff from the dinning room table. I told him it was fine, that we had just wiped down that table. He proceeded to put my stuff on the floor and wipe it down. He then washed two dishes (I remember because I counted). Then he helped himself to the food without asking (something he has done a lot of the past few months). He ranted at me saying about how he deserved food because he had cleaned up and how I was so rude.

5) Claimed I stole his best friend. We met his two friends after John introduced us. About the same time we became tired of Will's actions. They told us about how he had gotten into drugs and became intolerable and how they didn't want to put up with it any longer just like us. When I told his ex-best friend about how I had stole her she just laughed.

6) He has said many inappropriate comments towards me and my fiancee. He has made many comments about my weight and, most disturbingly, said he wanted to molest my fiancee and watch her get raped. He ""apologized"" but then went on to say that it was a compliment and that he would never touch her because he was John. 

Adding to all of this, he got upset with us when we asked him to stop smoking weed in the apartment, has invited people over to the apartment that we didn't know, calling us liars and claiming we never clean anything, coming into our rooms without knocking, and much more stuff we have brought up to John. 

After telling John I didn't want him in the apartment, he still let Will stay the night. When I brought it up, his basic reply was ""It's fine, he won't be a bother (Which I have heard so many times it's not even funny), and that he didn't know what Will said to me but that he was sorry and would try to be better (which again, I've heard before.)

I'm at my wits ends. No matter how many times I've told John I will not tolerate Will in the apartment any longer but he hasn't listened. He has even given Will a key to the apartment and can come and go as he pleases.

But the issue is the bathroom light isn't fully covered and the living room light isn't covered, it's a disk style lamp hung from the ceiling with an exposed bulb.

So if I screw in these 5000K bulb and switch them on, they will cause damage to my eyes, right? I'm not going to spend all day looking straight at them, but I will glance at them even if by accident several times per day.

Can someone give me any advice? ",05Jan2017,1

On December 4th we rented out a room to an older man. We typed up a rental agreement for the time of his stay, stating that from Dec. 4th to Jan. 4th he will be staying with us, and paid us X amount of dollars upon moving in temporarily.    
He signed the agreement, and settled in. No problem.    
    
Today is January 4th. He is due to leave per the agreement that was signed. We have seen him every day up until today. I heard him leave out the front door early this morning (maybe around 6 am). I go to work, come back home to my girlfriend and toddler, but no guest in sight. He has not been here all day, yet all of his belongings are still here. He also has the extra apartment keys with him.     
    
My girlfriend suspects he might be avoiding us, and may come back really late so that he can get a extra night here without having to pay for it.

Do I go to sleep, and deal with him tomorrow?

58,"Some background of my relationship with this guy, let's call him Dave. Dave was on my same floor freshman year of college and I roomed in a quad suite with a friend, let's call this one Rick, and he was one of our suitmates. It was ok having him as a suit mate since I didn't really interact with him much. For junior year my friend got an RA position and I had to look for someone to room really fast so we decided to room together, me and Dave. His former roommate hated Dave and decided to go off with other people. I would've done the same but the rest of my friends thought I was gonna room with Rick so they already had their groups made. I currently hate living with Dave, he is not clean and he is really socially awkward in an annoying way. He is rude to people and hovers when you talk to someone else, a lot. He has used my toothbrush and razor and when I called him out he said sorry and that he did because in the mornings he just rushes through his routine. I already plan on moving out with other people into a 5 person apartment but he thinks we are still going to room together for senior year. The thing about Dave is that he has no true friends and if I leave him he will be shut out of the social circle he currently is in. He is also very sentimental. So, how do I tell him I am not rooming with him without sounding like a dick or destroying his feelings.

TL;DR - How do I tell my socially awkward roommate who has no social skills I will be rooming with other people and hence he will lose his place in our friends's social circle.",05Jan2017,2
59,"Hello, I'm on the verge of being out of high school and I don't see any future where i am now. I live in the Northern SF Bay Area, and it is impossible for anyone who is poor to survive here... we have one of the highest homeless rates in the nation, and frankly I think I'm next on that list. My family situation is complicated but to put it short - my two grandparents are threatening to kick me out if i don't go to college and my parents are homeless. That's all the family I have. 

Now I am a very conservative person - college is not the place for me and I feel I will be unfairly treated based on my outspoken opinions on politics, etc. That, and i don't want to waste at least four years of my life getting a piece of paper to survive in California. I have $2000 and a car, plus some other stuff ill sell before I leave. i also ""have"" $17500 in a savings account held by my grandparents but i doubt ill get the money now that i aint going to college (they're rude people unfortunately, alienated themselves from whatever family they had). 

My plan is to take the car and the money and drive to Mississippi and start a new life there (Mississippi because it's very conservative and I will feel more welcome away from progressives). I also want to be around more poor people so I can relate better to others, something I cannot do here as the people I go to school with currently all live in opulent palaces. I don't care if I have to work at a fast food joint or whatever, as long as i can pay rent for at least a room. I plan to live in my car for a while. That's my plan.

Three times now two of my neighbours (elderly gentlemen, the personification of small-town community) came to help with their snow blowers - today while I was at work. I came home, it had rained and snowed, the street was a mess of frozen snow boulders and I thought I won't even manage to enter the driveway. Well... I had to double-check that I'm at the right house! Everything was cleared! And I don't even know which neighbour did it.

67,"Hey there Reddit!

So I'll try to keep this as short as possible; I dislike typing and most people dislike long stories. 

Basically 2016 was a shitshow for me; I found out that my job wasn't ever going to go anywhere despite promises made by management, my father passed away, and basically the second half of the year was nothing more than a depression blur after that. Shortly after my father passed away I quit my job to have some time to recover, and 6 months later I'm here; unemployed, still dealing with the aftershock of my dad's death and other life problems.

Anyways, so in a couple days I have an interview at a local dealership for a Service Advisor position. It's been over four years since I've last had to do an interview and I'm looking for some help in both the interview itself, but also some insight into what this position entails and what I can do or say to stand out from other applicants.

A rough overview of my previous job experience has been 3 years in the services industry (Bartending at a hotel, and a year working in fast food) with my most recent being 4 years of sales experience in retail.

I did a search here on Reddit and found a AMA from a Service Manager which gave me some insight into the job at hand, but also was from two years ago.. I messaged the user in hopes they still might be around, but from their activity log it doesn't look like I should be expecting a response.

Anyways, any tips, tricks or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Normally I'd just accept whatever happens, happens; but with my current situation I really need to get back to work again and it's just difficult when you've been in a rut for awhile.

This escalated slightly when this NYE we kissed several times.

Yes I'm sure you must be thinking that she has to have feelings for me too, but she's not always this way. We snap a few times everyday and usually after we reciprocate a couple times she will open my snap and not respond. I know that she snaps other guys after she ignores my snapchat and in all honesty it makes me feel like absolute shit. But during the weekends we will hangout again and everything will seem normal.

74,"To clarify, I am a sophomore in high school and I have known these three people for only a short time. One I met a year ago, two I met maybe two years prior to present day. Despite having some history, my meager social skills and different set of classes have helped to widen the distance between us.
It feels like they're my closest friends despite these short relations. Every person I've ever thought of as a best friend has either moved away or moved on to other people. Some of the moving on is my fault, I am socially inexperienced and I was very infrequent in my contact, I don't usually know what to say/feel over analytical about how he/she will react to my response and settle on something generic which I think gives me a seemingly dull character. High school has definitely improved my skills with idle conversation and the like, but I still feel very mediocre.

Back to the matter at hand, I have been invited to social gatherings at one person's  home a number of times since school started this year, and it has probably been one of the few things that I look forward to. In the past, I admit that some gatherings with previous friends felt like time not spent very well. I'm not sure why I felt this way, it was a way to get away from home but I almost felt like I was better off alone and indulging in reading or video games. Recently, I have felt completely the opposite, and I would put down a game or book right at a climax or interesting moment just to talk with any one of my current close friends. This is relevant to my overall question...I often yearn for social interaction and rush to my phone when I hear a notification. The three friends went to grade school with one another and have had long lasting friendships. They have made me feel very welcome despite being something of a newcomer. I have always thought about having someone come to my house but that has not happened for around three years. Even then, the former friend later described being bored. I can definitely provide more these days, I moved to a larger room in the house and finally have a PC and console to call my own. Even if I might not be able to entertain, there would be ways for someone to look past that and still attempt to have fun. I would not want for a guest to feel like I did long-ish ago, like I was almost wasting time.

How should I go about becoming more acquainted? I don't want to lose out on more friends. I have heard that high school friendships tend to be the lasting relationships in a person's life, and I really want that truth to ring true for me. For the first time, I feel like I am a part of an actual social group even if I am a C-lister, the spare tire, the dull yet accepted and ever present terms and conditions section. I really want to strengthen my few relationships to these people, but I don't know how to do it. I feel like I would likely bore if I initiated a social event, especially with only one other person.

One more thing I'd like to add is that I have been placed in an alternate lunch period than all of my friends including these three. I was thinking of a schedule change in order to avoid sitting alone, as lunch was the highlight of my day last semester. I wouldn't want to seem desperate but I could just chalk it up to a teacher trying to thin out a large class into one of his/her smaller periods, as my schedule has been rearranged due to this before. I'm not even sure if the counselor would accept my reasoning, I'm not sure what I could make up. I wouldn't be giving up any classes, but I might have them in different periods to cope with a changed lunch. It is early enough in the semester to still do these things, so it probably wouldn't be too much of a nuisance...
I might seem like something of a hermit in training, and I'll admit to that. I really would prefer to avoid this fate so I'm extremely grateful for any advice offered to me.",05Jan2017,2
76,"My boyfriend and I have lived with my best friend for a few months. We want to move out when the lease is up because the apartment is full of roaches and she has started acting like she's the leader of the house, even though she only pays 1/3 of the rent. There are a lot of control issues. Where I don't mind clutter, she flies off the handle if I leave anything out anywhere. If I leave dirty dishes in the sink for more than a few hours I might as well have killed a baby. She was never like this before we moved in together.

80,"There are two girls in this story.

Girl A: The girl who I have a crush on

Girl B: A mutual friend of mine and Girl A. Both Girl A and I have a very close friendship with Girl B, although Girl A is closer to Girl B than I am

Us three have been friends for a very long time. I became friends with them in early middle school, they became friends even a little earlier than that. We're at the end of college now, and they're both the best friends I have.

I've long had feelings for Girl A, but have never said anything for a variety of reasons. Recently, the main reason is purely not wanting to do anything to jeopardize our friendship. A few years ago, I was struggling with anxiety and acted in a lot of ways that basically ended our friendship for nearly two years. Something similar happened with Girl B, but the fault was more equal in that case. Regardless, Girl A forgave me as soon as I asked, and knowing that I would feel awful doing anything that put that friendship at risk, again. She's always been an extremely trustworthy and loyal friend, moreso than probably anyone I know. I truly do want her in my life, even if it's just as a friend, which is why I have some reservations about straight up asking her out when I'm not completely certain she'll say yes. The way I see it, I probably have at least a 50/50 shot, probably a bit more, but that's not enough.

That's why I was thinking I'd ask Girl B if she knew how Girl A felt, or could possibly help me find out. I trust Girl B enough to think that she probably wouldn't rat me out to Girl A. Girl B has previously told me (unprovoked) that I should try dating Girl A, but that was years ago and so much has changed that even though I now realize that was probably a pretty good sign, it's probably not relevant now except for the fact that I know she's probably comfortable with me talking to her about this. She's the type of person who probably likes setting people up, tbh,

Is it a good idea to ask Girl B if she knows anything?

87,"Using a throwaway because I think this might be a bit of a stupid question.

I'm a moderately conservative person who lives in a very liberal state. Almost everybody I know is much more to the left politically than me. I know this might be a really stupid thing to complain about, but bear with me. It's gotten to the point where I constantly feel ostracized, and often even attacked for my political beliefs, even by my family. It makes making social connections difficult for me, since most people fundamentally strongly disagree with me and make moral judgments on me for my beliefs. Even if people don't directly say anything to me, people are constantly criticizing people with right-leaning political opinions, and I feel alienated. 

Even though I feel what I believe is right, I'm constantly told that I am wrong. At this point, I want to try to become more liberal so that I can fit in better with the people around me and feel more connected. I've tried just not ever talking about politics, but regardless of that people frequently berate conservatives, even if they don't know that I hold a lot of right-leaning beliefs, and I always feel very stupid, but am unable to see it.

88,"When it comes to breakups, getting out of slumps, and all of this motivational stuff, people say ""make a change/keep trying/don't give up"". Well, I've been trying to make changes and trying different tactics in school, in my love life, in my relationships, in my living space, but nothing seems to budge and my life has been in a perpetual standstill regardless of me trying to fight back. If anything it only makes me more depressed that nothing has worked.
My grades at university, while not technically at a ""fail"" level, have been very poor in comparison to my goals. Despite changing my program, reducing my course load, trying new study tactics, asking for extensions, my grades have yet to have a monumental change, so I just feel like I'm stupid.


I also got a job at the university, which I had hoped would allow me to flex my creativity and feel more independent. However, it has become more and more arduous and working with some of my superiors has been infuriating and un-motivating, with much of my responsibilities regularly being taken away from me, harshly criticized, or largely scrapped for work by higher-ups that is regularly considered sub-par by the rest of my department.


My most recent relationship has taken a huge toll on me as my ex-girlfriend moved in with my best friend (not dating) after we broke up, in the same building as me. I had no option to move out, and seeing her regularly be cold to me when I try to hang out with my friends, even though her life is otherwise perfectly fine, has left me in an anxious state.

We've known eachother since we were in the 8th grade with all the good and bad times in between. So, I'd say we have a pretty good grasp on eachother and how we think and feel. 

My friend is the kind of guy who constantly needs to feel validated (which probably stems from a deep rooted insecurity and lack of self confidence). So inevitably after the breakup, he took matters rather personally-feeling like he's not worth being loved or even alive if he can't have the one thing that had made him happy. 

It hurts me to see him hurt, especially since I know exactly what he's feeling as I went through a spout of depression myself after my dad passed away. But with time to heal and self discovery, I learned how to deal with my emotions and understand why I'm feeling them. 

I've tried to be there empathetically and listen-give my input when needed without lecturing, suggest therapy, etc. but nothing really seems to resonate with him. He's so stubborn in this mindset that I don't know how to help him and as selfish as it sounds, I'm getting really tired of having to handle crisis management with him after all these years of the same problem. . 

We've talked about this before and how I feel about it and he understands but yet, he doesn't seem to make an effort to change to be better. 

All my other friends whom I've talked to about this claim that he's just taking advantage of someone who actually cares for people or if he truly valued our relationship, he would make an effort. I refuse to believe that he has bad intentions but part of me too also wonders if I'm overlooking something. 

They say I should just drop this friendship because it's unhealthy and that he has too much baggage to sort out that I can't figure out for him. But I don't want to give up on him either since we have such a long history.

Why do I think this? Well we have experience and also are able to make mistakes hrough this we learn what we dislike and what we like. We also have a tendency to adapt and evolve. We just become afraid because we overthink things sometimes that these thoughts may become beliefs which make it hard to find an answer, but in reality the answer is simple and probably already known we just make scenarios in our heads that are only opinions and these become options the option is choice. We have a choice in a situation not in how to control someone or the outcome of a situation but the choice to make the choice we would want. What makes this choice a difficulty is our beliefs. Sometimes our beleifs are dont hold true for us but rater for what our society would want. Whos doesnt want to be a good person and do the right thing? But sometimes the choices we make are not for our own good. We give ourselves to choices that are not best for us which can cause us pain, fear, and discontent.

99,"**Overview**

As the title implies I have a few things floating around in my head. Ideally money wouldn't be an issue but like most Americans from my generation living in the lower-middle class I'm floating by paycheck to paycheck. 


**Why**

I currently live in Portland, OR and would be moving back to Kansas City, MO. My core group is almost all there except one person that's still in Springfield, MO (only 3 hours away). I've been here almost three years and haven't really connected with anyone and feel like I would be happier getting back to my strong bonds I already have. 

My core group of friends being there I will have a lot of support. One friend is willing to put me up while I transition. This will also be great to have a vehicle so I can commute to work as KC doesn't have the greatest public transit. I will also most likely be able to transfer with my job. 


**Moneys**

I currently do not have a vehicle. Do not have anything on savings. Spend $600 on rent, an average of $350 on food and $45 on other subscription services like Netflix and that includes my phone bill. No other bills. Take home is about $1400 a month.

When I checked my credit a while ago it was 600 and when I just checked credit karma doesn't have a score for me with Transunion or Equifax. 


**Relocating**

With the research I have been doing it looks like the move to rent a truck (U-Haul, Penske, Budget) would be anywhere from $700-$1200 not including gas and food. I would most likely tent camp and pay for camp sights along the way the 1600 miles as I am pretty outdoorsy and wouldn't be bothered at all by it. In fact I'd probably prefer it to a hotel. 

**Vehicle** 

I've narrowed a few things down here as to make myself a low risk for lending and to make sure I can still get something reliable. I'm not willing to spend more that 10k on a vehicle and I'm more so looking for something around 6k. I'm open to paying more in interest considering my situation. I'm assuming I'd have to pay for full coverage on insurance so that will be out of pocket.


**Both**

Basically I'd like to get a vehicle, pare down some things and just make the move in it. I would just be paying for the gas, food and lodging on my way there. I may even make a stop to see a friend that's not to far off the path in Jackson Hole. 


I'd really appreciate any input. Maybe some options I haven't thought of. 

I'm not interested in ""Buy here, Pay here"" type auto lots. May snag a secured care just to get some credit established. I typically fly under the radar so I'd assume that's why I don't have any credit established. ",05Jan2017,1
100,"I'm a guy, and am interested in this girl. We've known each other for a number of months.

I threw a party a while back, there were drinks available, games, etc. I sat down on my sofa to take a break, and she ends up walking over. But instead of doing what she usually does when she wants to lay down (putting her feet into other people's laps), she put her head in my lap. I put one hand in my lap, but in front of her hands and face, and my other on her waist/hip. She then held my hand and started running her thumb along my hand.

On a separate night we're hanging out with friends, and she keeps on putting her feet on my foot.

When we talk, she'll touch my arm or shoulder or something.



So I decided I'd ask her out on a date, in a fairly casual, no pressure manner. But so far when I've suggested hanging out 1 on 1, she seems...reluctant? Due to circumstances we had to cancel one plan (came down with a cold), and the she said she'd get back to me the second time, although both times she seemed excited about it. We've hung out 1 on 1 before, usually over lunch or dinner. To clarify, none of these have been date plans (at least, I don't think so, just casual hanging out and watching TV, playing video games, etc), and I'm waiting until a decent chance to talk 1 on 1 and ask her out in person. I'm just confused is all, and hoping an outside perspective could be helpful.",05Jan2017,1

At the time, I felt depressed and crushed by life, even though I live a life that is really, really worth living. In October, my dad passed away after a 2.5 year annihilation by cancer. Lung cancer. This was a painful irony, as my dad, after having smoked for over 50 years, had quit only 1 year before his diagnosis. My life has gained an amazing, supportive girlfriend, and recently my mom offered to help me financially to return to the university to get a degree. However, I also have a union construction job that might start in June. It will pay 27$ / hr, and is consistent. After 3 years, I would be making closer to 45$/ hr. I feel I am smart, and intellectually gifted. Should I play it safe, and wait for the union job? Or take a risk and return to the university? Many people would say the second choice is obviously the superior one, because who in their right mind would turn down help getting an American university education? I am overweight (337lb) and very large. I enjoy bodybuilding immensely, but fail to really thrive due to roughly monthly depressive episodes. However, I now take Prozac, and despite random sweats and extreme water shits, I feel happier than I have in years. I enjoy seeing my friends, and really feel like my relationships with my remaining family are as strong as ever. Do I pursue higher education? Or merely survive and pursue deeper love with my family, friends, and love while I live?",05Jan2017,1

Most of the work just involved some minor alterations and visualisations of the data I already have, but he also left me the task of reading a particular paper on modelling and trying to figure out how to apply what this paper says. 

I got all of the easy stuff done on the first day, but the challenging task has proven to be too challenging for me to handle. The mathematical concepts involved are a few years above my current level, plus the data I have looks like it's in the wrong format and I don't understand enough of the theory to be able to convert it into the right format. I don't even know how to get started really, and I can't ask anyone else for help because everyone who knows about the project/theory is on holiday. My supervisor said before he left that he didn't expect me to get very far with it, but I still feel incredibly disappointed that I can't seem to get *anywhere*. 

I feel like I've hit a brick wall in terms of what I can reasonably do, and I really hate knowing that that limit exists. If I were smarter, I would be able to figure it out, but I'm not smarter. My supervisor is now going to know exactly where my limit is as well, and I'm sure he'll be at least a little bit disappointed in me.

Hi, I'm Leon, and I have a fee problems to talk about, I feel it's best to talk about issues. This isnt a 'my lifes harder than your pleace appriciate me', it's just me asking for advice.

I'm 25% into my a levels. I recently did a mock exam (England btw) Im loving Law, flying colors, not one issue. Economics was surprisingly good with a C. I felt depressed when I did my accounting so I got an e, I wasn't in the right mindset and If I were I would get a C-D. In maths I got a U, 60% marks.

Normally I'd push myself even further but I really don't feel motivated because I dislike the subjects. Id love to write essays or design something, I wouldn't mind something that I could be creative in. But I'm stuck with these courses that I hate. Do I just dig into it and hope for the best or do I just quit and try an apprentiship? I've always wanted to teach and I guess I need A-Levels to do so.

Another thing is that there isnt enough time in the day for me. I don't get any time weekdays and the weekends are pretty full making up for lost time. I wake up, go to college, come home, have my dinner and do jobs around the house, gym, bath, then that leaves me with an hour or 2 that I just waste on things like talking to my girlfriend( well, not wasted, but you catch my drift) and the rest I just chill.

When i get to this time I cant sleep. I have a long day and even after that I can't sleep for about 2 hours. Its not like I drink coffee before bed or anything, I just find it hard to fall into sleep at all.

Any time I do get I feel is wasted and any time I use at all feels useless. I really don't know what to do and I feel like my future is going to be filled with things I force myself to do,not things I want to do.

7 hours a day at college every day feels grindy at best.

So, what's the plan? I do enjoy maths a little and Law, but the Law im taking is a BTEC and would be hard to follow up into something.

I feel as if im a nice person that can work for what he whats, but I'm not feeling it for whats ahead of me. What advice could you give at all? Will things turn out alright?

128,"Hey. Thanks for reading this. 

Background: I'm 17, in high school

A couple of months ago my best friend (male) asked me (male) out and I said yes. I knew I was gay, but nobody knew that he was. Now, because of the strength of the bond of being best friends, the first couple of weeks were very good, although now looking back I see I definitely didn't eat enough and sort of slacked in all other areas, out of shock. 

Then, for a very short period of a week or so, we slipped into what I think is the ideal for us; We did all the best friend stuff, being distracting in class etc, but also held hands and hugged behind the scenes. It really was awesome. 

Then, he was ill for a couple of weeks and I got super anxious, which I didn't know I was prone to doing, but it definitely wasn't a normal amount. Up until now, my life has been very calm and uplifting; People know/knew me as someone they can depend upon to be happy all the time, I think mostly because I haven't had a single memorable majorly bad experience in my life. Which is good, I guess? But it means I was unprepared for the (albeit positive) shock of this guy asking me out. 

Now, recently, after I got anxious, I realise that being single and flirtatious, and being calm all the time, were seemingly a major part of my identity. Now that I don't have either, I'm just (allegedly, I don't feel it) smart, and I play videogames and do social media. 

It feels like I want to build my identity again from the ground up; I know I shouldn't have had temporary aspects as major parts of it, but I did, so I'm here now. I can't build from the ground up because everyone expects me to act a certain way, and to like certain things. 

The truth is, I feel like I really don't feel... enough of anything. I like my bf, obviously, but by comparison, it seems like barely anything else even goes remotely close to being something I like. Cycling clears my head and physically gets me places, and space travel is a very cool idea, and I watch a lot of comedy, but that's about it. 

I play the piano, which is satisfying, but I'd quit if I could (plans have already been made that mean I can't quit now) and I play videogames to pass the time, really. They're more escapism than something I actually like. 

I like reading books, also, and get through them quickly, but I have issues with concentrating for extended periods of time unless it's a very good book, and there is work to do. 

Um, yeah, sorry about the long post. Basically I feel like if it was just that I didn't know who I was, I could fix it, and if it was just that I didn't feel very much, I could probably fix that too. But now that I feel like I don't have a cohesive identity, and I have no basic likes or dislikes, I don't know how to build up to being like everyone else?",05Jan2017,1

132,"So I fucked up; I'm 21, and 'going out' with a 16-year-old.

I don't see her age, and she doesn't see mine, and lately I realised the issue that this has.

I have come to the realisation that I may need to break things off, not because of the immorality of it, and there's nothing illegal from it, but because I realised that I am seriously unstable, and she isn't stable either, and she's going through a few things herself, which I am not helping with.

This girl is seriously attached to me, and I love her to fucking bits, but I am hurting her as I realise that my 'slip of the tongue' jokes, and relying on her as my only source of happiness (which in fairness she is), is really unfair.

Along with that, I get jealous as she is a young girl with everyone after her, which only perpetuates issues with mine and her instability.

Now her parents really don't like me (for obvious reasons), so she's going behind her backs to even speak to me, and as well as she absolutely breaks at the very idea of me leaving, more so than anything else, so I would be walking on eggshells to even play with the idea.

I've always been interested in it and been pretty good at it without too much effort. The problem is that I've come to realise that maybe i don't like it as much as i once did or thought i did. None of the topics we learn particularly intrigue or engage me, in lectures i just go through the motions, i don't feel particularly drawn in by the material. Now that I'm studying for my first exams it has dawned on me that the things I'm learning are not really doing much for me, they're somewhat interesting to read about but I'm not sure that it's something i want to spend my life doing. I guess i picked the subject because i couldn't pick anything else and it was the only one i was good at, there wasn't much more thought to it. Now I'm having to decide whether to continue on or perhaps drop out and re-enrol on another course (possibly an online course in computing or something). I like the social aspect of uni (even though I've yet to find anyone here i truly enjoy) and my hometown is even worse (all my friends have gone to uni). Even if i were to re-enroll I would have to wait until the next entry point, meaning in the meantime I would be grinding away at my supermarket job and I'm not sure if i can take that.

I tried to on a few occasions but, of course, they never worked. Whenever I show up to school, I can barely function until around third period which at that point, the day is almost over. I'm at my breaking point. I want to drop out of all of my classes and clubs, I haven't found the will to do basic things like shower or wash my laundry, and I struggle to maintain most of my relationships (including my family).

156,"I have posted this in multiple subs, so I apologize if you keep seeing it.

A little background information: I am 23 years old. I have been working for a building material sales company in a small college town for almost 5 years now. I started part time when I moved into the dorms of my college, and the job was just supposed to be something to give me a little extra cash, because broke college student. A few years later, I have moved up a couple positions, got an apartment (where I still currently live with my now fiancé) and decided I was going to drop out of college in the spring of 2015 after I had finished the semester with about 2 years left to complete. I started working full time at my job, and in the fall I had gotten another promotion to a sales representative where I would make $36000 a year; $10000 more than I was currently making. At the time I thought this was an amazing thing. I was 22 making $36000 (which I still make) and living comfortably. 

A little background on why I was promoted: The previous sales representative basically had a mental breakdown in the middle of the day due to the stress and shit he had to put up with and walked out. I'm pretty sure I overlooked this fact because of the money, and my manager kept telling my that I would do just fine in the position. Looking back on the scenario I believe he just wanted someone to fill it quick so we didn't loose customers.

Why I do not like my job: Basically everything is my fault. I quote building materials for a project, the contractor cuts a board wrong and uses too much waste, it's my fault and I get a screaming phone call about how I shorted him material and how he thinks I should just give him the overages. It would be one thing if this was only one guy, but it is every single one of my clients. I wish it was only phone calls, but too many times it has been someone in my office, going on a rant because I can't count or do my job, when in fact it's not my job to figure everything on the nose. It has always been like this, even with the other guy in my position I remember. A person cannot figure exactly all the materials for a project, and from talking to other people in my profession, it is impossible because everyone builds different and some people have more waste then others. Oh and unrealistic sales goals, although I believe that's a common thing with a sales position.

A year and some months later I absolutely dispise my job. It has beaten me down to where I feel like a worthless piece of shit. It has taken a mental and physical toll on me, as I have gained 40 pounds in that little of time. I do not want to wake up in the mornings to go to work no matter how much sleep I get. I honestly feel like I am becoming depressed again (I was depressed and on medication during the start of college because of many reasons). I want to go back to college, hopefully in the fall, but I don't think in can continue to do this job until then. I'm really nervous about finding another job because it has been almost 5 years since I have had to look for one. Also, since I have worked at this company for so long that I don't know if there is anything better out there, and I am not sure what to do.

TL;DR: I'm 23, dropped out to college for my job, got promoted in my job, job sucks, want to go back to college, not sure if all jobs suck. Not sure what to do.",05Jan2017,1

161,"I have always had a dream where I lived a life of freedom, looking out the window to see clouds moving to a new horizon, dropping everything and run off to see new things each day without looking back. I always sought the sense of peace that I would anticipate from fulfilling that kind of life each day and night that passes with new wondrous adventures.

But, reality is binding. Just like anyone else, I have financial problems to take care of (student loans currently as a college student) and the career choice(s) I will make. It doesn't have to be about my job (I know my job doesn't define me), but are there any activities or careers that can be alternatives to give the same essence of my dream?

162,"I'm a really young guy (about 19), I've only had three jobs previously and two of them were pretty temporary. I have always had issues with anxiety at work. Just as an example, my first day at my last job I showed up almost an hour early and sat in my car just trying to get myself ready. 

I'll spend the entirety of my workdays often anxious as hell with the urge to just walk out and quit. I've never actually done it though, I just fight through it and later in the shift I feel a bit better. I have never been diagnosed with any sort of anxiety problems and have never really had it be THIS big of a problem until I started working when I was 17. 

I am starting a new job pretty soon and I'm going to be working in a restaurant, dealing with people quite a bit.  Does anyone have any ideas on how i can cope with this at all? I don't want this job to be like this as well ",05Jan2017,3

We seen eye to eye on really almost everything. and at first she was just a best friend but fast forward until 2015 and i caught feelings for her. deep feelings. like I'm in love with this girl. I'm 21 going on 22 and she's about to turn 20. she's been there for me repeatedly thru my depression. she's so smart and funny and soooooo beautiful. most beautiful girl I've ever seen or known. she's all i think about daily. she's my only friend can thats how i wanted it. about a month ago i told her i was in love with but because i already knew she didn't really feel the same i told her i still wanted to remain best friends. and its so hard, it hurts because i can't kill of these feelings and i feel like I'm not holding my end of the deal to say because as her best friend thats a special trust i had to earn and i feel like me being in love with here and her not feeling the same way is only jeopardizing what we have. but at the same time its like she's the best thing to happen to me and the only person i truly love besides my mom of course. she's so beautiful inside and out i truly don't know how i would get through life if she wasn't in mine. what do i do? she's literally the only person that i talk too. Do i break off my friendship with her? what do i do really? because it hurts being in love with someone who doesn't feel the same way. and i whenever i try to talk to another girl i just feel so wrong because that girl is not her. i just need to know what to do because its killing me on the inside that i can't have her and i feel like if i bring this up again with her, she's not gonna want to be friends anymore at all and that would literally just ruin me. i feel like God made her just for me.

170,"I love my dad, I really do, but I can't stand him. His overall mentality is what I hate about him. Him and my mom divorced when I was 10 years old because he used to abuse the shit out of her (this is another reason I dislike him) and I never had a real relationship with him, even when we lived together. He was never really a father to me and either sat home all day watching TV or would go and hang out with friends. He's extremely foreign and still doesn't understand America. He's racist, sexist, etc, I hate it. He also has INSANE anger/depression issues which he is supposed to take pills for but sometimes doesn't and insists he is ""fine."" This causes a lot of fights between us because he starts getting mad at dumb stuff. He also points out flaws in my character, such as my weight, the fact that I am introverted, etc. I can't just have a normal conversation with him, ever, because he always has something to say about me or my mom. He loves talking shit about us.

Even through all of this, he is still my father and I love him. I will never like all parts of him, but the fact is he does love me and just has a crude way of showing it. But I still cannot bring myself to go see him, even if it's for two days (we will probably fight at least once in those two days). There's no possible way for me to tell him any of this without him blowing up and us probably never talking again. I don't want that, but I also want him to know why I don't want to go see him. 

I don't even know if I'm asking for advice. I just needed to vent and get this out. ",05Jan2017,1
173,"I know this sound like a really dumb question, but I am being pushed to the brink here. My mother through out my life has constantly screamed, yelled, locked me outside once when I was a child in the winter of Minnesota, and put me and my hobbies down with several cusses and profane language. I've never ever seen her support my goals in life and every time I ask her about something or to do something, she gets mad. I try to calm her down, but then she just escalates and cusses at me, screaming, telling me that I am a quote: ""little fucker."" Now, I am not as sensitive to be upset from anyone telling me off, but she does this constantly to the TINIEST things. She over exaggerates everything and is obsessed with keeping the house clean, so she NEVER lets or has let any friends of mine even 10 feet within my house. Recently, my dad has calmed her down a bit and I'v been able to have friends ""Stop in"" but that's being generous for her. She's paranoid and worries about everything. She always puts herself first and no one else.  It's getting to the end of where I can deal with here constantly pushing me down when I'm trying to get back up.  From some examples I can remember when I was younger she has said things like:

*You can't be a professional MLB player, you are never gonna be able to make it in that. (To my 10 year old self when I put that I want to play on the Twins when I get older in my yearbook in elementary school.) -You could chalk that up to brutal honesty, but to a 10 year old???

*I wanted to play Lego Star Wars on the new Wii my family got a long time ago, but my brother wasn't getting off of it for my turn, because he was splaying a game called the Conduit I think? She got mad at me for complaining and locked me outside for several minutes in the Winter of Minnesota. In Minnesota, for any of you warm people, that's pretty fucking cold. 

*These days since about middle school I've been writing and am an aspiring filmmaker. I write screenplays and shoot film with my buddies whenever I can. So last year sometime I decided to check out the scene for film in Minneapolis and I wanted to meet with this company about acting and stuff. She then found out and called that company and told them that we wanted nothing to do with them and that they were scammers. After she told me that something like film is a dumb idea and I won't ever be able to be successful in. And my plan isn't even to go to college for this, but to do it as a hobby until I get an actual degree! However, she sees me as this person that's gonna drop out of school and just be a failure.  Anyways, after she hung up I went to my room in tears. Now, I don't know for sure how legit this place was, but I still see it as her sabotaging my dreams and trying to fuck me over. Now when I wanna make like a youtube video or some fun video project she rolls her eyes, scoffs/laughs at me. 

*About two years ago, my two older sisters completely cut contact with my mother and have not talked to her since. Blocked on Social Media, phones, any way possible. They haven't seen her since. Apparently from what they've said to me, which is very little, their two lives were lies and they were told something rally bad by my folks. Now, my father is great. Honestly he supports me no matter what and has given me absolutely everything I've ever needed. I am a bit spoiled I will admit, but it's been all him that has done that. 

*She constantly puts me down, calls me names, swears, screams at me for little things, and is paranoid about everything. She has accused me on several occasions in the past of doing drugs and even calls me dad things behind his back to me and my siblings. 

*She has threatened with physical violence before, but has never acted upon those threats. 

*She always assumes the worst of every single situation or outcome for every possibility. She constantly reminds me ""how fucking ungrateful I am for everything."" Keep in mind also, she has been a stay at home mom my whole life and hasn't worked a day in her damn life either. My dad single handedly brought us up from the bottom and now we are pretty well off. 

*I really don't wanna sound like a whiny brat, but she constantly drags me down for grades and gets pissed of when I get even something I think is good like a C+ or B range. She goes absolutely ballistic. And I don't mean upset, I mean SCREAMING. Like bloody murder. She has also personally told me that I need to get good grades so people in the county don't make fun of her or so that I don't make her look bad. 

*Then today was a more recent one. First let me say that she is the worst and most constant liar ever. She lies about almost everything to get her way and make herself look good or get people on her side. She's apologized before, but they've always been half-assed and she did another thing right after that.  Sorry, anyways, today my car didn't start for school. It seems the cold might've gotten to it, and it wouldn't turn on. So I asked my mom to borrow her van, and she said yes. So I'll admit I was frustrated and said a couple ""fucks"" here and there, but my family is like that and it's just general words when it's not directed towards anyone in frustration. Now, my mother got mad at me for swearing and I shit you not she said ""Don't you fucking swear in my house!"".....So I'm not sure what she means by that but ok. Then I took her keys and got on the road to school. However, then I get a text from my dad asking why I took the van to school...Confused, I texted him back saying that my mom gave me permission since I'll be back at 2:30. (I have hours off since I'm a senior in high school). After I got that text from my dad, she called me and said to bring the van back and that she never gave me permission to use it. So apparently she told my dad that I ran off with their van and was just gone. Obviously a lie, I was furstrated and turned around after she threatened to CALL THE POLICE on me! So I get home and am just pissed off. Told her she needed mental help and stormed upstairs. Bad choice of words, I know I know I'm sorry about that. However, she looked at after that and said ""Your father said I need mental help?"" and I was dumbfounded. She then called my dad and raged at him accusing him of saying what only I said and he NEVER even implied ever. So she lied right in front of me. I said something, then she carried that and lied to me my dad saying that he told me that my mother needed mental problems. Also on a side note, my mother is notorious for not believing in mental issues and thinks therapy or counseling is too expensive or a waste of money. Her method is to make fun of me or someone else or say ""oh poor me poor me"" because She would just say something about Jesus or some shit. Go figure she's ultra religious and says mental illness is a lie. 

So sorry for the absolute novel, but I'm really just broken down writing this, and I can't really take anymore. I am moving with my girlfriend in college and will be away, soon but I'm really getting edged out right now. It seems that she's trying to give one final push before I leave and I am about to break into insanity. I just can't take it. Does she really need mental help? Or am I a whiny brat? I've been called one before by her, but I wanna know what is happening. It's been going on for too long and I need some advice, guys.

174,"I'm 21 and I have my first 'grown up' job. I have major depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorders and in my experience those disorders have made it difficult to do a lot of things, for the most part I do my job well out of a fear of losing my job but lately I've been falling off a little because my anxiety and depression have gotten worse. I'm a writer and naturally I want to work on my craft and build my career, and enjoy other parts of my life. I find that I can't because when I go home at night in worried about work, when I hang out on the weekends I'm thinking about work, I'm terrified of getting fired and becoming a failure while Im still trying to build my life but this obsessive and all encompassing fear prevents me from nurturing other parts of my life. I don't do the things I enjoy becauae they're a distraction from focusing on how.i can be better at work or worrying about work,  I want to have a life and I wanna be happy. What can I do to create balance? I feel like if my job isnt the central focus of my life becauae it's my livelihood then I will make crucial mistakes. ",05Jan2017,1
175,"So before the question I want to give some backstory to hopefully give me a better answer. I'm 14,she's 17,she's bisexual and I've been curious,she's goth and I'm attracted to that, she's into that freaky shit(pulling hair,pain etc.), so I think she's into bdsm, I don't know 100% though, but I am too. We both struggle with depression but she's quiet most of the time. She's also smokes weed regularly and used to do cocaine a while back as well as smoke cancer sticks. We only see each other on the bus cause were both in highschool,we go to different schools,I have never had a girlfriend,I have never had a girl as a friend before her and I've never actually talked a lot to a certain girl. Now,onto the question.

So this all started on the 3rd of November,I say hey on messenger and she gives me her number. We start talking and I start getting to know her better,I ask her if she wants to hang out on that weeks friday, she says what about on sunday,I say see you soon but her stepdad wont let her leave the house,so its called off. Next week we had thanksgiving break and asked if she wants to hotbox on wednesday,but she had no weed and she had noone to buy it from,so we both try finding a a guy,but we never do,so we dont hang. Next week we fuck around on our bus and I flirt by untieing her shoe,she playfully gets mad,goes to tie her shoe,her hoodie sleeve goes up and i see her wrist.Its covered in scars and recent cuts,I try to act like it's nothing,but i stare for a couple seconds too long and she sees me see them,so I get off the bus and immediately text her saying I saw them and if she wants to talk about it.She tells me she's been cutting herself since she was 10 and that it was a long story.I tell her I'd rather listen to it than act like it's nothing,and that I want to help her.She says thanks and that she appreciates it,but she's already talking about it and getting help. But I still insist that if there is something going on she can talk about it with me. So I try to act like nothings going on,but there is,on a Thursday she says on snapchat that she's sorry and gives up, I try asking what happened,she says ""stuff"",but I'm genuinely concerned so I try calling her,she hangs up immediatly and I'm starting to panick. The next day she doesn't get on the bus,my ""girl"" friend, *insert personal name #1*, sees me in distress and asks what's up, I tell her everything I know. She tells me that during the summer my crush(person I've been talking about in this post) tried killing herself. Being told this made me start hyperventilating,I start praying,this is the first time I've prayed since 5th grade(I was suicidal but got help before it was too late). I try to act normal before we have to go to class,but I can't fucking take it,I start having an anxiety attack,I don't have social anxiety disorder but I have major signs of bipolar disorder. I had to go to our school counselor to try and vent shit out,at the same time Savannah was in there because her Boyfriend (One of my best friends),*Insert personal name #2*, was taken to the hospital because he had depressing thoughts,like ""what if I didn't exist,what would happen?"" Or ""what would happen if I died?"",things like that,he's also tried killing himself over the summer. Anyways,I vent all my shit out besides her name and the suicide attempt. The counsler tells me I'm doing everything right and just keep doing what I'm doing, so I do. This is when it gets fucked. So I wake up on Saturday the next day. My dad,that left me at the age of 4 cause he didn't want to pay child support,comes to our house with a bottle of liquor in his hand and a gun in the other. He barges in yelling at us to let him live at our house, I sneak away and ask her what to do,she tells me to call the police,but if I did my dad would know I was,she tells me to call multiple times but keep my phone in my pocket,cause they'll have to track the call at some point,so I do and sure enough,the cops show up and arrest him,she asked what happened,and I tell her,my dad told me that I was a mistake and that he wanted an abortion,but my mom said no. She says she's sorry,I tell her it's ok,but in reality I'm not,I try to go about my day but I can't. It's been around 3-4 weeks I've been talking to her,it felt right to tell her how I feel,so on snapchat,I post on my story im gonna ask,what I meant was to ask if I could go over to her house,smoke some weed and tell her my feelings for her,she sees it and puts me on blast,saying ""ask what"" so I'm very nervous, I didn't know whether to tell her I wanted to ask if I could come over,or to be straight up and tell her,so I told her I liked her and that she was the only one that I felt feelings for(which is true), and I ask if she feels the same. She tells me she likes me as a good friend, so I say we still get to be friends,and that I'm cool with it,but I was actually balling my eyes out,I start questioning what I did wrong,what could've made her say no, cause she showed every sign in the book she liked me, she'd laugh at every joke I made,even if they were cringy,she stared at me in the bus mirror,she said she's gonna sit with me even though I didn't ask, she responded to every text I sent,I just didn't understand. I..., I started cutting myself,I just felt like it was my fault. Next day my grandma died,last time I talked to her was 3 days before,I start crying and can't control myself,and I cut, on Monday I find a couple needles with heroin in it and a belt my friends closet,I ask why but they won't tell me. On Tuesday my cousin attempted suicide,I talked to him the day before and made him feel good about himself,but it didn't help,I felt guilty and cut myself on wednesday morning. During this whole time I've purposely avoided my crush to not make things awkward. But in the afternoon on wednesday, she saw my wrist and she said my name to get my attention,I look and she taps her wrist,implying she saw my wrist,so I say not right now,cause there was a lot of other people on the bus,and it was private talk,so she waited till the bus was kinda cleared and she asked why I did it. I tell her my dad,but she interrupted me and told that's not a reason and gets mad. I continue listing everything I just did, and she tells me she doesn't like people in that mindset,and that there's other outlets and knows how much it sucks,but there's another way. I tell her why and what made me come to do it,she wanted me to promise her to stop,I do, and she says ""you fucking better"", and I tell her I'm not a liar, and she says ok, since then I have stopped cutting,since then I've felt better, but on Friday we were messin around and I saw her other wrist,she had new cuts,either that day or yesterday,there was a longway cut,which made me very worried, I texted her I saw them a couple hours after I got off. I ask why but she said it's nothing new, I say I meant the reason,but she had no reason,it just felt good to her. I ask her to at least promise me not to do longway cuts cause there's more of a risk. She says yes and I say thank you. Couple weeks past and we start flirting,by touching each other,me mocking her,I scare her by yelling when it's quiet, shit was going great. and then break happened, and over the break she got a boyfriend. Keep in mind she was not cool with this dude a month ago because he was already sorta fuckin with someone for a week, and then immediatly started acting like she was his world. So the fact that the same guy that played her is now her boyfriend just made me have a extreme mental breakdown, I tried slitting my throat but the knife was dull, so I hit my head as hard as I could against a wall and I black out. We go back to school a week later and  were now in present day. *personal name #2*, saw a very long line across my neck(cause I tried cutting my throat)and got VERY wide-eyed and after school wants me to tell him what happened, I talk about it with him, and I feel better. I tell him about the guy my crush is dating and both *Personal name #1 and #2* don't like him,infact they think he's a faggot, and that my crush has low standards personality wise. Anyways, I don't want to tell her because that will completely shut down everything i've worked up to so far,and there's a chance she'll feel guilty about what happened,and I don't want her to know she was the reason I did cut in the first place. I also don't want to stop talking cause it'll make me look like I only cared if I had a chance and I see her everyday on the bus and would be awkward as hell. But I genuinely care about her,it's just that I can't bear to sacrifice everything for her again. I don't know whether to feel sad cause of rejection. Feel angry at her for getting with a guy that she made her mind on already. Feel confused again, cause we've grown since last time.So for the question, should I just stop talking to her and move on,or do I keep around her and keep helping her out? Cause I have a lot of feelings for this girl. I've wrote a letter for her,never sent it cause I'm too scared, I drew a picture of her off the top of my head,I made a rap about my feelings for her and a song about her. This is the only woman I have ever gone out of my way and say, ""I want to put time and effort into you because you are amazing"". I would appreciate if everyone would put their 2-sense in,cause I need everything you have,cause I don't know where to go from here. I'm also doing better,so don't be concerned about me, all I need is advice on this topic.",05Jan2017,1
176,"Hey guys, made a throwaway account just to be safe. I am a college student living in an apartment complex that is mainly just students. The property is basically student living, but doesn't associate with the school. Over the break, my apartment was broken into and a few items were taken, like my new smart TV.

I guess I am asking for some advice on how to handle it with management. Although the complex couldn't have predicted a break-in, there are numerous reasons why our apartment was more susceptible. For instance, there are no cameras in the lots, there is no lighting in the back of the building (where the door was broken down), and our back apartment door is the only door along the line that has an in-ward open door rather than an out-ward open door. For those that don't know, in-ward open doors are easier to kick in than out-ward.

177,"I met this girl at work.(No I don't work with her, or even for the same company, however we sometimes see each other.) The other day for new years she asked me where are the parties at. And if we couldn't get together for new years, then we could go to dinner.


I normally am a pretty relaxed person, a little shy, and a little under confident. But, I don't like being just another average Joe. I want your experience to be unique in a good way. Something to be remembered, and hopefully come back for.


She asked me about new years partys, then we talked and joked about how we both got too drunk over the holidays. which is what lead into going out to dinner.


I'm trying to be creative for a first date but I don't know if she will want to get drinks, or just dinner and non alc drinks. I also want to do more than just dinner,(like an activity) but not overwhelm or take up her entire day. I will be driving to the date spot, from a meetup spot. She will be driving home from the meetup spot. Not to mention it is cold outside, and might snow.


Can I get any tips or advice on how to not overthink this? I don't want to order a beer and come off as if all I drink is beer. I like this girl, she seems cool and I'd like to get to know her more. I just don't want to fuck it up with some small mistake that comes back to me like ""What were you thinking?!""

today i left the door to their room open for the first time. the boy cat immediately trotted out and explored the whole house. the girl cat stayed up in the closet. i nearly had a panic attack while he was wandering around the house. i don't ever remember this happening with any cats i've had before. there was nothing specific i was worried about, but i just got super anxious. he only walked around for 10 minutes max and once he went back to the cat room i pet him a bunch and then closed the door. 
is this normal? i don't want to feel like whenever i let him out of there that i'm gonna have a breakdown. should i just let him wander around and show myself he's not going to explode or whatever if he's out of the room? i know the girl cat won't leave the room because she's so skittish, so it's just him i'm worried about.

195,"""A new way of traveling?
FEATURED
A new eye for 2017?

Traveling allows you to be open with the world or to stay open with. What is very important is to keep your eyes wide open during your travels, because in that way you will be well connected with all what happens around you.

By keeping your eyes open, I mean, to see the places with no tourist eyes but with human eyes because we are also human and except the beautiful of the place, which is one point, the other one is to pay attention to what happens everywhere even if the beach and the sunset are beautiful. Indeed, behind this postcard, there is another aspect, which is the poverty event if there are some wonderful 5 stars hotels. What I have noticed many times during my travels is that tourists do not pay attention to this reality. According to them, they have paid a hotel and just want to have a great service. Personally, I think it doesn’t work in that way, even if there are hotel staffs, they deserve respect and compassion from clients. I am probably too much human but I cannot be like that, that is for this main reason I am telling you to enlarge your vision when you are traveling and not to see just what you are seeing but what there is behind the scene. Even a poor person may bring you, and learn you so much just by looking through your eyes. Do not forget that when you discover a new country with a new culture because it is the key of everything. Everybody always says that eyes reflect the soul but it is absolutely correct, and keep in mind that when you are going to meet a new person whatever where is it around the world, do not forget that.

There are so many places there is a rich diversity of fauna and flora. In my opinion, it is important when we are visiting a place to understand very well the interaction there is between animals and nature because we are all animals. Human beings are simply on the top of the evolution scale but we are still animals that we want or not. On earth, each animal is living for a particular reason, and not for anything. When you begin to see the world in that way, you begin to see life differently with new eyes.

Have a safe journey and enjoy you travels.""",05Jan2017,1

223,"Work is killing my soul, and it's partially my own fault. How do I stop trying to be PERFECT at work?

I honestly don't know where to go with this but I'm losing my mind and I just need some advice, or someone to tell me to calm the heck down. I have been working at my current company as the assistant manager (a five story storage facility) for just right around a year. The pay is pretty good, the benefits are even better (we're talking over three months a year paid off work when you account for all paid holidays, vacation time, and sick time). I work only about thirty-five hours a week. I only answer directly to two other people. One of which who is the area manager and works outside the property, the other who is the store manager who works along side me, although we may only see each other a couple of times a month). It's a corporate location, so there are people higher than the area manager, I just have never met or spoken to any of them. Honestly they are all over the country. 

For the most part I work on my own, which is usually nice (I am an introverted person, and work better and quicker on my own), but I always feel busy / rushed to get everything done by the end of my shift. Not to boast, but I do work really hard. I rarely sit down at work. There is quite literally as the saying goes, always something that needs to be done. My job is a mix of customer service, cleaning, and accounting. We use outlook reminders to schedule weekly tasks which is helpful.

Unfortunatly, the problem is the following. I am such a hard worker that I am stressing myself out at work to get everything done, especially the little things, because there is really always something that needs to be done. Working alone six or seven days a week in such a large facility is really taking it's toll. That is not likely to change as my store manager is also the lead manager for the area and goes to other states / other stores to help out and open new locations. She works on average about once a week. I am very detail oriented, and there are SO many details.

On a typical eight hour shift I am coming in, cleaning all the bathrooms, cleaning all five floors with the dustmop, cleaning the elevators and vacuuming, cleaning the office, doing inventory, restocking, helping customers, doing legal agreements, moving customers out of storage, checking over paperwork, answering phone calls, answering emails, sweeping, moping, fixing doors, fixing toilets. You name it, I do it. 

It seems like none of the other assitant managers at the other locations are this overwhelmed. Mostly because they don't go to the same extent to make sure all these things get done on a daily basis. Most of the time you can find me running down the halls with a mop trying to get back to my office before a customer pops in, or hurrying through legal documents so that I can get the lobbies clean before my area manager comes to do his weekly check.

I'm not sure what I'm asking here. Just some advice on how to slow the hell down. I met the assistant manager who worked here before me, and for the most part she sat in the office all day. I think a lot of it has to do with my anxiety. I just don't want to get in trouble if something doesn't get done that day (but honestly, I wouldn't likely get in trouble) deep down I know this, but the anxiety / workaholic in me just says GO GO GO. At the end of the work day, I am too burnt out and tired to do much else but shower, eat, and crawl into bed, just to start it all over again the next day.

I have expressed all of this to my SO, that I just feel overwhelmed because I'm taking on too much at once, when really - it's not completely necessary. But the idea that someone will come in and get mad that a certain thing isn't done just stressed me out to no end. He gave me this advice, ""instead of working like you make sixteen dollars an hour, give the same amount of work for the amount you get paid"". 

But this advice is just so hard for me. How to a chill out and stop caring so much and stop busting my ass when it's honestly not even noticed the way I think it is? I'm pulling my hair out over here.

225,"To put a short story long, I started uni in september and made a few friends. There was one guy in lectures that I noticed was always on his own so I made an effort to speak to him and bring him into our group. It was clear that he didn't fit in very well as he didn't share our sense of humor and was also very PC and enjoyed discussing politics a lot which we weren't overly interested in. Eventually he stopped hanging out with us, and started dating this girl. I ended up developing an interest in the girl he was dating's best friend and I took her out on a date and it went really well. She mentioned it to him the following day and he told her that she should avoid me for her own safety. He then told her multiple lies about me for seemingly no reason. 
1) He said he's known me for over 10 years (Nonsense, he met me in September) 
2) He said I was heavy into weed and cocaine (Nonsense, only drugs I've ever touched are Weed and Shrooms and I haven't done either in almost 10 months) 
3) He said I'm always in trouble with the police (Nonsense, don't even have a criminal record) 
4) He said I used him at the start of uni to make friends and then turned all of his friends against him (Nonsense, I spoke to him at the start of uni because he didn't have any friends, he left our friend group of his own accord and as far as I'm aware, none of the others have a problem with him) 

This girl has agreed to a second date with me and she mentioned it to him and he told her that she should get away from me now before I wind up hurting her. She asked what he means and he just said ""You'll see."" No idea what he means by this as I've never cheated on another girl or messed a girl around in my life, and every relationship I've had has always ended on good terms with no hard feelings between me or the ex. 


Can't figure out why he's saying stuff. Tried confronting him but he refuses to speak to me. My friends are under the impression he likes this girl and is trying to screw things up for me as she is quite open about how she feels about me to her friends apparently. But like I said, he's dating her best friend, and I don't see any signs that he has any interest in the girl I like. I can't think what else it could be though. Any ideas?",05Jan2017,1

227,"Throwaway just in case, and this is probably going to be long. I'll also preface this by saying I feel like a total scumbag and very stuck.

Now, where to begin... 

I have a long-time friend, we'll call her ""G"", who to be perfectly honest, I'm attracted to, but I respect boundaries. She and her husband of 17 (i think) years (also a friend but not as close), he'll be ""B""; have had a pretty rough time the last year or so. G cheated on B for close to a year with another close friend of mine, we'll call him ""R"" (not her first incident, but the longest duration that I know of). When things blew up, B understandably was devastated, hurt, and and angry with G, but said he was willing to work things out with her - but he's definitely not forgiving or forgetting, much less allow her to do so either. I then find out that G still won't stop sneaking contact with R, and I've told her many times over that if she feels the way she says, she'll handle her business, but tell me as little as possible about it. Willing to be the supportive friend, the less details the better since I'm pretty much in the middle of all involved parties.

Fast forward to these past month or two. B has been trying to ramp up a closer friendship with me, but I think his main motive is to try to get information out of me. R has been fed up with the whole thing because he has feelings for G, but told me he's decided to cut ties with her. But, she still won't stop with the lovey-dovey emails and secret meetings... and still admittedly refuses to hurt B any more and fears the repercussions if she left him (he's told me that he will gladly make her life a living hell if she did). 

Now a few weeks back, I was hanging out at G and B's place having some/too many beers. B did his usual routine of downing most of an 18 pack then going to bed. Another typical scene followed, G cries her eyes out about how awful she feels, loves and misses R, but doesn't want to hurt B anymore/again. The following events were kind of a blur, but G and I end up making out some (didn't have sex, as if that makes it any better). G starts saying things like she and I should be together instead, we'd be a great match, blah blah blah. Further icing on this crap cake is that I'm 4 months separated from my wife M (divorce pending), who was also close friends with G up until M decided to start fucking half the city behind my back while i was at home taking care of her shitty kids. But, I digress.

Back to the point - I admit to R what happened because I want to be an actual friend and be honest, and release some of the guilt I've been carrying about this. He said that sealed it for him to cut G out for good. G jumped my case over it (as if she wasn't also involved). R also said that he's always suspected that I have feelings for G (which, I can't honestly answer in my current state; I'm just hurt over my own situation), and that I should have slept with her to make him calling it quits with her ""more worth it"". R and I are still cool but it's sort of shaky right now, G cries to me a few times a week, and B keeps wanting to hang out and go to lunch but won't stop asking me if I know anything between G and R.


God damnit, this sucks. I hate to lose friends, but I'm leaning towards distancing myself from G and B and letting them sort their shit out on their own. I honestly think she's more afraid of what B will to do her, R, or himself than anything else. R has made it perfectly clear that he won't be her landing pad if she did leave B, the man's got a pretty volatile temper and tends to drink A LOT.

 **TL;DR:** I'm feeling like a hypocrite scumbag and a shitty friend, and am somehow staying loyal to someone who won't stop doing to her husband what I left my own wife for doing to me.

228,"Is there such thing as a quarter life crisis? Because Im at a cross roads at the age of 35.

Me: 35, Aussie. Ive been working in the office since 2000 - straight out of school. Mostly in online publishing/print publishing and graphic design. I started a side gig in 2010 doing photography and that was going well. Ive learnt a lot and got a few quals in this stuff during my 16 odd years.

My passion has been photography for the last 6 years or so and its basically how Ive identified myself. But this last year or two, with everyone now able to use cameras/learn quickly and easily, that income has dropped off completely. Its killed my motivation and most of my enthusiasm. I went from weekly bookings to 1 or 2 a month and regular clients started buying their own cameras to save money (I dont blame them tbh). IMO the majority of people no longer recognise a decent photo these days and any photo will do - anyway thats a whole other issue.

On top of that, my well paying office work is going well, but after 16yrs of 8-10hrs a day on computers, my hands/arms and wrists are giving up with RSI.

So Im at a point in life where I guess I need to turn a page and start something else.

Now other things I do; I breed fish (african cichlids). Into cars. Can paint and enjoy making/selling things. I love future tech as well. I was a big gamer before my hands started giving up. Also dabbled in designing t-shirts and used to produce calendars for Harley Davidson.

So I've basically spent the last few months trying to think of what I can do using some existing skills to move into something thats future proof and not 100% sitting at a keyboard, and hoping someone on Reddit has had a similar experience in life or some (sustainable) suggestions.

My ideal would have been a half/half office job + photography/design or something that gets me away from a desk and computer - which I managed for a few years before photography became so mainstream.

TIA

229,"Note: Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I work in a small metal fabrication shop, with 12 employees. 3 in the office and the rest of us in the back.

One of my co-workers, who has been there for a year and a half, has been spending more and more time in the bathroom each day. He has also developed allergies. At first, I figured he just a small bladder and nature hated him.

Until today when I watched him rail a line of coke off his car dashboard on his lunch break.

He's a good worker and there have been zero issues with him. I don't want to be a nark, as I also like to party; just not on company time where you have a great chance of losing a finger.

What should I do?

230,"I'm a student and started a new job today. I got sent home by my supervisor because I didn't seem to ""have a clue"" what I was doing.

All my previous jobs I've been bad at. I've been reprimanded at work often for ""not trying"" even though I DO try, I just come across as useless for some reason. I feel like I need to be spoonfed everything to get anywhere.

I'm nothing special in school - a lot of my essays and work in general is less my own words and more reconstructions of other people's points/words. I'm not creative, don't have any kind of artistic talent. I'm average at best at everything.
I have trouble coming up with my own things to say and verbalising my own opinions (which are often just things I've heard or read somewhere else). I'm not great at socialising. Even my cooking cleaning etc skills are at a minimum.
Even the dumb things that don't matter I'm not good at. I can't make an outfit look good without basically copying what my friends wear, I can't draw anything good without tracing (and I've been drawing for over ten years as a hobby).
It sounds like I'm just really self conscious but that's the thing - I'm not. I'm just not GOOD at anything. I'm either painfully average or just plain bad. I have no talents or anything to fall back on. Everything I try I seem to fail miserably or just do enough to get by.

I'm really struggling I guess to find myself. I want to be able to make something of myself and put myself out there but nothing I do pays off. And I have tried, believe me I have, but it always seems like nothing works out. I just felt empty and melancholy all the time to the point where I feel unmotivated to even get out of bed. I'm wondering if anyone has ever been in this spot and has any kind of advice they can give me.",05Jan2017,1
233,"I'm succumbing to this, as noone seems to want to help me, thank you for taking your time to read this if you are. I'm a young 14 year old and recently my parents have been extremely strict with me. It started with nothing more than a dirty room, they got mad about that, and then tiny things that I have issues with have become huge ones, such as taking the spare key cause I don't have one, or other things, but recently the bomb shell was a bowl of cereal. I, very hungry, went down and got a bowl of cereal, only to be refused to by my father, then 2 hours later, still extremely hungry, went down and got it, I do not know what I was thinking but I was tired and hungry and its what I did. Then my parents found out and for a hour and a half I was verbally berated being called a ""psychopathic slimeball piece of shit"". I was just starting to get their love back until I fucked up literally five hours ago. Since they were also mad at me at my grades, I've been desperately trying to get them back high, but alas, periods before an important test today, I blanked, I forgot everything, and in a pressured panic, I wrote the formulas I forgot on my hand, again my luck, moments after the test was handed out, I remembered everything, then, I got caught. My teacher called my parents and right now I am hiding in my room awaiting my punishment, I don't know what it'll be, but my dad looks fucking PISSED. So, here I come for advice. First of all, how the fuck do I get out this slippery slope, it feels like I'm fucking up left and right and I cant help myself, it sucks, a lot. Secondly, what should I say when they bring up this cheating scandal, do I beg for forgiveness, or do I try and make them understand my view? Please help, thanks.",05Jan2017,3

237,"First off. im a high school 11th grader. I dont even know if im goign to get accepted into any college due to my misdemeanors. (bad history of mental health). 

I try to show that I can change with community service hours at my local church. I need 40 hours by the end of may 31st. 

So far ive done 5 hours at a physical therapy place and oh boy is that place boring to help at. So ill give my local church a taste. 

Uh. So far I like the idea of talking to people and understanding how they feel. I really reallllly like the idea of filming and writing but the problem is i am terrible with writing but I can see my self documenting how people live. I like other countries. I really want to speak at least 2 more foreign languages. (really European languages but if it comes down to Spanish than I will force myself to learn it). I really want to aim around international studies/political science. I do not know where to start this stuff worries entirely. If I cant get into any college than ill just resort to much more extreme measurements. So far i have been getting into video editing, but it is not much at the moment just some really cringe memes. 


For the people who have ADHD and cannot read a 192 word passage I will shorten this up with some bullets. 

* Want to get into college but I dont know where to start

* I am looking into international studies

* I love other countries and talking about politics (not American of course)

* Do not know if wanting to be good at video editing and writing could mean anything with my case. 

* I love talking to people and helping them go to a better place or feel better

* Understanding how people think and advocating their lifestyles is something I would love to do.
