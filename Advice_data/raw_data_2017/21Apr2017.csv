6,"I'm a junior in high school, and theres this girl in my grade who I have had a crush on for a good long while (hence my skepticism). The reason I'm confused as all hell right now is because, in the last 2 weeks, she has been interacting with me waaaayy more than normal, texting me out of the blue (she had my phone number from a group project a while back), and just generally seeming way more friendly/leaning more toward potentially interested BUT: we basically only talk about books, which feels much more like she just wants to be friends. I was going to dismiss it, but then today in class she teased me and patted me on the shoulder, and apparently, (according to my best friend) thats flirting.

10,"I work for a large telecommunications provider in the most droneful of corporate drone departments. We basically keep track of all our customer accounts and fix whatever the sales people screw up. I, specifically, look at our systems and processes and find ways to make them better. Most of the time, this results in my writing software or creating databases for our team to use. As you may, or may not, know this takes a lot of work. A lot of this stuff boils down to scripted tools to do repetitive work so people can truly multi task or spend their time working on more compelling work (yes I'm the guy building the robots that are going to take all our jobs).

My boss does NOT realize how hard making and maintaining all this stuff is, she frequently refers to what I do as ""waving [my] magic wand"" or something similar. When I try to explain just how much effort a task will take, I'll get a reply: ""Can't you just sprinkle some pixie dust on it?"" I should also mention that she regards the 40 hour work week a MINIMUM and has no regard for work life balance (other than her own, of course)

How can I make my boss realize how hard I work?

P.S.
I don't have a computer science degree so just up and getting an new job in the field is kind of out of the question. I'd like to get one. But see my comment above about work life balance.

11,"Background: I applied to six colleges, and I was planning on applying to several overseas (UK and France) which were going to be my priority. I was fully planning on going overseas.

I hadn't yet applied to my overseas schools, but I was super excited to go abroad. In late December, my family was going through some very tough issues during the time when I heard about my final two colleges. I got into one, but not the other. The day I got these letters, I made the decision to go to the school I got into, fully committing to the school. I never applied to the schools overseas. 

Four months on, I've been happy with my decision. However, in the past few weeks, I can't shake the feeling that I should have applied to the overseas schools and gone there. It doesn't help that this week a few of my friends announced their (completely surprising) plans to go to the very schools I was considering. 

I've already committed to my school, and it's a good school, and I'm sure I would be happy there, but I don't know if it would be the best thing for me. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm terrified that if I stay, I'll have wasted my chance to go to my dream schools, but I'm also scared that if I switch schools, I'll realize that I should have stayed. I definitely rushed into my decision, and I don't know how to rectify it. There is a chance I could still apply to some schools abroad, as I haven't yet missed the deadline.

I need help figuring out what to do. It's completely ruined my outlook going into this fall.",21Apr2017,1

16,"So here's the whole story.

2 months ago I talked to one of her close friends to talk about it, she said to go for it since she was easy to talk to and she isn't judgemental. Seems easy right ? 

I asked her if I should DM her since when I talked to her it was winter break and it wasn't until 2 weeks school started again. When I did we had a very short conversation. The thing is she asked me about something but I didn't try to carry on the conversation, I just said "" uhh no "". She never saw it though so I'm not sure, she doesn't use Instagram a lot so I'm not sure.

Now two month later. I want to talk to her but I'm not sure how to ( i have a class with her ). She's always talking to someone else and I want to find her alone walking somewhere else so I can swoop in but there hasn't been an opportunity yet. 

I also want to know what she thinks of me, she's that kind of student whose silent and has all A's while I'm here with 2 C's, 2 A's, and 2 D's ):

19,"Before you read 

**I am seriously asking for help/advice. Nothing in this, is meant to brag in any way. I am giving as many details as I can, in order to allow some good-hearted people to help me in any way they can.**


**Please read all lines**


**I am 17yo male living with my parents.**



**SCHIZOPHRENIA**

I have schizophrenia that absolutely no one knows about me having. I don't plan to tell anyone about it anytime soon.

I [rarely] smoke marijuana because I enjoy the effects it has on my mind.

I have a remarkable ability to intrigue women very easily through the way I talk, yet I always regret using it after I do. I always end up losing confidence, or ending our ""relationship"" because of something they did. I have never had an actual ""relationship"" (gf/bf), yet I can start to build one with much ease, with any female willing to talk to me. My friend's girlfriend caught feelings [badly] for me after talking to her, AS A FRIEND. I believe a friend's girlfriend should be able to be friends with his friends. I feel like all this is because of the way schizophrenia makes me think and talk.

Personally, I hate dating terms. Boyfriend, girlfriend, talking, etc. I hate it all. I hate the idea of making sure everyone on social media knows everything you do together because it is a ""given"" that we just have to post every aspect about it. I hate the idea of having to do things for birthdays and anniversaries. You should WANT to do things for those occasions, not feel like you must. This, I also feel is caused by schizophrenia.

I believe schizophrenia is the cause of my extreme ambition and creativity, which I will get to.



**THOUGHT PROCESS**

Something makes me extremely ambitious. I have dreams, and ideas, etc. that I MUST see happen.

I don't want to go into too much detail, on my aspirations but, I want to own a clothes brand. I feel like that is the best way for me to express my mind and general thought process. I want to do things that will bring people together in a ""modern"" way. (I'll explain if anyone asks). I want to be something. I want the things I say, to mean something to people. I want to be important. I want to be an influence on modern culture today.

I consider myself as an extremely creative person, lacking options to express it. Portrayals of creativity and ingenious thoughts always intrigue me, especially when said creativity is from modern culture. 

•	Modern music, mostly hip-hop and R&amp;B. Recently I have been amazed by the pure genius of Kendrick Lamar with his new album. I can’t help but be jealous of him. I thoroughly enjoy the true talent shown by artists.
•	Creativity in clothing is another one of my favorite forms of this. When artistic designs and patterns display true talent, it gets to me.

I believe I can point out real, genuine creativity, over fake creativity, created only to make money or some other boastful reason.



**FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND LIFESTYLE** **The biggest part I want help/advice with**

For the last bit of information I need to get out here, I want to say that I have so little support for anything I do, and I’m not sure why. I believe it has do with the seemingly common idea of ***working hard to make your dreams come true. Although very few will support you in the beginning, you have to work hard and eventually it will pay off.*** That’s what I always tell myself. But I can’t think of anyone who genuinely, fully supports me, not even my parents. It always comes down to:
* not having faith that I could do anything big with my life
* the fact that I don’t try in school on most subjects. This is because I don’t see reason for it. I only put in effort when something is inspiring or intriguing to me.

It seems as if most of my friends take advantage of me. I have no one that I can talk to and be real with. There is no one like me at all to thoroughly be myself. I can elaborate. It seems like I’m always the one that buys others stuff, or help them in some way, though they never do anything back for me.

As I said earlier, I am a very ambitious person. I work on myself, I work on my brand, but I feel like I am so lazy. I need money to make things happen, as anyone would, but I can’t get a job. I am not trying to be spoiled, I’m not trying to be lazy, I’m not trying to be pretentious, I just can’t. Having a “9 to 5 job” makes me absolutely hate myself. It kills any creativity I have, it makes me dread life; It is just a vibe that I cannot have in my life. I have ideas, thoughts, processes, that having a job like that literally just makes me lose all interest, and I can’t have that. I do stuff like mow lawns, buy and resell things, etc.

I don’t like the way I’ve been raised, or the place I’ve been raised. I live in a small town where everyone thinks that success (dreams coming true) is purely luck. It’s all about going to college, getting good grades, never getting in trouble, and having the most fun childhood possible just to grow up and have a working, static life. There is nothing wrong with this type of life if that is what you desire, but it isn’t for me, yet everyone expects me to live like that, but I refuse to do it. Unfortunately, that means the only people I can even slightly relate to, are the “bad kids”, the low lives, etc., because they are the only ones that disregard school, and do things outside of school that I enjoy doing… Only I don’t particularly want to live a “hood life”, I just wish I could’ve lived the life of a New Yorker, for example, or just a city life in general. I hate that I’ve grown up so out of my place.

I am kind of close to my mom, but I am not close to my dad at all. Me and him are both polar opposites. I listen to music very often. In the car, at the house, at family gatherings, etc. I have to sometimes. Either I do it because of the way music affects my schizophrenia, or because I'm feeling extra creative and I want to gain something out of it. My dad hates it when I listen to music like this. He hates the aspect of my creativity (he is like the people I talked about previously about the way I've been raised). He obviously doesn't support marijuana at all, but what parent ever does... and both of my parents religious views are different than mine. I don't believe in the things they do believe in, and that's not an easy topic to discuss with them.



**IN THE END**

In the end, 
I want advice on:

* how to deal with the whole hating relationships thing
* how to express my mind to people and them ACTUALLY understand me
* how to deal with the inability to get a job
* how to deal with my dad's complete disapproval of my lifestyle
* how to make the best out of my surroundings, and live the type of life I want to live
* how to deal with the fact that I have no one that I can be 100% me with

* and most of all, how to find someone or something, that will make me snap, and help me realize exactly what I have to do to create the future I want to live.

**Absolutely any answer to any of these is appreciated. I am confused about how my life is going to turn out and I want to know anything I can do to guide it.**

22,"Hi all, I'm performing in my school's talent show (I'm 14), and I stupidly chose to do stand up. I want to do well but I just don't think I can. I can't memorize my act, I don't know what to do on stage, whether to move my hands around, whether to walk around, I just feel like I'll do terribly and, ironically I guess, become a laughing stock (he he, get it? This is why I think I'll do terribly lol). At my school I'm an outsider, and yes I have many friends but I'm not very social, I don't like parties, or social gatherings and such so I'm scared of being bullied and stuff if I don't do well.

24,"Im looking to join a football (soccer) team again but my problem is im not sure where to tell them I like to play.
Im a very all-rounded player, I'm kinda tall, Im not slow but not really fast, Im not weak but Im not the strongest player ever, Im good at defending but good at attacking.
The first team I joined I was kinda a back-up sub guy. I filled in for absentees, if they put me left-back, I'd do a fairly average job, not an amazing job, but I'd do what I'm supposed to fairly well. If they put me striker, which they did a few times, I'd do a fairly average job as well, maybe get 1-2 goals, wouldn't always score but I'd give the defence a good go and help my other striker out. The only place I do truly good job is central midfield: I have so much energy to burn all the time, I run past people with the ball, I stop counter attacks, I start counter attacks, I slow the game, score long shots, assist, slide tackle etc. I do everything you'd want your CM to do, pretty well. I left that team because I didn't like the manager, he was a nob in all fairness. I then joined another team who were supposed to be ending because they had a lack of players, we had enough by the start of the season and I was starting every game in CM and the manager loved me, I was the best player and it was nice to be appreciated that much, he listened to everything I said and took it all on board, he helped me, I captained the team. My only problem was, the team around me weren't at the same level. There was a time I'd ran back and slide tackled someone and carried the ball past like 2-3 players then put it on a bloody plate for the striker but he just rolled it wide, the defence messed things up and I kinda just carried them in a way. I was not the top scorer in the team, but the top scorer's goals were basically from me and my mate who played Left Wing. I dont mean to sound big headed, the team just wasn't good
I enjoyed CM but not the team.
When I join my new team, where should I play? I can player literally anywhere, but before you say CM, I dont wanna say that straight up incase I have the same problem with the team being poor.

40,"So, to start off, I'm in high school. Before this year I had never been to tardy to any class, ever. Starting around second semester, my brother started driving me to school. At first everything was fine, but lately he's started waking up late. It's gotten to the point where almost every other day I'm tardy. I've already gotten three detentions for it (two 2-hours and one 4-hour detention on a Saturday). If I get one more tardy, I get an In School Suspension (ISS). That goes on my permanent school record, right? Does this seem unfair to you guys too, or am I overreacting? I've tried to convince my brother to wake up earlier, and he says he'll try, but most of the time, he just falls back asleep after his alarm. Doesn't it seem kind of stupid that I'm going to get a permanent blemish on my record just because my brother likes to sleep in some days? 

Aren't detentions meant to fix problems? How am I supposed to fix something out of my control? 

Also, I have no other ways to get to the school other than my brother. I've tried contacting my vice principal but he didn't help at all, he just said to try and convince my brother to wake up earlier or take another way of transportation which like I said, is not possible.

51,"Basically, I'm stuck between two career paths. Dog grooming, and Phlebotomy. Odd choices, I know. A career with animals has always been my goal and passion, and Phlebotomy was a split-second decision I made not long ago as a career choice since I was undecided for years. But now I'm stuck between both and I'm unsure of which to do.

Both will make a similar basic ballpark salary from what I've read, below 40K/yr.

Phlebotomy will provide me with benefits (If I don't go corporate grooming that offers them); Insurance, 401k, etc.

I love animals, and as a child I vowed to devote my life/career to them. That view still hasn't changed, and while grooming isn't some animal life-saving career, it's still directly in my field of interest. Medical careers were always a ""Yeah, maybe if shit doesn't work out, it'll always be there"" option.

I'm already working as a bather for a dog groomer, who is willing to train me. This place isn't corporate, it's family-owned and they can't offer any type of benefits, but I've already got my foot in the door and I'm on my way to the next step.

With grooming, I can go my own way and become my own boss if I want to be brave and smart about it and take that step. I can't exactly be an independent Phlebotomist and will always be in a hospital, lab, etc working under others. Not a deal-breaker, but once again, being my own boss was a dream of mine.

With Phlebotomy, I'm guaranteed work more than I would be at a groomer. In the several months I've been a bather, I've had a few days where they tell me to not bother coming in because everyone cancelled/no one got scheduled/there's only like 1 or 2 dogs and they can handle it. For Phlebotomy, I'd have an hourly wage. Not so much with grooming if it's not corporate, once again. Though you can stay longer and groom more and earn extra income, so more work=more income.

I don't know guys. My mind is telling me ""Phlebotomy is a safe bet for your future"" but my heart is saying ""Do what you love, you're already so close!""

I need some outside advice that's not people just saying ""Follow your heart"" because I'm not trusting it right now. I'm 26, I need to get my shit on track and fast, I feel like I'm wasting time. Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you do? How did you choose, and were you happy you chose the way you did?

TL;DR: Can't decide between a career in Dog Grooming or Phlebotomy for various reasons. Need some outside advice from unbiased minds. Follow my heart? Or Follow my brain?

So after a haircut I have a totally different look and I decided I was going to be a different person for the better. But all the events after getting a haircut all seemed to be bad. I've had 2 failed relationships ( you might be thinking you're just a kid don't get involved in serious relationships but honestly I was comitted) I have friends in school but I can never seem to make anymore because I'm a shy and quiet person and I've been trying to change that. Basically I'm asking for help I don't know what to do I just feel a lot of loneliness and sadness that I just don't know how to overcome. Thanks for taking a time to read through this rant.,21Apr2017,1
57,"Basically we just moved into a house after living in an apartment for years. There's a spigot outside but the water was coming from the property next door and has since been shut off. We rented under the impression that we'd have access to a hose, but we don't. LL won't pay to install outside water access. With summer around the corner and two little ones who'd love to finally have a sprinkler or kiddie pool, not to mention planting some stuff, I'm wondering what to do. Our basement leads outside so I'm wondering if I can get a super long hose and hook it up to water there, or wondering if a plumber for this would be insanely expensive. Any advice appreciated.

60,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost 7 years now and we have known each other for 9. I currently live with my sister, I have a good job, graduated from college and I'm pretty independent but I feel so lost. My home life sucks and I don't feel like I have support. Let me explain. Currently my sister met a guy and he moved down from another state like a month after, he started staying over every day and now he basically lives there. I told her how unhappy I was with the situation (especially since he doesn't pay rent) and she just ignores me. He basically never got his own place and I feel Iike I'm being pushed out of my own home. I love my sister but she is very selfish. I have chosen to stay there because it's basically my place and because I can't break the lease. I mentioned to my bf that I would like to move in with him when my lease is up and at first he was ok but now he's mad at my sister for ruining his plans. He wanted to save money and get married first. Now I can live by myself. I can afford it but I would rather live with the person that I love. I am pretty depressed because I feel so alone. I wonder if he really doesn't want to move in with me because he wants to do things right or because he probably never wants to commit. I don't know what to do and I'm so sad. ",21Apr2017,1

So about 5 months ago now I had to stop going to school due to severe Misophonia. If you don't know what Misophonia is, please google it. It may not seem that bad to you but it's god awful and has ruined my life. Anyway...because of the Misophonia that has led me to also have severe anxiety and depression. I was at the point were when I went to school I would end up having a panic attack and hiding in the bathroom all day crying. So I had to stop going. And ever since then my mom has been so hostile towards me. Telling me to kill myself and threatening to throw me out. I never took her seriously but very recently (about a week and a half ago) I went to a court meeting about me not being able to go to school, stuff happened during it which led me to staying in a mental hospital on suicide watch for a few days. And since then my mother has told me I have until the first of May to get a job and pay rent and to buy my own food and other stuff like clothes, shampoo, etc. I guess I can see where she's coming from if I was well not so mentally ill I can't even leave the house anymore. I've tried getting a job but nobody will hire me due to my mental health. How am I suppose to get a job and pay rent and buy my own stuff I need if I can't even go to school anymore..? I'm just so stuck and I really need some advice. I have no idea what to do. On Sunday I'm meeting up with a lady that's wants me to do some petsitting for her, so I'm really hoping that pulls through and I can pay rent for another month and get some more time.

67,"I was at a supermarket and I was in a moment of weakness and hunger and I filled up one of the self serve cups with soup but instead of paying for it I just walked out. I know its terrible but in the moment I thought to myself ""Im just a poor and hungry college student who doesn't have 7$ to waste on this measly cup of soup, to this giant supermarket chain this little cup is soup is so nothing"". And its no excuse, but I had done this before a few years earlier with some friends and saw it as no big deal. 
However, I was calling one of my friends after and told him what I had done, and he got really angry at me, saying ""is that the kind of person you are? I thought you were raised better. I don't even know what to say to you."" He emphasized how he would never never ever do anything like this and would never ever even consider stealing anything, unlike, apparently, me. Then he hung up on me, saying ""I don't want to be friends with someone like you.""  ((side note. What he said about me not being raised better than that really made me so angry. It's fine if you want to say I'm a terrible person, because in this case I would agree, but don't say anything about my parents. My faults are my own.)) 
Now, I know that what I did is really despicable and I shouldn't have done it. And I do feel really really guilty about it and I don't know what I was thinking in the moment. I do really need to work on my self control. But I really don't think I understood why my friend was so upset. He was saying things implying that I was on a slippery slope to shoplifting bigger and more things and I just feel like he should know me better than that. Did he really not know me so well that he can end our friendship of 5 years in an instant over a cup of soup? Aren't friends supposed to accept you, flaws and all? It's not as if I'm a hardened criminal. I know if he did something like this I would forgive him. In an instant. 
I know I'm in the wrong here. Definitely. For sure. And I have apologized. But he won't accept it. It's as if my whole image is marred in his mind, and I think he's wrong to jump to conclusions so quickly. And it's not as if I had portrayed myself to him as someone super pure and goody goody before. As with all close friends, he's seen my ugly side. 
So reddit, please help me. I don't want to lose this friend, especially not over something like this. How do I swallow my pride and help him see that I really am sorry? I know he's really stubborn in his mindset. I've tried apologizing, and he's said things along the lines of ""it doesn't matter if you're sorry. you did it anyways, and i just dont think i can be friends with someone who is willing to steal.""

But then he hits me with this and tells me he wants to hurt me while we have sex ( slapping, restraining, choking like S &amp; M mixed with unrelated beatings feels more like he just wants to beat me and then have sex). I was kind of taken back and asked him why exactly he wants this I get the whole BDSM kink but he told me if he can hurt me while having sex I would be consenting to it and he would be able to take out his frustrations and anger on me without actually harming me because I would be enjoying it ) does that even my sense.

Our relationship is kinda funny. We roast each other all the time and do things to annoy each other. For example, he'll hide my shit when I'm not looking. I'm pretty sure he only likes me as a friend though (considering he was seeing someone before... Broke things off with her though).

72,"I finally got my fidget cube delivered just a couple of weeks ago and I have grown quite attached to it. I have a moderate stutter and also work as a Sonic drive in carhop. My vibe has helped me greatly while at work with my stress on the job throughout my shifts including with my stutter. The day I got it my coworkers were nuts over it and snagged it every chance they could. Managers and fellow carhops alike. The cooks were the only ones who (mostly) didn't care for it as well as a very select few others. 

For those of you who don't know about Antsy Labs funding this fidget cube on Kickstarter let me give you an idea about it. It is a stress cube that fits in your hand and has multiple different sides to it with different things to fidget with. It is of great quality and on KS was $22, $25 retail value. 

So I attach my fidget to my employee card which I have to use to take customer orders as well as claim orders to take out and clock in/out. I was working Easter Sunday and by that point had good reason to not be so sharing with my fidget cube. People would often want to hang onto it during my breaks or while I was talking to customers. People often wondered off during their own breaks with it. I had good reason it would get lost or ""misplaced"" (stolen) by someone. So I tried keeping it clipped to a belt loop on my pants or just keeping it in my apron. 

When we get into a rush though I do sometimes just dump it on a tray or table or carelessly hand it to a coworker when I am not there. So tonight the latter happened. A co-worker asked to see my card/fidget cube to scan an order since it was going late. I flung it at her as I already was taking out 2 late orders atm. Minutes later I run back in to take care of the rest of my orders and it took me a bit to realize the horrible truth. After taking out those orders it had slowed down and I started to search my apron for my fidget cube. Realization hit me I asked my coworker. She said she had left it for me by the drive thru. It wasn't there. We had slowed down but not enough where orders had stopped coming in so I couldn't stop to look for it long. I looked under trays, outside the drive thru window and the whole drive thru section. I looked thoroughly throughout the store after we closed. Nada. By this point I had been assigned anew card but idc I paid good money for that cube. After we all clocked out for the night I told my coworker who had lost it she would have to pay for it if it didn't turn up by Saturday night.  

She didn't argue like I thought she would though I put that on us all being exhausted. It is 1:20 am and I finally got home so yeah there is that. I don't believe for a second she will actually pay for it. I am a little too nice of a person and so I am going to tell her she will not have to pay for shipping or the prism the cube came had (a keychain carrying case) but just the retail price of the cube itself.

Anyone who has ordered a cube knows how frustrating this is for me. I backed it way back in the beginning of October and only got it a couple weeks ago. I am not interested in getting a cheap knock off from Amazon just because it will be cheaper and delivered quicker. I want my cube back that I paid for and will begrudgingly await another cube's arrival if it come to that. 

I need to know how I should approach this when she will (more likely than not, trust me) tell me she is not going to pay for it. I know she has no money, none of us carhops do but you have to own up to your mistake and pay for it. If I hit someone's car I would cover the damages (let's just say this is a scenario where neither one of us has insurance nor wants to involve police), if I dropped someone's phone in a sink full of water I would pay for a new phone. Now a fidget cube isn't of the same monetary value I know but it is about doing the right thing and she needs to do just that. ",21Apr2017,1

77,"I am normally a bitter and unemotional person (thanks adderall). I had a horrendous back injury and was volunteering at a camp, I was in rough shape at this time and my health was declining so i tried to mask the pain and how scared I was by being arrogant and careless, I started to flirt with this girl that I had found attractive since I first saw her 2 years prior in one of my classes, but i was always too shy to talk to her that much. So i was flirting with her and was beginning to get to know her, basically becoming her best friend in a few days and texting her nonstop when we werent with each other in person. Given I had been experiencing random episodes of paralysis and excruciating pain as a result of my spinal injury I said ""fuck it"" and decided to ask her out thinking I could potentially die any day now as I had no clue what the injury was and my evaluation wasnt until months from then. She said yes and i quickly became deeply in love with everything about her, potentially because I am a nerd and dont usually feel emotion and usually dont have the courage to ask girls out. I was far too in love with her and couldnt stop thinking about her and those feelings were reciprocal. My first real date was with her to the movies, I will never forget that day, i, being a total nerd, never imagined this would happen, but it did: we kissed, it was my first kiss and she is extremely physically attractive too (there is some bias). It felt exhilarating and when went to my house briefly we kissed again for even longer and i felt like i was on top of the world! I felt true childish joy whenever I was with her. I was blindly in love. Soon after my condition started to grow worse and I was prescribed opioids to deal with the pain, this caused me to think irrationally and have fluctuations in extreme happiness and extreme sadness. I made some regrettable decisions and I was unable to control my urges due to these circumstances. I frequently attempted to have sex with her or do naughty things in public (remembering this is making my stomach twist). She prevented me from doing said horrible acts and was unusually cool about it. I wanted to take the next step too soon and was pressuring her a lot (I feel sick thinking about it). One day when she was over at my house the opioids got the better if me and she was okay with it so we did anal. She was emotionally cold that day and a bit sad in hindsight but the drugs clouded my assessment of the situation. She later went through some emotional patches which were completely justified and i was in no position of stability to help her and we eventually broke up. I feel like a jerk and that how she was treated was unfair and I wish I could make it up to her or go back in time and i feel extremely guilty and these thoughts go through my head every night keeping me up and occasionally bringing me to tears. We broke up months ago and I dont think she wants any part of me and I need help on how to move on, I still love her and would love to change how things went and relive that first date infinite times. I have since fallen into a reclusive state built up with multiple facades (including one of exuberant false confidence coupled with some self deprecating humor to attempt to cover the black hole of emotional and mental pain I feel), and emotional detachment and a lack of happiness of any sort, I also have a lot of family issues going on currently including my dog that I had as a child and grown up with having died a week ago. I need to get over my ex so I can enjoy life and potentially avoid serious contemplation if suicide. How do I get over her?

79,"So, my work is transitioning everyone over to a 4 10's schedule in July. They restructured everything and had one on one meetings with everyone today to offer  you your new shift and get your input, change things around. For the people that work 4 8 hour days (like me) they offered 3 10's. I know it's only a 2 hour difference, but I'm finding myself balking at only getting 30 hours a week. You can pick up an open shift pretty much whenever you want and get extra hours, but I'd like more guaranteed, I guess. 32 was always a little iffy anyway.

Also, when they offered me my new schedule (11-9:30 Saturday-Monday) I told them I've been wanting to move into an earlier shift if possible, so they offered another shift of 8-6:30 Monday-Wednesday after working the original shift for a while as they get the new hires trained. So, I accepted that, but I feel like I kinda fucked up.

A.) When you work weekends at my job, you get +10% added to your hourly wage. Which I'm used to and kinda don't want to lose.

B.) Weekends are much mellower and I really like working them.

Buuuuut, I've been debating this as working weekends has taken its toll, I have no days off with my fiance and that's getting difficult. Plus it's harder to get together with friends so I feel a little isolated.

I know this is incredibly dumb and rambly, but I guess I just can't decide what to do. Ask if I can make it a 3 12's schedule for more hours? Say ""ah, I fucked up I would rather continue working weekends"". Ask if they can just tack on another day and make it 4 10's? What's more important, more money and mellower days or more time with people outside of work? Probably should have asked more about this at the meeting but it was at the end of my shift and I ended up just accepting what they pitched. I dunno.",21Apr2017,1

The TLDR is that uni has me super stressed. I'm going to graduate in the summer.

My car is parked directly in front of my door and I noticed that the car looks wet and it's not raining outside. The car was literally doused in rubbing alcohol. Completely covered in it. Even on the bottom, looks like they went underneath the car and put it on everything underneath as well and inside. By the time I realized this this person was long gone.

What should I do now? 

I'm feeling kinda lost. 

Should I attend community collage and try to get perfect grades and transfer to Cal? 

That would be almost ideal, if I could pull it off, I think. 

Should I go for a guaranteed transfer to another UC? 

Seems like the reasonable option. 

Should I return to UCR? 

If my parents would allow it, I could get an off campus apartment and take UCR classes via the extension center. 

It would be good because I've already friends and obligations there and it would be good not to abandon that. 

It would also be good because I really would rather not live at home. 

On the other hand, I never really liked UCR. 

Should I attend some other university? 

I have no idea. 

Should I take a summer internship or seminar or something in the liberty movement? 

It would be fun, and a nice change. 

Perhaps that's what I need, change. 

Still, it isn't something I really want to pursue, and I have other reservations. 

Should I put off doing anything and instead focus on addressing my mental health issues? 

Mental health is important, and I can't do much else without it, but treatment doesn't seem promising.

89,"I hope for my sake people who click here actually read this, because I'm dying for a second opinion from people who don't know me personally so the conversation won't go off course.


With that being said, for many years, I've been having problems connecting with a lot of people because I can be quite Toxic. I am cynical and quite the misanthrope which, I think, is part of the problem why I am like this. 

I psycho-analyze everything people say and I always subconsciously dig for the alternative motive of why they said that.

For example: I recently joined a discord of a Twitch streamer and was poking around. I didn't really like the streamer but I subscribed because I felt more engaged than normal with the stream. But I talked to her mods and some of them told me that the server was Diverse. I scoffed at this immediately and tried to explain that its not diverse. All the people there were only slight subgenres of the demographic the streamer gave off in the first place. The Twitch who owns the server was playful, cheerful, into Japanese culture and liked being cute. So of course everyone in the server was the same. Care about feelings, cute avatars, please don't disrespect anyone or the white knights will come out, baby/animal talk. To me, some of this diversity comes from that. You have Anime lovers, Furries, Bronies, Otakus. Which is diverse, but is it really? But the point is, This is how I thought of the situation in my head and it kind of set me off a little. Then these mods went on to tell me what other discords they're mod in. Which set me off even more. Because were they telling me to make conversation, or do they get some kind of high off this being mods in multiple streamers discords? 

In conclusion: I always see the selfishness in people and I think I'm so good at seeing it cause I am selfish too. Every word that comes out of a persons mouth, is like walking on eggshells with me. One slight tone or variation of even the most trivial sentences can turn into big debates on the implied message behind it and I don't know how to stop it. I judge on a dime and I categorize people like a produce section at a grocery store.  I strike like a shark that smells blood when I hear any form of selfishness or badly time confidence for the wrong reasons.

94,"Hi all. In a bit of a quandary and could use some fresh eyes on this.

So about two years ago I was working for a pretty good company doing a job I really enjoyed, the company was growing quickly and soon bought out all of their competitors. Soon after the final merger was announced, my employment was terminated for what I feel was a silly reason. This left my life in a bad spot, and I had nowhere to turn for another similar job and have been struggling a bit since, working jobs I don't really like.

Recently a new company has moved into the area to fill the competitive gap, and I got a job in their first hiring wave. 

In my capacity and another job I currently have, I ran into a former colleague from the old company. He's a really nice guy, I still get Christmas cards from his family, and he'd give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. His wife is an old friend and is just as wonderful.

While I was catching up with him, I asked him about how his company would be dealing with a new large competitor that they wouldn't be able to absorb easily, and he volunteered lots of information about the strategies they were already implementing.

I'm really considering turning this information over to my current employer. I've been trying to make a name for myself there and I think this would prove my ability to go above and beyond and really put me in a good position, but it also feels like a betrayal of my former coworker, a person I really like, who has never been anything but kind. 

I'm torn, what do you all think?",21Apr2017,2
95,"Hi,

First of all, i'm not suicidal or something like that. my problem is: i'm anti-social person. i used to be shy but it developed into lonliness. Nobody feel me, nobody cares about me.

At school, i'm the ""genius"" person, as people think, even tho i'm not really. However this sometimes makes people respect me, but no one feel to talk with me. I don't blame them to be honest, because the only subjects i can discuss are school-related subjects. This is my last year, I'm pretty sure when i'll finish my school i won't have anyone by my side. The main problem is that i know the solution, i have to change, but if i change people will notice and i'll become even more isolated. My second problem isn't that big, I'm extremly lazy, i don't have the will to do something, it doesn't matter if it's day or night, weekend or weekdays, i'm always tired and lazy, i can't even go and practice some sport, mainly collective sports because of my first problem.

105,"I approached him about the issue, expecting him to be even more understanding about how huge of an issue this is for people that can hear the bird within a 17,428 mile radius and can't even open their god damn windows to cool off the house.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Instead, I get an idiot who admits that it is absolute hell for him, but outright refuses to let me on his property to 'take care of it' (which in my mind means invoking their supposed inherent aggression then beating it to death). Why?  
Because 'it's against the law'. Of course. It just *had to be* one of *those* people, whose morals and actions are entirely guided by legality.  
He's the only person in the neighborhood (that I know of) that has things like double-locked fences and motion detector lights. So I can't exactly be sneaky. And even if I could shell out tons of money for a gun, it's now obvious who shot it. If it suddenly disappears, it may also arouse suspicion.  
The trees here are also immense, so even if a water gun would work, it would not reach this embodiment of satan.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Supposedly it's disallowed to harm/harass them, but at what point does that thought process just become outright fuckin retarded as we permit them to abuse dozens of apex predators relentlessly every day for 6+ months?  
A lot of the advice I've seen (while researching how to take care of them) is testament to human stupidity: Move somewhere else. Make it someone else's problem. Drown it out with 8 fans running 24/7. Wear earplugs all the time.  
Notice how none of these actually solve the core problem - they just make it not affect you. If you stab your ears with chopsticks to drown out stadium music, that doesn't stop the music.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The bird issue here is already absofuckinglutely completely out of control during the day and I already have to take ridiculous measures just to drown out the noise during the day while heavily restricting going outside. I'm not going to do that same shit at night and allow birds to dictate my *entire* life.

114,"A little background: I'm 24 year old guy and I've only been in one (relatively) long term relationship. I don't have a problem with the opposite sex. Never really had any bad experiences, don't have trouble making friends or more intimate relationships. The one thing I've had trouble with in the past was feeling ""loved up"". It always takes me a while before I start feeling butterflies and can't get the person out of my head. My last relationship lasted 5 years, but it took almost a year of being in the relationship to feel like I was in love, and I really never went through an extended infatuation period. In fact before that I cant remember a time when I was infatuated with someone. I know that's a little weird, I think I'm a warm person it just takes me time to feel those sorts of emotions strongly.

So my relationship ended earlier this year, and I feel really good about it. We ended on great terms, it was mutual and there's no awkwardness between us (we're in a lot of the same social circles). I'm enjoying being single, I have an active sex life but don't really feel like getting into anything more serious than that.

So here's my problem: I met someone at uni recently, we have a few classes together and we're friendly, but nothing more. She's not exactly my physical type (she is good looking though), but our personalities are similar. I haven't been flirty at all and neither has she, but for the first time in my life I can't stop thinking about someone. It's been a few weeks now, and it's really starting to play on my emotions. I can't figure out why this is happening or what to do next. I really don't want to be in a relationship, and even if I did I don't think she feels much towards me. I feel terrible every time I see her because I know there's nothing there and it feels almost creepy talking to an acquaintance who I can't stop thinking about. I play out all these ridiculous scenarios in my head of meeting her parents and impressing them and of going on hikes together and showing her how I cook my favorite dishes and all these things that read like a 14 year olds love letters.

How do I deal with this? I've tried hooking up with other people to see if it would break it, but it hasn't worked. I've upped my running/gym routine to try tire me out. Is it a waiting game? Do I just need to go through the rest of this semester and wait till this part of me and the rational part of me meet and I don't feel like this?

I know that was a bit rambly, it's the first time I've tried to put my thoughts together and I really don't even know what I think.

Thanks for the advice.

122,"I was seeing a guy for a few months, we got along really well, hooked up a few times toward the end. He ended up getting an important internship back home (we're at two different schools in the same city, but pretty far from his hometown) so he's been gone for the semester, but I feel like things are unfinished. The last thing he said to me was something like ""I do hope I see you again."" No idea what he's been up to, because we're not super connected on social media, but I would like to see him when he gets back at either the end of this year or beginning of the next semester, because when there's unfinished relationship stuff out there, it's hard for me to completely move on (the person is always in the back of my mind until everything's worked out, even if I'm dating, etc.), and because I do feel like we have the potential to be great together.

Since we ended things, we've only texted once (about a month and a half after last seeing each other,) just about some silly thing I needed advice about, but he was receptive. He usually watches my Snapchat story and likes my Instagram pictures.

I think he might be dating or hooking up with someone, but I don't think he would be serious with anyone because he's just coming back here soon anyway, and I know he doesn't want to do a LDR because of his relationships before me. There is a possibility that he's hanging out with his ex, but he has told me that he's ""done with that"" and from the way he described their relationship was as him being with someone that helped him at the time, but was over, because he couldn't do a LDR and it seemed that he hinted that the relationship wasn't actually healthy for him in the end. Pretty sure they're hooking up though. I couldn't really be mad anyway, because we're not together (but it could be an ex!) but I'm hooking up with someone I have no feelings for, and it's great, I just miss having the other stuff too, and don't know how feasible it is for me to move on in a relationship direction with anyone until I've talked to the first guy again.

How would you reconnect with someone when you have no idea what they've been up to? Choices for correspondence are Snapchat or texting, and I obviously know that I could just text ""hey, how've you been?"" But it feels weird because I don't know when he'll be back and I don't know if it makes sense to start talking if we won't be around each other for months. Do I do nothing and just try to move on? Or reconnect? Do I wait until I know he's back to try anything How do I try?

tl;dr: Was seeing a guy, he had to move home for 6 months, a little social media interaction, only texted once since, he might be hooking up with someone (possibly and ex?) but I really don't know, I'm hooking up with someone, but no feelings, and trying to figure out how to reconnect with this guy in the least weird way.",21Apr2017,1

125,"I'll try to write this without giving a life story, but it'll require some background I think.

So whilst I was growing up I found that I was always the one getting picked on a lot, and always the one people would have a go at riling up or pissing off, probably because it was ridiculously easy to get a reaction out of me. It's kind of hard to remember what exactly, but the general idea was that I took almost everything personally: whether it was somebody being even slightly impolite or coming across in a way I thought was rude, or taking pot shots at me for whatever reason, even if it was just 'banter'. 

School was always pretty difficult because of this: when the wrong people picked up on it they'd do their best to make my life difficult, and it wasn't exactly hard for them to do so. It didn't help that I was also generally pretty socially hapless (in fact these two things were most likely related) and had no idea how to deal with this stuff or make it stop. As I grew up though I became a bit more apt at getting on with people, and started to figure out what was serious and what fell into the category of banter or friendly joshing about. 

Fortunately these days I generally get on quite well with people, which is great and I'm happy for, and on top of that I seem to have a bit of a thicker skin than I used to. However I've realised that there are still things I get really agitated by that other people seem to be able to shrug off easily, and though it feels really feeble admitting this it seems to be mostly to do with internet-based spats: whether I get into an argument over politics on Reddit or Facebook or something or just get some random flak from somebody it really gets me agitated. Like I'll be feeling really riled up and unusually angry over it, it'll linger in my mind for hours or even days like it's personal, and I never seem to be able to just shrug it off like most people seem able to.

It's weird because I've been described as fairly stoic in other areas: people say that I deal with stress (E.g. exams, deadlines) really well, or generally cope with adverse situations or pressure in a stable and productive way. I just don't get why I take this stuff so personally, and it doesn't help that I find it way too easy to get roped into arguments online or react to things that I see. 

This all feels really pathetic to admit and I feel crap about it, but I need to ask for help because this is not a healthy way to live when I do rely on the internet and social media a lot during my day-do-day. So yeah, any suggestions? I'd hugely appreciate any input.

126,"So, I have been in a relationship for about 6 months now and it all started out very happy. But after about 3 months things started to change.My boyfriend is a very busy guy, he works full time and he goes to college and takes care of his grandmother. He often takes me out for dinner and picks me up to spend time with me since I don't have a car. I think I show him that I love him, I often tell him why I love him and how great of a guy he is I make little surprises for him, sometimes I write him love letters and we have sex regularly (every day). But somehow that doesn't seem to be enough for him. He often tells me that he feels unappreciated and unloved. He doesn't seem happy until I do something for him eg. a sexual favor. He usually is very grumpy when he gets up in the morning, even when I bring him coffee or make him a bath or something like that, it is almost like I have to earn his happiness every day all over again. It feels like I am walking on eggshells and cannot do anything right. He is often late a few hours when he picks me up and I don't say anything because I know how busy he is, but if there is only the slightest sign of anything bothering me he will get upset and tell me that I am spoiled and ungrateful. He often minimizes my achievements in college. I am a 4.0 medical student and he goes to a community college, but he keeps telling me how easy my school is and that probably everybody has a 3.8 or so. He straight up says that fights are 100% my fault even when he starts them. It feels like I'm being trained into only saying the things he likes, never express any criticism and run around like a puppy serving him and his needs just to have him act normal and happy.
I understand that everybody is grumpy sometimes and that we don't always act rationally and that I probably overreact sometimes too. I just feel like I am working my ass off just for peace between us and he pretends like I don't put work into our relatoinship.
I love him, but this relationship is making me unhappy.

133,"Hi,

I am seeking for advice in the decision which language I should learn. In my university the language courses are always full and so you have to apply by drawing lots. After applying for several semesters for multiple courses and always having bad luck I was lucky in the last semester in which I'm eligible to apply. The problem is that I was admitted to the beginners courses of both Chinese and Japanese.

My dilemma now is if I should try to learn both languages simultaneously or waive my seat in one of those courses in order to fully focus on the other language. The logical follow-up question is which language I should give up if I give up one language.

I am a German, so I don't have advantages learning any of those languages and I study computer science, so I am at least used to learning lots of different languages, albeit those are mostly programming languages. Currently Japanese seems to be more beneficial, especially in the robotics sector, but the Chinese have the manpower to be relevant in many sectors in the future.

137,"I'm a 17 year old girl -- a junior in high school -- at the start of my first relationship. The guy I'm with is 18 and a senior. We met through a retreat at his church because my youth group leader used to work at his church, so we were invited on their teen leadership retreat back in September. I've been talking almost every day with this guy since February, and though we're not ""official"" yet, we've been sorta-dating since the beginning of April.

He and I have been making plans for things we want to do together this summer, since he lives about forty minutes away from me and we don't get to see each other much right now. One of the things we've talked about is going up to the mountains with a group of our friends and staying in his family's cabin up there for a night or two. But I'm not sure I could convince my parents to let me go.

He's a really sweet guy and our relationship with each other so far has been awesome in terms of communication. Since our relationship is based on our Catholic faith, we've both already expressed that we aren't interested in having sex before marriage. He's asked me about my boundaries in terms of physical affection, even telling me that he wouldn't kiss me if I wasn't comfortable with it. I think it's all pretty mature -- not in the way that we think ""we're almost adults, we can do whatever we want,"" but in the way that we both know what makes a healthy relationship and we're willing to put in the effort it takes to make things work.

But the whole 'staying in a cabin with a bunch of other teenagers and no adult supervision for one night?' I'm not sure my parents would be cool with it. Before even suggesting it to them, I'm going to make sure they've met all the friends we'd be going with multiple times so they're familiar with the group. All of these friends are Catholic like me and my boyfriend, so we all have a similar set of values. And we'd have separate rooms for girls and boys to sleep in, obviously.

I was wondering if I could hear from some parents and see if it's even worth it for me to bring it up with mine. They're not crazy strict, but I still wouldn't be super surprised or think they're unreasonable if they said no. I just want to have a good chance for ""yes"" if I *do* ask.

It's difficult to get him to talk about it because of how painful the situation is for him, but as I understand things it went like this..

My friend had 2 daughters in Oklahoma with a woman who is not the picture of mental stability. She had 1 son before he got involved, by the name of Merlin. His 2 young daughters, Galaxy and Mystery are the root of this. A few years ago, he noticed that his baby mama was acting strangely and he assumed that it was on account of her taking drugs. He threatened to have the kids taken from her in legal custody.. and it turned out she was actually fighting cancer. After that altercation, she vanished with all 3 children and will not allow my friend to communicate with his daughters at all.

Their grandmother on their mother's side has acted as an intermediary somewhat, requesting money and phones for the kids that he has been sending. However she rarely responds to his messages. It *is* possible that he's sent her hundreds of texts without replies, understandably.

In return he's received pictures of the girls every so often, but that's basically all. 

I want to help him find his daughters, and bring their mother (and grandmother if she's liable) to justice. She cannot be allowed to steal these girls away forever!

141,"Hi r/advice,

I have found myself in a quite complicated situation and I hope you will be able to help me choose how to proceed. However, before we get to the crux of the problem, I would like to give you the background of how I got into this mess. If you're short on time or patience, feel free to skip to the last two paragraphs.

The story begins 6 years ago, when I enrolled in a translating/interpreting course on a university. I had always been quite good at languages, but I found the course pretty dissatisfying. 

I have dropped out after a year, but since I had pretty much no marketable skills at that point, I decided to try my luck in another course. I wanted to study something creative, but I didn't know what, so I went for something general – mass media communication. I'm sure most of you are rolling your eyes right now, but it seemed like a pretty sweet deal at the time – the university I chose had access to professional grade TV and radio equipment and they had creative classes of all kinds.

I have enrolled in the course and for the first year I had the time of my life. At some point during the second year I have rediscovered my love for programming and I have finally decided that my future career would be the one of a web developer. I have started learning web dev stuff again, so I had no time for the extracurricular activities which made me enjoy the course in the first place. I had decided that I would quit after getting my Bachelor's degree.

After a long and painful struggle I did indeed get my degree. However, the second part of my resolution was not destined to pass. You see, my older sister had dropped out of her Master's/Engineer computer science course in her last year a few years earlier. She had a reputation of being a great student, a borderline genius even, but she completely burned out and failed at the last hurdle – her thesis. Our parents, especially our mum, had invested quite a bit of time, energy and money in ensuring that we would be able to concentrate on our studies, so they were understandably dissatisfied. I think it's because of this that they put me in a position where I was basically forced to continue my education.

I have changed my course to marketing communication, which I thought would at least be somewhat more beneficial to my web development career than the mass media one, and onward I went. In our last year we had to find a month-long internship in some marketing-related company, and I managed to get it in one pretty cool web development/IT company. The manager had offered me a job when I get done with my degree (though I'm pretty sure what he meant by that is that I would finally have time to work fulltime, not that I would actaully have a degree in hand).

Enter today, the day I was supposed to hand my 90k character long thesis in. It is currently only 65k characters long and I'm pretty sure that most of it is complete b******p anyway. I have fallen victim to the same thing that had happened to my sister – I burned out. I realised that the time I have spent studying is time wasted, completely useless to the career I had planned for myself. I realised that the university was geared towards making us all into academics, and that's something that I have just no interest in.

Finishing the thesis on time is out of the picture now. My options are these:

1. Try to finish the thesis over the weekend and try to hand it in on Monday. I have heard that there is a chance it will be accepted anyway. The problem is that I'm not confident I'll be able to finish it well enough to pass and I will waste money even getting it printed and bound.

2. Try to get the hand-in date moved to sometime in June and exams to August. However, this will mean that I will have to keep up with this Hell for another 3 months. Also, if I'm unable to start working I might lose the job spot promised to me, but if I do start working I might not have time to produce a good thesis anyway.

3. Just quit. I would be able to start doing what I want and even get paid to do it. However, the situation within my family is already pretty tense and this could push it over into all sorts of unpleasantness. I actually got a call from my mum while writing this post and when the truth came out... Well, it wasn't nice.

So, what shall I do? I'm looking forward to your suggestions.",21Apr2017,1
142,"Hi I posted here recently about how I don't want to go back to uni as I will be doing a new degree in September and I'd rather work.

143,"I posted this about a week ago, but i haven't really gotten over it or know how to deal with it etc, i will post the same thing i posted last week since its quite a bit of text.

'I wish i was kidding. im 20 years old, a virgin and until yesterday evening, never kissed a girl either. So my friends invite me to go party with them, and i make it my goal to grow some balls and talk to women there. In the beginning it was really hard, since im not used to it, but it soon became so much easier and it was the only thing i really cared about while being there (for 5-6 hours). I kept trying to get a girl to dance with me, kiss me, grind on me etc...

After a few attempts, i succeeded and got this STUNNING woman that i would never even have thought about aproaching to kiss me on the lips (for the first time in my life). I quickly started to be needy/pushy and eventually she got annoyed with me (the fact that she had her friend with her didn't help me either). So that felt terrible, since i had my first kiss with a stunning woman, but who now disliked me. I kept aproaching women there, and got them to hold me and i held them by their behinds (sometimes just squeezing it if i saw they didn't mind). One of them had a boyfriend and even though i THOUGHT about letting her go, somehow i couldn't control myself in the beginning and kept my hands on her butt and playing with her (not kissing, but i laid her hand on my crotch while she was just laughing). Eventually, i snapped out of it and let her go because of the boyfriend, it felt bad and it seemed like i had control again.
That same day, a girl suddenly comes grinding on me (i didn't even notice her) but i played along, soon i was also touching her, grabbing her behind and breasts, i even went in her shirt. She didn't pull my hands away or something so i assumed she was fine with it. Suddenly a guy comes and i think he pulled her away and told me i crossed a line there, so i asked the girl if i did something bad, she said no (as i remember) but my thoughts are really messing me up, not knowing sure if she said it, but at the same time im pretty sure. Then again, i ask a girl if i could buy her a drink, she said she had a boyfriend, but we agreed on me buying her a drink in change of her giving me a hug and kiss on the cheek. Now my mind is not letting go of me again, i think about how much of a disgusting person i am, that i messed up my first kiss, that i 'might' have gone too far with that girl that was grinding on me, etc.. 

I cant stop feeling bad, and im scared of something, im not sure why or of what. But i dont know who i am, if what i did was necissarily bad etc...
At this very moment im constantly beating myself up again mentally, thinking im disgusting, worthless, shameful,.. I asked my friends about it and they said i shouldn't stress and that he saw it and that the girl wanted it, and that if she is in a relationship and doesn't mind me holding her like that, its her fault, not mine... But then again, my thoughts come beat me up again, saying they lie and that i deserve bad things.
Was hoping someone could help me out Sorry for the long text


Thanks in advance'

Yes this is a serious question.
I have to take a drug screen for a new job I was offered and this is the kind of job that will change my life for the long haul and offer me so much. I am so excited for this.

I went to a concert on Monday and there were a few people in the crowd smoking weed near by. I was in the mosh pit having a great time and didn't care. Now, I was told I have to take a drug test. I am positive it is just a urinalysis and not hair.

Backstory: About halfway through my last semester, I kinda just freaked out. I decided I hated my major, I stopped going to class, stopped doing all assignments, and started drinking and using drugs heavily to avoid having to think about school or post-grad plans. Somebody suggested I go to therapy so i did. I got on an antidepressant that really worked for me and quit all substances. My motivation returned, I started looking for jobs I'd qualify for, and started telling people that I would indeed be graduating this semester (I had previously warned the family that I was worried I wouldnt). I turned almost all of my grades around except for one. This isnt a hard class, but its at 8 am on Mondays, I never went, and I did all of the assignments except for a paper that was worth 25% of the grade. I did all the work for it, I just never finished it or turned it in because I was too nervous to bring it to her office hours. I already took the final exam and got a 90% but I still don't know if this could save my grade.
What do you guys think? Should i talk to her and see if I'm going to pass or fail? She hasn't posted the final grade. Should I finish the paper this weekend and bring it to her? It was due a while ago. If I do fail, should I just repeat it in the summer? Will they still let me walk at graduation? I'm sorry if this is long-winded, I just feel like my family will think I'm a piece of crap if they all came into town for nothing. Thank you guys.

150,"Looooooong story:

Me and my girlfriend graduated from hotel management school. We managed to score a decent sized room in the city we work, but we live with 2 other guys that we share the bathroom, toilet and kitchen with. The problem is that we are very neat and clean people, they are not. The point: we want to move to an apartment for our own.

I've made some stupid decisions like quitting my job during my probation month because I didn't like it. Instead of waiting for something else to come along. Now my girlfriend was working and she's been paying rent for this month. I've provided for her A LOT in the past, so I'm not feeling guilty about the fact that she has to do it, and she doesn't mind it at all just to be clear about that.

So, since we want a new place to live we both need steady jobs in order to pay for rent. That's why I decided to start bartending because it was very hard for me to find a job, and I knew for sure I was able to do this. The job is actually very nice and within a month they will have me promoted to be a supervisor of the bar and in the future there are more possibilities to grow. The hours are at night, which is the first thing that my father doesn't approve of, and the second thing is that he says ""he didn't pay for my hotel management education for you to go and bartend. Something that someone without a diploma could do too."" I see it differently. I haven't worked in a bar before, even though I have quite some experience in the Food and Beverage part of the hospitality industry, and I see an opportunity to learn more about the operational part of a bar. Things like making cocktails, shots, etc. Plus, like I said, I'd be able to move up quickly if I do my job well. The problem is that my father just doesn't seem to listen. Whenever we call he's always like: ""have you found a new job yet?"" or ""for how long are planning to bartend?"". Right now, I'm just happy I have a job and that me and my girlfriend are able to search for a new place. The hours are already hard enough, but him launching annoying questions like this repeatedly really starts to get on my nerves.

What should I do? Am I doing things wrong? Should I not have gotten this job? My father is a hard man to handle and really stubborn. He just does not want to listen sometimes which is extremely annoying. It's his way, or the high way.

162,"I'll try to sum up my situation as quick as I can, can give more specifics if something isn't clear..

I'm 24 now and just recently recovering from a chronic illness since I've had since I was 16.  I had chronic fatigue, pain, brain fog, memory loss, concentration problems, trouble staying awake including while driving..

Had countless blood and hormone tests, some sleep studies, went to every kind of specialist, tried loads of antidepressants..  The only thing that worked, for 1 month, was the antidepressant Wellbutrin, although on subsequent attempts at taking there was no effect at all.

A couple months ago, I learned about parasites, candida, fungus and probiotics..  Well I've been taking anti-parasite, anti-yeast and anti-fungal supplements along with probiotics for a couple months now, along with eating foods like pumpkin seeds, raw garlic and cinnamon that kill/harm parasites..  Plus lots of kombucha and..

I've been shitting out tons of eggs and worms.  As far as I can from Google, they're tapeworms and tapeworm eggs.

All this medicine failed me, but fucking black walnut, pau'd arco, wormwood and the like worked and I've been gradually getting better, feeling my symptoms go away..

But during all those years of being sick, I royally fucked my GPA in college; tried going back 5 times because..  Well..  I didn't know what else to do.  My GPA is shit now, I'm permanently unable to get financial aid, have no-one I can get any kind of financial help from.. 

Actually, my mom, who is extremely depressed and in her situation will never be able to retire, lost one of her low-wage jobs last year, needs MY financial help and daily help around the house.  Which I don't mind, but..  That, along with working minimum 40 hours a week and driving minimum 6 hours a week, all this before I can even think about classes with a record that I can't get expunged..  It's impossible for me to go back to school in this situation.

I COULD go to trade school, my job would even pay for it, and I wouldn't mind it, but..  Living in Japan and having a family with a Japanese girl is all I want, I get incredibly depressed at the thought of anything else..

I have no problem working hard, but..  A trade just isn't good enough.  During the 1 month an antidepressant made me feel better a few years ago, I had learned and memorized all hiragana and katakana as well as a few dozen kanji and some grammar..  So I have confidence about my ability to learn the language, but..  It seems like without a degree, no amount of hard work is worth anything.  I would love to do construction or welding, but..  Fuck.

I'm about to just go through a trade, cut off contact with everyone I know and just do whatever jobs get thrown my way in welding or construction..

Since he has more insight, I want to go with what he thinks is best, especially since I was hesitantly leaning that way myself. However, I cannot get past the nagging feeling of it being wrong to alter my baby in that way. As much as I hate to admit it, my only reason for wanting to do it is because of American societal standards.I am confident in my ability to teach my child to clean his body and am not concerned with that factor and also feel fairly confident regarding medical risks either way. I wish that societal pressure did not matter, but it simply does and I hate that. I know several women who will not be with an uncircumcised man, and while I realize that it reflects more poorly on them than the man, it breaks my heart to imagine the rejection and shame that person would feel. My ex was uncircumcised and he caught a fair amount of teasing as a kid and was very guarded as an adult that no one ever knew. I don't want my son to feel that way. All that said, it also breaks my heart to imagine my baby on a cold operating table having a part of his body mutilated. I know someone and my husband knows a few men who opted to have it done as adults and they said it was an awful experience...My husband says it makes him grateful that it has already been done for him and he doesn't remember it. He is sensitive to my concerns, but thinks it is best in the long run. I just don't know either way.

176,"I spent the last days working at a meditation retreat which has allowed me to do some soul-searching. The work there made something painfully clear to me: I cannot deal with criticism in a helpful manner. Whenever someone has criticized me, be it at work, in relationships or friendships, I have always reacted in the following ways:

- The person does not like me anymore, they probably think that I am a total waste of space, and they hate me for it.
- I´m not good enough, I´m not only bad at the area that they criticized me, but in any way. I´m a phony, and even if I have done things correctly, this was just luck.
- I get defensive, trying to justify my actions. It´s the fault of the other person, not mine. I cannot bare to feel guilty, so in my mind I have to put the other person down. If I don´t value the other person´s opinion, they can´t hurt me with their criticism.

After the criticism a long and painful thought process starts, in which my mind comes up with all kinds of scenarios concerning the future relations with that person. These spiraling thoughts consume a lot of energy, and the outcomes most of the times are: The other person does NOT hate me, nor criticize me as a person, but just for that action. I feel elevated, until the next time someone criticizes me and the whole process starts again.

What I would like to know is:

1. Is there a psychological term or medical diagnosis for this kind of behaviour? 
2. What usually causes this kind of behaviour. What has usually happened in the childhood of a person with these symptoms? As far as I can remember, my parents have not been overly critical of me, but I do remember some instances where my mother was very frustrated with me, even yelled at me if I screwed up. But then again, whose mother did not? The relationship to my father is alright on the surface, but I can´t help seeing him as a rival, and I´m always trying to be better than him when I can. I don´t know why, though, because he has never intentionally hurt me in any way.
3. Is there anything I can do to stop these thought processes before they spiral out of control? Meditation has helped me, being aware of my negative emotions and how they manifest in the body. But they consume a lot of mental energy nonetheless. 

Maybe someone can relate, give me some clarity, maybe even suggest a form of therapy or psychological councelling, and give me some tips, because I feel that this kind of self-destructive thinking has really affected my life negatively in all kinds of ways.

I walked back to the other person's car and didn't see anything noticeable on there. But to be honest I didn't do a major inspection or anything and a mark or scratch could've been left. I was walking away and as I was a little bit a way, I saw someone walking towards that car with groceries and packed the groceries in the car and left.

183,"Posting from mobile. Not sure of the appropriate subreddit. Need advice. 

I started therapy about 3 weeks ago and after 2 appointments decided that the therapist just was not a good fit for me. I felt judged and overall did not feel comfortable opening up to her. I can provide all the examples if anyone would like.

So, I called another therapist at the same office and was hoping to meet with him instead. He stated that we could meet but that it is the clinic's policy that I tell the other therapist that I no longer wish to see them.

I did so that night and left what I feel was a very nice but direct voicemail stating my position. I even wished her luck and thanked her for her advice and time.

She called back the next day basically asking for another chance. I was firm.

I left another voicemail stating after thinking about it for some time I know in my heart I just wouldn't feel comfortable opening up completely to her and wished her luck again. 

No calls back.

From there, I called the other therapist wanting to schedule something and did so for Friday, at 1pm. 

I arrived at the appointment. I was waiting in the reception area. I could hear my first therapist blabbing about a story I told her of an older coworker[50+] making me feel uncomfortable with his compliments. She was telling the whole reception area about it and I overheard it and she made it seem like it was my fault entirely. 

I was pissed and wanted to just leave. If the new therapist hadn't shown up literally 10 seconds after I overheard it I would have. 

In my session I started off with how humiliated I felt and was in tears. I even said I don't even think that's legal for her to talk about. He didn't disagree and said I think anyone would feel humiliated. I was pretty content with what he said but I wish he would have said I'll take care of it or something. 

I don't know if he's buddies with that other therapist. I don't know if I should have said anything to him. I don't know if it's illegal for her to say something but I am indeed humiliated. 

I don't know what to do from here.

I was horrified when i found pictures of another woman and a kid, and then a picture of the same woman and my father kissing. The pictures date back to April, 2016. At the time, my parents were seperated and planning a divorce because my father decided he couldn't live with us anymore and yeah, that's about it. He never mentioned anything about another woman and I know my mother has no idea about this. They made up last summer and things have been tough since he's still the same irresponsible prick.

186,"I apologize in advance for the length of my post, but this is my situation and I really want the whole story out to get your input.
It all began just over 20 years ago, my parents decided it was time to have a baby and so... , no I'm just kidding. Seriously though, It all began last year around May. I had just discovered Nofap and the longer I went without relapsing the healthier and more energetic I became someone else entirely, but that summer I worked over the course of 5 months for a relentless boss full time and overtime in a night job until fall where I became a bedridden corpse for a few weeks, this was only after rage quitting my job over text, I admit I snapped and I could have handled things better. Nevertheless, school started and after being fap-free for 4 months that summer I left my bad influence of a best friend, got a new squad, passed my classes, aside from the exhaustion life was good thank God. When I quit my job, however, that's when It all fell apart. I got sick consistently and all the energy+superpowers from nofap were gone, I got diagnosed with narcolepsy and seborrheic dermatitis and everything was going downhill. I am saying this because over the past year I have tried everything to become my best potential self from learning new skills, embarking on journeys/adventures, sleeping on the ground for over a month(getting perspective), staying fap-free of course, fasting many days at a time only having water, waiting out depression, showering cold, eating only veggies and oatmeal(living sugar,dairy,gluten,oil free) for over a month, giving up tv/music/ifunny/games/girls(religious reasons), even losing over 30 lbs of muscle and fat as a side effect of making sacrifices to follow my ambitions. **But as many of you know, you are never the same person you once were before achieving your goal and that is where I am stuck**. Last week was easter for my religious denomination and I spent the majority of the week in church. After easter, however, I asked what now. What do I do now, I am following my passions sure, but I don't enjoy music or tv anymore, I have forgotten the taste of sweets even fruits, I don't even dream about sex let alone entertain the thought in daily life and now life seems depressing. I am always tired and after sleeping 8,9,10,12, even 18 hours some days I am still tired and feel like 50-60% energy at best. I tried to watch tv and listen to music and eat watermelon but none of it makes me happy anymore, I can't enjoy the little things and I don't know what to do with myself. I am fortunate to have spiritual fulfillment and know my vocation and I am following my passions/hobbies but I feel nothing, nothing is pleasurable, nothing is exciting or intriguing and I just want, to want to live.There is a lot of crap and anger that tore me apart over the past year that I haven't mentioned but this is the gist of what matters, I'm sure people have been where I am and know the way out of this situation.

I'm in school for nursing, and work part time as a paramedic. My BF, of 2 years, is a nurse and makes pretty good money and lives at his parents saving since his parents sort of depend on him (he is 10 years older). My mom seriously overwhelms me. I have many things that are going on in my life and many stressors and she constantly harps on me for house chores, etc etc when she sees I literally never sit around doing nothing. I rarely go out and when I do I see my boyfriend or have him over since she enjoys being around him. She goes very mean and very cold with me and I'm conflicted on what to do. Should I leave? The stressors of work, school, life responsibilities and having her constantly harp on me is becoming seriously overwhelming to the point where I cry and feel extremely anxious. I don't want to leave home, because she does work out of the country most of the time, also finances and I'm afraid if I do move out to live with my boyfriend I'll be too distracted and not finish school. But I'm afraid my mental state/emotional state may not be able to take this kind of abuse anymore. What should I do?

189,"Some background about me, I grew up in a town of 7,000 people. While it really isn't the most cultured place, my family and I always traveled quite a bit so I got a taste of the world. When I was out, I always was so excited about what was out there. I told myself I would move away and find success in a big city.

And I haven't failed. I was very successful and well liked at the 5th biggest company in a particularly successful industry. Yet I felt like something was still missing. So I switched industries not too long ago to the second biggest company in an even bigger industry. I also have just shifted through roommates again (important for later).

Meanwhile back home my Dad recently retired, and my sister gave birth 13 months ago to twins and they are amazing. While my friends seems to shift with the times -- especially as I start to see some get married -- and my lack to attract a long term girl friend. I am starting to feel as though I've really lost sight of what's valuable. I want to see my nephews grow up, I want to talk to my parents face-to-face when I need advice, I want to take time for myself.

And this latest job shift is kind of showing me more that I feel sure of this. My last job was a huge time sink, but I felt like we were a team and I loved seeing my coworkers. Here, I feel like we're all competing more or less.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, actually, it let us know more because she's told me everything about her relationship over the past four months (she even told me she lost her virginity), and he doesn't know anything at all. 
About him, he's actually really beautiful and he knows how to dress, and I think that's why she is still with him: I mean, he's pretty stupid or at least not intelligent. Me, on the other hand, I'm not that beautiful and I don't actually dress perfectly, but I think my main strenghts are my intelligence and my ability to give good advice.

My group is no different. We all planned on going, but now we are not.

210,"Hi all, bit of a background :

when I graduated high school in 2015, my parents decided they were gonna move. By 2016 they were able to sell our house and move. I went with them obviously because I didn't have anywhere else to live and they were gonna put me through school. I left behind a large circle of friends, a girlfriend (who is still my girlfriend, but we haven't seen each other in months when I was able to save up enough money to visit), and a lot of memories. When I arrived I started going to community college this most recent fall. I passed my classes, and same with this semester. I didn't meet anyone though. In fact since I've moved here I haven't left my house for anything other than to get fast food or go to class other than the time I saved up enough money to visit my hometown. 

I just have no one to talk to anymore. Even my long distance girlfriend and I have grown farther apart. I've tried breaking it off with her because I can't stand the distance but it hurts me too much and it hurts her and I can't stand to see her hurt. We've been together almost 4 years now so you can see why it's hard. 

I've tried to talk with and meet people but nothing ever works out, I get really awkward trying to be outgoing and i just can't do it. And my family just got a brand new boat and I've been wanting to take a bunch of people out on it one nice day but that'll probably never happen. 

I'm just broken. Every day is the same. Wake up, eat breakfast, go to school, eat dinner, do homework, go to sleep at 8pm. I don't think I can take another year of this or possibly more. I just want to die. 

I have two options in my life. I can stay here and be miserable and finish my associates and get a job. Or I can move in with my sister in my hometown and give up on school and get stuck working in the God awful restaurant I used to work at, but at least get my old life back that I was happy with. But even if I go back I can only live with my sister for so long, and I won't be making enough to live on my own. And if I stay here I might get a well paying job, but what's the fucking point in that if you don't have any friends or anyone to talk too.",21Apr2017,1

Okay cool that was fun and now I can design posters and whatnot for people.

Alright, First things first. I was born in Canada from immigrant parents. I understand I am more privileged than most people in the world.

I am blessed with a greater opportunity here and I fully understand that. I just want to get this out there.

During Grade 10 I started to go to school less and less. Skip classes and just stay at home and game. Naturally, my parents were angry at me and we always argued. Whenever I argued with them, I never really let out how I was feeling. And since English isn't their native language there was often miscommunication too. This went on for months to the point where they gave up on me. Looking back, I realize more how was in the wrong in this. I understood I was hurting my parents every time I was fighting with them, and it returned like a double-edged sword; where I was hurting also. And since I was the eldest (I have a younger sister) I felt this pressure to do extremely well. Friends tried to reach out to me but I shut them out. Around Grade 11 I tried to start fresh in the New Year. It didn't work. In fact, it got worse.  I even tried switching schools to see if I can change my lazy ways and take education seriously. No, luck. I started not going to school again, and argue with my parents. This time my feelings would be bottled and I showed no emotion when fighting back. Eventually, when I was alone in my room I would start to let it all out and cry constantly every day. I remember one day where my mom made lunch for me and I just took a bowl of it and when straight to my room. I was crying while I was eating. I realized then and there, I was truly depressed. Luckily a friend reached out to me and helped me get a job so I can get out of the house more. He also recommends I move out for a bit just so I can experience the hardships of independent living. My parents approved of this and we all thought it was the best for us. 

(If you're thinking my parents didn't raise me right here, please don't. In this point and time, I struggled with mental illness and we were not sure if it was real or not. My parents are actually my heroes when it comes to work ethic and family.) 

So there I was, a barely 18 Year old living with random strangers working full time. I liked it a lot actually. What I discovered here was that I love the feeling of hard work. Of accomplishments in tasks and being a team (I worked full time in fast food Lol). It finally felt like I was doing something useful in my life than wasting my time in school. 

(I encourage everyone to stay in school though. If you’re doing great in a subject or something truly interests you there then stay. A school was just not for me and I hated every minute of it. I hated how closed I felt in the classrooms, I hated how tests were given only to prove that we can study for a day and get a decent mark without learning anything, I hated the attitude of my generation when it came to school.) 

So eventually I transferred positions to move back in the city (I was working 20mins away from the city) and I moved in with that ‘friend’ that helped get my job. He helped me go back to adult education too. But living with him was a disaster. I didn’t know this “Friend’s” true personality until I was living with him. He was toxic to his core. He treated his “acts of kindness” as a debt collection. “I did this for you, so you do this for me” He abused my kindness in terms of helping him with his tasks for his jobs (he was a contractor and ex-assistant for a politician). He was always on a power trip because he was the oldest one in the house. (We were all around 17-18 and he was 30). He abused me mentally/verbally, made me feel small and I’d never thought I would be depressed again but it happened. It was worse because I was physically harming myself (cutting) because of all the mental stress I was getting living in that house. Eventually, I fought with him and broke ties with him and went back to my parents’ house. I didn’t tell my parents about this experience because our families new each other and I didn’t want any more drama. That was the last time we ever spoke.

(Before I talk about my life after that, I need to take you guys back to what I was raised around and my family. This is to help understand my current situation.

Alright. So, growing up it was always my Father, Mother, Sister and I. At around age 10-13-ish we found out that my Dad had another family back in the Philippines that he never told us about. 2 Half-brothers and a half-sister. I didn’t know what to do about it. I was a kid and I felt angry that Dad never told us about this. This later created conflict in my perspective of him. I kept thinking things like “he doesn’t care about this family, he only cares about the ones in the Philippines”. I would later hear mom and dad fighting a lot. This created a fear that still exists today. The fear of division and divorce. I remember mom yelling at the mother of my half-brothers and sisters’ mom. It woke me up actually and the look on my mother’s face scared me. It scared me in a sense that I was going to lose someone. “What is going to happen now?” was an ever occurring question whenever my extended family in the Philippines was brought up as a kid.  Months ago I find out that my father had another child with someone long time ago. So we have 3 different families in this mix. I’ve met my half brothers and sister and we are all nice to each other. It’s just the mothers, naturally, don’t get along with each other. And as much as I want my dad to stick with one family, I understand that he cares for all families. Pretty messed up right? Currently, my parents and sister are on a vacation in the Philippines.)

So here we are today, back to where I came from. Home. But this time it was slightly different. I was experienced in life. I decided to continue that adult education but quit my job. Our family also decided to foster a kid. (This kid honestly saves us sometimes because we put him first and put our BS to the side). And I make income through babysitting. I tried another job which was door to door sales but it wasn’t my cup of tea so I quit. Since my adult education is a part time thing, I had a lot of free time still. I decided to start an online business. For the first couple months, I was pumped because it felt like I was doing something productive again with my life. But then my bad habits started to kick in and I got addicted to gaming. And an even worse habit formed which is watching Porn. I’m talking about daily addicted. It sucks. I tried NoFap and failed multiple times (still trying). I’m trying to pray more (I’m Catholic and it's actually helping). I just can’t seem to focus, and procrastinate my priorities. Because of this, I lost money not keeping track on my Ads for my business, and buying useless things online. I even started not going to school again and I just have a semester left till I graduate. Life in this moment feels much disorganized. 

Why I decided to write this today
I received a facetime call with my mom who is currently in the Philippines. She was in distress because she found out my dad has been texting his ex (the mother of my half-siblings) and living there for the past weeks. (Keep in mind that my parents are in there 56-60’s with heart problems, and other health issues) According to the texts the mother doesn’t like my dad hanging around with my mom and even sent her own son just to spy on my dad when he’s with my mom. Like c’mon they are married! I grew up living with my father as a committed married man to my mother for the last 20yrs. I understand that he has family he cares about but you, can’t just walk away like that. Maybe I’m speculating too much here and he just misses the extended family a lot but, he blocked my mother on Facebook. Even after they’ve spent time together in the Philippines for the first couple weeks. I’m currently trying to call him but no answer. A lot of questions are popping in my head: 
“Is this the thing that will cause a divorce in this family?”
“ If he does walk away from this family, what will I have to do now?”
“ How long will it take for me to truly Man-Up to my own responsibilities?”
“ Dad WTH?!”
“ *Sigh*”

I’ve been dealing with situations like these throughout my whole life. I just pray that this isn’t the event that leads to our families being separate, distant or worse, spiteful.

Before you sh*t on my Dad: 
- He works from morning to night just to provide for this family here in Canada
- at the same time, he tries to send/ provide money for my step-siblings
- this man saved me and my sister's life from death when we were kids from mucus inflammation. (My sister and I had massive mucus inflammation where it got to a point that we couldn’t breathe. he had to suck all the mucus in our noses and spit it out.)
- He cooks daily for my family. 
- His siblings provided us comfort and love through the years.

As you can see I’m slightly stuck here. I don’t know what to focus on, how to fix this. I still have to wait a couple days to see how this plays out. I’m safe to say I am not depressed, just stressed. Like I said in the beginning, people have it way worse than I do. I just don’t have anyone to talk to this about right now. I’m trying hard not to lose myself.

TLDR: Dad had hidden extended families growing up. Got Depressed in High school, Dropped out. Worked and moved out. Fought with roommates and left, Learned lessons. Moved back with parents, Started a business, lost money. Got addicted to video games and Porn. Facetimed mom to find out Dad is with the extended family. All causing this super long post of my life story and what I’m stressed out about.

Feel Free to ask any questions for more clarity. Thanks for taking time to read through this if you have.

235,"Hello, my boyfriend and I (we're both 20) don't really know what to do right now.  A few weeks ago we learned that my boyfriends dad was moving due to work, which means he can no longer live there with his dad.  The good thing though is he will finish his associates degree in general studies (originally was going to transfer to a 4 year for BA in CS) before they move.

However, that leaves us in a tight spot.  I live with my parents as well, currently getting a pharmacy tech certificate which will take one more semester.  After that school won't be a factor for me.  However, my bf still wants to pursue a CS degree.  Problem is even combined, we wouldn't make enough to live on our own and pay for the BA.  

So the options are...

1. Gather up the 2 other friends and all live in the $2000 per month house, it would make everyone happy, it lets me stay close to family and not rush our marriage (we love each other very much and plan on it anyways but still) and my bf can get his BA, and live with our friends.

2. My boyfriend joins the airforce for 4 years.  He would be gone for a long time and when he gets back, we would have to get married. Its not what I would want but with this option there isn't much choice.  Then he would get his assignment and we would get moved somewhere, away from family and without friends, which I suppose is practical but comes with its own cons.  He would get paid, we would have our own place and he could finish his BA.  Admittedly it seems good on paper, I don't know how good it would be in real life though.

I would like options 1 because it allows us to have more time before marriage, my freedom and I'll be close to friends and family.  Option 2 has the most benefits though it seems... I just don't like the idea of rushing a marriage and getting shipped away.  Again, we love each other enough that I would do this, I mean... neither of us love the idea though.

Some followup questions... 

any huge cons about joining the military that are unforeseen?

We live in the DMV (Washington DC area), would it be possible to get any good decent jobs with associates these days? Or do you typically need a BA?

If you choose options 1, how would you go about it?

If you choose options 2, how would you go about it?

If anything else needs more explaining, just ask, thanks!",21Apr2017,1
236,"[Edit] *found

Recently I learned that my dad has been using e-cigarettes to quit smoking. I knew he used to smoke but I had thought he gave them up a long time ago. I found this out because he's really bad at being subtle and keeping things a secret.

So that's the first piece of information you need to know. Next, my oldest brother who's 23 has been recently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He's not been able to go and do anything with his life since he dropped out of college years ago, and this diagnosis was the explanation for it. He has many delusions such as believing that we're being poisoned by our water supply, and the reoccurring one: my parents are drug abusers/alcoholics. This is obviously not true, but also he has said that my dad is a smoker. I now know that this is pretty much true, and that my dad actually told him once.

Now here is my question: Do I tell my mother what I know about my dad? The reasons I should do this:

-I do not believe it would help his condition if we tell him that both his false beliefs, and reality, are not true

-It is a very uncomfortable truth to know and keep inside me without telling people (partially why I am asking this here)

Reasons not to:

-It would be a pretty harsh reality for my mom to face that my dad has been keeping this secret from her for such a long time

-It would change the relationships between the members of my family and probably embarrass my dad greatly

I do not know whether my mom knows about my dad or not, though it would be surprising if she didn't. So I need your advice, should I tell her what I know? Or should I not tell anyone just to avoid any future conflicts or problems?

Just so that you have all the information in case you might see an alternative solution:

-I am 16, in my sophomore year in high school
-My other older brother is 19, in college in Florida
-We had a traumatic event where my parents had to go on trial facing 2 years in jail that they won, but spent a ton of their energy on and stressed a lot about
-My brother's psychosis shows up depending on many factors such as if he is in a relationship or not, our pets, and our family in general

Thank you guys, I really hope you can help me out with this!

238,"Long story short, born with lots of medical problems. Can't talk right, bad hearing, anxiety, etc. Other than that I'm 'normal' I guess. 

Last 2 jobs I was at I overheard people asking if I was hired because I was disabled, and if I was the new retard. Both jobs just made me feel horrible about myself, and considering the jobs were basically slave labor for $11 an hour I just decided it's too much.

What kind of job can I get that doesn't require me to communicate with anyone aside from my boss? I have basically 0 experience and I'm 19. I currently work part-time at UPS and I like it. Hard work, but 0 communication and it's great. ",21Apr2017,1
239,"I'll try to keep this to the point. I live in the USA and went on a trip to Europe a few months ago with some friends from school. While I was there I met a girl who lives in the Ukraine. I was not in the Ukraine at the time, and have never been there, but she was also traveling and we crossed paths. We talked a little bit (I initiated it) and that was about it, and we exchanged some contact details. 

Fast forward a few months and we have been in contact almost every day since then. We even video chat on Skype on a nearly daily basis. I don't know if it irrational to say that you can be in love with a girl that I have only spent an hour with in person but that's what I'm saying. Thousands of messages, and I feel like we really know a lot about each other. I think about her all the same and I have no doubt that the feelings are mutual. She wants me to fly out again, and when I told her I can't said that she will always be there.

Here's the list of multiple problems. I am a 25 year old medical student. I literally will not have 2 consecutive free days for the next 3 years. So there is no way I can go back to Europe, period. It just cannot happen. The second problem is that even if I could go back to Europe, what in the hell would I tell my family? I'm going to Europe to meet a girl that I've essentially only talked to online? And the third (and fourth) problem, she is from Ukraine. There is no way in heaven or hell she can get into the United States to visit me. Even if I could go to Europe and spend a week with her, what then? We will still live 5,100 miles apart and end up in the exact same situation. I'd have to spend an absolute minimum of 6 months with someone before I'd even think about getting married.

I'm an above average looking guy, and have always worked hard and been successful, but this is honestly destroying me from the inside out. I've literally fallen into clinical depression over this. I've cried for the first time in over 10, maybe 15 years. The fact that I have not dated in a long time and honestly have no social life (because of school) has probably contributed to and worsened my mental state. I know the thing to do is move on and find an even better girl, but I have looked at my options and there is nothing on the radar, slim pickings and currently not a girl that I know that I would be interested in (and this was true even before my trip to Europe).

I want to ask what I should do, but I really only have one option. Forget about her and be happy single, until something else falls into place? I don't know, I'm just in a really dark place right now.",21Apr2017,1
