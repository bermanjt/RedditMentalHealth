0,"I'll try to make this quick, my dad has done some shitty things to my mom and they are having a divorce, I asked my mom if I'd be able to live with her when she gets a place of her own and she said yes. 

The part I need help/advice with is how do I handle my dad, I've never known the full story until yesterday and I'm horrified at what he has done for the past few years. I've asked him to promise me that he would stop the things he is doing and he seems like he will keep that promise, but I still don't want to live with him alone.

How do I take the step and not hurt my dad but tell him this is what I'm doing.",20Jun2017,2
3,"The other day I was working counter at mcdonalds, and they asked me to help take drive thru (which I'm not familiar with). I was taking an order and the person was disrespectful, they said they wanted a mcchicken and i asked if that was the combo or sandwich and they said ""LET ME FINISH"". They were talking extremely quiet and i had to ask them to repeat themselves. Their order was tedious. But I was respectful and provided great service. When I went to turn off the speaker cuz i was don't the order, i didn't hit the button hard enough. The customer heard me complain about them. I was telling a co worker that they were annoying, they customer heard me. The customer comes into the restaurant and speaks to my manager yelling. My manager must of told my general manager, because my general manager asked to speak with me. Mind you, i have never worked with my general manager, he barely knows me. I am a really good worker, i take everyones shifts, and I'm very outgoing. My general manager told me that they have to let me go, saying i have bad work ethic.

7,"We have been together for over 5 years.... Both in our mid 20s. I am 18 weeks pregnant. He wants to be a dad but hasn't been supportive at all, emotionally or financially. The relationship has been very fragile since becoming pregnant. We don't even live together anymore (we haven't for almost a year now) but we are still arguing all the time. 

I am not sure I want to keep fighting for this relationship, actually pretty sure I don't, but I can't figure out how to move on when a part of him is inside of me. This is my first pregnancy and it hasn't been pleasant. I can't wait to have my mind and body back. I'm so emotional and I wish I could get drunk and forget everything for the night.

8,"* I'm 18M, recently graduated high school
* the job is at Walmart (overnight stocking).
* I already have another job in mind that I can easily get.

* I've been depressed for about six years. Suicide has always been in the back of my mind, and it still is honestly, but it's becoming more and more of a realistic solution to me, if you know what I mean.

* I've been at the job for a little over a week (about a third of it was orientation stuff, the rest actual work). And I hate it. I mean, HATE it. The atmosphere. The coworkers. The management. Everything. Oh, and I don't think night shift would go well with depression and suicidal thoughts.

* My family has been pressuring me to get a job for a while now, and honestly, they're mostly the reason why I took the job. If I quit my first job, especially this early on, I know I'd get shit about it for the rest of my life (and that's no exaggeration).

Any advice, whether it be supportive or critical, would be highly appreciated. I have no one else to turn to, and I'm really ready to quit this job, if not, my life entirely.",20Jun2017,7
9,"Hi Reddit. 

My mates gf messaged me 2 days ago about something he did to her. 
I've known this guy for approx 8 years and he's been a great mate to me. Not only that but he is my employee. I own a small business and he's one of the few people I've employed and a hard worker. 
2 days ago he came into work late and explained he'd had a huge row with his gf. A few hours later I received a message from her out the blue to tell me he had raped her and asking for my help. This is really odd to me because I don't know her and never spoken to her before in my life. So why she'd decide to tell me about it, is bizarre? 
I replied to her saying I didn't believe her. And this is where she sent me a screenshot of text messages between them where he actually admits to doing it and apologising to her for it. The text said something along the lines of ""I should of stopped when you told me to stop. I crossed a line. I'm sorry I hurt you"". 

I have turned a blind eye to it because I'm really confused why she'd choose me to tell this to. We're complete strangers. I told her to go away and not to contact me again. 

But I can't say I'm not concerned because I have 3 young daughters who are around him a lot.

She had a small crush on me in college but I friend-zoned her despite the sexual tension on my end. I dont think i could live with myself if i cheated. Its been a while and we've had very little contact but still share similar interests and it seems like we would both like to start hanging out again.

How do i deal with what people will think? With what my fiance would think?
Should i even get back into contact with her at all? If i do should i set boundaries? Am I overthinking this? I just don't want my family and friends and girl to worry or make assumptions.

16,"I'm a 28 year old male and I've had enough. I belong to an extremely overbearing/narcissistic family who constantly give me advice on how to do literally everything. If I decline their generous offer, I'm told they know what is best for me and I'll only realise this when they're dead and gone. For most of my miserable life I've dealt with this by going down the path of least resistance and going along with whatever has been asked of me. 

Six months or so ago I was happy - I lived in a different country, far, far away. I worked a very well paid healthcare job and although it was brutal I'd internally be ecstatic as I didn't *have* to communicate with them anymore. I'd talk to them on my terms and if they pissed me off, I had an off switch. Unfortunately, I was emotionally blackmailed into giving in once again and looking for a job where they are located even though there was no reason whatsoever to do this. Common things I was told were ""you don't care about us, you wouldn't care if we died"", ""what have we done to deserve this"", ""you'll find a much better job here"" etc. 

Since then, my life has been a literal hell and every time I even hint at wanting to move back I'm met with extreme amounts of resistance. They also nudge me into doing things I don't want to do like meeting up with some dickhead they know who can give me ""career advice"" or help me find a new job. I've just had enough of getting unsolicited advice and I want out.

17,"My best friend since high school is about to quit his part time job to pursue a career in insurance sales through Primerica, a multi level marketing agency. His whole family is into it, especially his parents, and are extremely christian/conservative, which I think explains why they got into it since a lot of these agencies are rooted in both of those beliefs.

Anyway, I've been trying to convince him to go to school with me for a while, or at least get into trades. I can't even convince him to take a theology/history class with me. I really think he's making the wrong move by doing this, and I spend a lot of time worrying about it. I can tell he's dissatisfied with what he's gotten out of just putting in 40 hour weeks, but now he wants to go further because he thinks he isn't trying hard enough.

I really don't know what to do, I fear that bringing it up again will cause a rift in our friendship. Primerica is big on denouncing people who ""don't want you to succeed"", so I'm afraid I'll lose him. He really is a good guy, one of the most supportive and caring individuals I know of, but he's just so naive when it comes to this.

20,"So I went and got hitched and everything is going great. We bought a house together. We are financially stable. We are trying to have children. The major issue I am having is before all this happened my wife and her brother were living together to keep bills low so they could both save money. When proposed with the idea of her brother moving into our new house I was all for it because A) I am not a dick, B) He needed a place to stay and he was now family and C) His living with me and my wife was supposed to be temporary until we got pregnant or 6 months. It has been over a year and my wife and I are having issues conceiving; so he sees this as not going anywhere anytime soon cause the rent is cheap.

Now, you may be thinking, ""Is it really that bad having your brother living with you?"" Try it sometime. First of all he is very unpleasant to be around. He has the mentality that he is smarter than everyone else in the room and he is always right. You cannot have a simple conversation with him. 

He is also a slob. Just gross. Almost to the level of hoarding. One of those types that keeps finding new places to stick cups, plates, cutlery, and bags of fast food. He bought a large area rug for his room knowing he would ruin the floor. 

My garage has been almost completely taken over by his shit, crap, and junk. He does not throw things away cause he may use them years down the road. A miser savant. He has his own storage unit which is full to the brim and refuses to get another when there is a perfectly good two car garage for him to store his stuff. His collection has even swelled to the kitchen and the living room. I started moving his stuff out of the garage and in front of his bedroom door with instructions of, ""It goes anywhere but back in the garage"", to which he has just left it in place and filled up the void in the garage with more crap. Kayaks (yes plural, more than one), fishing equipment, camping equipment, parts for his motorcycle, random hand me downs from the previous house he lived in that he may one day use. Its ridiculous.

Now for my darling wife. Long story short she is protective of him. He and her are twins so they are closer than normal siblings. As I said before he isnt the most pleasant person to be around and she knows this. If it werent for her, his social life would be very limited. She knows this and is hesitant to bring up the prospect of moving out cause he might get lonely. She has gotten accustomed to his living habits and will take his side cause, "" That is just how he is."" We get in arguments about this almost every week and his condition hasnt improved it has gotten worse. He is 29 years old. He has a good job. He has enough money saved he could almost buy a house flat out. He is not destitute at all. Full disclosure: My wife borrowed money from him (at his behest) to buy a car and she owes him $7K. His room is $300 a month and we just subtract that from the amount owed. 

I feel like I am asking my wife to choose between me or him and she might just pick him. She has one uncle who lives close who sides with me saying we are not pushing him out, we are moving him forward. Is there any legal proceedings I can do (I live in North Carolina)? Can I get this man-child out of my house without my wife hating herself? I just need an outside opinion. Thanks in advance to anyone still reading.

Since I have known my husband, 7+ years, I have seen him cry two times, both of those were due to a terrible fights he had with his mother and she said what I feel are unforgivable things, over and over to him. My husband has grown somewhat accustomed to her behavior and doesn't see it as a ""let's address this head-on"" issue. My FIL also is aware of her behavior and has told me that ""it's easier to just let it go.""

To be more specific, his mom lashes out when she is angry to the point of what I can only describe as a sobbing uncontrollable rage. I have seen her slam doors in my husband face, hit him, and say that he is no longer her son.  She will scream and make the same argument over and over, never listening to anyone, as well as bring up things from years ago.
After her episodes are over, she either claims it's a cultural difference or dismisses her behavior saying that she ""just gets angry sometimes and says things but they don't really matter.""
My husband is an only child and has always done what he can to please her. We both agree that cutting her out is not the most mature or best solution. We have a child and another on the way. She is absolutely in love with our son and they get along perfectly. Other than these outbursts, she seems to be a loving and caring person.
Recently, she had one of these outbursts while my 14 month old son was with us. I told my husband that if she has another episode when our son is any older, we will be leaving immediately and not sticking around to ""figure out what's wrong"" or make sure she feels okay before we go.

To clarify, she has a very serious outburst once or twice a year, other than that it's just walking on eggshells around her because you don't know if something will make her mad to where she won't speak to you for several days/weeks.

45,"First time being on the opposite end of this subreddit in a while but I feel it's necessary. 

I have a friend of mine, great guy, best friend I could hope for, but every once in a while he does shit that kinda puts me on edge. 

For example, he's been interested in the Nintendo Switch. Right now, there's a post on TIL about how the past CEO of Nintendo docked his own pay when the Wii U failed to meet expectations. I sent him the link and told him the amount of respect I'd have for the guy if the story was true and how Nintendo seemed more and more like a great company. Wrote a couple of paragraphs of text. His response? 

""K"". 

It seems small but it's becoming more and more constant. Earlier I was playing Overwatch with him online. We communicated through text. I lost miserably the first match. The second match I won, told him I felt I redeemed myself a tad bit. His response? 

""Cool.""

Even down to his behavior in video games, he worries me. Every time he killed me he'd just sit there unloading the gun even though I was dead. He doesn't play for shits and giggles, he plays because he thinks he's proving a point. 

He references depression quite a bit, though he's never been completely open about it. I go through it as well, the difference is that I'm in therapy and I'm nowhere near as negative as him. There's days where we get on and talk through headsets and he seems like he'd rather die than be talking to me, yet he gets on anyways. I feel like I've gotta straight up tell him that he doesn't have to play if he doesn't want to but he forces himself to pretend he's lenient. 

Idk. I don't want to cut him out of my life because he's a great guy, practically a brother, but he's starting to worry me and I don't know what to do.

Edit: More ranting because I can't get this out of my head. It makes me wonder if I'm doing something to piss him off and he's just trying to passive aggressively take it out on me, but I can't tell. I don't talk to a lot of his other friends, but I've heard the way he talks about his other friends, and boy does he talk some shit. He gossips right behind their backs to me. I can easily see how extraordinarily unfairly judgmental he can get. Anyone who doesn't align with his methods of thinking, he seems to cut out of his life. Anyone who did the slightest thing he doesn't agree with he gossips to me, I try not to show interest as to not encourage his behavior but eventually I'm going to need to actually call him out. Whenever he's met with an everyday friendly challenge, he takes it far too seriously. Not just, ""I need to win."" More like, ""I need to win because this person is a fuckface and how dare he challenge me.""",20Jun2017,5

48,"Greetings to anyone who happens to stumble upon this.


I've been desperately searching for advice on my situation for the past couple of months when I stumbled upon this subreddit. I'm aware that my problems wont be solved by simply getting advice from strangers on the internet, but it'll at least keep me occupied until I can get an appointment with a therapist. So for anyone reading this and willing to share their thoughts about my current predicament, I'll get straight to the point.


So as you most likely noticed from the title of this post, I am 14 years old, and seriously questioning whether I am depressed or have some kind of social disorder. For the past 8 months now (approximately), I have been in some kind of a funk. Here are some of the things I've been feeling these past months: 


  - A  sense of numbness towards everything and everyone around me. The only emotions I ever really feel are anger and sadness.

  - A huge lack of motivation to do anything school related AND the things that I'm passionate about. It's even come to the point where I'm not even motivated to physically move my body in any way.

  - A constant state of exhaustion. Doesn't matter how much sleep I get or how much I do during the day, I constantly feel tired. I always want to sleep or just do nothing, and I usually tend to oversleep on the weekends to the point where there is very little time left to the day.

  - Bouts of crying or anger triggered by nothing in particular. It's been three times this month that I've cried for no reason other than intense negative feelings washing over me at random.

  - Extreme mood swings. Extreme meaning that even a single word could bring me into a state of rage, severe depression, or sometimes even something akin to happiness. Even the mere presence of a certain person could make my mood and personality do a complete 180. This most likely also has to do with the emotional instability that comes with being a teenager, but I'm honestly not sure if what I've been feeling is considered the norm at my age.

  - A hatred of people and socialization in general. I used to be a very outgoing child but as the years went by I've regressed further and further into my own shell. Nowadays, I have no interest in socializing at all and would much prefer o be left alone to let my thoughts wander, listen to music and draw or read a book. But of course, I'm surrounded by people who make it a point to be as loud and obnoxious as possible at all times. Not to mention that people always come and talk to me about their problems and mundane garbage like social media because apparently I'm easy to talk to. I honestly want to tell 99.9% of the people who come up to me to piss off, but I don't want to hurt their feelings because most of these people are my ""friends"". Then again, I've always devalued myself and put others needs before mine.

  - Occasional suicidal feelings, but mostly just the desire to hurt myself. I've often thought of cutting myself but was always too afraid to actually do it. Recently, I've been picking and clawing at my skin hoping to draw blood (and failing) and I've unsuccessfully tried to cut myself with a broken ruler.


... And that's basically many, if not all, of the feelings I've been experiencing these past few months. I'm honestly convinced that I have some form of depression or anxiety but I'd like some insight from an outsider's point of view. So if any of you would like to share your thoughts, I would greatly appreciate it.


I apologize again for the long, kind of all-over-the-place post. And a big thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this.

i am a 17F and recently stood up to my dad after all these years, which led him to continue to harass my mom and my family every single day. he gets into our computers, tracks IP address to see where we are at, goes up to my old school (doesn't know where we live or what school I go to, since we moved to get away from him.). 

since I told him off and am trying to never see him again, (have to go with him on his visitations til i'm 18 apparently, even tho he has been drinking and driving with me, abusing me, etc for 10 years), my mom and i filed a court thing and we went to court, but the judge didn't want to hear any of it. i still had to go with him. 

i kept running away when i had to go since it is an extremely bad situation. he upped his game and found out my mom divorced my step dad, and where we live now and where i go to school. 

court is this friday. i feel like we have a good case and he knows it.

my mom is a single mom of 3 kids who works her ass off and makes 15K or less a year. 

he has a PhD in lord knows what and makes upwards of 85K/year.

tonight at about 10 PM there were 3 cars circling our neighborhood, parking in front and by my house. 

they got out and had what looked like a gun. they had a map/paper looking thing definitely, and a flashlight. they pointed the flashlight at the paper, then at my house and started motioning directions, and pretty soon i heard voices out of my window.

i don't know what to do and i am pretty sure hitman are more discreet than that. i guess i am looking for advice on anything at this point. i'm so confused and scared.

tl;dr- my dad is crazy and i feel like he hired someone to hurt my family

53,"In French class a guy, who I have many other classes with, sits in front of me. I've never talked to this guy. Recently, in class when I was on my phone and not paying attention to my surroundings he took a selfie of himself with me in it. It was clear that he was trying to take a picture with me because he took it at a weird angle and cut off some of his face so I would be in the picture. Many of my friends also thought the same. I feel like he took the picture to make fun of me for being strange/weird (which I'm not, I and many others would consider myself really average and casual) or that I'm an inside joke. I feel like it's bullying? Could I be wrong? What should I do?",20Jun2017,3
55,"There was this girl at work who went to the park with these older guy coworkers and when she went with the she got taken advantage of and I was just kind of happened to be there for her when she needed someone to talk to so I became her emotional tampon basically and she would call me like 7 times a day and was constantly texting me asking if I could talk or asking me what I was doing or if I could go see her. Eventually after about 2 weeks she confessed to me that she wanted to date me and I was kind of backed into a corner so I had no choice but to show my cards and tell her I didn't feel the same. (This was after I already asked another girl out by the way) So afterwards I felt like a douchey turd but she insisted that she understood more than I thought she did and that she wasn't upset with me. Today (two weeks later) I attempted to do damage control explaining that I've been going through a lot of anxiety and whatnot but if she still needed someone to talk to she didn't have to feel like we weren't friends anymore (might've been a mistake) because she just called me asking if I could hang out with her and these 2 other girls on Thursday insisting that she had something to ""show me"". Considering her character (she's kind of crazy to be honest) I feel slightly afraid and she said she was super excited but she couldn't tell me what she wanted to show me because she wanted it to be a surprise to her friends and I but she said there wouldn't be any other boys there and something about this whole situation sounds kind of sketchy considering hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn.

What should I do?

TL;DR: This girl who I rejected just reached out to me asking me if wanted to hang out with just her and her friends because she has something she ""wants to show me"". ",20Jun2017,3

58,"I was asked to do a big favor by my boyfriend’s mother. She asked if I could fax her papers which will withdraw $7000 from her retirement but she will also get a 20% penalty because she does not have the age for retirement yet. She will only get $5000 and throw away $2000. She wanted me to do it in secret because she doesn’t want to upset her husband and my boyfriend about throwing away $2000. She said she needed the money because her family was coming to visit. I said I would do it without thinking it through because I wanted to help.  She gives me money for the fax and paper. But then I realize it was a big deal what I was doing. I didn’t want her to throw away $2000 and I didn’t want to get in trouble with my boyfriend nor her husband. I then decided to ask if she wanted to borrow the money and pay me back later instead. She says yes. I tell my boyfriend because I don’t want to upset him about letting his mom borrow some money. He says I can’t afford to let her borrow since I am just a student and I only have loans. Boyfriend would not let her borrow money, because she still owes him money and he thinks she spends money irresponsibly.  I don’t know what to do now. ",20Jun2017,2
60,"I've been working for this company for the last year and it's a pretty laid back place to work. The work is not too challenging, I feel I'm succeeding and others have taken notice at the quality of my work. I get along with mostly everyone I come into contact with except one fellow.

One coworker just manages to get under my skin. We are both staffed onto the same project/client and report to the same manager. He never pulls his weight and is always pushing back on the business team who make change requests for our team. Basically he makes the QA, business team, and clients lives hell by pushing back on every single item no matter the level of difficulty.

I usually don't care much that he doesn't pull his weight as if I do, it will just create unnecessary tension and drama. I am passionate though about making the clients satisfied as well as working with other departments in a civil manner so he does deep down frustrate me in this aspect.

But what finally put me over the edge was today he had the nerve to act as my manager when we are in the same position. He asked me for an update on a tool I'm working on even though I interact with the business team who has requested this tool every second of the day and it's on target.

I told him off basically saying he's not my manager and I don't believe he has the authority to make such an inquiry in clear writing. I then stated that it is on target and if there is an issue, our manager will come to me or a representative on the business team who I communicate with frequently.

I'm wondering if I over reacted and what advice you folks can offer for dealing with such a menace of an employee. Basically he doesn't do any work, yet he feels he should be in a position of power due to his tenure. A lot of people have complained about him, yet he's stuck around for years. Even though no one respects him or really likes him (and it is evident).

tl:dr employee pisses me off by not working and trying to be a manager, what advice can you give?",20Jun2017,3
62,"Hi! My boyfriend is currently in India with his family. Long story short, his family and my family did not approve of our relationships for the longest time. I'm Filipino, so my culture was strict too. Anyways, our parents finally came to terms that we weren't gonna break up. Back in April, my boyfriend went to India because some of his family were there to apologize to them for causing such a mess with our relationship.

63,"I'm 20 years old and I've never had a job. I started looking about two years ago, went into two interviews and never got call backs. I've never been good at handling rejection and it disheartened me quite a bit, enough for me to stop trying. I feel especially bad about myself when kids who are 5 years younger have worked two to three jobs already. But i think it's time i stopped crying about it and actually getting on my feet to find myself work. 

Needless to say, i don't have a resume that actually has anything on it. I've worked at a few volunteer places but they're nothing spectacular. The few people I've spoken to said they made up a few jobs as most people are wary of inexperienced workers. The two interviews i went to, I made it clear that I've never worked before, and i feel like that might have been why they never called me back. Or maybe I just didn't seem like i had 'it.' 

I'd really love it if i could get some advice on how to find myself a job, tackling the very basics - resume, interview and any other tips that i could use.

68,"So I've been beating around the bush about posting this somewhere. But honestly I'm fairly lost now and am in pretty desperate need for some advice. I'll try to keep it brief as possible.

So 2 years ago, I was a year out of highschool and things were going great, I had a large group of friends, a first job that payed shit but it was a job, so hey, was talking to a pretty amazing girl and things were going great there, and I was exploring myself and my interests at a local community college. To put it short, my life was going great. 

It didn't last however as I managed to break both of my feet(The fifth metatarsal), and to keep away from the gritty details, I essentially could not walk for an entire year. It needed surgery and as a relatively active person prior to my injury I soon found myself quite depressed over my situation. I had to drop college temporarily and quit my job. To add on top of that the vast majority of my friends completely abandoned me during this time, several directly telling me it was because I couldn't walk. To keep things simple I soon slowly began to recede into myself. I didn't talk to many people, gained some weight and slowly became hopeless during that year. Needless to say it was by far the worst year of my life.

It's been a year since I've started walking however, and while objectively I know I've made some great strides forward(Have more direction in college and have lost a fair amount of the weight gained), I still find myself lost, lonely and filled with regrets. I never was able to tell that girl how I felt about her for one(I denied my feelings to her friend who asked me with the intent to tell her myself but refrained as I saw my post injury self as not a good time to start anything), and now she's seeing someone else, so that's a no go. On top of that I miss a lot of my old friends, but few really were accepting of me coming back, ridiculing me for everything from my injury weight gain to me dropping out. I know deep down they're not real friends and I'm better off without them but it sucks to really feel that. A lot of them I've known for years and I seriously thought they had my back and I their's. On top of it all as well, I feel so far behind everyone else around me. Most of the friends I still am in touch with are talking about graduating soon and stuff like that and here I am still trying to get my AA and transfer and essentially get my life back on track. It's quite demoralizing.

So with those two out the window I threw myself into my studies and did everything possible socially to make new friends and rebuild my practically nonexistent social skills from a year's worth of social isolation. For a while I was literally doing *something* every day, and needless to say it became exhausting, which  brings us to today. I feel pretty much burnt out. I haven't made as many friends as I'd like to have, still have to finish out my quarter and have work obligations and it's just far too much now. I clearly shouldn't have thrown myself at my goals the way I did and now I really don't know what to do to get myself back up and happy again. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Broke both my feet, couldn't walk for a year, now am facing the regrets from my previous life, and emotionally and physically exhausted every day and don't know where to go from here.",20Jun2017,1
72,"I'm subletting an apartment for the summer for an internship, and had signed the lease with the understanding that it would be a fully furnished apartment w laundry/stove/electricity/water etc etc. I got here and it turns out the stove and oven are broken, meaning I have no way of cooking. Since I'm on a really tight college student budget and had been planning on doing a lot of cheap meal prep, this really fudges with my entire plan. The person I'm subletting from has been really nice with trying to help and calling the landlord to fix it, but it's still broken and my wallet/stomach are suffering from take out and/or cheap instant ramen. I can eat cereal, instant oatmeal, instant noodles, sandwiches, but since there's also no microwave it's hard to even heat leftovers.

I asked the guy how Burger King was going and my bullshit detector went nuts. He was obviously giving me a line of crap.

The rent is weekly and he has gone like 6 or 7 weeks without paying anything. The only week he has paid for was the first week which his scumbag boyfriend paid for (who has already been kicked out for getting violent with another roommate). 

When his boyfriend got kicked out, I told him if he needs extra time to get on his feet he can go into debt and pay me when he has money. 

6 weeks is an absurd amount of time to take to pay me. Lying about shit doesn't fly with me.

86,"So I grew up very sheltered from the rest of the world.  I have never been to public school, only a small private school with 50ish kids.  They were fairly unprofessional and their curriculum was pretty bad, but I had nothing to compare it to so I just assumed it was the standard.  I went to that school up until 8th grade and then quit.  My parents straight up refused to let me go to the local high school and I didn't know what else to do so I just kind of gave up on it because I felt overwhelmed.

I proceeded to spend the next 1-2 years doing literally nothing.  I woke up, played video games and then went to sleep.  12+ hours a day.  I hated myself.

Fast forward to now.  My parents tell me continually that education doesn't matter and that I don't need it to be successful.  My friends tell me basically the exact opposite. I just have no idea who to listen to, I trust my family and my friends so I just feel lost.  I feel like if I make the wrong choice, I'll screw myself.

Context:

Recent college grad in NYC with friend from school

Things I like about *roommate*:
 
 * Shares stuff a lot; very giving
 * Handy
 * Good cook
 * Resourceful 
 * Has people over without telling me (pro and con by mood)
 * Hard working
 * Can be fun in super small doses
 * Motivated by something (Not sure if good motivation or bad)
 * Brought a lot of cool useful furniture like speakers and TV 
 * Good perspective on problems
 * On top of bills, venmo split
 * Occasional good serious conversation
 * Cheaper to live in NYC (studio prices are crazzzy)

Things I dislike:
 
 * Selfish (personality)
 * *roommate* comes up to me one day, drops out of the blue that he wants to not live with me again, recruits 4 other mutual friends for giant apt that I'm not allowed in, I guess? 
 * Keeps trying to swoop in on girls I like (very petty of me; I'll get over it)
 * Juicer, dirty dishes
 * Generally screws me over (will flake on plans, generally tries to avoid me as well)
 * Too impulsive 
 * Leaves shit everywhere
 * Can't trust him or talk to him
 * He's like one of those teddy bears with three canned phrases. Just says old memes a lot 
 * “I'm the type of person who...” [general ""I"" talk when we have conversation, see 'selfish personality' above]
 * Begs for attention like a puppy
 * I honestly think I'd rather have a pet as a roommate
 * Tries way too hard to please people (says yes all the time) while also blowing them off at the same time it's actually kinda magical
 * Blew off my birthday to hang out at a bar or some shit
 
Should I continue to be his friend?

Pros:
 
 * Likes to party too and stay out really late on weekends, good to have a club friend
 * Has many mutual friends
 * Will most likely bother me so I won't have to reach out to him after we don't live together
 * Life is too short to cut friends
 * Pretty petty on my part
 * I'm pretty shit at making new friends

Cons:
 
 * Kinda listed above
 * No fun at music festival when we went alone together
 * Only hangs out with *some friend that I'm not close with*, then he tries to steal *my best friend* from me wtf hang out with your own friends
 * I have a list id rather hang out with
    **Came up with 20 or so; genuinely close with 3 or 4**
 * He's only a fair-weather friend, unreliable to talk to
 
Conclusion:
Outside of me needing to grow the fuck up, be less petty and pay my own bills on time, I think it's a good thing that I won't live with *roommate*. Knew it since sophomore year of college our personalities clash too much and he makes me physically retreat. 

There is also the point to my social anxiety, but I honestly believe *roommate* makes it worse. I'm good in groups and one on one with people I trust and the sad truth is I don't trust *roommate*. I'm really uncomfortable around many people as is, should I try to live alone or find a roommate who gets that I'm really awkward (is that selfish? Am I taking advantage?)

He was rushed to the hospital last June 14,2017, by his supervisor (he was a hotel maintenance guy/driver) when he passed out at work (we found out later that it was a cardiac arrest).
He had zero vital signs when he arrived at the ER, pants drenched in urine and it took ~20 minutes to successfully resuscitate him.
He regained consciousness and recognized family members and even our dogs' names. He can respond to basic questions.
The next morning, he suffered another cardiac arrest, severe pulmonary edema in both lungs, and a non-functional set of kidneys. The doctors recommended hemodialysis by 1pm, so we set him up for it. By the 3rd hour of the 4-hr dialysis session, his heart stopped again. Another 20 minutes, he was brought back. He never regained consciousness that night. At 12 midnight of June 17, we were brought in the ICU because of his worsening state. Doctors attempted CPR and defibrillations for 40 minutes to no avail. He died at 12:40 AM.

97,"It hurts a lot. It started hitting me last year. I suddenly became vividly aware of death. Of how prevalent it is. Of how spontaneous or excruciatingly drawn out it can be. 

How those who dream of the future with bright smiles and gleaming eyes can suddenly be shunted off this Earth.

Then it extended to every tragedy. Loss of sight. Loss of hearing. Loss of a loved one. Loss of limb. Loss of independence. Suicide.

Cancer, strokes, locked in syndrome.

Disassociative Identity Disorder, psychosis, Alzheimer's, ALS.

Complete mental breakdowns.

At the moment I'm in a relationship with someone I want to be with for as long as I possibly can- they're already so far out of my league as it is, however at the start of our relationship they said they aren't interested in bald men at all and I know exactly what their type is so I know if I were to go bald they would no longer find me physically attractive and I know myself I wouldn't be physically attractive as I have a young face with this god awful hairline. I therefore feel like the days of my relationship are numbered until I eventually go bald/hairline gets so bad its all you can see whether that be months/years from now and its making it so much harder. 

I know this is super vain but I'd really like some advice from other guys that have found themselves in a similar situation. How do I cope with this? ",20Jun2017,1
105,"Okay we have very different work patterns and i've been trying to improve my fitness levels by going to the gym so its starting to get hard to spend more time with her. My current schedule is get up a 7am eat breakfast spend about an hour and a half in the gym start work at 10pm then finish at 5pm.

My girlfriend starts work at 2pm and finishes at 10pm so i usually stay up to see her untill about 2am but now my body is feeling the effects of lack of sleep but if i go to sleep earlier then i feel like i never see her and i'm neglecting her.

109,"So I work in a restaurant that staffs females, ""breastraunt"" style like twin peaks or Hooters. It's a brand new concept, and I was hired 3 days prior to its grand opening by the GM to alleviate the work load of himself, and the AGM, despite the owners wife disagreeing with doing so. (She didn't think they needed another manager). 

The GM and AGM were the only two managers out of 5 that have ever ran a restaurant, or EVEN I. The least WORKED in one. The owners wife, shall we call ""DeeDee"" and her best friend ""Jane"" are both salaried, as well as her daughter ""bertha"", who has a restaurant management degree bull crap, but no experience. 

Deedee has been rude, disrespectful, and lacks communication with everyone, but she refuses to speak to me since day 1. I didn't make a bad impression on anyone else, and everyone says that's just the way she is...well the other day I told her good morning and she abruptly and rudely says ""morning."" So I ask ""not having a good morning I take it?"" And she replies,

""Well, I have to deal with you today so there's that"" and walks off. 

I was livid, wrote this resignation letter to the owner (husband) as a way to deal with all my emotions. And my GM told me to go home and walk it off. He totally understood me wanting to quit, and said that my resignation rant was the most well written and concise letter he had ever seen, and that I should send. I didn't because I felt it lengthy and inappropriate. I had just wrote it as a coping mechanism for my frustration and anxiety. 

He convinced me to stay. Bit this is what she has done:
-stripped me of all responsibility (writing the server, host, bar schedules and doing them herself, training, shift meeting before open, uniforms, money handling, server checkouts, camera and safe access, no authority over staff.
-allows her family members who work there to disrespect me, insubordination isn't in her vocabulary.
-starts rumours about me and listens to all the employees complaints about things like the schedule (every manager should know all servers and bar staff complain about schedules to some degree).

Now that the schedule for the week was posted after the start of the week and we didn't have Monday morning servers, she is making a server finish and do them from now on instead of admitting she d idnt know how to do them. She won't speak, talk, or acknowledge me. And the General Manager is begging me to stick through it all. But I can't stand it. 

If it was regarding work ethic, skills, criticism in relation to my JOB, I'd understand and ask her to be more communicative towards it all. Bit it's not, the GM said she's trying to fire me, and he doesn't even know why. Should I just peacefully walk away and find somewhere else, or try to communicate with her and resolve? Help!

116,"Hi! 

I found you guys on google and I think I'm following the rules, please let me know if I break one. Could use some words of advice.

So.......I'm a twenty-one year old girl. I've spent my entire life living in one place, and I've barely ever left except for a couple family trips to Vegas on the (US) mainland.

I never had much of a problem with that growing up. My whole family is here, and there is enough to do here that I never felt like I was missing out on anything or whatever. I always felt like we had everything we needed.

*But.....*

Shortly after graduating high school I started dating a boy. I'll call him Charlie. Charlie isn't from here, he's from the mainland (but don't let that fool you, he's actually a good guy, lol). I love Charlie, I really, really do. These past three years I've been with him have been the happiest time in my life, and my family, somewhat to their own annoyance, really like Charlie as well.

But, we knew from the beginning, Charlie wasn't going to stay here forever. He was here for his job, and now our time is up. I kinda felt like I was falling (back) into depression as his time to leave approaches. 

But, Charlie made me an offer. I can go with him. He's moving to a big-city on the mainland and offered to let me join him, get an apartment together, and start a new life.

There was a time that I wouldn't even have considered leaving. But now.....I don't know. Listening to him talk about all the places he has lived, and he has lived in a lot of places, as well as the places he wants to go.....I think he activated some latent wanderlust in me. I want to *go* places. I want to ride a train in Europe. I want to walk around NYC gawking at the skyscrapers like a dummy. 

The last couple years are the first time I ever thought that I am actually unsatisfied with spending my life where I am.


And all that aside......I would get to stay with Charlie. Live with him, like couples do, and he really is what pulled me out of a depression I used to be in.


But the other side of the coin is, my whole family is here. If I leave, it wouldn't be easy for me to get back, and visits would be few and far between. I've never been more than 45 minutes' drive from my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins.......

And what if I go rushing off into the world and just get completely in over my head? And, I don't know, what if this really *is* the best place for me? What if I really do belong here?

My family has told me it is my choice to make, but they would miss me terribly if I left, and most of them have the attitude that I'm already in the best place in the world, so they don't understand my desire to leave. 


What should I do? Adventure and romance? Or safety and familiarity?

118,"I have great programming skills with a few minor projects under my belt, and I'm rapidly improving and creating more. I have attended a University notorious for being difficult for 3 years, and have racked up a small debt. Unfortunately, I was not accepted into my program of choice due to grades (computer science, average is ~60 and requirement is 85+ that goes up every year), so I am left with a load of credits, only some of which can be transferred to other Universities. The worst part is that even if I get into the program at another University, I have to spend another 2+ years re-doing similar courses I had no interest in completing the first time around.

To take make matters worse for my motivation, my best friend (who previously had little to no skill in programming), took a 2-month bootcamp-like program in fullstack web development and landed a job paying 50k+ within 2 weeks of graduation. I considered this program as well, but the cost is 10k, I have no money to pay for it, and the government only gives out loans to those who attend official institutions.

I have absolutely no desire to continue attending University at all. Every semester I end up stressed, fall into mild depression and end up getting poor grades because I absolutely hate spending all of my time learning courses I will never use in the field just to score low on the exam, end up with a shit grade and forget everything the moment I leave the exam room. It is extremely demoralising.

My father says he is willing to financially assist me only in the case that I continue with full-time studies. He is rarely supportive of my decisions and usually dismisses my ideas, citing my deadbeat cousins as examples of those who don't get degrees and fail at life. I love my dad but his strategy in raising me since 12 pisses me off big time.

I want to drop out of University and spend my free time building up a good portfolio by making interesting projects, expanding my network and trying to find a job I enjoy doing. I don't necessarily want any specific job, as long as I enjoy the job, can provide for myself and save a little. I have no plans to have a family in the future. I'm also willing to switch professions, work different jobs and live in different places. Even though I enjoy programming, I want to experience the many things life has to offer, not just sit in a cubicle and hope for a raise. I currently work part-time remotely, which allows me work from home and from anywhere in the world, but it doesn't pay enough to make a living.

What options should I consider in my situation?",20Jun2017,2
119,"I used to have a Spanish online friend. I had been talking to him for two years. In the past, I've always wanted to learn new languages, and I decided to start with Spanish since I talked to him everyday and it was hence convenient for me to practice my Spanish.

He started acting in a strange manner ever since the question to whether we should meet irl arose (Details: He said he wanted to bring his brother to our meeting as he doesn't know the biggest city in his province well enough to go there himself (his brother had to show him the way to the exam centre for his recent public exams). Also, we only had two video Skype calls in the past. He said he got a new phone at the start of this year and that his previous phones did not allow Skype to be installed. He said his parents separated and he lives with his dad, and his dad's laptop's webcam does not work so he could only skype at his mom's home. His Facebook only had a girl added there. I asked him who she is and he said she's a girl he met online.) After all this, I still kept on talking to me. He only stopped replying and checking my messages the day I left his province.

I guess I have been catfished all along. However, I still think of meeting him as a ""positive"" thing as he introduced me to a new culture and language. If I have never met him, I would have never picked Spanish to study and I would have never got to know so much about Spanish/Latin American culture. I realised that there are many positive aspects about Spanish and Latin American culture that I didn't know about in the past.",20Jun2017,1

126,"My husband and I have been together for 5 years, married for 3. He is first generation Chinese while I am white. 
We were raised very differently. I am one of 7 and my parents were very loving, affectionate, and kind. His family is small and his parents were nothing like mine. They aren't awful, you just can't feel the love like you can with mine. They own a Chinese food restaurant and he grew up having to work there everyday. He wasn't allowed to hang out with friends or anything. 
When he went to college, he joined a fraternity and finally gained a good group of friends. He's extremely introverted whereas I have never met a stranger. 
Now to the issue. He is so negative. He always sees the bad in everything. This gets very frustrating because I am very Pollyanna and always see the good. Friends point this out about me. 
Along with being negative he also has a short temper. On Sunday I painted our bathroom. I didn't ask for his help and that was fine. But then he complained about the way I painted it. Yesterday I got the stuff together to do the second coat. A bit of the watered down paint from the brush was on the counter. He was ""so mad"". I told him I would take care of it. But then he was in a bad mood for the rest of the night. 
He was still in a bad mood this morning. We were talking about the algae in our fish tank. He said we should lift the light off the glass a bit. I said it was because it got too much sun. ""Fine, whatever. Do what you want. It doesn't matter. I'm done."". Then I suggested we use some leftover wood and try his way. ""you don't care. I'm done."". He says that phrase A LOT. 
His family never talked things through and he does NOT like to take responsibility. When we talk later on he knows he was wrong but it never changes. 
I'm tired of walking on eggshells. We want to start a family, but I don't want my kids to be like him.

131,Ok so at the moment I'm 22 and dying to move out but there's no way my mom can support herself at her current job. I make twice as much as her therefore I'm paying most of the bills which is no problem for me. The main reason I work is primarily so I can help her but also to save up for a place of my own. Since May of last year I've been saving for an apartment and in a few months I had what I needed. At that time my mother had a full time job that paid decently. Unfortunately in late August our apartment was broken into and all of my electronics were stolen. So with the money I saved up I used to buy a new laptop and a security system. I started saving money again but in early December my mom lost her job so that's when I started paying all the bills. Again it was no problem because that's why I work. The problem is well my mom is kind of emotionaly abusive. That entire time I paid for everything and even worked extra days to make ends meet. I also work at night so I need a good amount of sleep during the day but that didn't stop her from yelling at me about 3 dirty cups in the sink at 10am. All the times she's yelled at me she basically said I was useless even though I paid for literally everything. In March she got a job where I work during the day because I talked to one of the managers and she's still working there now but as part time. She still says things that make me feel pathetic like how I don't do anything and I'm just so tired of it. This isn't anything new either it's been my whole life but it seems like it's gotten worse once I was able to help out. Now I just really need to move but since she can't support herself I'm kinda stuck here. She's in her early 50s and doesn't have the best health so she really can't just get any job. I love my mom no matter what she's put me through but I don't know how much of her I can take anymore. I can't just spontaneously leave. I don't think I could live with myself if I did that.

136,"As a preliminary note: this is my first time renting an apartment.

I'm recently moving and put my notice to leave in. My landlord has started doing viewings for my apartment, and she's managed to cram at least one viewing in every day this week, including 2 on Saturday morning.

I feel anxious about the amount of viewings during the week, but I can understand when they're during my work hours. I stay at home during the weekend, and I feel that she doesn't need to doing viewings during the weekend since she already has 7 viewings during the week (not including the weekend viewings). A few viewings are even already after work hours that I'm trying to accommodate for.

I am worried that she will continue to try to push as many viewings as she possibly can, intruding into my privacy and personal time at home.

I also have some concerns over security of my possessions, but I do have tenant insurance. Obviously I still would rather not make a claim.

I was wondering if there's any advice you have on this? She has seemed fairly reasonable about other issues before, but she also seems to be one to try to take advantage of a situation.

I even know one guy here who's a crazy nigger and he always mumbles weird word salad shit no one can understand and he just randomly talks about killing people and angrily freaks out for no reason yet people fucking love him. Like they all hang out with him and let him come over and they're all nice to him on social media and shit. Whenever I try to hang out with someone they just ignore me but everyone is just like ""oh just text people and ask to come over they won't be mad"" but I just get completely ignored like I can't get invited to shit unless I have money for drugs or something but then I just feel unwelcome and if I don't have money or something then they don't even want me around. 

People usually act nice to my face and stuff but then they hate me the next day after I leave and stuff. It's like there's a demon or energy in the world or something just telling everyone to hate me after I leave. I mean I'm mildly autistic but I'm not really mean or anything I'm actually way more nice than other people and go out of my way to help people even though they treat me like shit but all I get is ignored and insulted whenever I leave the house. 

I've literally never had one friend. I'm 25 and I hate every single person I've ever met. How can this be possible? How people literally all just hate me for no reason. People act like I'm a faggot pedophile rapist or something but I don't really do anything bad and I'm nice but people just hate me. I thought being nice made you have you had friends? If being nice doesn't make friends what does? ",20Jun2017,0
152,"(Throwaway account)

Ever since I moved out of my parents' house about 2 years ago, I don't feel like I've really gotten this whole adulthood thing down. Now I wasn't expecting myself to be the shining example of an adult but definitely not this.

I live alone in an apartment building, but we share certain things (garbage, recycling, washing machine). Today I was told that I wasn't breaking down boxes properly for recycling, and this is true. However, I did this anyway even though I knew it was not the right way to do it. This is among a few other problems that I had but this one stood out since it just happened.

My apartment is just a mess. My mother is coming over tomorrow and it just looks awful. As in, ""how can anyone live here"" awful. I'm definitely going to clean my room up but I know I could be doing so much better.

In a way, my brain feels like it's still in university when it really shouldn't feel that way anymore. Oh, I can fix it later, oh, it's not that important, etc. When in reality, it is important! I don't know what's keeping me from growing up. What should I do? ",20Jun2017,1

I came to that sub pretty depressed hoping to find some positive stories and indeed i found some guys who had success in relationships regardless of their height. The thing is all of them which I tried to relate to were guys at 5'0 amd above. I never found anyone who was my height sharing a positive story. I have started to feel like an inch is a huge difference. I feel like maybe 5'0 looks very short but 4'11 is abnormally short. Like if I imagine myself standing next to someone an inch taller he would be short while I would be abnormally short.

I need you guys to objectively see my situation and help me out here. Does 4'11 really looks a lot shorter than 5'0? If not can I relate to their positive experiences?

And also if anyone is at 4'11 or 4'10 and has positive experiences regarding relationships or if you know someone like this please share it. It would help me a lot.

157,"There's a few threads already like this, but everyone's situation, and honestly I just need to talk to someone about this.

I'm 19 and an only child. My parents and I have always had a bit of a tough relationship. They've always argued near constantly, and I was in a foster home for about a year while they were in jail/recovery (I was 7 at the time). Since then they 'made up' and resolved to stay together 'for me', while it's very obvious that they're not at all compatible. 

Up until I was around 17 or 18, I planned to move out and had zero qualms about it, or how it would affect my parents. However, my mom's health has become increasingly worse and she relies on me more and more. She has low mobility, is in pain most of the time, and is also mentally ill (bipolar disorder, drug/alcohol addiction, depression, anxiety, and I suspect borderline personality disorder). She's also become increasingly emotionally abusive to both me and my father (though my father has a history of being abusive as well). She picks fights constantly and is impossible to please! According to her, she is always in the right, she is always the victim. 

Currently, I'm house-sitting, and since they have an old dog I'm basically living in another house for two weeks. Whenever I call or text my mom to check in I get a negative response, and she's been pulling a guilt trip, making sure I know ""Dad's been doing all the stuff you usually do"". Generally, she tends to lament about how she wants so badly to have a good relationship with me... But honestly, after the things she's said to me in past disputes, I don't really WANT to have any sort of close relationship with her. I of course will continue to respect her and care about her as a human being, but not quite a loved one.

In college, I'm learning more about other cultures from both psychology and sociology classes, as well as the people I meet. I've become increasingly aware how (mostly) white Americans follow a trend of not taking care of their parents as they get older. A few people have said things like ""I don't care what my mom does, I'm never putting her in a Home, I'll take care of her as long as she's alive"". Are these people truly selfless, or do they just not have mothers who pressure them for drug/alcohol money, constantly pick fights, and create an overall negative atmosphere 24/7? 

We live in an expensive area, and with my dad as the only source of income (I work part-time while I go to school, but he won't let me pay rent or help with groceries). We're middle class and sometimes struggle to make ends meet (scared we can't pay rent for our one-bedroom apartment, etc.). If my dad gets sick and can't work, I don't know what the hell I'll do. The field I'm going into doesn't pay well either, though I'm not about to sacrifice my passions to become a doctor or lawyer...

Long story short: I feel royally fucked, at at the same time like a selfish prick.

This job was my life for 2 years. It has been very lonely. Most of my fellow co-workers have families, ready to check out at 5PM so they can watch their newborn children coo. They have no interest in chewing the fat in some Irish pub with a single homely woman in her early thirties.

In February, I took an Improv class. I joined this amazingly supportive theater and I discovered what I really wanted out of life: Community. I suddenly started questioning my life choices. Do I really want my job to be the end or should it be the means? I've been making friends and performing shows and I am happier now than I can remember ever being.

Yesterday, [AAA_GAME_STUDIO] contacted me for an interview. They would like me to interview for a position that pays more and is wayyy cooler than my current job. However, I'd have to move hundreds of miles away. I'd have to give up this Improv community.

Have I changed as a person? Is this what I really want or just what 18 year old me really wanted? Do I really want to become a complete stranger once again? Do I really want to start over?

171,"Hi! Sorry for the long post!
I had a best friend for 12 years. She was the person I told everything to and I always had fun with her.
Then I got a boyfriend and after some time we decided to all live together in one house. Not the best idea, I know, but we had to because of the high rent.

First we got along fine, but then it all turned into a fight. The fight was mainly between her and my boyfriend and I tried to not take sides (altough my boyfriend was right most of the time), but I didn't want her to feel like we were both against her.

At the end she was mad at us most of the time and she blamed us for everything (at one moment she cursed with cancer towards us). That's when we decided that we couldn't live with eachother and she wasn't a friend anymore. Her father came to talk to us and he said that the lease agreement of the house was on her name (he made sure of that because he helped with the house) without our knowing. 
And they wanted us out of the house in 3 months. We were very upset and angry because we didn't want to go back to our parents but we didn't have a choice.

We moved out immediately. A few weeks later she texted me if we wanted to come over and drink something, as if nothing happend. I haven't reacted since and now its half a year later. 

Now my boyfriend and I have a new place. I have a few friends, but nobody as close as she was and I miss it. Should I get back in contact with her or not?

173,"Hey /r/advice, this is something I've gone back and forth with for a while so I thought I'd see what you all think. I was raised Catholic, but not very strictly so, as my family didn't regularly go to church or anything. When I was about 12 I decided I probably didn't believe in God. In high school, reading more philosophy and theology, I decided I was an atheist. I met and married another atheist, and we had a kid.

We didn't get him baptized, obviously. I always felt that when he was old enough to comprehend what we were talking about, I'd teach him about some different religions and philosophies, maybe even take him to some different churches and urge him to come to his own conclusions, supporting whatever he decided.

When he started 1st grade we put him in Catholic school, simply because it's the best school in the city; my family all went there and got excellent educations. I'm very happy with how he's doing at school, but of course, they drill religion daily (more than I remember from when I went there). He asks me about God and Jesus pretty much every day, and I give him the ""Catholic"" answers, but then also explain that other people believe different things. 

He's almost 7 now and his school is gearing up for First Communion. All the kids in his class are doing it and he understandably wants to, too. He'll need to be baptized first. 

I feel like he's way too young to really make a decision like this, but then I also feel like it doesn't really matter if he goes through the rituals and decides later he doesn't believe in them (I went through them when I was a kid). I guess it feels kind of... dishonest? to jump through all these religious hoops just because his friends are doing it. But if we don't do it, I'm not really supporting his ""decision""?

Maybe putting him in Catholic school was a bad decision? There just aren't any non-religious private schools in my area, and the public school system isn't great.",20Jun2017,13

178,"I was born into a well-off family and went to a private high school and it never bothered me because until I matured I thought everyone was like us. I never met any kids outside of the school and thought the wealth and class structure was homeless -&gt; where we were -&gt; absurdly rich. I was and still am so sympathetic to the middle and lower classes, and I have had such a feeling of guilt for about a decade now. I didn't earn the money that my parents did. They worked hard to get where they were, but none of that should have been spent on me, I feel. I essentially got whatever I wanted as a kid, although I was disciplined at the same time. When I realized our situation relative to most of the world/country's, I attempted to cut back on wanting my parents to buy so much stuff for us as a sort of repentance, but I still felt the same guilt. Again, I DON'T DESERVE ANY OF THIS. When I was applying to colleges I would always hear people talk about expenses and how resentful they were because wealthy kids are somewhat more likely to get accepted anywhere and of course that they don't have to hope for scholarships or take out loans. On the topic of school, my private high school cost about half of a normal college tuition because it was supposedly harder and most of the kids there were way above average. Then I began to think if I was really smart or a product of hundreds of thousands of dollars spent (that other families didn't have) on my education. I really don't know what to do. My whole family donate a lot to charity, vote more taxes upon ourselves to try and help out the lower classes in any way. But the reality is that I can never relate to what most people live like, and when I see people try to, they're met with backlash for it. 

So how can I relate to people and show them that I'm not a snobby rich copy of my parents, but rather that I care and I do everything I can to understand how the classes below me live even though I'll never be able to. I'm so grateful for my luck, but I don't know what to do about it, and it's come to hurt me mentally. Even though I think I put a lot of hard work into my grades, I pretty much had opportunities handed to me in school. There were kids in my school that were snobby and had even more handed to them because they were even richer and had connections, but that doesn't mean I'm exempt from trying to help. Was I supposed to move out at 18 to feel what it's really like to live like most of the country?


Please, those who have lived poor or middle-class, what can I do to show that I care and that I acknowledge this absurd privilege? Those who were in a similar situation, what did you do? I can't stand feeling this guilty for so long.  ",20Jun2017,2

I have been a member of reddit for a short time now but have never posted anything.  I thought I'd reach out and ask for some career advice. I'll try to be as brief as I can be for reading sake, I apologise if this was longer to read than planned.

 Long story short I am 34 years old and the manager for a brewery/restaurant.  I am grateful for the opportunities that have lead me to where I am needing a change. Working with the public so closely, poor upper management, and working shifts until 2am have burnt me out.

I am always been fairly savvy with coding and computers (only in my free time) and would like to switch careers and dive into software development.  With no experience at my age is this even possible?  Are their companies willing to train? What is a good place to start or entry level type jobs in the field? I have management experience which might help with project managing but that seems to barely scratch the surface..

Would that be the best route to get my foot in the door with tech/software dev ASAP? Are they worth it or more scams?

I'll have intermittent moments where I'm like, ""Yeah I wanna be XYZ now,"" but I always inevitably return to being a flight attendant. Being in the United States, most US-based Airlines don't hire FA's under the age of 21 (with the exception of American Airlines, who hires FA's at 20). So, at 18 and a recent high school grad, I went to college.

On a whim last week, I took the first step of reaching my dreams, and submitted an application for American Airlines.

I am 20 years old, will be 21 in September. One of the things I didn't take into account when I applied for American was that I have one more year of undergrad left. I've done a lot of soul-searching over the last few weeks (some recent personal tragedies have forced their hand in my thinking), and I'm now stuck between deciding on finishing out my final year of school or withdrawing (temporarily or maybe permanently) from school to pursue finally becoming what I've dreamed about for years.

Being this close to 21, I've done a lot of thinking on a plan should I opt not to return to school in the Fall. This is the rough plan:

I have a job a restaurant now, and can financially support myself with it. So I would work there and after turning 21 would apply to all of the airlines I can apply to, hoping that at some point I'll get a bite. If all goes well with American Air, I could be offered a position there by October or so. 

The last thing about this is that I'm not very passionate about being a college student. I'm good at it, I usually pull B's with minimal effort, but I've never really loved being in school. I'm not getting to the point where I loathe the thought of having to walk those halls again, even if for just a year.


I'm seeking some advice on this all. Are there any FA's/non-FA's out there who decided to walk away from college to pursue something else? What was the outcome?

All advice is appreciated!

189,"TL:DR How do we decide who gets the pull-out couch?

3 years ago my wife and I went on a trip with another couple and had a blast. That particular couple asked us to go free of charge, aside from gas/food. Lodging fees were covered, as it was a gift they had received. The place we stayed in slept 10 which was overkill for just the 4 of us, but the place would be great for our group of friends and split the cost. We are taking a vacation next year and are starting to ask some of our close married friends to go with us. We're all in our mid-twenties, and real close knit. The problem is there's 3 bedrooms and 2 pull-out couches, meaning one of us is going to get stuck with a couch. 

Since the previous couple took us free of charge, I immediately want them to have a bedroom as a ""thanks"" for allowing us to join them in the past. The whole idea for this vacation was mine and my wife's, and we would be driving us and another couple, so we would also like a room.

In my mind I feel as if we're justifying us getting a room kind of almost selfishly. Just because it was our idea doesn't feel like enough of a reason to stick one of the remaining couples on a pull-out couch for a week. Plus, the other 2 couples weren't with us the first time, so why would they find it fair that the first couple gets a room?

Aside from it being our idea, there's no real reason why we should be getting a bedroom over anyone else. Should we just draw straws? Am I over thinking it?

Also the roots are fairly deep down since the weeds grew through the layer of sand that we put down under the patio which is why whenever we have pulled them we usually miss a little bit of the roots. 

So Anything that isnt going to be toxic is fair game for use for us. We just want to avoid putting chemicals into the soil and also we like the sun bath and be barefoot on the patio and dont want to be absorbing chemical residue through out skin.

191,"Hey y'all. Potential long post. This is my first time making one of these but I'm not sure which direction I need to take in the next few months. Let me explain.

I am a 20 year old male living with my parents and sisters. One of which is older than myself and the other younger. After a recent religious disagreement with my parents it's been decided best that I move out in the next couple of months, no later than the second week of September. Here's the problem, I have no steady source of income at the moment. I have a part time job that I've had for about a month now but I put in my two weeks notice because it just isn't getting me the money I need. Granted it's something but I need more to be able to sustain myself in the long run. It pays an average of $180 every other Friday. I'm lucky enough to have no debt or bills to pay but what little does come in is still subtracted from when I come home to a certain degree. 10%, 15%, 15% is the requirement here. I did the math. On my last check of $179 I lost $72, that's 40%. I have maybe $700 in two separate bank accounts with at least another approximate $170 coming in when I finish these last two weeks. My old man has his own business which could bring in some cash but I'll have to get it off the ground. Long story short, he's had to scale down his availability to his customers due to medical issues. Myself and another guy he's looking to employ would be doing a relatively easy part of the job that takes an hour and thirty minutes to complete tops. Each job we would be called to would relatively match two weeks of work at my current job. It's easy money. My folks have offered to pay my first months rent and I could use my old man's truck to move all my stuff in one trip so that's no issue. I have no car, no phone of my own and no laptop. I have clothes, furniture and a good sense of health. I live in a military town so there are job openings pretty frequently on and off base that I could take advantage of but things like transportation and experience would become an issue in all too familiar dealing with. I don't necessarily have a resume as all I've ever been involved in is informal religious volunteer activities. This means I'd have to settle for something entry level like fast food or something. I have a budget rough draft that I'm trying to work out so living off those wages would be rough but it's possible. I'm trying to eliminate unnecessary expenses. I have no girlfriend, so no money wasted there. All my friends are pretty distant so I would just go to work and come home when I'm on my own which I can deal with for a time. I'm ok with walking where I need to go but I'd have to live in the center of town and the apartments there are a good $745 for 1 bed one bath. I could look for a roommate but the problems with that is the fact that my parents would be against that, which wouldn't matter at that point anyways, and the fact that two monst isn't enough time to get to know someone much less trust them to live in your space. It's too big of a risk but there's a slim possibility it could work if I find the right person. I'm shootin blanks here. All I have is my wits and that ain't enough to make this work out. All that might not come across as coherent but even now I'm press for time. If anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears.",20Jun2017,1

195,"Short version: I am an above average intelligence (had to mention because it's one of my only good traits I can state confidently) high school student, not bad looking(8/10 on a good day) but am only 5'8 and not very built at all. Not awful except my three best friends are ALL over 6 foot, insanely ripped, and all have musical or artistic abilities. I'm tired of living in their shadow, I want to improve my life by honing in on what I know I can do successfully. I said this is a three part process because I know what I want to hone in on and I believe I know the order I should. The first is getting very very in shape.   Longer version: Okay so as I said I'm 5'8, maybe even 5'7 and a nurse was feeling nice, but I'm not very built at all. I've never been called fat because I'm not but most remarks about my body structure are along the lines of ""why are your arms too scrawny for your arm holes"". It's embarrassing. My friends however are entirely different than me. I am indeed smarter than them and I've always prided myself on being well-read and clever but I won't lie, literally being towered over by my three best friends who are all over 6 foot, on very strict workout routines that have made them look like bricks in addition to their respective abilities in art and music has made me feel like shit. I think I need to stop pitying myself and just enhance what I am good at, I just need some help from people who know stuff. The three things I want to do in order are get very in shape(will elaborate as this is part one), really apply myself to learning how to code and program to the point where I can contribute to the Computer science team I am on, and then to truly improve my guitar skills so I can confidently become active in the growing local music scene around me. Anyways let me get started with part one.  Goal number one, Getting in shape: I have put this goal first because I have struggled for the duration of high school with depression. It's made me very lethargic and simply uninterested in a lot of things, I feel I've spent a lot of time letting time pass me. I think if I dedicate myself to getting in shape it'll put me at a place where I'm motivated enough to pursue my other goals. This is where I need some HELP. Like I said my friends are all huge and insanely ripped. I've tried to get on their workout schedules and one of two things has always happened 1) I'm discouraged because they're so advanced and I don't understand powerlifting jargon or 2) I simply don't want to be huge and buff, I'm a short guy. I don't wanna be a meatball.  So I'm hoping someone in this community can provide me with advice on how to reach my fitness goal. I am short but I know I can get ripped. This may be a stretch but like a Lightweight UFC fighter body type( Sort of Lean but incredibly ripped and overall strong) is my dream body. I know it takes a combination of diet and exercise and I'm willing to dedicate myself to it if I know what to dedicate myself to. I hope someone can provide some tips or guides, thank you.",20Jun2017,2

202,"**TL;DR:** I housesat for some friends, they didn't explain parking rules and I got two tickets that I can't afford that they say I owe. plz halp


I house/ dog-sat for some friends for a week and a half while they were away in Europe. My duties included moving the car, walking and feeding their dogs, and doing a few little errands for them (some friends came by to pick up some stuff). I didn't accept any payment or gifts because they are good friends of mine, but they told me they are bringing me back gifts despite that.


Their dogs pooped and threw up everywhere because they were old. They told me that this might happen, but I wasn't anticipating how bad it would be, haha. I also accrued 2 parking tickets:

* one because I was in front of a parking sign in front of a school parking area (though when I parked it was outside those bounds because I was in front of the sign, not behind it where the indication arrow was)

* one because I was ""in front"" of a fire hydrant (the car was not blocking it and it was outside of the markers around the hydrant, but apparently it was still too close). 


I had kept the car at the second location for a few days as the sign allowed, and didn't get a ticket for the hydrant until the third day. If I took pictures I probably could have contested these tickets, but I was super flustered and I had to go to work and move the car again each time. They didn't really tell me much about the parking situation other than giving me days of the week and places to move the car (which were wrong, according to the street signs, and my violations were not due to this).


The two tickets amount to $175, which is just over a quarter of what I make a week after taxes. I don't make enough to cover them out of pocket.  I'm trying to save for a deposit for a new apartment, and any extra money I have goes towards this. Additionally, both of them have good jobs. They originally told me they'd pay one of the tickets, and now they're saying I have to pay them back for both of them and I should do so over time weekly.

I don't really know what to do in this situation.  According to them, the tickets are ""not their responsibility"" and I should have known about the fire hydrant 15-feet rule because ""it's the law."" I recently moved here, and don't know the driving laws well, nor do I have a car of my own here.  In my old city, restricted zones were clearly marked with yellow paint. It's not my car, and they didn't give me the proper information about parking.  On the other hand, I signed up to take on this responsibility. I don't have the extra income to pay these tickets, and what these tickets would cost is way more than even a few days of dogsitting would cost. I'm meeting with them later and I'm not really sure how to broach this topic.",20Jun2017,1

210,"Hi guys, first time posting here.

As you can suggest by looking at the title, I'm just not really sure what to do anymore. I want to start by saying I've never been diagnosed with depression and I don't really feel depressed, just kinda stuck. Not really sure if it helps but I recently turned 19.

My parents have always been telling me to get out more because normally I'm just stuck on my computer, so this weekend I did, I crashed at my best friends place the whole weekend and had a blast of a time. I spent a lot of the time there talking to his girlfriend downstairs because his room was way too warm (British heatwave!). I've also been really good friends with his girlfriend for a long time and we can share secrets and have deep convos and stuff. 

Now the backstory is out of the way, and the weekend too, I just kinda feel stuck. I've got a decent paid job and bought a brand new car not long ago but I just feel like I'm missing something. 

The main reason I feel that I'm missing something is because seeing those two sometimes cuddle each other made me think of my ex and that it was quite nice to have someone there who I could cuddle and stuff. It made me feel kind of empty and hazy inside. My problem is that I have no confidence to do anything at all related to relationships/girls. The last girl I talked to (apart from my friends gf) was my ex around 2.5 years ago. But the weird thing is, I've never had a problem making friends, but looking at it now, they're all lads.

213,"Hi Everyone,

I am a 23 year old male, and for quite some time now I have been having some really intrusive thoughts that relate to body image/being teased about my body when I was younger. There is nothing wrong with my body really, I don’t have a ton of muscle, but I’m not overweight either. However, these intrusive thoughts have been quite bothersome. For example, I remember when I was 10, I was walking around in a towel and my mom kept on saying “Ooh, I want to see you naked!” I didn’t let her, and showed her I was wearing underwear underneath, but it still bothered me (she didn't end up seeing me naked). I also remember a time my sister lifted up my shirt when I was 14 and said “I saw your belly button!”, another time my mom and dad made fun of me for walking around in a towel when I was maybe 11, and one time when I was 10 and we were going swimming and my dad jokingly said something about taking photos of me when I change. There have also been a few times (maybe 2-3) when I was accidentally walked in on after or during a shower in my teens.

I have been trying to just let this go for quite some time, but it just isn’t working. Note that I was not abused/assaulted or anything, just teased. Nonetheless, these incidents really bother me, these thoughts are incredibly intrusive and can easily take up all of my mental attention at times. I find my self connecting the most unrelated scenarios to these incidents (like someone saying ooh, as my mom did once).

My family is nice and supportive, and we get along fine. I am the youngest, and all of these family members (and others, for that matter) have seen me nude at some point or another. The teasing was when I was a kid mainly, not so much an older teenager.

My parents are not from the US originally, and where they come from nudity within the family might be a bit more acceptable. Therefore, perhaps they did not realize the teasing, at my expense, was not appreciated. After all, they have seen me naked in my early life more than anybody else has…who knows, maybe that teasing reminded them of those young childhood days, memories of bath time. I think I was fine with being nude in front of them when I was 8, maybe even 9. But 10-11 seemed a bit too old from my perspective…maybe they just didn’t realize that. For example, once we were visiting a relative, after coming out of the bath I needed the room to change, my mom said it would be fine if she stayed she was just in the room getting some stuff together, but I insisted she leave too (and she did along with the others). I honestly don’t think they had any negative attentions.

I do remember a time when I was 14 or 15 on a hot day when my sister was almost insisting that I take my shirt off to prove that I don’t get embarrassed, my mom was the first person to defend me/lecture her on where I am in life right now with regards to my body, and why I am not comfortable with that. We recently took a beach vacation, I didn’t want to go to the pool. While my sister was insisting, my mom again told her it is fine if I don’t want to take my shirt off. 

It’s strange, I go through periods of time where the above really really bothers me and I just wish they hadn’t done that at all and I think about other people who were “lucky” to not have that. Then there other times where I am personally bothered by the things I did or said to my family in my teens that wasn’t nice (unrelated to the above, not revengeful behavior), and I don’t think about these incidents at all. I developed some body issues in my teens, but I don’t think that was related to the teasing. During those years with the teasing, I had no issue taking my shirt off at the pool/going swimming. I feel like I didn’t actually think too much of the teasing when it was going on, but a couple of times when I was walked in on in the bathroom in my teens oddly reminded me of those times…and then it made me upset.

I want to ask, firstly, is it normal/not unusual for some level of teasing or incidents like this? And how do I let this go completely? It takes up my mental attention when I really have other more important things to focus on. Occasionally, I will think of an incident or two like this and then get frustrated with my family in present day, unrelated situations as kind of a means of “getting even.” There are other times I feel like I am close to moving on, but then I get upset with myself for having spent so much time over the years thinking about this. I honestly just don’t want to think about this anymore/almost erase it from memory…any help would be appreciated!",20Jun2017,1
214,"I just started an office job about 6 months ago. Since then the company has merged with another company and is under joint management and a transitional period. At my company,  I get a lot of information regarding policy, procedure, and projects from upper management relayed to me through my supervisor. The problem is she is manipulative at times, very emotional, and somewhat unhappy with her situation and with upper-management after the merger.  I'm not a mind reader and don't know the details to the dynamic between her and the uppers, and don't wish to, but sometimes i feel as though she is either trying to frame herself as a victim (she frequently says things like ""they are trying to crucify me that wasn't my fault"") OR she is trying to gain my support to use me as leverage (I sit thr next desk over from her in the office so I constantly hear her have conversations then completely frame it in a different context and to her advantage when re-telling the story to someone else). But there is a chance she is genuinely just venting to me, which i feel is also inappropriate due to the work dynamic between us.  Anyway, I have no desire to even think about it or get involved with her situation, unless it pertains directly to me. But I am constantly having to filter useful information from what she says (As my friend would say ""ugh she is so extra!"") but I am concerned that I may be losing important information in this process and I do value her input from a technical standpoint.  Any advice on how to handle this?

227,"Throwaway account because I don't want this on my main account. Hello everyone, I feel like I'm in one of the most bizarre situations life could have ever thrown at me.

 My wife and I are in early/mid 20's and we're basically high school sweethearts, together for many years. We have our one daughter, and do not plan on having any more children. Finding each other feels like we've used up all our luck in the world because we feel like the unluckiest people alive sometimes. Fresh out of school, we were both going to stay with her dad while we attended college, but this plan just never came to fruition. I come from a very poor family and was desperately trying to escape from them. With nowhere else to go, we got to stay with her mom and stepdad for college. My wife was already attending college and was on her last semester for an associates degree as I started my first semester. I ended up working a part time job that barely covered my tuition after a long and exhausting financial issue with FAFSA. I got half a semester under my belt before strains were happening between my wife and her parents. We were essentially kicked out where I ended up being closer to work and was footing all the bills for ourselves. My wife's parents then decided to pull out on paying her tuition to finish off her bachelors degree for no real good reason considering they are very well off.

 We lived off my now two part-time jobs for a year before she got pregnant. We talked extensively about it and everything was planned and how would we handle it. The only thing that made us truly happy was each other so we didn't really want to be held back because of finances from living like a family. I found a great full-time job that paid decently well that let us save money and we found a great new place to live that was decently cheap. If we could have kept living like this forever, we probably would have. That's not always how life works though because I tried to expand my career by taking a new job with great potential for growth, benefits, government retirement plans etc. Upon starting that new job, I was met with a very hostile staff on top of an already overwhelming job. Trying to balance my work/home life was seen by them as extremely rude. I felt like they were trying to tell me that ""this job is your life now"" and that thought really bothers me when I have such a great wife and daughter at home waiting for me. Eventually, after what felt like a witch hunt, they ""helped me out"" by having me resign but the reality of it is that I was fired. I just accepted the terms of everything because I really wasn't ""in love"" with the new job like I wanted to be and became pretty disillusioned with my career path that I was taking. 

In the 3 months or so I had worked with my new employer, my old company had fallen apart and lost many jobs, including the one I used to work despite them saying I was always welcome to come back if things didn't work out. I was completely unable to find new work and was forced into a situation where I now couldn't afford my bills and thus lead to the desperation of me returning to my parents. I hadn't seen them in years, and they assured me that they would help us out with a place to stay and figuring things out. We ended up living in a very bad home that was constantly under construction by my uncle with nothing we could do about it. He stays up very late working with power tools which is bad for establishing any sort of good sleeping habits for us or our baby. In this new area we are in, jobs are very abundant, but I've now had two jobs that were completely soul-sucking and red flags from day 1. On top of all the stress of our living conditions (like not having a kitchen now for almost 3 months, making all food on a grill/microwave) I just couldn't handle the poor working conditions either. My wife and I have been under constant stress and strain from all of this and it eventually lead to fights between everyone on my side of the family and her now forcing us to cut ties there as well. 

We are now living with my best friend and he's giving us the time we need to figure things out. My mom thankfully is our full-time babysitter as she is unable to work allowing my wife and I both the opportunity to work and save money. We both got jobs together working for the same company because we want to be working together. Above all else, being together could make any miserable job an amazing one. Well, they lead us on like we would be together all through the hiring and we jumped through a bunch of hoops before finally figuring out that it's against company policy for us to work together and we were only going to have a special treatment for training purposes.

 So here we are now, jobless again, living in my friend's place, low on cash, and really trying to figure out what we are going to do from here. The biggest life lesson we have learned from all of this is that if you don't have passion for the work you are doing, it's going to be miserable work. We want to be passionate in what we do, and that really involves us working together at whatever it is. This is where drastic measures come into play. Frankly, we want to get involved in porn. We want to start webcamming from home and trying to brand ourselves and make a business of it all. It's something we would both be very comfortable doing, and above all else we would be working together. Should we take a chance and go for it? Would this actually be capable of fixing our lives financially if we have the drive for it? We love streaming and talking to people and playing games and having sex of course lol. Is there anything we should consider before trying to live this lifestyle? We've tried to do a lot of research into it all, and it feels like the right move, but I always love to have a second opinion. I'm sorry if this story seems jumbled but I felt like I tried to sum up a very detailed story and chain of events so if something doesn't make sense or if anybody needs more clarification on anything, feel free to ask. Thanks anybody who reads this.

228,"We have a vacation home in a rural area and drive about 30 minutes over a mountain to get there. Cell reception is quite spotty. We are currently both with the same service provider, which has relatively good reception on the mountain, but horrible reception once we get to our destination. 

I previously had another carrier that had great reception at our home, and switched to be on my fiance's plan with him for savings. I am considering switching back and he is as well so that we can actually have good reception while we are at the house. 

One concern he has is with the switch is the possible decreased reception on the mountain. We are concerned about being able to call each other or call for a tow, etc. if there is a car issue on the mountain. I'm aware that you can call 911 on any carrier that picks up a signal, but my fiance reports that one time when he had a car break down on a freeway and had no cell signal, he used that option, called 911, and asked them to call him a tow truck. They told him they couldn't do that. Would this situation be considered different (mechanical breakdown on remote mountain) and would 911 help? ",20Jun2017,1
229,"Hello, Reddit.

Firstly, I want to begin by saying, if this belongs in another subreddit, please tell it to me, and I will move right along, I just didn't really know where to post, so I thought this was the best place for it, but anyway:


So a bit of background to start this off, I have had an ongoing argument with certain people I know for months, and it has been a bickering argument, where it started where personalities clashed, and now we all hate one another, tensions have been rising, but for months now I have had this horrible, sickness like feeling in my chest, it's brought on by anxiety, and emotional stress, and it feels like something is slowly digging into my chest, from this I've been feeling nauseous, I've lost my appetite, shortness of breath, and this isn't something physical, because whenever I have an argument with these people, it gets 10x worse. I have scheduled a time to talk to these people, but it's in a week, and because im so anxious, and stressed about this meeting, my horrible feeling has just ramped up, to the point where its difficult concentrating on other things, and my mind is only set on that one thing, and I really, really need help to try and settle this feeling down, because it's affecting many areas of my life.

Thank you :)",20Jun2017,2
230,"While doing dishes today and listening to a podcast (Sword and Scale, anyone?), my iPhone fell into about an inch of water for a moment. I quickly snatched it up, but fearing the worst, I took out my headphones and dried the phone off with a towel. It didn't seem to be wet in the headphone jack or charging port. Maybe because the water was so shallow?

After drying off the phone, I plugged it into the charger to see what would happen. It connected and said it was charging.

Still afraid of damage, I turned it off and put the phone in a bag of rice for good measure. If it charged when plugged in, do I have anything to worry about?",20Jun2017,1

232,"I need some crucial advice on how to like a girl. I use the term 'like' loosely as what I'm asking is for advice on how to grow to love a person which is, understandably, a pretty outlandish thing to ask but hear me out.

So there's this very attractive, petite, large breasted, Asian girl that I've been talking to for the past 2-3 months and we're pretty much seen as a 'thing' by our peers. Long story short I like her enough to keep talking to her after indulging in physical activity but I don't feel the need to talk to her all the time which is pretty draining as she wants to talk to me non stop. For a 8-9/10 on a good day she is a very insecure girl due to being cheated on previously which probably explains why she's so needy and is talking to a guy like me who's not that physically attractive what so ever.

Either way before I take it any further with her I want to actually feel some sort of emotion toward her and I was wondering if someone could help me out. Much appreciated.

234,"I've been working at the best job I've ever had for about 6 months now. It's in my career path unlike previous jobs, and the people here are really amazing. I've had about 10 years of shitty jobs (# in username was random btw), horrible bosses and coworkers - you name it. I love it here, but...

For the past two days my boss has been incredibly rude and talking down to me, acting like I'm an imbecile who can't perform my duties correctly and telling me how to do my job, when in the past he's praised me constantly. He seems to be under a lot of pressure lately, but that still gives him no right to take it out on me. I don't feel like I've been slacking, in fact I've been going above and beyond what's expected of me lately.

I know I can be a little sensitive at times, but this has turned me into someone who doesn't take shit from anyone and I know when to walk away from a bad situation. I'll never let someone treat me like shit again after what I've went through in the past and especially in my last job (which actually led me to this one).

Most people will probably tell me to talk to him about it, but I feel he's unapproachable at the moment. He's the CEO of the company (~100 people in the company) and not even my direct manager. I suppose I could talk to my direct manager about it or have him help as a mediator because I feel this needs to be discussed before it gets any worse.

I guess I just needed to vent. This sucks, because I love the work I do and the atmosphere, but being treated this way is something I will not stand for ever again. That tormenting feeling of being walked on is coming back, and I'm doing my best to keep my composure.",20Jun2017,1

237,"So, I will finish my college exams next week, and then my summer holidays will start. During August, I will go on a trip with my family, so I won't have much time to worry, but during July, I will be free all month with no plans whatsoever. I've always been a shut-in person, I still spend most of my time playing videogames and drawing.

However, 3 years ago I met a girl and I hung out with her a few times during our holidays. We became closer and eventually I fell in love with her, but she had always seen me as just a friend so she started feeling awkward around me. Also, as the idiot I am, I didn't give it the time we obviously needed, because she was also my best friend and I didn't want to lose her, but she ended up getting mad at me for ignoring her feelings and she said we should stop talking for a while, she said she would speak to me again whenever we had forgotten all this, but I'm seriously unsure if that's going to happen, also I can't cling to a mere possibility...

Besides her, I really don't have many friends, a few from college but they live apart and they also have their own friends outside college. I've been invited a few times by one of them to go to a coffee shop with a group, but they go very late into the night and stay there all night, and I was never a nightlife person, also my parents get sick worried if I come home so late, and they also have to wake up early every morning to go to work, so I don't want them to lose their resting time worrying about me. My brother also invites me a few times, but I don't really want to rely on him every time, he also has his personal life and privacy.

I'm planning to join a gym along my brother, at least it will make me leave my house more often, but I would really like to meet some new friends, especially girls, because I also wanted to forget about that whole situation I described before, but I have social anxiety and I would feel really awkward going out alone, people would just look at me and judge me, and it makes me very uncomfortable. I would like to go to the movies, play some bowling, go to the beach, I mean the weather is just too good to stay home depressing. Like I said, I really like to play videogames and draw, but I would still have plenty of time to do that. 

I just don't know what I could do to meet new people I can hang out with, possibly make some very good friends and maybe even a girlfriend, so any advice would be really much appreciated! Also, sorry for the long post, I hope I didn't bore you :)

I don't know what to do, I want to be able to help her, but I myself will be in Austria and Sweden at the time so I will not be able to provide direct support.

now that I'm older I'm slightly more financially well-off and I do try to incorporate more healthy eating into my diet (fresh fruits and veggies with hummus, drinking more water, eating whole grains and lean meats, etc.) I still badly crave junk foods to a point where I get  extremely irritable if I do not have it (mainly cola or mountain dew, chips, any type of sweet like donuts or cookies, and of course fast food like pizza, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, burgers, etc.) I don't binge eat but I do crave them very badly and I get in a horrible mood if I do not have them. I'm very much addicted to salt and sugar based on my poor diet growing up, I crave these crappy, cheap foods.

254,"A little about me to start: I'm mid-30's, female, married, no kids (and no plans to have any), my husband and I own a house with good equity due to a sizeable down payment, and we love our town. Moved here to Colorado a few years ago and couldn't be happier with that choice.

Last fall, my husband took a massive pay cut to follow a much-wanted career change and while we had to adjust to smaller paychecks, he is infinitely happier and working his way up the ladder at his new job.

Up until January I was doing pretty well for myself. I'm a professional with good background, graduate degree and many years of experience in my field, I've worked my way up and while I have bounced around a few times and taken some risks in my career, I feel I've done pretty well for myself. I was also making good money and was more than able to make up for what we lost when husband changed jobs.

Then I got laid off. I got notice at the beginning of January and was paid through the end of the month. I wasn't too worried about it, as I had some money saved up and didn't think it would be hard to find a new job. Boy was I wrong.

I of course started polishing up the resume and putting out feelers, applying to jobs the day I was notified of the layoff. I've been on dozens of interviews and had several where I thought my chances were really good, but I've gotten all sorts of responses: we went with a more qualified candidate; we've decided to cancel filling the position; we're going to hold off on a decision; we're changing the job requirements. And the absolute worst ones: total silence, even after multiple in person interviews. It's incredibly frustrating when I know how qualified I am for these jobs and I've always interviewed well, I thought. And Colorado has 4% unemployment, so they should be desperate for applicants!

Now I'm faced with a decision. I have about another month (maybe month and a half) of living expenses left before I get desperate. I interviewed today for a job that starts at minimum wage in the cannabis industry but has promise as far as working my way up. Pretty sure I can get the job, since I have more working experience than most people that apply for the entry level positions and they get a lot of people wanting a career change. It's not in my field, but I can foresee a path where I could work my way into corporate and get back into my field eventually. I really only have one minor lead at the moment that I just phone interviewed for today. (There are two others that could still come back  that I interviewed for but haven't heard anything for about 2-3 weeks so I consider them lost.)

In theory, I suppose we could make massive lifestyle changes and survive on minimum wage, but it wouldn't be pretty. As far as debt goes, we do have some credit card debt but nothing unmanageable. I do have significant student loans, however, because I put myself through both undergrad and graduate school on loans. They're all on deferment for the time being, and I know the balances are climbing. Husband is managing the mortgage payment and I've been covering all our other expenses with savings. I had unemployment for awhile but that ran out a couple of weeks ago. If we were desperate, I could cash out a portion of my IRAs.

I guess where I need advice is, should I just take the sure thing and work with it? Take the sure thing and keep looking knowing I could end up quitting after just a couple of weeks or months? Keep looking full time? Also, is there something I can work on to focus my career search more? Improve my interviews? I'm just so lost without a job. I feel so useless at the moment!",20Jun2017,1

258,"My 25 year old brother dropped out of college and won't work (always some excuse as to why) and my parents have supported him for 4 years now.  They kicked him out of the house last year and told him to live in my grandparent's trailer home parked on our property away from the house because he would not stop smoking weed in the house.  He has threatened to stab them before, and they called the cops to place a report but ended up not pressing charges because they care about him and don't want him to go to jail.  They seem to keep hoping it is a mental phase that he will grow out of.  Anyway, recently he has became a lot worse towards them. He has broken their stuff in the house, opened new bottles of juice and thrown them all over their cars, and most recently has stolen their $200 router.  I keep pressing them to just call the police to try and get the router back and press charges if he won't, but they seem to still care so much about him they don't want to take that step.  It is at a point though where I am wondering if I should take that step for them and call the police.  I am worried that he will go crazy and attack the police, or they will find drugs in the trailer if they go in there and he will spend years in jail.  I just don't know what else to do and I hate hearing about and seeing my parents live with him treating them like that when they are providing for him when he is well past the age to be on his own.

I also have photos from his Facebook where he has bragged about stealing things, whines about how my parents are abusing him and not providing basic necessities to him, and asking if he can use squatters rights to steal their property.

Any advice is appreciated. I feel like I need to step in and do something, but I'm not sure if I can if my parents aren't on board

I also do not live at their house anymore if that changes anything.

259,"So I [23/M/straight/bicurious] pretty much have no experience with dating. Had had a shortlived hookup with a female friend and went to the movies once with a different girl (who wasn't interested). 

I get along being alone, also the financial advantage is nice. However, I from time to time I get uncomfortably horny and maybe I should get a way to vent that. 

Kinda affraid/nervous and **thend to procrastinate everything**, so I should probably get over the fear of dating while it's not that bad and I'm still young. 

I get along with people fine, have no problems talking about sex as a topic but the moment it comes to being actively flirting, tuching, ect. [uhhhhh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_XaIuw6K6Q) ....

260,"To get to my question i do have to give a little bit of a backstory (sorry). So i lived in Denmark for 11 years as a child, then we moved to California for two years, and then i came back to my own country (TURKEY). I am currently still in turkey, i am now 20 years old i just started university. I can still understand most of what i read in Danish, and i can also understand and speak in a slow pace. But my Danish is not as good as it used to be back when i was in Denmark. I also attended two schools in Denmark. So now that the Backstory is over here is my actual question; I really miss Denmark, i feel like it was my home, its where i soent most of my life, and i miss it so much. I researched about getting a citizenship but i heard that even Danes couldnt answer some of the questions that were on the Naturalization Test, so even though i fullfill all the required requirements i am scared i may not be able to pass the final Test. So i thought maybe at least i could attend university and study there and look into the whole citizenship thing later. But unfortunately i cant seem to find a school that accepts foreign students easily. I still havent graduated from my University in fact i am just going to be starting my 1st year so applying for a bachelors/masters(etc) degree is not possible. I am studying ""German Language Interpretation and Translation"" at the moment. So to wrap it all up: ARE THERE ANY SCHOOLS I COULD APPLY FOR AND HAVE A HIGH RISK OF GETTING ACCEPTED?",20Jun2017,1

It's at least once a week he's completely black out drunk, doesn't remember a thing of all his shitty reckless behavior the night before.

271,"I'll try to make this short. 

A few years ago it got into my head to start dating rich men who are likely to give me money. Having seen youtube videos on sugardaddies and seeing college girls have tuition paid for I thought I would try the dynamic sans sex. At the time I had no one to support my tuition and at huge risk of homelessness straight after high school. I worked two jobs but not did not make enough to both house myself and get through college. I didn't consider myself a prostitute because I went on dates looking to date a guy whom I knew I most likely would not fall in love with but would be comfortable/attracted to enough to be somewhat intimate (embracing, kissing, etc) and date for awhile. I was open to have sex with I was in fact genuinely interest in romance and love. It is true, I never subjected myself to spend time with gross guys who creeped me out for money's sake. One gentleman even offered huge sums of several thousands of dollars within the first month of dating him and I completely declined because he made the dynamic immediately one of ""exchange"" whereas I was wanting to get to know somebody. 

The fine line for me is, am I a prostitute if I got to know somebody, felt comfortable to date them exclusively (while keeping my eyes open for someone I'd be in love with), but had sex with them when I had no physical attraction to them? And yes, their financial support being a huge incentive in overlooking their appearance. 

So it went like this. After dating ""rich"" men for a couple of months I realized I could not date someone for simply being rich. All these lawyers, ceo's, big-shot-whatevers were totally perverted and sick in the head. At the tail end of giving up this gimmick I met a significantly older gentleman online who I hit it off with immediately. We dated on and off for a year, completely with no sex, and what was holding me back from being intimate with him was 1.) His age. 2.) His looks. 3.) I was in love with someone my age. Throughout this time he gave me a couple thousand each month and then we stopped seeing each other. Half a year passes and I reach out to him again to see if he would be interested in dating because I was ending my relationship with my actual love interest. He said he was only interested if I was willing to be a real girlfriend (meaning, sexual active with him, exclusivity, and emotionally open to love.) 
I said yes and we began to be intimate for the next several of months. No weird fetishes, nothing creepy, and I felt a genuine friendship with this man and felt very very very safe around him....except I wasn't at all sexually attracted to him. I as able to orgasm just once with him and I really have no idea how. Naturally he treated me like a serious girlfriend and gave me enough to put me through college for a year and housed me for a year. Throughout my time with him because of his help, I developed a career in Nursing very quickly. I got a better education. My life was productive and full of travel and laughs. But I was not in love and didn't like having sex with him. Later, I met someone I was actually falling deeply in love with during this generous relationship and decided to end it to be exclusive with the new man I met. 

Am I a prostitute? I never did this with anyone else and would not. We've been broken up for two(almost 3) years now and I am in another rut and considering reaching out to him to see we can rekindle things..but money is the more powerful incentive than companionship. (Yes, I actually do enjoy my time with him outside of sex and care for him.)

I feel very sick with myself and this is a new feeling after having confessed this to an ex (Who is ironically the ""new man"" I fell in love with mentioned earlier. He who broke up with him after this confession.) and he called me a prostitute. 

What are your thoughts? Am I ethical in reaching out to him again?

Sigh. Thanks...",20Jun2017,1
273,"I am a 23 year old female, graduated with an illustration degree a year ago. I moved to LA and I am working full time at a fine art large format printing company. Previously I was a nanny but I thought something closer to my career path would be better.

Anyway I have found that after working on other people's artwork for 8 hours a day(I also edit artwork digitally) I am exhausted. I come home, go to the gym, and pass out. I am creatively drained and when I sit down to draw it feels painful to force a creative thought.

276,"I'm kind of facing a crisis of sorts regarding my future, my career, and my education and I was wondering if some redditors could give me some advice.

I'm currently 32, and I attend a local community college. I'm a textbook example of a student that was never challenged and therefore never learned to work hard. I finished high school with a 3.2 gpa in advanced level classes. I LITERALLY never studied a day in high school, I rarely even paid attention. Math and science mostly came natural to me, merely looking at problems presented easy solutions that I just sort of ""figured out"". English, history, economics, government, and social studies never required more than a few minutes of paying attention during lecture. Sometimes I rarely even paid that much attention. I took my act on a whim my senior year and scored a 31, I still had never studied and rarely if ever paid attention. I only ever did the minimum homework necessary to not totally tank my grades.

Post high school I joined the United States Navy as a Nuclear Electronics Technician. We were responsible for studying electricity, electronics, advanced level math (cal and trig), chemistry, material compositions, heat transfer, fluid flow, and physics (basic all the way to nuclear). This time I only crammed about an hour before each exam (usually short answer essay, pretty long). Most people studied rather hard, several failed out. I finished in the top 1/3 of my class with yet again, no effort.

After the navy I went to college to major in criminal justice, I finished my associates degree with ease, I had all a's except a history class I couldn't stay awake through. Then I went to work on my bachelors and just sort of gave up half way through, everything was just so easy that I couldn't bring myself to even try.

This was all 8+ years ago. Now I'm 32 and I've returned to college, this time to grab an associates degree in Electrical Technology with the hopes of becoming an Industrial Electrician. Classes are still a breeze, I've even gotten myself on as a T/A, Lab Assist, Tutor role where none previously existed purely because of my good grades.

I've realized that I wasted so much time and I'm trying hard to do well in school so that I can get a good job but I feel like I could do so much more. Looking back I wish that I would've pushed myself so that I could have attended a top level university and studied with some of the best and brightest. Now that I've wasted so many opportunities I was wondering if there is any way to rectify this. Is there any sort of test that I can be taking? (Like the act/sat?) Is there something that I can do to fix this? I don't see a high level college being interested in me at this point. Would I need to return and fix the classes I messed up when I dropped out before? Do I have any options? I don't really want to be a low level electrician at a factory, I know that I'm too smart for it.",20Jun2017,1

279,"BTW, I'm 18 years old.

I lived on a small city since I was 4. Best five years of my life. Then, we came to this big city, on another country. I've been living here since then. Years of bullying, depression, and bad weather. It may not sound like much, but when your best days were on a place were it was sunny and beautiful 90% of the time, it depresses you. Specially when everything you see is car smoke and black clouds. Also, I'm really allergic, and living on a warm weather makes my life actually livable.  About two years ago, things started looking up. I started eating better (I was borderline anorexic), put on some weight, started exercising, got a girlfriend, entered the preparatory for the best college in town for musicians, and started a (secret) YouTube channel. Now I'm in much better shape, both emotionally and physically. I'm single now, but I am still a very good pianist, and I think I almost have my life together. The preparatory ends in a year, and I've been thinking...

I've been thinking about going back. If I go back, I could study on a University on that town; is not as good as the one i'm in, but I have really good friends there, and I could live by myself since that YouTube channel is exploding right now. It should be an adventure, and also a hard task, living alone on a new city (it's been almost ten years). The weather should make me able to breathe normally for more than 3 hours straight, and the people there are a lot more like me than the people here. It sound good. But if I stay, I could become a better pianist, and the future of my career would be way more promising. Also, I could use that Yt money for something else, instead of living off of it.

283,"So I'll try to keep this short as possible and if anything I'll include a tl;dr at the end.  

So at my job last year around this time I started dating a co-worker.  It was, as far as I knew, a secret except for one person who I trusted. He was fired for an unrelated matter (called out of work ""too often"" even though he had dr notes).  We dated until the end of November.  This is where my fuck up began.  I've had relationship issues in the past, I'm not familiar to someone giving me most of their attention, I'm a loner.  Basically I woke up one day and just didn't feel it anymore.  Not that I stopped liking him or having feelings for him, I just didn't want to invest my time into it anymore which I guess is the only way I can explain it.  He asked me why, what did he do, did he say/do something wrong.  But since he hadn't and I didn't want to be that person who says ""it's me not you"" I just went the asshole route and left it alone.  I'd get the occasional text of ""this sucks so bad I miss you"" and it'd hurt to not reply but I already had in my head that I was doing what was best for me.  So the new year comes and goes, I'm still thinking about him and realizing I made a mistake.  I know at this point it's been almost 2 months of me being a piece of shit I can't just text him and say ""hey"".  So I reached out once, not saying much just asking if I could talk to him and didn't hear anything.  Waited 2 weeks and sent a different text, I knew it was the last I'd send and if I didn't hear anything I'd leave it alone for good.  I said something along the lines of ""you have every right to hate me and I understand why and I won't take that away from you.  I hope you can reach back out to me but I understand if you don't.  I'd love to have a conversation again"". I got a text back 10 minutes later where I got cussed out, something along the lines of ""you'd love to talk to me?  not that long ago you dropped me like a worthless sack of shit"". But it opened up into a conversation where we talked about how we were both doing, his new job etc, he asked for my Snapchat, we sent some snaps back and forth etc.  just friendly convo.  But after that it never happened again.  I'd randomly text him to say hi and I'd get a hi back, but trying to have a convo with him wasn't happening everything was yep, no or ok.  I get it, I fucked up and he doesn't owe me a conversation as bad as I wanted to just fix what I did he had shut me out.

So fast forward to last week, I come into work and a friend in the office asked me if I heard what happened to him over the weekend.  I said no, I looked at her and she had this look on her face so I knew it was bad ""a drunk driver hit him and he's in the hospital in critical condition.  They found the guy parked behind a building trying to pull the dents out of his front end.  They guy just left him in the street to die"".  I spent days trying to figure out his condition, see if he's even alive or in a coma.  I don't know any of his family or close friends.  I looked through Facebook at the local news stories about it.  Found a comment saying ""I know his family, he's in rough shape and has a long recovery but thankful to be alive"". 

So I've been wrestling with wanting to go see him (if he can even have visitors).  It wouldn't be for any romantic reason but because I'm genuinely upset and sad that this happened to him, if I could be any type of support for him I'd like to be.  I don't want to show up if he wouldn't want me there especially all he's been through he doesn't need the extra bs.  I have some people telling me to go see him, some saying I should just be happy he's alive and leave him alone.  So today I bought a card, I want to write something to him but really have no idea what to write.  My mind is all fucked, I just need other opinions that aren't coming from my friends.  Leave him alone or should I reach out?  Send a thoughtful card or go see him?  


TL;DR
I essentially broke up with someone by ghosting them, tried to get back in their good graces after I realized I fucked up and I didn't have much luck.  Found out last week they almost died and are in the hospital and don't know if I should visit, send a card or stay away.",20Jun2017,1

288,"I (17) have lived part time with my dad and brother (mid 20s) for many years now. Over time, he's been getting more difficult to deal and live with. Just off the top of my head, here's some of what he does:

He's incredibly lazy and dirty. He hardly ever throws things away or picks up after himself (or his 3yo son, who I fear will pick up his bad habits). He works very strange hours at a not so great job, and often he will stay up hours on end before he's supposed to go in to work and sleep for an hour or two before he needs to get up because he thinks he won't be able to get up if he doesn't. He sometimes comes home smelling like grease and (granted not much anymore but used to) come home and sleep on our furniture, not his bed, still in his work clothes and make everything smell like grease. Recently, my dad and I took a whole week to completely clean his room because we were sick of asking him to (have to go through his room to access the bathroom, so it was unavoidable). Imagine [a room like this](http://c8.alamy.com/comp/AB6DG9/extremely-messy-room-of-a-teenage-AB6DG9.jpg), but even bigger and even more garbage. Over the course of the week, we managed to fill nearly 15 garbage bags to the brim with dirty clothes of both his and his son's and probably 3 or 4 full of just garbage. On top of that, we found broken glass on the floor buried under other shit, green mold on the carpet in one area, and some important car papers that my mom had been asking for for probably a few months. We both got the room looking pretty much spotless. Took his clothes bags and the mounds of toys for his son and put them in the back room that's connected to his bedroom for him to sort through and wash whenever. To this day, and this job was done a month ago probably, not even a single thank you or anything. Even after made an offhand comment about it once to him. He (well me and my dad mostly) managed to keep it semi clean for a good while. Recently, he's back to his own ways of filth and laziness. Empty plates and food containers under his bed after we asked him not to eat up there (because we know this would happen eventually). Clothes all over the floor. Shit lazily thrown around and not picked up. It's as though that whole week we took to clean was pointless. On the nights he has his son (he and ex share custody), he'll stay up all night on an Adderall binge, playing video games all night or stay up on his phone all night and get no sleep. Then, he'll be sleeping all day while his son is up and we have to watch him for him. Not that we mind watching him, but it's about the principle that he thinks he can just do whatever he wants. 

It's tough because I know deep down my brother isn't a bad person. He's usually very kind to everyone, but in the last few years there's been this growing animosity between us and him. We try to ask nicely for him to start cleaning up after himself, and he does nothing. We try to be a dick and be forceful about it and still nothing. We try begging, and again no change from him. I feel like we're both at our wits end on what to do with him. I had the idea of my dad setting aside time with their doctor (they have the same doctor for their meds and stuff) and telling him what he's been doing to us, but that almost feels like going behind his back and I'm frankly afraid that my brother would do something drastic if taken off his meds - he's said to my dad that he has had thoughts of suicide before). I honestly don't know what to do in this situation. It's either that option, or just dealing with him how we've been and pick up after him for the rest of our lives.",20Jun2017,3

For example if sent the person who discriminates biased on social economic status they may lie and say they have never discriminated based on income to ""save face"" be seen as someone who is nice. Do I people know who I am and send them the survey or do hide who i am. I feel if people knew I was they would be less likely to respond honestly. Also would like to contuct reasearch on banks, fiancé companies, and dealships giving people higher interest rates based on income. For example I had finance manager tell me I had to buy a service contract through her was required to get a loan. I later found out she gave those of higher status they had choice.

Upon doing some research I found that people of higher economic status are more prone to problems of drug abuse that people than people of lower statuses. What some ways other then survey to conduct research. ",20Jun2017,1
290,"So me and my girlfriend had sex on the the 8th so it's about to be two weeks and it was unprotective sex.Three days ago she told me that she was starting to cramp but that only lasted a day but it was only for a few minutes, then yesterday she told me that when she woke up she didn't really feel that well and I thought this was morning sickness but this only last a few minutes and I think morning sickness last for while? I don't know. She then said  that she might be starting her period but I highly doubt it because she recently just got off of it on the 5th or 6th (so that would be two weeks ago). I've been looking up ""early signs of pregnancy"" but that doesn't really help me out.

So I come to this subreddit asking for help and advice about this situation.Do you think she could be pregnant? Or do you think she could just be starting her period? This situation has been really stressing me out and I really need some sort of advice or help.Thank you. ",20Jun2017,1
292,"3 months ago I had a industrial maintance interview at a large oil and gas company. I really wanted to work here and money was brought up during the interview but right before that the interviewer said ""we really don't hire people this young for this position"" im 26. He asked what I wanted to make and I told him I understand his reasoning behind hiring a younger guy and phrased it like this. ""I'll start at the low end for a millwright, 18 an hour and after the probation period I would like to open dialog about higher pay"". He like it and hired me. 

90 days has rolled by and they've thrown some large projects my way I completed and had high remarks. I completed a project today and my direct boss went over my work and said ""this is why you make 30 an hour"", I left it alone. They've already given me a company truck, tool box and treat me very well in such a short time and I don't want to seem greedy but I would like to be in the 25 hourly range and that's reasonable for the pay scale of the company. 

The maintance manager has not brought up money, I had a performance review and the only negative was im to detailed oriented, I agree with that but is a psychological thing and they've embraced that ""trait"" and assign me larger projects like rebuilding sub sea rovers with thousands of parts because they know it will get done 100% right even if it does take slightly longer. 

The comment my direct boss said today makes me think I do have justification in asking for more money as he does not know what I make and was in the range I want when he said 30 an hour. Now that I've been there for a few months I've also gotten to know what everyone else makes and im the lowest payed guy in the shop. The guy that just started and supply's the welders with consumables is making 22 an hour and generally maintance is the highest paid position behind the tooling and die machinests. 

I know if I asked my direct boss to talk to our manager he would because in such a short time he treats me like his son lol. People I don't even talk to are pleased with my work and I've received the ""above and beyond"" bonus at work...Every month since I've worked there. Im not trying to toot my own horn, im just giving context for better suited advice. I just dont know if im out of line in asking. I've read hundreds of threads on this subject but it's always ""I work way harder than anyone else"". I don't work harder, In fact im the slowest guy to make a repair but the machine operators always appreciate the fact it dosent break down again because it was fixed right and the machine got cleaned in the process. 

I just don't want to sound greedy, I absolutely love this job and love the fact I can do things how I want to do them and they are encouraging me to go randommillwrightguy mode on everything. I live in Oklahoma and have no formal education so 18 an hour is really good. They want to pay for a formal education and move me to engineering but honestly, I like turning a wrench. I worked for another company that gave me the title of ""building engineer"" and 90% of the work was drawing machine parts that dont suck in catia and installing them or doing PLC work. I have no desire to be behind a computer all day. 

It just comes down to getting the balls to ask I guess but I think it's in bad taste to do so but the other part of me keeps saying it's justified because of the average pay. Im willing to hold off on asking but I don't want my pay gap to turn into a angry pay gap. 

Thank you for your time",20Jun2017,1
294,"Hi, I'm a summer program coordinator at a local museum. I'm supposed to organize and make activities for the kids during summer day camps. I have a bunch of ideas in mind for crafts and arts but as for educational physical games, I could not think of any other than modified tag and relay games. I also do not know how to approach my job as summer day camp coordinator and how to get 3 to 10 year olds enjoy their time.",20Jun2017,1
296,This may seem like a stupid post however here it goes. My mother has been wrong several times and continued to blame me. A feel as though she truly never thinks she is ever wrong. This would be alright however the one thing that makes me angry or truly sad is unfairness. With my mother acting like this and blameing me or ignoring me for something she did wrong i see thst as unfair and it itches at me. Now I also belive in honesty to the extent that when i give my word that i will do something it will be easier for me to chop my own dick off then not do it. During an argument i was fed up of this and i gave my word that i will not say a single word to my mother again. Now its been about 4 days and its just getting annoying to continue. Should i continue in order to maintain my morals and prove a point to my mother about her actions still having consequences or should i talk and that will mean that my word wont mean shit to myself and therefore others ever again.,20Jun2017,2
298,"So I'm pretty sure I'm friendzoned by my best friend of several years. We've talked about taking things further, but it doesn't seem too likely at the moment. I don't want to feed my feelings of romance but at the same time I want to... you know... to thoughts of them on my own private time. My fear is, if I start doing that, what if my feelings for them will intensify and it will be harder for me. At the same time I kinda just wanna do it, for enjoyment. 

Is it safe? Or will it just subconsciously make me want my friend more, and make me awkward around them?",20Jun2017,3
299,"Lately I've really tried to get into the ""who gives a fuck"" mindset and honestly I've gotten pretty good at it. The one thing I still catch myself doing is comparing myself to my best friend. We have been friends since 7th grade and now we go to college together and he's my ride or die for pretty much any situation. However, I always catch myself comparing myself to him because I definitely get jealous of him in certain areas. The biggest thing I get jealous of is his ability to get girls. He doesn't have to work to get girls, while it takes me a lot more effort. I really really want to be happy for him when things go good for him, but naturally I just get jealous/upset. How can I fix this? 

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses. I'm still new to reddit but i've never seen a community that is as willing to help others as the reddit community is. ",20Jun2017,9
