1,"I like my current job a lot and I've pretty much created all of the systems involved in my day to day tasks.(I inherited the job from an old timer so I had the opportunity to rebuild the position.) I absolutely love my cube mate and my boss. I honestly feel like they are family and I am pretty much left to my own devices. However, the rest of the office is full of drama, backstabbing and unprofessionalism. Our HR manager is constantly going desk to desk talking loudly about religion and politics. About ten of the other people regularly throw full blown tantrums; cursing, slamming doors and throwing things. I've still grown quite comfortably there. Maybe it's Stokholm Syndrome? I get about a 15% increase each year and am treated very well by my direct manager. The benefits suck but I am fortunately on my husband's so it's a non-issue.


I have been offered a position at a new and smaller place doing pretty much the exact same thing for a 25% increase but I'm so frightened to take the leap. Yes, the place I work is dysfunctional and probably terrible for my mental health. But they have been good to me and I know where all the ""bear traps"" are so to speak. This new place could be exactly the same or they could give me this pay increase and then never give me another. What say you, Reddit?",30Jul2017,1
3,"For about four years, I've been dealing with people posting my nude photos all over the internet. It started when my ex posted them on multiple sites. Those spread very quickly. People in my hometown (of only 10,000 people) have contacted me telling me they saw them. Multiple times, random strangers have contacted me about them. Either to blackmail me or because they felt bad for me. But today, someone called me while I was at work ON THE WORK PHONE LINE and said there was an 8chan post of me and his girlfriend was making him call all the girls on there. Apparently someone posted about me two days ago and found where I worked on LinkedIn (which has since been privatized) and that's how he contacted me. This isn't the first instance of me feeling unsafe and having to freak out and panic because I know there's things like this about me out there. I have deleted my Facebook and am in the process of deleting all of my social media accounts. The thing is, the person who is now posting my photos on revenge forum threads isn't my ex, he's a guy who was into me a few years ago. He randomly messaged me a year ago on Facebook sending me dick pics. When I denied him, he got very angry and called me a nigger fucker (because my boyfriend is black) and said that I shouldn't breed outside of my race, etc. Then he started posting about me on revenge sites. I knew it was him because the posts were made around the same time he messaged me. Plus, there's no one else it could be. My ex and I are now on good terms. I have no SOLID proof it is him though. But I am certain it is. Is there any way police involvement would be beneficial? Or would I just be wasting my time? I'm scared of this person. He's a very crazy and violent white supremacist. I barely even know him. Also, I have been thinking about changing my name but I don't know if it will help my issues but I think it would. I am very, very scared, and constantly panicking about things like this. I was a very bad person and that is why this even started happening to me but it's time for it to end. I've completely changed who I am and want to make amends for any bad things I've done in my past but this makes me feel like there's no escaping. My mother passed away about a year ago and I have been trying to completely change my life but again and again this has been holding me back; scaring me, making me feel worthless, and worrying me about my job and my future. Any advice is welcome.",30Jul2017,1
4,"I'm in a situation where my father has done something wrong and my sister and mother are now estranged from him. I'm attempting reconciliation, albeit our relationship can never be the same again. We have to redefine our relationship, and I am attempting to do so from a place of forgiveness and compassion, despite the seriousness of the offence.

My sister is marrying and taking her husband's surname. My mother is divorcing and reverting to her mother's maiden name.

I feel mixed on the issue. I'm genuine in my desire to reconcile, but I am going to be the only remaining person in my family carrying this name, and even though my parents have been separated for over a decade, I still felt like we were a loose family unit. I now feel I have relatives, but no sense of family. I feel the loss of ability to take any pride in my name.

I'm not trying to be vindictive in considering changing my name. I just feel there is a positive sense of ""rebirth"" to changing name.

I'm not really sure on this, so any thoughts would be welcome. ",30Jul2017,1

15,"Maybe it's depression: I've been under a lot of stress for a long period of time, both at work and with my personal finances. So maybe part of this is being brought on by all of that.

Yet, I seem to have the same, reoccurring issues at every job. People walk all over me, treat me like an idiot, things like that -- but the thing is, I *keep screwing things up*.

Whether it's something technical, to do with my job, or even when I was working as a barista years ago, sometimes people will have to tell me how to do the same things over and over again. And other times, I'll just make simple, stupid mistakes.

I get that ""everyone's human"", but for it to bring trouble to literally every career I've had -- and I'm 29 now -- I have to think there is something wrong with *me*.

Now, I'm not trying to be all debbie-downer over here, but... Well, it deeply worries me. There really aren't many people who work *harder* than I do, but I feel like I'm constantly met with failure, and when you screw up little things, no employer is ever going to trust you with bigger things.

The only job I never had any issues with was GameStop, which it sounds like there really isn't a long-term career there anyways. For such a long time, I wanted to pursue *some* kind of career in the Gaming industry, because it's the only thing I feel like I *truly* knew well... but I never got a college degree, never got certified in anything, and I feel like that door is pretty well closed to me now, if it was ever open to begin with.

I just... I want to know that I'm working towards *some* kind of future for myself, but I feel like I'm incapable of virtually any job I've been given. I don't know if it's just that I still haven't found the ""right job"" for me, but it feels an awful lot like there may just be something inherently wrong with me, like some broken circuitry in my brain.

My work history is all over the place, and I aside from I think anyone would vouch that I put 100% into whatever I do, I don't know that I can truly say I have any sort of ""skill"". Like, I don't know if there's *anything* that someone could ask me to do, and I could confidently say I could do it without needing someone to double-check my work.

Two books (with essays), around 50 math problems and a packet for our AP class (APWH) this year which requires a textbook which you pick up at the school. He has around half of a book done and hasn't done any of the math or WH. He is now ranting to me about how his mom is going to take away his video games and is calling him irresponsible. Im not saying anything right now, as I don't want to get into the middle of this, but I'm completely on his mom's side. I've done my math and finished the longest of my two books today on a flight and have done a quarter of the WH work. I'm just mad that he thinks he doesn't have to do the work and gets mad when called irresponsible. What do I do?",30Jul2017,1
20,"This will take time to read, but I seriously need some guidance. 

There's no other way to put it. I'm in love with my best friend. We are both females, both 19 years old. We've been best friends since we were about 14. I've liked her for almost this entire time. As far as I know, she's straight. And as far as she and everyone else knows, I'm also straight. I haven't come out, she's the only girl I've ever had these feelings for. I'm also attracted to men and I'm trying to date so I can lose feelings for her.

Firstly I'll tell a bit about myself and her. I'm more masculine, but in no way do I identify as a male or a butch. I usually just wear a men's tshirt and hoodie, and a pair of sweat pants. This is just because I'm comfortable in this. I'm kind of shy, so I don't get touchy around any other friends. She is VERY beautiful, she's also had a kind of rough upbringing. She was kicked out of home at 16, where she moved in with my family and I which we live over 2000 kilometres away (I used to live down her way, we went to school together until I moved when I was around 16, she moved a year later). She recently moved back after living with me for two years after sorting things with her family. This was one year ago. She's very feminine, but she can also be a little sloppy and I like that!

I'm just going to list some things below that she does or has done in the past. 

• She's very touchy, but I think she tries to do it discreetly, much like I do to her. For example she will grab me around the neck (jokingly haha) with her arms and kind of wrestle with me, and she full on wrestles too and she's setup her phone on record once (with my knowledge) and filmed us wrestling.. I would do that to capture some special moment or something, but that's just me. Anyone else? She always sleeps on my shoulder during long car rides and stuff, I don't think she does that with other friends. One time in particular recently, she rested her head on my lap when we were sitting on the couch watching a movie and asked me to play with her hair. I loved it, but it got me thinking. She also gets me to draw on her back.
 
• She keeps my clothes. As I said, I usually dress in male clothes so I have a fair amount of comfy shirts and hoodies. She used to LOVE asking me if she could keep some. Even if I loved the item of clothing, I'd let her keep them. I liked her to have them. She would upload photos of herself in them, one photo in particular she uploaded a photo to Instagram and she was wearing my shirt she got a while before and the caption to the photo read ""Haha aw, I still have it :)"". But she didn't tell me about the photo or anything, so I don't know if she wanted me to realise she was meaning the shirt. I got to excited so I just started to look for other things in the photo that she could've been referring to, but honestly it was just a photo of her and I couldn't notice anything else. 

• This one is odd. So basically one time we were laying on a fold out bed together, we were just talking to my younger brother in a spare room. We weren't sleeping in the bed, just laying on it. We were kind of in the spooning position, but about two feet apart, so we weren't touching or anything. I think I was just annoying her and flicking her ear or something just messing around like a friend, something like that. Then we both just got up about 5 minutes later and left to each others bedroom. (We lived together at this point). Then within 20 minutes, someone had messaged me (without her knowing) some screenshots of some texts between this person (we'll call him Jake) and herself. She was telling Jake how we were just laying on the bed and that I was putting my hand on her hip and so she asked what do I want, and I apparently signified to go to the bedroom. I was so confused because none of that happened... why would she bring it up? I don't get it. She doesn't know till this day that Jake sent that to me, I was a little embarrassed so I just kept quiet. Also another time about a year later, she must've said something else to him again, and he asked me about it once again. She came up with this out of nowhere. Apparently she mentioned something about lesbians to me, and I 'went real funny and quiet'. I don't recall her ever mentioning anything... I know I would've got funny about it and remembered it because of my feelings. But it didn't happen... I don't know why she's making up these things. 

• This one was a while ago, but once we were sitting by the computer at my place just doing stupid stuff, and she decided to prop her phone up and just video ourselves talking and saying funny things. Towards the end of the few minute long video, she grabbed my face and gave me the biggest kiss on the cheek, almost like it was a big urge. I loved it but I just acted like it was normal and ignored it. 

• She lived an hour away from me at one point, we were about 15. She used to come and stay at my place every few weekends, she would get the bus for an hour to get to me. I'd usually really want her to stay longer so I'd be cheeky and convince her to stay for another night. She would tell me she has work the next day (part time job). But then she would ring up and say she can't make it, almost every second or third weekend. There's only one person I'd do this sort of thing for, and that's someone I'm desperate to spend time with. 

• About a year ago, she had just come back home from visiting her family at the other side of the country. I decided to sleep with her in her room that night (we used to sleep in each other's rooms sometimes) because I was happy she was back and wanted to hang out. I also had another friend visiting me that week who is also kind of friends with her, so we all decided to bunk into her bed together. I was on one side, my friend was on the other, and she was in the middle. Was very uncomfortable to say the least, lol. I was pretty tired so I decided I might go to sleep, so I put my phone down and shut my eyes. They were having conversations, and it kinda prevented me from going to sleep. As weird as it sounds I just fake slept because I was trying to sleep anyway, hahaha. Then I decided I'm gonna cuddle up to her and see what she does (she would've assumed I was doing it in my sleep, so it didn't bother me). I didn't want to do too much, just subtle things. I wrapped my arms around her arm, put my head on her arm or shoulder, put my head all the way up near her neck. It sounds weird, I know, but I just wanted to see her reaction! She would move after a few minutes to get comfy again so I had to move too. She was just having conversations like normal with my friend while I was doing this, she was just acting like it was normal. Then I seen flash through my eyelids haha, assuming she'd taken a photo of me. Just assumed she was gonna send me a snapchat of myself with a face filter or something. Then, they talked for a hour or two and then went to bed. I woke up the next morning and the my other friend was looking at her snapchats and she opened the photo of me, and it was captioned 'cute'. I didn't get the snapchat, so she mustn't have wanted me to see it. 

• Once I decided to go hang out with her in her room. At this time she only had a single bed because she had just moved in, so it was a bit squishy. We were just being funny and taking stupid photos of each other, but I had just laid on the edge of her bed because there was nowhere else. Somehow I slithered my way up onto the bed more and I was literally laying between her legs, but I didn't even realise at first. We were just laying messing around though, it wasn't anything sexual. I kind of was comfortable and of course I liked it, and she seemed to like it too. We weren't doing anything, I was just sitting there. But she didn't seem to mind, it would've been very uncomfortable but she didn't ask me to move or anything. 

• She sometimes mentions that she dislikes lesbians. But, I do that too. I know it seems like such a terrible thing to say, but I only do it to hide the fact that I have feelings for her. I wonder if she says it for the same reason. 

• I don't know if this is a lesbian thing, but she did watch all seasons of Orange is the New Black... just a thought ;). She also done a school assessment about gay marriage rights. 

• Back in the tumblr days, I was just going through some of my friend's blogs and stuff. I decided to have a look at hers, and I was just looking at her likes (which I remember once she was telling me how she thought they were private) and there was a hour something long lesbian porn video in there... I never mentioned it to her. 




So, let me know what you think. Do you think she feels the same way or a similar way? Let me know why or why not.

26,"My parents have always been very protective and strict. Typical authoritarian parents that like to control as much as possible. I've been ok with it for most of my life because I thought they'd end up trusting me later. Long story short, they do not. Despite never having done anything dangerous or risky, they have made it clear they don't trust me to make my own decisions with most things. One of their big things rn is that they don't think I should date and openly express that I'm not ready. Reasons are things like ""not old enough to be alone with a guy"" and ""you'll start failing classes.""
I'm in college and mostly financially dependent on them. When I'm home for the summers, I stay with them and thus have to follow their house rules. They also get to monitor me a lot more than when I'm at school a few hours away. But they're seriously the kind of parents that make me share my location so they can know where I am anytime. 
I recently began dating someone back home and thought it would just be a casual summer thing, but am realizing I care about him a lot more than that and might be willing to do long distance when I go back to school. My parents don't know I'm seeing him.
Basically I want to know how I should get around the fact that my parents will not approve (nothing to do with the guy, they'd probably love him actually). I know they'd make a really big deal and basically I don't even want to imagine what would happen if they found out. They just don't trust me. Our relationship is already strained but I do care about them supporting me in general and also have to worry about being dependent while still in school. This is really the only thing keeping me from making it official with him. On the one hand, my parents won't really know about him coming to visit me at school, but what about when I come to visit him? I'm just trying to weigh the benefits and risks.

33,"I'm just posting this here in hopes of finding some guidance

Currently I'm living in Alberta, in a tiny city with very little opportunity at 20 years old still living with my parents, I'm healthy aside from long term clinical depression (Who ISN'T depressed nowadays?), 0$ in my bank account, my only education being high school and my only work experience being with my parent's company as a janitor. There is very little work here, and I've been refreshing Indeed.com, and other city related job websites for the past 5 month, as well as handed out around 100 physical resumes in person to no avail. I've had absolutely luck in landing any job. I have also tried free city counselling, and an employment center, both of which aren't helping.

My issue is I cannot move to a larger city because I lack a vehicle, money, and independence. And I can't gain any because I can't find work. I want change, and I want to start my life, but I need help, and I can't find it nor can I afford counselling. Free city counselling has three month wait-times between sessions, making it pointless.

I have an interest in working with computers. Especially an office environment, with entry level data entry jobs. I want to explore other computer-related jobs. But I don't know what's smart, or what's profitable, or what industries to avoid. I've been hoping to land a job at a hardware store, like Best Buy, or Visions, to help me better understand the different industries, but as I pointed out earlier, I cannot find any work. I'll be lucky to find a fast food position.

Can anybody please help me out? Can anybody recommend what I should try or look into? Any information on potential computer courses to look into? Entry level computer fields? Any other Reddit threads I can ask? 

I want to pursue work that I will enjoy and I want to finally make my own money and gain independence. I know it's broad and selfish. But I'm totally lost and desperate, and I have nobody to turn to for help.

TL;DR: I'm 20, have no post secondary, no work experience, no vehicle, no money, no independence, wasting away in my parent's basement while they're losing their house. My small city is crap and has no work, I can't move away. Can't afford counselling. I'm interested in working with computers, but don't know where to start. ai need guidance or advice. Help, please.

It used to really get me down, but I just got my doctorate, I've started an amazing job that I love, and I'm having a great time just living my life now.

I have a really solid group of friends from undergrad who are fun, amazing people. They all just happen to be coupled up, married, engaged, etc. I love hanging out with them, but more often than not, a select few of them will bring up my single status while also kind of gloating about their own relationship.

The kicker? She is with my best friends older brother. He doesn't know we speak... and my best friend knows only of us being close friends. We are both single parents as well... so a lot of factors come into play. She has expressed her feelings for me as I have for her. Its something we talk about frequently. We've never kissed or had sex or anything like that, but we have spoken of it and what it would be like...and typically if a woman is involved I immediately walk away. With her, I just cant seem too. We see eachother at a weekly event where all 4 of us plus others are there so i try to avoid too much contact with her to avoid situations... but when her and I spend time together as just us? Its fire. Since I cant speak to many of my close ones about this... I was hoping some strangers of reddit could express some insight. Thanks in advance",30Jul2017,1

If *I* took him in her weekend/day without notice to another city I'm certain there would be an amber alert. She will be back tomorrow but it's still absolute bullshit that she can get away with this.

Should I call the police or what, I am so furious at how hard our shitty policies fail men in this crap system.

Any other men been through this? I need some cooling down and I'm worried about my son and miss him, she hasn't ever done this and I don't fear his safety it's just disheartening not knowing where you child is and pretty much having no rights slammed in your face because your a ""dad"".

45,"Coming from an Asian household, we have many customs and rules. One of them is to always pay for everything, as nothing is ever free in life. We feel as it is very rude to ""freeload"" off of someone. If you have received something for free, you must repay it in some way. 

My boyfriend's (we have been dating for three years) parents invited me to Walt Disney World for one week. They are part of a time share/club in which they pay a yearly fee to go to Disney. The specifics: They pay $500 a year to have two weeks of vacation for a family of four. Because we are only going for a week, that makes it $250 if broken down numerically. They said that the only thing that I would have to pay for is flights. 

I knew right away this wouldn't be agreeable with my mother, as she fully believes that everything needs to be paid for. I asked my boyfriend if his mother could text my mom, to ask for permission or to discuss finances. As a disclosure, I was fully prepared to pay for everything myself as it is my vacation, not hers. My mother was furious that I would do such a thing, as naturally, she would say no, however that makes her look like the bad guy. One of her many lectures mentioned that if my boyfriend and I broke up, by going on this trip for ""free"" could be used against me. In other words, it's like I would be owing them for the rest of my life. I understand that argument partially, however I think that's quite a pessimistic thing to say. 

After a very LONG lecture, my mom in a very mad tone said, ""Do whatever you want, it is up to you."" I sort of got the green light to say yes or no to this trip, but I knew that my mom wanted me to say no. My boyfriend's parents needed an answer right away to book the rooms as they were filling up, so I hesitantly said yes. 

So here is where I need advice. Do I go on this trip for free (I still need to pay for flights) or do I pay for everything myself? As a side note, I'm a pretty broke college student, so I can't even afford it. His parents really want me to go, invited me, and offered to pay. Money is no issue for them, and they said to treat it as a gift. Obviously I would like to go for free, but the Asian in me knows that the right thing to do is pay. So if I pay, I will be broke, which leads me to owing them money for a very very long time as the whole trip including food will cost me around one thousand dollars. ",30Jul2017,1
47,"Hi. I really don't know how to start this so I'll get right to the point. My really close family friends that I've known for years recently have been having some problems and later in this relationship the wife told me that the husband is cheating on her with some other women all the way across world. She said she knew this because they are (husband and other party) have exchanged pictures (don't know what pics didn't go in detail) she knows they exchanged pics because when she was backing up the phone into the pc she saw pics of another women and multiple of them. and also she says that later late at night when he thinks the wife is sleeping the husband speaks to the other party on the phone usually like late in the night (2am she said was the usual time) and I guess the wife's eldest son saw these pictures of the other party and is really confused and didn't know how to react the mom just replied with delete them there nothing. But I guess the son is confused and angry about the pictures cause he doesn't know what to think of them and he probably has his own speculation on them, he also has been acting strange. And now the wife wants me to break the news to the eldest son technically saying oh your dad is cheating on your mom. The eldest son is like 14-15 years of age but I don't know a way to tell him can someone give me advice or ways to break the news to him

48,"I work with an organization that hires intern every semester. I'm a young millennial and recently graduated college and lucky to find a job directly out of college. There's an intern in town for a number of weeks, potentially to soon be living here. He appears to be chill, mellow and reserved. Right away, I can tell he has an introvert personality. 

Now, I value friendships and every friendship I encounter, I try and take them seriously. While growing up and going through my school years, I never had a lot of friends. While I do have friends, they're not as close as I want them to be. Therefore, I'm searching for that one guy I can actually call a best-friend and brother. Not a boyfriend because I'm not gay and currently have a girlfriend. But, a friend that I can hold long chats with, meet up and grab a bite to eat, and do what suits us best.

I had the chance to grab his Snapchat and we had a quick convo. My responses were quite distant from each other because we were chatting while working. But, I got left on ""read"" with my last reply.

I'm not the one to message someone if they're not willing to message me. I believe that it's only fair to treat people just how you want to be treated. In other words, if you want to chat, you'd reply or hit the person up and vice-versa.

I don't know what to do and I'm going a little insane inside my head. I don't know if I'm over thinking everything or there's something I did wrong. This is the moment I wish I had the ability to read people's mind to see where I fall in their every endless mind.

Thing is my sister is doing pretty poorly in all her classes and we've just asked her to try her best and do whatever she can -- we've even enrolled her in additional classes after school to help. Today she just sent me this video and told me to watch it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8 - tldr - education system sucks and not everyone needs to do good in school). 

And though I do agree with the facts in the video. The education system and the mentality of everyone back home is not something that can change over night. I don't know what to say to her -- Even I feel some basic education is really a necessity for her and she really needs to pass her classes. She can definitely choose whether or not to do a undergrad and pursue anything she wants after high school -- but I feel like a high school education is something she really needs -- and my parents will never let her drop out of high school either.

59,"So I have tendonitis in my forearms and ankles, which is not a fixable issue. (It can be treated to cause it to stop, but can easily be triggered again)  I have it due to extensive drawing throughout childhood to now and, somewhat currently, work. The tendon inflames, and causes pain, but nothing too serious, and it doesn't inhibit me from working. 

The issue has come up at work, but it has never caused me to miss a day of work, or to cause me to not do my job properly, I've learned how to live with it. And since my managers never used to see it as an issue, they made decisions to not file incident reports (because he hates the paper work, but that's another story) and I've never made claims for workman' s comp because of it. But because of it, my managers have decided to take shifts from me and will not allow me to work as much unless I have a doctor's note. But it has never been a reported there. 

Due to it not actually being reported, are they truly allowed to make me go to the doctor (for what they claim is a work injury, but I wouldn't get work comp) to get a note, or am I allowed to work as normal because it is a preexisting issue that they allowed me to work with for 2+ years anyway?

75,"So to start off before you expect the usual tirade of depression that and anxiety this, as much as I would love this to be a thing I could treat with pills it isn't. It's a feeling more... hazy... like a lingering ghost of perpetual laziness. Also this post will be quite jumbled as I'm kind of writing this from nowhere at 2 am.

At the time of this post I am a week away from moving away to the city for a 2 year, IT and Sys Admin course at a local college, for up to a year prior, I am an (almost) 21 year old, overweight, male loser, with no friends (more like an odd gagel of acquaintances) and no social presence.

A year ago I graduated from a very short 1 year Game Design course at a small college in the city. Trying to find work was difficult afterwards, I wasn't even looking for industry work just something to pay the bills. After 4 months of job hunting in the city, finding nothing and costing on the last of my savings I met the end of my lease and with no money to keep me afloat I had to move back home. Once home I continued job hunting... another 4 months pass by and I still haven't found a stable job, I was hired for numerous jobs but due to a myriad of reasons ranging from a mass layoff of the staff to being fired for incompetence I never kept any of them for more than a month.

During all of my down time I promised myself that I would have a playable... something developed by the end of the year. I never ended up working on anything steady, I'd get a month into designing a project half-assedly then lose all interest. I'd make half of a minigame or something for mobile, and drop it when I couldn't figure something out and the passion was gone. my development skills have decreased to almost nothing and i feel like I've wasted everything my professors taught me and my own time.

In addition to game development I wanted to improve myself as a person and learn a myriad of new things, the first thing on the list is weight loss. I started calorie counting and losing weight with the help of the community over at r/loseit, I kept this up from March to  the beginning of this month, and now I've lost all drive for it. I haven't lost a single pound in a month, I haven't been counting my calories, just a general failure.

I also wanted to learn german, I kept at this pretty constantly for about two months before i started completely neglecting it for weeks on end.

Also in the meantime I took a local driving course through the government, and took my driver's test twice, both of which ended in failure after 4 months of regular training, after which the program was cut and I got no other chances, and without a vehicle of my own I had nothing to try again with.

I've basically spent the past month holed up in my room playing video games, and even those i'm not enjoying all that much, pretty much the only thing i enjoy now-a-days is playing with my cats.

I'm worried I'll move for college attempt to start all these things back up again, then just do nothing like I usually do, I want to develop games in my spare time, I want to learn to speak german, I want to be healthy and fit, I want to ahve my drivers liscence, I want friends, I want somewhere I belong even a little bit,; but it just feels like there's a big fat monkey made of melancholy and laziness draped over my shoulder doing it's absolute best to stop me from being a decent person.

80,"One of my good friends and coworkers recently had a spontaneous marraige to her girlfriend of 2 months. On the night of their wedding, after quite a bit of drinking, she blurted out that they wanted to have a child together (each already has a child, so this would be their 3rd), and asked if my boyfriend would donate his sperm. We were both taken completely off guard, so we told her we would talk it over and let her know. We talked it over privately the next day, and decided we would not feel comfortable with it, but that we'd take some time to make sure it was the right decision before telling them. We have been together for 4 years and are just getting ready to get married, and possibly start a family ourselves.
The next week, we were texting eachother to arrange a time for me to pick up a matress that I was buying from her, and she made a joke stating that I could pay her in my bf's sperm. I told her that we had not had enough time to properly discuss it, and would need more time. 
It's been a few days since then, and she just texted me asking for our answer.

I am honestly so confused about how to talk to her about this. It bothers me that she is asking something so important from us but doesn't seem to be taking it seriously at all (how can she think it's okay to ask me for an answer with a text?!), without even attempting to have a serious conversation about it.  I don't even know how to respond. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I also refuse to treat the question with less gravity than it deserves. Maybe if our answer was ""yes"" I would have no problem responding, but I don't know how to respond and tell her that our answer is ""no"" through a text message. I also don't want to string her along waiting for an answer, but I feel trapped and frozen. Any advice would be appreciated.

88,"Last weekend I went drinking with the boys. We had a fun time, played some video games, went to a bar with some foreign girls who were going home in 3 days. Two friends ask me to wingman,
 so I drink a little less to help them out. However the one with a girlfriend (We'll call him Albert) starts to get really friendly with one of the foreign girls, (she will be ""Betty"") As the night goes on we dance a bit, some drink a wee more than they should have. (my two friends get no girls; maybe they were too drunk, maybe I'm a bad wingman, it's irrelevent right now.) 

Eventually we go back to an apartment to crash. It belongs to Albert and a mutual friend (who will be Casper), we have gathered a great group of people at this point and they slowly begin to sleep. Now I/Casper see Albert go off into his bedroom with Betty, she didn't come back out. 

The next day Casper and I get up early to get some fresh air, eat breakfast, and nurse our hangovers. I mention to Casper that I saw Albert go to bed with Betty, he replies that he knows. Then he tells me that I cannot tell Albert's girlfriend (she can be Danielle) Now firstly I think that he doesn't want me to say anything because he's good friends with Albert, he then tells me that Albert cheated on his last girlfriend as well. (this confirms my suspicions). Then he reminds me that Danielle's brother (Evan) will be furious and beat Albert down hard. (Evan goes to the gym every day and is at least 6' tall, lovable if he likes you but tougher than a Nokia.)

I'm now in a predicament. I'm friends with Albert, Casper, Danielle, and Evan. I don't know Betty, and she's gone now. 

I have many things to consider now...

1. Albert was drunk

2. Albert has a record of cheating

3. I'm friends with Albert

4. Casper has dealt with this before but said nothing
5. Casper will know it's me if it gets out because he knows I dislike the situation immensely.
6. Danielle is a good friend but emotionally unstable.
7. Evan Will beat up Albert (he does deserve it, however the beat down will be quick and brutal, Albert stands no chance. I will be the catalyst of his pain.)
8. Evan is also a good friend.
9. I think I can't be friends with all these people anymore. If I say something, it'll probably get out and some won't like me anymore. However If I say nothing, I will remember the event every time I see Albert, Evan or Danielle.
10. It's possible I live in ""Mywittythrowawayname Show"" and it's a soap opera, if so, should I watch Coronation Street for advice instead of asking reddit?

What should I do?

89,"Okay. So I'm 19, this guy is 17. We met on a meme app called Pictophile. This guy was basically a fuck boy. Still is but isn't as awful. Well anyways. This app is like a social media for memes. I had a picture of myself as my profile image and it looked relatively good. 

I am a pro at deceptions. I am obese, at least 120 pounds overweight, I've got a massive double chin, and I know ways of angling a camera to look like I'm thin. Not the old myspace camera angle, but something subtle. 
I'm pretty ugly irl. 

Anyways. With that being said, this guy saw my image and thought I was hot, so he started messaging me with intentions to flirt. 
He flirted a bit but I kinda scolded him and he apologized for trying to flirt with me without even knowing me for more than 2 minutes. 

Well he started really opening up to me a month afterward about how bad he was feeling. He had flirted with 4 other girls and 3 of them were falling for him thinking that he was serious. He felt guilty about it, and I gave him advice and told him to tell the truth to all of them. He sent me screenshots of their responses. They all stopped messaging him afterward which he was a little upset but he felt better in the end. We kept talking more and more. He tells me everything. He says that I'm the only one who's seen his ugly side and his mistakes and still accepts him. 

He's called me beautiful a few times and after a few months he's said things like ""everything you do is just so precious."" And ""I cherish our relationship."" 
And later he's been saying things like ""if we were to get married, I'd want you to be a stay at home Mom and I would bring in money to support the both of us and such"" 

We aren't together. But I have grown small feelings for him. Well recently I've told him that I was fat. He obviously didn't believe me. 
So I sent him a picture of my stomach. 

His response was ""you'd be beautiful if you were thinner"" 
And now he's been talking about his dream girlfriend or wife and he says things like ""I want her to have a nice waist and smallish boobs and a big butt."" 

And he's also been saying stuff like ""I'd date you if you were smaller"" 
Or ""you're pretty for a bbw""

I know that weight is pretty important in a relationship, but it kinda makes me sad that now that he's seen my stomach, I'm less attractive. Which I should've expected it lol. But still. It's been a few months and we've talked every single day. At least 4-5 hours a day we spend texting. Every once in a while we'll call and talk on the phone. But ever since I shown him my body, he's stopped taking time to text me. He'll even leave me on read. 


I don't have any intention to date him. Although I did grow a small crush on him. But I fear that if he puts looks over personality like that, I'd stress myself out every day to try and be completely perfect for him. I don't know. I just feel like a relationship should be more about growing comfortable with someone and falling in love with them. 

I have a hard time losing weight. It's one of my worse nightmares of getting so obese that I'm disabled. I have a weird eating disorder. Somedays I eat too much and other days I don't eat enough. So my body is in a state of confusion I guess. It thinks it's being starved so it holds everything. I'm no health doctor tho obviously. 

But are my feelings childish or legitimate? Any advice besides losing weight? 

Thanks",30Jul2017,0

95,"Very briefly, this is my first time using Reddit. I figured my situation MIGHT be rare but maybe there's someone here who could relate with what I'm going through. 

Necessary background info: 
. Mom is 52 y/o

. Mom's Boyfriend is 27 y/o

. Mom's Boyfriend has been living with us since I was a junior in high school (I'm in college now, just finished my Freshman year)

. Mom's Boyfriend is attending college now too (an Arts college)

. I am 19 y/o 

. I have a relationship with my biological father, but my parents never spoke with each other nor properly negotiated custody over me since I was born. My mom practically made it so that she was a single parent (whoa, hostile much). 


The dilemma: I want to keep believing my mom's boyfriend is a nice guy. Don't get me wrong, he is. He cleans around the house, does chores, is pro-fitness, loves and encourages my mom and I to travel and explore nature, blah blah blah. He is a good influence obviously, but the more I analyze the situation, the more I begin to think that he is just in it for the ride and I'll explain. 


I recently had a talk (very touchy/emotional) with my mom regarding her relationship status with boyfriend (let's refer to him as Bob). She says that they are not together; that if either finds someone who they are truly fit for, then they are free to part ways when the time comes... But it's like they've gotten TOO comfortable with their current situation. I fear that my mom is getting older and potentially missing out on a better relationship with someone her age (who can reciprocate paying bills and spoil her). 


Bob currently has his own $11/hr job in retail, has his own hobbies and interests, is kid-friendly (he plays with my nephew), and has taught me many things a dad would (how to snowboard, drive, mingle, etc.). Bob wasn't always this way. He used to be unemployed, would sleep all the time, DJ, drink and invite friends over to OUR apartment, and I was the only one doing chores and cleaning up after his mess. He's an enabler. He has enabled my mom and I to go travel, to be more active, to be real and less superficial; and even enabled my mom to buy a car that he raves about.... However, it bothers me how I (and especially my mom) credit him for all this stuff as if my mom isn't the one funding our trips that Bob plans, for instance. It bothers me how my mom asks Bob for advice and insight even though she is the older and supposedly more experienced adult. 


We moved from a 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment to a junior bedroom/1 bathroom apartment to accommodate my college move, yet Bob still lives with us. My mom and Bob sleep in one bed in the junior bedroom while I have to sleep on the couch. As a mom with a 19 y/o daughter in college, my mom is putting her boyfriend's needs and comfort before mine. I have no bed, barely any closet space, and I have no privacy nor quiet space for studying and just general alone time. I know I sound ungrateful, but it pisses me off thinking that this dude is just going to live with us until it's convenient for him to leave (once he's finished with college, which btw is in the area of where we currently live, and once he's financially stable enough to live on his own). 


My mom treats her boyfriend like he's her own son. She feeds him, houses him, pays all the bills, let's him use her car which he encouraged her to get (maybe b/c according to his plan, he'd get to drive his dream car), and he even gets to travel for free because he pitches the idea to go to national parks or out of the country and my mom is automatically on board and pays for ALL our expenses. When I talked with my mom about this she said, ""Treat it as though you're asking a friend if they want to go and travel. Since you're inviting them, it's customary to pay for the travel expenses."" 


I don't know about you, but I think my mom is in a toxic sugar mama relationship... What can and should I do to confront the situation? I want to drop out of my college that I currently attend, move out of my mom's, and maybe live with my biological dad and attend school there (Both my parents live in different states). 

What I'm afraid of...

1.) If I move out, I'm afraid Bob will continue to take advantage of my mom and just be there for the ride. Once again, he doesn't contribute financially but he is supportive (almost like a son)

2.) If I decide to move out and tell my mom it's because of Bob living with us, I'm afraid giving her this ultimatum will make her resent me. It's like I'm making her choose between her daughter or her love and happiness. 

I'm not close-minded. I'm pretty accepting of the insignificance of age in relationships (not like 30 y/o dating 12 y/o... please don't twist my words), but part of me is suspicious of this relationship. It's empowering that my mom is the kind of person that doesn't believe in conventions like men financially supporting women, but at the same time I feel like the treatment should be reciprocated. It's a balance that should not intersect with gender formalities. Thoughts? 

Also, feel free to ask me for more information about the situation. I'm not sure if I was specific enough. It's a very long story (almost 4 years of details).  


(p.s. I think since I'm 19, I'm still at an impressionable age. I could be potentially misguided if I continue to live in this environment? Maybe I'm just being paranoid?)

96,"I recently quit smoking with the help of a douche flute (vape pen). I work night shifts and got pretty comfortable using my vape in my cubicle area.  My job has a no tobacco policy on the property that includes electronic cigarettes. I knew it was risky, but figured I was in the clear because there are very few people passing through the area at night.

I just received an email stating that I have a meeting with management and HR about a policy violation and I know it's related to this vape pen.

I also have an interview for a big promotion coming up and will not be able to accept the position if I receive any disciplinary action.

Here's my options, as I see them:

1. Deny it completely. This one is tough because I don't know what info came from how many sources.

2. Own it and accept the outcome.  I know this is the clear cut high road.. but I also know that I have worked my butt off for this promotion.

3. Explain that the liquid in the vape pen is 0 nicotine and tobacco free and play dumb.  This option is borderline true, insofar as I do occasionally use 0 nicotine juice because I enjoy the flavor.

I knew I was bending the rules or outright breaking them. On the flip side of the coin, I am great at my job and I think I have a great shot at this promotion.

Then she suddenly snaps (I've gotten good at telling when her mood has shifted) and she started telling me what I had to do this morning (in a really pissed off tone). Okay cool beans, I try to keep calm when she gets like this. But then she went right up to my face, gritted her teeth while snarling ""don't act like it's such a big deal"" and put her hands up to my neck. She's been acting like this for years but it seems to be getting worse. Then 20 minutes later she was acting as if nothing happened? 

I've always been on the ropes about what to do when I've left for college regarding my family because my mom acts like this most of the time and my sister doesn't really care for me unless she needs something (dad died when I was young) so that's it.

126,"So I got a job at a supermarket about 6 months ago and made friends with a fellow cashier. I live with my grandparents and my cousin, and I noticed that she talked about how much she adored and loved my cousin. This was what she always talked about.

For the first month or two while I was there she was dating someone else that she was having issues with. But as soon as they broke up it was all 'ur cousin is my favorite person in the world'. 

About a month ago my cousin and her started 'talking' and rumor has it she was talking to others too. About a week into it my cousin is getting frustraighted because she keeps playing mind games with him like 'do u like me?' And he'd say yes for her to only snap back 'no u don't' and so on.

130,"Dear Andrew, 

I'd like to start by saying I think you have been a great significant other and I am grateful to have spent the last 5 years with you. 

Now that I have had some time to process my thoughts and feeling I think I've connected the dots and understand why I may have seemed upset. And no, it was not out of jealousy because there were girls at the party. I think why I seemed upset is a re-accruing  theme I have brought up several times in our relationship. Again, I usually brush these feelings aside because I understand you are a medical resident and are very busy. I am trying to be patient in hopes thing will be different when you are done. I do appreciate the things you do for me such as texting me good morning and asking about my day. 

However, I don't feel like there is enough effort to plan doing things together, just the two of us. Most of the time we spend alone is having sex or watching television. A lot of the time we spend is with your family and sometimes your friends, such as a couple weeks ago when we were hanging out and Mike and your brother came over to play sports with you for a couple hours while I was over. I like your family but don't want to date them. I understand that they are important people in your life too and you need to spend time with them. I'd much rather spend just a few hours with you then 6 or 7 with half of them being with your family. 

We have talked before about planning regular dates each month and switching who plans it. I feel like I put effort into planning things for us to do but it isn't reciprocated. Such as recently for your birthday, a month before that the escape room. It's been your turn for a few months. 

A few weeks ago you asked what we were going to do that day so I found an art fair in Royal Oak. I didn't feel like you were with me because you spent almost half the time we were there talking on the phone with Sam. For special events, it would be nice to do things. I have made plans to do something for your birthday every year and we have not had plans for my birthday once. Not even dinner, although your family did take me out for dinner a couple times. I understand you couldn't take me our the last 2 years due to fasting. I didn't ever want to mention this because I didn't want to sound like an ungrateful jerk so I usually brushed it aside and then felt very guilty for feeling this way. I am grateful that you seemed to put a little extra effort in this year by asking what kind of cake I wanted. 

I found the open houses to look at and planned when to see them. I not as recently since you've been coming to your parents house more often and I don't like cooking there, but effort into meal planning and buying groceries to make food for us. I realize planning for things is a way I show love and a way I need to be shown too. However, maybe we just have different love languages. 

I feel like even when we hang out you are texting or making plans with your brother for after I leave. It seems like there are more plans to do things with your friends than with me, almost every weekend. I know you are capable of planning things because you seemed able to plan a trip to Toronto to visit Sam and Nadia. I don't want to bring up the past too much, but that's why I got upset in Chicago. I made all that effort to plan a trip for us since I was going to tell my parents about our relationship the following week. Right after we got off the train you were texting Nick to make plans to meet him for lunch and then your friend Adam. I of course apologize again for my part, but am just bringing this example up because I feel like it connects the dots for me to the current re-accruing situation. I feel like your friends are prioritized sometimes. I feel like a side kick just going along with what you have going on in your life. 

This causes concern for me in the future if we get married. Will we just go about our normal routines and you'll go out with your friends to watch fights most weekends like it's been for a while? Yeah we say we're going to do all of these things once married but I'm not so confident it will happen. I've mentioned before several times that this is something important to me.  ",30Jul2017,21

So my dilemma is, that I can either workout, and not improve my back (not make it worse, but not helping it recover faster) and impress my exes, my friends, and everyone, OR, not workout, and just heal for my volleyball season....

136,"I'm 14 and I'm always being stared at by men. I'm so fed up with it. My friends tell me to stop dressing so racy, when the only thing I wear is a tight top and sports pants, or clothing like that! I don't wear skirts or tights! I am quite curvy, I have large breasts and a large backside and thick thighs, but this doesn't make it okay for much older men to eye ogle me all the time.

When I walk at the shops, men usually glance at my chest, then away. Sometimes they look at my waist, legs, or even my feet (which I don't know why). Older men tend to smile at me creepily and continue staring at me, EVEN IF I'M LOOKING AT THEM. One situation which really upset me was pretty recent. I was looking at some albums, and an older man WITH A CHILD, literally, looked at my chest, then looked down slowly. So basically he eyed me up and down. Then, when I looked at him in shock he just raised his eyebrows and walked away. 

It's a drainer. 

At one point, my mum caught a guy staring at me, and in the middle of EVERYBODY, she forced me to put on my jacket in anger and shock. I can't blame her, but it really upset me.

I'm struggling with the biggest decision of my life so far.

I've been interning with the national lab for the last 2 years. I have a chance to return back to lab, after 8 months of virtual work back at my home institution to finish and defend my phd thesis, and interview for a postdoc position. Something I've wanted for a long time.

Now I also have an offer for a senior analyst position at a very prestigious company. The compensation between the analyst position and potential postdoc is relatively the same.

After defending my thesis, I'm quickly becoming aware that my family has been struggling for a while now. I guess they didn't want me too concerned and add more stress to my already stressful phd experience. We are struggling very badly and the family needs all the help it can get. More importantly, the kids need a lot of support as it's affecting their schoolings and social life.

Here's the thing: the postdoc is very far away. The job is only 2 hours away. Do I decide to move away and go back to the internship so I can apply and interview for the postdoc or do I just accept the offer from the company and remain close to my family so I can help out?

143,"My husband, daughter, and I are moving into an in-law apartment above my parents that my aunt and uncle are leaving this upcoming week. My aunt is often frail/sick and my uncle is kind of a dick so the apartment was rarely (if ever) cleaned. I haven't seen too much of it but both my parents are pretty shocked at how gross the apartment is. My father is willing to do some cosmetic repairs as necessary however cleaning is mostly being left to my husband and I in exchange for a reduced rent the first month.


We could probably hire a cleaning service but we would rather get it done ourselves. I have basics but I think this will call for some heavier duty stuff. The floors are all linoleum/vinyl.

How should I tackle this? What should I keep in mind to clean that I might skip over? What products should I get/use? I have WalMart, Target, Dollar Tree, Home Depot, and Lowes all within a reasonable distance. The budget for cleaning supplies could go to maybe $60-$80 or perhaps a little more.

So I'm part of a band with three other guys. I'm pretty good friends with two of them , but the other one I don't know all that well, even though we've been a band for more than a year now. I've tried to converse with him (let's call him the drummer), but our conversations don't usually go anywhere. The three of them, however, are good friends, and have a whole friend group that I'm basically just a fringe member of, or not part of at all. I was the one who introduced them, so its not like they've known each other for a long time. This has honestly always made me kind of jealous.

But anyways, lately things have been kind of different. My two friends in the band have asked me to hang out a little bit with them, the drummer, and a few of their other friends from their friend group. Now, this has been pretty cool, and I had a great time. The drummer basically told me he liked spending time with me, and I thought I was finally breaking the ice. 

There's another element to this. A few weeks ago, my friend convinced me to download Snapchat. I'd been avoiding it, but decided I'd give it try. Somehow, I managed to rack up the courage to send the drummer a snap. I was trying to start a chat. Anyway, this led to a brief conversation, but nothing too interesting. Anyway, sometime later I get invited to hang out again. This time, I feel that things didn't go as well. I never felt the same close feeling I did on the previous occasion, and I've become paranoid that I've annoyed them somehow. And so here I am

Finally, here's the problem at hand. I want to be friends with the drummer, and do stuff with his group of friends. But now I'm just not sure how to approach the problem. I've sent him a few snaps, but he's never sent anything to me. I was thinking of just going out and asking him if he wants to hang out. Knowing the situation, would this be weird? Is it worth the risk, or should I try something else?

Please give me some advice if you can, thanks",30Jul2017,1
146,"My period is a week late, and for the past few days I've been experiencing many pregnancy symptoms such as severe breast tenderness, bloating, and frequent need to pee. BUT I'M A VIRGIN. I looked up reasons besides pregnancy for my missed period. Most reasons such as new medication, diet and exercise change, do not apply to me. The only thing that made sense was stress, but that doesn't explain why my breast have been so tender + other symptoms. 

My mind keeps coming up with ridiculous scenarios such as rape &amp; being pregnant with the second coming of Jesus. I know many girls have these crazy thoughts when their periods are late, but the breast tenderness thing has freaked me out. Should I be worried &amp; go to the doctor or calm down?

He came into my room, said ""you're being too loud"" and started hitting me and beating me for almost a minute. I'm shaking and choking from tears right now. I can't go on like this. I grew up with my older brother constantly abusing me physically and mentally. I always have to hide my bruises and eyes swollen from crying when I go somewhere, for example, to school. I can't defend myself, I'm really tiny compared to him. He works out and his punches hurt very much. He also always says how he wants to kill someone, how he hates people, how he wants to get ""revenge"" and many other things like that. He went to the therapist, took pills for depression for a long time and it didn't help at all. The situation is even worse now. Once when I was, I think, 10 years old and home alone with him, we were in the kitchen and he pulled out a knife and started threatening me. He didn't do anything because I quickly put on my shoes and went outside. I'm terrified. My parents know. He beats them too. They don't wanna call the police because they ""don't wanna ruin his life"". I really don't know what to do. Can someone please give me an advice? I would call the police but my family is gonna have a really bad reaction.

Edit: Whenever my brother hits me and I tell my parents, they are like ""Oh we're sorry that happened, that's awful, he won't do it again, we can't do anything about this situation, we feel helpless"" and yet he always does it again. They are very mad at him for doing that, but won't do anything about it.

Edit 2: My parents and brother are having a big fight right now. He's hitting my mom and she's screaming. My dad is on the verge of calling 911. How do I convince him to do it? I'm desperate and scared to death. 

Edit 3: The fight stopped and they calmed down. It's 9pm here. My parents are bringing him to a hospital tomorrow morning and they told me not to call 911 yet. If he doesn't go tomorrow, I'm calling the 911 myself. It stops soon. Even if it means my parents are getting mad at me.

Edit 4: My parents changed their mind and they decided not to do anything because they think it's ""just a phase that will go away"". I forgot to mention that my brother is suicidal and he *really* needs medical help. So I don't think calling the *police* is the right thing yet. But this situation needs to be reported to someone ASAP. Since my parents don't wanna help, I have to think of a plan myself.",30Jul2017,110
148,"I know using mary jane is not always a good idea, not here for anything on that.

So I have two friends, we'll call them Jane and John (a girl and a guy)

Both of them have been interested in each other (I introduced them, Jane I've known in high school, John I met at community college, or TAFE in Australia). I introduced the two and despite feeling like a third wheel, I agreed to hang out with them to smoke some cones.

Both of them need several to get high, while as I don't use weed very often, it takes very little. Being an idiot, I had just too much, and suddenly started panicking . I was legitimately thinking I was going to have a heart attack and die. I go outside to calm down and while John and Jane watch tv, I message them to say I'm outside greening out. The response I get was 'lol' followed by a gif. I would rather have alcohol poisoning than go through that again.

I then go to bed in the loungeroom (where John was supposed to sleep), and manage to sleep it off. When I wake up the next day at 9, I wait for them to wake up and once it hits 12, I knock on the door of Janes bedroom and find them sleeping in the same bed. I know that it doesn't imply they got up to no good, all Jane told me was that they kissed and that was it. We established that I would sleep with her as she has a boyfriend.

Weeks later, I've only just been informed of a bunch of shenanigans going on regarding John and a bunch of Janes friends eg. John sleeping and kissing other girls, Jane getting jealous even though she has a boyfriend. Despite that, what kills me is the fact they left me alone while freaking out (on top of a mental illness that probably didn't help) . Both of them are really close friends but other friends are really dissapointed in them. John had no compassion or remorse when I told him. What to do?? It's making me feel like they didn't care. Do I have the right to be upset?

Tl;dr : two of my friends left me alone while I greened out and now they're hanging without me and causing drama",30Jul2017,0

151,"I need some advice to talk to about my problem. But first, Please allow me to share my story:

Back when I was in high school, there was this girl that I fell in love with. I never talked to her but I knew it was love since I couldn't describe the feeling I got every time I see her. She never had a boyfriend (as far as I know) until almost half of our school year. I wanted to tell her how much I loved her but I couldn't since I was (still am) a coward. One of the fondest memory that I will always cherish with her was that during our graduation ceremony, her friend sort of teased her with me to come sit next to me which she did for some reason. Back then, I felt that I had a shot with her but I was too afraid to take it. A few months after the aforementioned event and it was our summer vacation, I couldn't help it anymore and I finally got the guts to tell her how I felt through a drunken message on facebook. I was expecting to be turned down (which would have been better) but instead, she added me as a friend. I didn't add any special meaning to it, but, I recall her personality to be as somebody who would reject another guy since it happened one time to another guy. Another factor why I couldn't pursue her was I got a threatening message from her bf that it broke me down to the verge of cutting myself and almost drinking poison. This happened almost eight years ago. Fast forward to now, I saw her working as a waitress in a restaurant and I wanted to talk to her or to approach her but I was too scared. The reason why I wanted to talk to her was perhaps ask if I had a shot back then or not. I know that you guys are probably thinking that I should move on or to forget about her, and believe me, I tried the best I can but for some reason, I just can't. I tried to woe other girls and met somebody but I wasn't able to successfully do so and for some reason my mind always reverts to thinks about her. Now, I feel broken and empty inside. I don't know what to do. I can't even bear to look at her facebook profile since I feel like it would open up old wounds and damage me more or that I'm afraid to know that she's still with the guy who threatened me back then. Please I need your help....

155,"Let me start my story, by saying that the whole point of this post is that I feel like my life is an utter shithole, and I want to change it, but I don't know where to start.  
Okay, so here it goes. I'm 17 year old, who lives with his mother(never knew the father) and another sibling, mother works minimal wage, and all she does in her free time is drink, even though I keep trying to convince her not to, she just says it's her way to relax, and she doesn't do it that often. I did full spreadsheet for one year, and statistics came out that she drank 4 or more beers 218 days in a year. I showed the spreadsheet to her, she just said don't tell me how to live my life because you're just a kid. I never had many friends, three to be exact, and only one who I talked to outside of school, the only friend who I regularly talked to moved onto more popular groups, and cut all contact with me, and the remaining friends went to one Highschool, while I went to a different one. I started dealing with bullying there because of my financial position and the fact that I was always the silent, chubby kid. Because of that I went to psychiatrist, and got homeschooled due to being sociophobic, decided to invest time into my hobbies and since I only had two hobbies, basketball and playing RuneScape, I had to choose between them. I looked up how much does basketball practice cost, I decided I cannot fund it, plus was really scared to get bullied by the kids who are fit and been playing ball for their whole life, so RuneScape was my choice. I invested time heavily in that game while not paying much attention to my studies(could always be top of the class without studying, so had no problems there, even more when homeschooled, since hours of ''school'' were halved). I got really good at the game, and my Runescape clanmates convinced me that selling in game currency for real life currency was almost zero risk of getting blocked from the game, so I started treating the game like my job, helped my mother pay off the debts, got two new computers, got new phone, etc., started hanging out with the 'cool kids', life was going super great for me back then, until I got blocked on RuneScape. That's when all the friends stopped talking to me since I was back to being broke, having no friends, and on top of that I lost the thing that I invested so much time into, my RuneScape account. I understood that it was my fault for abusing the economy of the game, and I understood that if I want to hang out with the 'cool kids', or have any friends at all, I had to change up my life. So, after being depressed for several months, I decided I will invest time into my body, so I started running, third day into running, some thugs beat me up, break my phone, breaks my leg. Running is off the table. I decide to work on my arms, since I'm still motivated to change my lifestyle, I get some things to lift(I don't know how they're called in English), and as I get down to the job, something pops in my elbow. I wait till my mom has workday(she doesn't drink midwork), I call ambulance, they get me into hospital, call up my mom, turns out I need a surgery. After surgery I am convincing myself with quotes like ''God gives his toughest battles to the toughest soldiers'' and shit like that, as soon as I get out of hospital, my grandma dies. At this point I'm just super depressed, crying myself to sleep almost every night, thinking that ending it all would be an option, but at the same time I know that suicide is plain wrong, and not something I am wishing for. I decide that I'm going to try to change my life once more. This time it's diet. One week into the diet, I'm eating an apple, trying to bite into it, I scratch it through my gums, and they start hurting, then few days later, my whole left side of the mouth starts hurting super badly. I go to check it up, it's some mouth infection, I get that fixed, and start thinking that maybe body change is just not for me, I start trying to be more social, nothing comes out of it. One day I'm walking home from shop. 8 Year old kid runs up to me, and spits on my back. I start chasing him, he runs around the corner, so do I, there's three 18-19 year olds waiting there, they beat me up, steal my money, groceries, and all the dignity that I had left. I come back home, completely shut out myself, turn on my computer, remember that I have Counter Strike bought from long ago, start playing that, get hooked, play 12hr/day, start watching all the pro matches, guides, etc, I reach best rank few weeks into the play, start playing with some team, get really involved with it, the team disbands, I start looking for new one, cant find a serious team for few months, I start getting really demotivated, but at the last second, I find a team, and one week into it, my mom who previously didn't give a single fuck about my gaming addiction, sees that in this game I shoot people, she decides to prohibit me from playing this game. So here I am very depressed, antisocial, and without the only thing I was actually good at. Fast forward few weeks, my favorite artist dies. Me being super frustrated about that, I kick air with my leg, and I hit the edge of a sofa, I fracture a bone in a toe, I need another surgery. That was the last straw. At this point I'm questioning everything, trying to see what I did wrong in my life to get to this point, why can't I just have at least a few friends? Why do I need to give up my favorite thing(RuneScape) to get some money so I can have slightly better life? Why do all these misfortunes happen to me?

156,"I went to return an item of furniture with my boyfriend. When we got there the salesperson tells us we'll only get back 2/3 of the price because the packaging is open. So I think even though it's not expensive, maybe instead of losing money on the purchase we can give it to someone who needs it, I know my mom uses things like this. So I call her but she says she has enough. I decide that I still don't want to return it just yet, maybe if no one in my circle wants it.

I find this offensive, it was like 3 minutes, and I don't laugh at him and share knowing glances with salespeople when he's taking his time picking between tech stuff.

162,"Hello gradcafe!

Im having a difficult time deciding what my next step is. 

So, I was accepted to an MA program in English. I have a great advisor, total financial support, and the opportunity to do paid research. The program has a great track record for placement in top twenty phd programs. 

For the summer, I moved to a city to be nearer to my significant other (SO) and to enjoy urban life before heading to a more remote part of the country for my MA. It's been amazing! I'm working in the creative industry and our love has really been growing. Since being here I've questioned whether or not grad school is right for me now. It's been scary but also exciting to spread my wings a bit and find professional opportunities here. I've been thinking about dropping the school thing for now and trying to pursue creative endeavors (my other passion aside from studying literature) like writing while I'm young. Of course my SO also plays a role in my decision.  She said she'd consider doing long distance (I'm a short plane ride away) when I proposed it. But is generally cool on the idea. She'd like me to stay on in aforementioned city. I could spend two weekends out of each month with her, as well as j terms and the summer if we did long distance. But I'm afraid that we'd grow distant. 

Its scary to consider staying on here in the city because I currently have no immediate job prospects and even if I did it would likely not be one of my passions as it certainly won't be a) academics or b ) in writing. But I feel as though it would be an interesting ride  and grad school is always there, though this amazing MA opportunity isn't.   If I did the MA, I'd stand a better chance at getting back to the city as a PhD candidate. But on the other hand, I could apply to PhD programs here in this city this fall to start next year and turn my back on the MA. I hadn't finished my thesis when I didn't get into PhD programs last year and I now have high school teaching under my belt, which might look good to PhD or Masters programs in this city. In fact, I initially planned to do this MA to up my chances of getting to attend a PhD program in this city--before meeting my SO!

So on the one hand, a sure spot and income come fall doing something I love but with an unsure future with my SO and lots of hand wringing at ""what could have been"" not just re SO but also at what kind of career I might have built for myself (safe route) and on the other an exciting young adulthood in an exciting city with my SO for the foreseeable future but still possibly regretting not taking my place this fall at grad school (risky route).  

And I have to decide within the week!!

173,"First of all.. I'm from Germany.

I applied for three universities in Hamburg. I live in a town nearby.

One university (University of Hamburg, I applied for physics) is the closest to me, so I would get there in less than an hour. However, I doubt that I will succeed at getting my degree. When I applied, I thought I could do it but now I'm a bit skeptic. Physics is hard.
I actually wanna become an engineer. So I applied for two more universities (both Civil Engineering).

One of those is a really small university (called HCU) that focuses on metropolitan development. It would take about 1 hour and 20 minutes to get there with public transport. Also I've read numerous reviews and apparently, the professors don't know anything about what they're teaching and the university is poorly organized.

The third university is the University of Technology (TUHH). They have a pretty good reputation because apparently, it's very hard to get good grades there. However, a few of my friends and also my boyfriend will attend this university as well. The problem is it takes about 1 hour and 30-40 minutes to get there. I don't know if it's worth it. On top of that, everyone who decides to attend the TUHH (and also gets accepted) has to complete an internship of a total of 10 weeks. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing because university will start in mid-october so I don't have anything else to do anyway (it is highly recommended to complete the internship before university even starts because there will be not much time due to exams).

I haven't gotten a reply from the HCU yet and the University of Hamburg will most likely accept me as well (because very few people want to study physics). The TUHH, to my surprise, accepted me.

But let's say every one of them accepts me. What do I choose? To study physics (I will fail anyway)? Attend the HCU (which apparently is a very bad university but: I don't have to complete an internship)? Or attend the TUHH (I can be close to my boyfriend, I can easily get a job after I get my degree, it's difficult (but I will work hard, I'm pretty motivated), the only thing that is scaring me is that I will lose so much time, about three hours every day and that the internship will exhaust me...)?",30Jul2017,1

Dad once told me to not touch his journals because they are very important to him and that's why I got sentimental. That's why I told Mom to not touch this journal.

176,"**Background**
I'm a fifteen year old female and I have a mother and brother. I don't really have a history with military except my grandpa-figure having served in it for a few years. My mother is pretty set on none of her kinds serving in the military. When the idea was brought up from my brother that he wanted to be a mechanic for the military, she (to sum it up) said no ""over my dead body"" sort of thing. Few days ago, when rumors about the 2018 draft and the whole transgender thing going around, I kind of joked with my mom about it. ""What if brother gets drafted"" ""Guess he's a woman/transgender now!"" Basically, she doesn't like the idea of either of her kids joining the military.


**Info about scholarship, ect. info**
I'm pretty adamant on becoming a veterinarian, ever since I could talk. I adore animals and helping them. However, I got to thinking: the amount of debt I'm going to be in is unimaginable. I learned about the HPSP (Health Professions Scholarship Program) scholarship after visiting an air show from my local Air Force base.

The scholarship offers one to three year full-tuition scholarship to vet students. The first year isn't eligible (probably want to see how your grades are, leadership, ect.), and a ten month stipend of a little over $1000 dollars.

The minimum commitment is 3 years *active service* and then 3-4 years in *reserve/inactive duty*. What I gathered from various sources is that *active service* involves caring for military family's animals and other animals serving, finding a healthy meat source, giving aid to animals in countries that can't afford it or don't have access (probably other things like that). You won't be the combat troops, but you would be the combat troop support.

The scholarship is HIGHLY competitive. Basically, the top 1% get in, and there are limited spots. Although this  dissuades me, I'm still going to try for it.

Having read this, how would I go about convincing my mother about this opportunity? We have an extremely close relationship (she's practically my best friend). I couldn't fit all the research I found in here, but please feel free to research more.

Thank you.

177,"I am a home owner in a 50/50 rental/owner occupied neighborhood. I have lived here for 17 years. It is a city neighborhood, and I don't expect quiet suburbia. But I have an older female neighbor who yells all of the time, is verbally abusive to all that she encounters, and uses terrible language. With all of my doors and windows closed I can still hear her and make out what she is saying. It goes on all day and night. The landlord, who I have a decent relationship with, lives in the lower unit. I have talked to him about the family as a whole before, but he is dismissive. Is there anything I can do?  I have confronted her before - unfortunately I seem to be the one willing to, although I have talked to other neighbors who feel the same and see them shaking their heads as this is going on.

178,"It's been 1 year after being out of high school, some of my friends are in school like me, and some of my other friends dropped out and started working full time. I have this one friend i'm pretty close too, and he dropped out of school, and stays home and chills home. He hasn't bothered to go look for a job, he could have easily gotten a job by now by applying online. My other friend has tried to set him for job interviews but he blows them by not showing up. I asked him if he wants a job where I work, and he told me ""nahh it's to far"". 

He said he want's to go to community college and do a 1 year program, and then get a job that pays him 50k a year. That sounds really unrealistic to me due to today's economy, and what 1 year program will lead him to a job that starts at 50k??? 

I honestly think, he's acting like this cause 2 years ago he told me he went to the temple, my friend is Hindu, and the ""priest"" idk what's it called in the hindu religion but he was like a priest, and the priest read his palms, and told him he's going to be broke for a while, and then he'll make a lot of money, and he'll die at 30. He told me he doesn't really believe in his religion, but I honestly think that he believes he's going to die at 30, so he's acting like this now. 

My other friend, has tried so many times to help him, but he's not taking anything seriously. Septembers coming up soon, and he hasn't even bothered to apply anywhere for school or a job. He got really fat, but atleast now he started going back to the gym. He told me he had to go to the temp agency but was too lazy to go. 

Idk how to help him, what do I do? What do I say to him? I'm sorry for the long rant, but idk i'm just a nice guy, and I made few good friends in high school that I still keep in touch with, and I wanna see all of them succeed too.   ",30Jul2017,2

As the title states, I was born left handed but forced to use my right hand for all tasks. This started when I was about 5 years old. Now I'm 17 and fully able to use my right hand for almost all tasks, but not without moderate discomfort and/or strain, which has made me want to attempt to become left handed again since it's really tiring.

I really want to switch since I find many things easier with the left hand, especially writing and eating. The problem is, when I attempt to use my left hand, my brain instantly tells me to use my right hand and it seems as if I can't break that barrier.

180,"Basically Ive been dating this girl for around 4 to 5 months now (Im 22, she's 19), I havent asked her to be my gf yet. Have breached the topic with her in the past and basically told her, I tend to take things slow, she's cool with it, thinks it's cute.

So as of recently, Ive just started a full time job and we havent been able to hang out in like 3 weeks since we're both busy. She texts me during the week to ask how Im doing we chat for a bit and I ask her on saturday at around 1 if she wants to hang out after she is off work that night, she replies way later: ""However you want I just dont have any money"". At that point Im already out so I tell her I might be a little late, so she asks me if we can go tomorrow then since apparently she has to get up early (she could have just said this before). I let her know that I wont be able to hang out the rest of that weekend and probably not next weekend either and ask her how early she has to get up.. she replies with 5 so I text her ""Let's go another week"", and she doesn't reply to that which is no big deal, few days later I text her during the week ""How's work"" and also no reply.

Keep in mind I work a 9 to 5 and she works 3 to 11 so we have little time to hang out. I also once ghosted her for a week, which I apologized for, not sure if she is still spiteful about it. Although she said she was fine that I havent made things official, maybe I pushed it for too long and she feels like Im wasting her time?

Now Im wondering whats going on, 4 days has passed with no reply and I see she has a new post on instagram of a stock image of a beach (which is weird since all her picture are selfies or of that sort) in the text she put: ""You said it yourself life makes sure to drive away your loved ones. So when you ask, ""Are you mad at me?"" and I reply truthfully with a ""no"", Im only preparing myself for when your not there, it'll hurt me less that way"" Im not even sure what this post means or if its directed at me because I never said that, but if she is trying to end things im not sure why she would still have me and follow me on instagram..

I'm working with a company where I travel to the city during the week, then home for the weekend, then to a different city the following week. Because I don't drive the company pays for my train travel, but can't afford to put me in a hotel for a week, so they use hostels. 

I'm fine with staying in hostels, but the shower situation gets difficult. Most of the hostels I've been in have open showers and there's no hiding. As soon as I step into the showers I start getting excited. I've tried everything to stop this from happening. I will think about my grandma, I pinch myself hard to take the attention away, I've even masturbated in the toilet before I go for a shower, but nothing works. As soon as I get in there, my guy is up. 

This never happens at home, only when I'm in a public shower. I will always stare straight at the wall and generally try to hide it, but it's difficult to hide it when there's other people either side of you. I had to stop going to the gym because it kept happening there too, but I can't stop showering for a week. Because it's a hostel there are always people going for a shower so there isn't even a time when it's not used. 

I know it happens to guys sometimes, but it get embarrassing when it happens every single time. Does anyone know what I can do to stop this from happening? I really don't know what else to do. ",30Jul2017,2
184,"Hi all

I'm a mixed-race (30M) guy who works for a professional services firm with a serious lack of diversity (race, gender, nationality, everything really). Most of the (posh, old-school British) senior management is pretty resistant to change, but following an all-hands meeting where I brought this up, the head of my practice has just said he'd like to improve things and asked me for suggestions and told me I have his backing.

I have a few ideas, such as:

- removing names (anonymising) applications (I like this as there are no good arguments against it, it's a visible symbol and will spark debate about something we simply don't talk about)
- taking a survey of our diversity and highlighting the differences between us and our clients
- having everyone take Harvard's Implicit Attitude Tests, and discussing results at our next away day (I'm happy to share mine with the firm, but this would be for individual's awareness rather than for public consumption)

Does anyone have any comments on these, or further suggestions (including the best subreddit to put this)?

185,"I want to preface this post by saying that everything in it is 100% true and not trolling.
I do not and have never condoned incest. This is not something I would feel comfortable discussing with my therapist.

A little less than a year ago, I moved in with a sibling who was down on their luck. I managed to help them get a job with the same company I work for, a small IT company where starting pay is $17/hour. Before that, they had been working at McDonalds, so needless to say they were ecstatic. I'm still the only one of us with a car, but my younger sibling, who I'll call S, is saving the required $3000 for a down payment for the car they want. So far, I believe they're up to a little over $2k.

Since we live together, work together and commute together, and often run errands together or play Overwatch together on the weekends, I think my brain is having trouble making sense of our new relationship. Before this, we rarely spoke or spent time together, since I had my own place and S lived with our parents. I also have severe social anxiety, and I wonder if that has a hand in this somehow.

The other night, while S and I were on our way home from the mall, I noticed that my mouth felt wet, as it usually does before or after a kiss, and I felt a strong impulse to lean in and kiss S. I didn't act on it and tried to block it out completely, driving home in stony silence. When S asked if I wanted to play Overwatch on Saturday, I said that I had some work I needed to do from home.

This is the second time this has happened. Once, when we were both drunk and watching some bad horror flick, I had the urge to kiss S, but instead of being freaked out by it, I thought it was one of those automatic thoughts you can't control, like the times I've thought about veering into incoming traffic or throwing a pet across the room. Things I would never, ever do (despite having anxiety I've never been suicidal and I am fiercely against animal cruelty) but the thoughts just come into your head somehow. I think some people call it ""the Call of the Void"".

Our mother always jokes that we spend ""more time together than a married couple"". I'm beginning to believe this to be true, and also wishing that it wasn't. Since S moved in with me, I've noticed that I've been taking almost a parental role with them, which I've decided is something that needs to stop immediately.
Besides spending more time alone, I would appreciate any other suggestions about how to handle this. Anything that could help put me at ease, persuade me that these impulses aren't evidence of more serious desires, would also be deeply appreciated. Right now I am feeling deeply disturbed and a bit lost.",30Jul2017,1

Basically i was cheated on with my current girlfriend. I was the first guy to ever eat her out. After some months of her faking orgasms... she cheated on me with the guy she loved for 4 years before me but never did anything with. She said he ate her out and she came fairly quickly.

190,"Hi,

This is going to be long. So please, bear with me. 

To start things off, I am 23 years old this year. I'm at a crossroads of my life, and I don't know how I should proceed. Frankly, I'm lost (is this called a quarter life crisis?). 

My story starts back in 2014, when I was still a polytechnic student. I joined a cover band as a guitarist, and found that I really, really loved working with them. So towards the end of 2014, we started writing our own songs. We kinda got into self-recording our originals. 

Fast forward to 2016. We haven't really done much recording, and on top of that, we lost our (unreleased) recordings after an unfortunate incident involving ransomware. We had no backups. Then our drummer had to leave the country for a year around the mid of 2016, for an overseas exchange programme. We still continued to write songs in his absence, but we couldn't really do anything about it except practice to a metronome and iron out any issues with the keyboard, guitars, bass and vocals in the meantime. 

Fast forward again, to 2017. I picked up a part-time diploma in Music Production and Audio Engineering, mostly because of my interest, and partly also because of the band. 

So this is where I currently stand.

My bassist recently announced that he wanted to settle down (have a family, the stuff, y'know), and would be slowly pulling out from band activities starting next year. 

Both my drummer and my keyboardist had no interest in finding work locally, so both of them are planning on finding employment overseas. 

Then my guitarist only recently (last week, that is) announced that he has found employment overseas, and will be leaving at the end of October. 

I really, really, really, love this group of people. Over the past 3 years, there's never been a boring moment with these guys. I really want us to stay together, but life happened. 

I don't know what to do. It feels like a part of me is missing. Being in this band improved me as a person, a musician, and as a guitarist. 

I know I'll probably never find another band like that again. I don't want them to leave (I know, it's selfish of me), but at the same time I'm happy for them that they got/are getting their lives on track.

I don't know, but it kinda seems futile to try to start another band. Or even to just continue with my vocalist, to find new members or something. I'm afraid to even ask if she wants to continue. 

I need some advice.

191,"Hello all,
I am a 15 (almost 16) year old girl, and I don't feel safe around my father. I have never really felt safe with him, but the last two years have been worse. He's been an alcoholic my whole life, but he's never been dangerous aside from one incident that happened on Christmas of 2015. He's never done anything to harm me before; however, I've had this growing feeling that he might. Although he lives with my mom and me, we've never had a good relationship. On the rare occasion that we talk to each other, it's only a few strained sentences when he's drunk. Lately, his drunken ramblings have gotten kind of sexual in nature and it's starting to scare me. I can't go to sleep until I hear him snoring in the next room, I can't stand to be in the same room as him, I can't turn my back to the door of my bedroom, and I am just so scared of him. I wish he would just leave already. My mom knows that I don't like him, but not that I'm scared of him. If I told her, she'd immediately tell him and I don't know how he would respond (I know he wouldn't respond violently but I don't know about anything else). I'm hesitant to tell anybody how I feel because I don't know if I'm just creating these feelings out of nothing. My mom would never kick him out, so there's not much that could be done even if I did tell someone how I feel. I just hate that man  so much and I want nothing to do with him. What should I do?

194,"I’m a junior at a small private college, and I have been thinking about leaving my fraternity for a couple of reasons:

1.	I’ve never really felt accepted in my fraternity. When I was pledging I never really got close with any of the actives or my pledge class. I thought things might look up after I was initiated (I assumed the brothers might be affecting distant personalities to make pledging a little tougher), but even after I was activated it felt like people weren’t really interested in doing anything with me (I feel like I am often snubbed for social stuff too: like going out to eat, hanging out, etc...). Everyone is cliquey, and it seems no matter how hard I work to integrate myself into any of these social groups, I’m never really accepted into them. Also, it seems like most of our elections are heavily influenced by social nepotism, so I have never been able to get into a position of any kind. 

2.	I don’t feel supported by my brothers. For example, several of my brothers and I are staying on campus this summer, and I recently broke up with my girlfriend of two years (I know its not long in the realm of monogamous tenures; but it was serious enough that we went ring shopping a couple of times), and not one of them tried talking to me about it. I don’t want to give the impression that I expect them to come running at my every emotional beck and call (they are free adults, so I recognize that they don’t have to do squat if they don’t want to). But I feel hurt on two accounts: 1.) the same thing happened to a brother during the school year, and the fraternity pretty much did everything in its power to make sure he was comforted emotionally; 2.) My ex became a good friend of the fraternity while we were dating (everyone views her as a sister), and it seems like she has gotten far more support from my brothers than I have (even though she was the one who dumped me). I understand that she needs emotional support as well, but it seems like they are turning their back on me to help her. 

3.	I can’t rationalize spending an obscene amount of money (by college standards) on an organization in which I don’t feel like I’m a part, and in which (it seems) like there is marginal to no room for advancement. 

I was an open bid and I joined because of that fact: I thought they really wanted me in the fraternity, plus I like the national chapter and what it stands for. But I am slowly becoming weary of my brothers. I don’t want to quit because my personal philosophy has always been to stick stuff out until the end, but is there anything I can do to improve my situation and, if not, should I quit and disassociate myself from the fraternity? Thank you guys for any insight you can provide.

197,"My husband is having a mid-life crisis. But not the kind where you buy a sports car and have an affair, it's the kind where he hit 40 and just seemed to decide that it was the beginning of the end. Now, every ache and pain is treated like early stages of arthritis. When he's tired, it's not exhaustion but rather his body is breaking down. Death is staking claim to various parts of his body and death's flags planted are patches of grey hair on his arms, head and body, spreading like a cancer of old-age. 

Ok, maybe that was a bit dramatic, but honestly it's shocked my system to see him change so dramatically in just the past year or two. Here's why I sympathize with him, and following is why I'm also freaking out-

I sympathize because I would freak out too, and because I'm his loving wife. I too am about to hit 40 and it's a title I'm not ready for. 40 seems to demand that you leave behind whatever childish things have clung to your identity up to this point. Sure, we can all feel and act young forever, but it seems to go from a lived reality to just an act around 40. He's also spent his entire life to this point in University, gaining two prestigious Ph.D.'s and I'm not sure if he'd do it again, had he had the chance. Success is a double edged sword.. you either live free and frivolous early and retire poor, or you sacrifice the years of your youth studying so you can retire comfortably. I think maybe my husband realizes that now that he has financial freedom, his body can't keep up and it's killing him. As a Pharm.D., Ph.D, I feel like he's earned the right to feel any damned way he wants about anything, including growing old. 

Why I'm also freaking out- Don't judge, but I'm set on feeling young for as long as possible. I really believe that you're only as young as you feel, and it's worked up to this point. Hitting 40 will present a new set of personal challenges to sustain this great thing I have going, but as long as I continue to eat well, work out and enjoy life I think I'll age gracefully and happily. The thing is, I can already see that if I do this, I'll quickly leave my husband in my dust. I'll forge on with girls night and afternoon matinee's and trips to the salon, and he'll sleep more and more and move a bit slower each year, declaring every conquest that age has taken from him along the way to anyone who will listen, and by ""anyone"" I mean me. 

I try to get him to work out, but he's not self-motivated and that's too big a burden for me to bear. I love him, but I don't want to establish this relationship where his happiness and health suddenly becomes my responsibility. I do try though. I give advice, cook good food, work out which motivates him to also work out but he quickly gets tired and looks at me with that ""what's your secret"" expression, before going back for his third serving of dinner which kicks my should-have-been 1000 calorie dinner to 2500 calories right before bed-time.

'm having a real hard time with something.



I recently approached a girl to explain something, and before I managed to speak, she managed to attack me with a great deal of energy. it affected my mind and it made me feel very bad for alomst 2 months. this is not funny and its not a joke.

The same once happened with a guy in the street. so IT IS NOT GENDER RELATED.

I remeber I had a gf a few years ago. we were in a nightclub and this guy was sowing interest in her on the dance floor. she was attractive, and I was standing next to her. I allowed the situation to continue, as this guy was doing nothing wrong, he was not aggressive at all, just flirting, and my gf gave him a very abusive ""act"" I dont know what to call it, but I could see that she litterally crushed his spirits, and he jumped from being friendly to muttering fuck off under his breath and walking away.

I didnt say anything about it due to the loud music, but later I brought it up..

I asked her why she was so abusive to the guy on the dance floor, and she said it was ""because she was dancing"" I said, the guy was just being friendly whats the problem?, so she replied "" he was harrasing me and trying to talk to me "", I said yeah, its a night club, thats what people do.

she said she didnt know what else to do. and i said that giving him a nasty rejection like that was not nessersary emotional abuse was so just not the way to deal with it, the only thing she had to do was turn around and kiss me on the face. that would tell him you were in a relatioship and that would be the end of it. she agreed. and all was fine after that.

my problem is that other girls do it to me and its bad, very serious. can someone help me to understand this, I find it difficult that some one can abuse another one without saying a word, and without reason. 

I have also witnessed this behaviour with other people in the street, (neither of them related to me in anyway.
I have seen guys do it to guys, and girls do it to girls.

Can anyone shed a light on this, becuase I'm genuinely having problems understandng it.

I asked my gf what it was that she did, and she just said, ""people allow you to abuse them"" but this was very vague, and I broke up with this gf many years ago. (for other reasons).

Until fairly recently, I worked for a land surveying firm in a small town. The bosses were particularly uncaring, the wages were too low, the work too overwhelming for the pay, etc... Obviously this is why I left for other work.

Anyhow, the culture at this company was essentially ""work hard, don't complain, and get it done."" This lead to a lot of long days in the field; hard days of 10 hours in the southern sun trying to finish a project with minimal rest so our bosses could come close to meeting the promises of the bid they placed to get the job (bids that often intentionally underestimated the time it would take, in order to win the bid-which put the field crew under even more stress).

The bosses constantly put us in some measure of danger, and there would be minor injuries often-usually unreported. In the summer, it was not uncommon for a member of the field crew to ""fall out"" roughly once every couple weeks. I personally had heat exhaustion a handful of times in my 2 years there, resulting in all kinds of terrible symptoms, mainly vomiting, and feeling horrible well after getting home and crawling into bed.

One of the times I ""fell out"" was right in front of the owner. It was not uncommon for this man to come out into the field, sit in his cart, and essentially heckle us while we do hard labor; basically keeping his eye on us to make sure we kept working without taking more than a few minutes to breath at a time. He essentially kept working me even after I stopped sweating, not expressing any real concern, and it was only a bout of vomiting that freed me from having to continue.

But I digress, this post... It isn't really about me and the way the company treated me. I'm simply trying to frame the culture of this company so I can properly ask my question.

A current employee at this company, and a friend of mine, died from heatstroke/heart attack today directly related to his working in the field. The bleeding in his brain was too severe and despite the best efforts of hospital staff he wasn't able to be saved. The owners of the company didn't even visit him in the hospital...

But I digress, I wasn't there to really grasp how it all went down in the field. He was an older man who was on blood pressure medicine, and I'm unsure of the exact conditions of the job or how much work had been heaped on him since I haven't been with the company in awhile... But I do know that the culture of that place is such that he and the rest of the crew were probably very overworked.

So my question is: would it be worth it to contact the state work force commission or some similar government body to report this company for likelyviolations? And if so, what agency or state dept. should one contact to report such possible violations? Keep in mind I no longer work there, if that matters.

Anyhow, I'm not sure if there is a case for ""health code"" violations, or some other infraction for that matter, but in my anger I really want to tip off the necessary govt department/s that this company is overworking their workers in unsafe conditions, and need to be held accountable and investigated for possible violations at the very least.

Thanks for taking time to read this; I know it's kind of rambling but it's kind of a difficult, confusing topic that I'm especially close to at the moment. Regardless, any help answering the question is appreciated.",30Jul2017,1

216,"Hi!

So, I'll be 26 next month, a senior in college and have 7 classes left before graduating with a BA in Communication. I have big dreams of traveling the world, just need this last piece before I can do it. 

I've been an auto and property insurance agent for 4 years; the company is amazing, pay and benefits are great, but I hate my job. To the extent that I dread going back to work, even on my days off. I work in a call center environment, so as soon as I got off the call, I get another. Thankfully, most of the people I talk to are cool, but I still get some crazies. I just hate the stress and have been thinking about quitting off and on for at least 3 years, but every time I've stayed because of the pay and benefits.

As for my plans to travel; I want to start by teaching English in Korea fall 2018, which starts in August. I need my degree to qualify, so I want to graduate after this fall and road trip for at least 6 months next year, before going to Japan and then on to Korea. This leads me to the actual point:

I have 7 classes left!! Graduation is so close, I can taste it. I've already signed up for 6 classes this fall and the 7th is just an easy public speaking class I can take at the local community college. I've already checked with my academic advisor, she confirmed I can take that last class at the other school and still graduate at my university. (I mention that, because it's usually a requirement that the last 30 hours be taken at the university before graduating.) 

So, I know what I SHOULD do: only take 3 or 4 classes this fall and the others in the spring, and keep working full-time so I don't have to take out student loans. But here's what I WANT to do: break my apartment lease (which I'm likely going to have to do anyways, because it's over next July, and I plan to be gone before then). I can move in with my cousin and half my expenses. If all goes accordingly to plan, I'll graduate in December, my boyfriend will quit his job in February, and we'll be taking off for our roadtrip in March. Im assuming by the time I get my loans and everything, I'll be moving into my cousin's in September.

So, here's the plan, move into my cousin's in September, my half of rent will be $475/month, electricity about $80/month (guessing higher than it probably will be), and Internet $30/month. Over 7 months, that's $4100. My own expenses are a car payment $192/month, and my auto/renters insurance $150/month. Over 7 months, that's $2400. My tuition for the fall with all 7 classes will be about $6000. I know it's a lot to think about, but I'm hoping to get at least $12,000 in student loans for the semester, which should almost cover those expenses. I won't have a lot of extras, but that's okay. This is also without working at all; if it turns out I need a lot more, I can just pick up a part-time job as a bank teller or at Starbucks or something. 

So, I need some advice on a few things: is there a reputable place I can get private student loans? I'll also be taken off my parents health insurance next month, what do I need to consider there? Is the insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield that the school offers usually good?

As for my plans to pay back the student loans: I'm planning to stay in Asia teaching for about five years, so I can pay off all my debt and build up more funds to travel the world longer. If I was planning to stay home and live a ""normal"" life (kids, marriage, house, etc), I would not even consider doing this, I would take the slower route. But I'm ready to go out and start exploring the world, and I have a plan for paying back those loans, so it's not as much of a concern as it would be otherwise.

I also have $20,000 in my 401k and do have the option to take a loan of $6,000 before I quit. I know I'd be taxed on it and have a 10% penalty, but would that be a good way to get the extra funds I may need?

TL;DR: going to quit my job to finish my last semester in college and start living my dream of traveling. Do you know a good company to get private student loans? How do I deal with being removed my parent's health insurance? Would it be the worst idea ever to take a loan from my 401k to supplement my income/put in emergency savings?

If y'all have any other advice, it'd be appreciated! I know it's kinda crazy and really scary, but I'm so excited!!

221,"I (34f) am a mom to 4 kids.  I was walking out of a grocery store today when I heard a chikd blood curdling scream behind me.  It was obviously a scream of pain, not of a big fit.  I turned and saw a woman carrying a child no more than 2 or 3 years old over her shoulder but she was squeezing the child really tight.  She child was screaming in pain and in agony saying ""OWIE"" .  The women didn't seem phased.  Everyone was looking at her.  

I walked to my car and could still hear the screaming.  I scanned the parking lot and saw the woman still carrying the little girl on the far end of the lot.  Anger and sadness consumed me like fire and I got in my car and drove around the parking lot looking for the women, as I was about to unleash on her as to why she felt it was ok to harm a child, but I never found them .

The entire drive home I held back tears.  I had a chance to do something about it and I waited too long. I was just another onlooker who walked away.  

I can't forgive myself.  I can't stop wondering if that little girl is ok, if she is safe.  I am on my bedroom on my bed still fighting back tears and that was 30 minutes ago it happened.  I tried to talk to my husband about it but he didn't have anything to say and he went back to his phone games.

224,"Tonight after a heated argument with my husband, I lay sobbing on the floor and felt so unbelievably out of control. In that moment I hated myself. I could hear his criticisms and all I wanted to do was hurt myself. I punched myself in the face about four times. I hit so hard I have a big bump on my temple and a few bruises. I felt calm afterwards. Walked to the bathroom cabinet an held a blade to my wrist. I don't want to die. I don't think I would say I'm suicidal, but the last two days I've fantasized about dying, how better off everyone would be without me. 

I am usually really logical, and my logical brain is screaming WTF as I write this down. I know what I did and how I feel are outside the realm of normal. I have a beautiful 2 year old who is my world. I am a teacher. On the surface everything is normal. And most days everything feels normal. But when my husband and I argue I crumble. I fall into these deep despairing holes. I become someone I barely recognize. 

I know I need help. I was so on the edge of having myself committed. I just want to escape. I even packed a bag to leave, but have nowhere to go. I am afraid to get mental health help because I am so terrified that it'll affect my job. As a teacher i have to disclose metal health issues. I am also afraid that if I ever get the courage and means to leave my husband that he'll use it as a weapon to gain custody. Do I seek help? Or just wait for the episode to blow over and hope it doesn't happen again?

227,"I started dating my girlfriend a year ago, and we have been living together for a half a year.

During the time our relationship was in the shitter, I told a family member I was unhappy in the relationship, they eventually told my mother about the situation even though the promised not to; yeah I know I'm nieve. The main reason we were living together was to get her out of her abusive household and end the long distance part of our relationship. The big problem is that my apartment only allows one person per studio, so she was made to leave by my mom and the owners of the apartment while I was on vacation. Since my mom pays for my college and my living, I understand she is in the right to do this, but she won't listen to the idea that I love my girlfriend and assumes that I am miserable even though I tell her I'm not. I keep telling her that I want to be in this relationship, and I have a right to see who I want to see since I'm 20 years old, but she keeps going on about how she is not footing the bill for another person, even though she never paid an extra fee for another person.

243,"I am hoping for some advice. I think I know what I should do but I'm just having a hard time doing it.  Maybe someone has some constructive criticism or advice that will help me over the edge. Will try to be as brief as possible.  

For the majority of my adult life, I have worked with an entrepreneur in a variety of different roles and job settings.  This person has opened numerous small family-run retail operations over the past 20 years, some successful, other less so. I began working in one of these stores in 1999 when I was still in high school and I have stuck with him on and off since then. As the years went on, we sort of organically transitioned from retail to manufacturing for the entertainment and educational industries.  I'm now 35. I've taken small breaks from this job here and there, but for one reason or another, I have always returned, and always on good terms. 

My boss is an incredibly creative person and he has been able to use that trait to create business models that are not only unique and fascinating, but also fun at times.  While he himself is not much of a hands-on type, (for example, he barely knows how to use a computer) he has been able to channel his creativity through his staff to come up with some incredible products. It has been a wild ride and I've been able to work with some amazing companies and people in the movie and entertainment industry from a fairly young age. 

It hasn't all been good though, particularly the past year.  While we have grown into a legitimate player in our industry, the business has always been run like a ""family-owned"" or small business.  We are a very small team.  About 10 people.  Each person plays a critical key role in the operation of the business. Lose one person, and the whole operation crashes. The company's income is enough to sustain itself (barely) but it doesn't seem to be profitable.  There's no cash reserves to solve problems as they com up. We have no HR dept or personnel. No health insurance. Labor laws are not really paid attention to. It sort of feels like the wild west of jobs.  It really is a blood, sweat, and tears kind of thing. The major staff members (myself included) that have stuck around only do so because we have a personal attachment to our product and overcoming challenges.  It's all VERY deadline oriented and the only goal, ever, is to complete projects on time. The problem with that is we are almost always against the clock in the worst way possible. Our team is very small. We have to finish projects.  My boss acts as sort of the project manager and overseer and puts out the fires as they pop up. He is very involved but not on the production side. 

As fun as this job *could* be, it's become rather miserable for me. Months and months of 12-16 hours days, 7 days a week has worn me out.  The pay is not great (Salary, $56k per year in California). There's lot's of travel, which is taxing, to install what we build throughout America/Canada. I could go on and on about how difficult the job is. 

While I really respect my boss and what he has accomplished, he now finds himself in a financial position where in order to keep the doors open, he has to take on more work. Sounds great, but the problem is we don't get more time to complete this extra work. Essentially, we get more and more busy, but out capacity does not increase. As good as my boss is with creativity, his ability to run the business and take care of his staff is lacking. It feels like a vicious cycle and it doesn't feel sustainable. 

Unfortunately, I think I've come to a point where I've had enough. I rejoined this company about 1 year ago (after a 2 year break) and told my boss I'd guarantee him 3 more years. I don't think I can do it though.   I have been with this company more almost 20 total years, far longer than anyone else and I helped build it from the ground up with my boss. 

But, clearly I'm not getting rich and I'm not getting younger.  I pay for private insurance for my wife and I (almost $1000 per month). The stress of the job is almost always over the top. I think the writing is on the wall that we are heading for a major issue of not being able to fulfill our obligations as we steadily get buried in more and more work.

If I didn't respect the guy as a businessman and honestly a long-time friend, I would bail without remorse. The thing is, if I leave, i will leave this company and its staff in an almost insurmountable clusterfuck and I fear it may be the thing that puts the business over the edge. 

It's a pretty heavy weight on my shoulders.  Do I sacrifice my happiness for the sake of a company that may fail regardless of what I do, or put myself first and maybe cost an entire staff their jobs? I have a college degree and lots of talent that could be used elsewhere, but it's hard for me to imagine leaving. 

Thanks for reading. I do appreciate it.

        When we moved into our current home a few months ago, my wife became very interested in ""freebies"" (as in anything that you can get for free) and has started trying to get every ""free"" thing she can. She started by finding items on the side of the road in our new neighborhood; usually some piece of wood/furniture that she planned on reusing/upcycling. She always planned on turning the trash into treasure, but only done something with the junk a handful of times.(...and I am being generous by saying a handful because all I can remember was one glass piece that she ended up painting.) I try to calmly talk to her about it, and finally we come to an agreement that she only bring in things that we need/things that she has a definite plan for. I pray, and time goes on...I should probably add that we are renting a house that is approx. 1,000 sqft. It's just a small 2 bedroom, 1 bath home, and we have a 2-year-old daughter together; there isn't a lot of extra room to work with.

    I probably should've also mentioned that she is also a fellow redditor, although, she basically only used her account for Pretty Little Liars subreddits until she became addicted to free stuff. When she discovered the r/freebies subreddit, our clutter crisis went up a whole 'notha level. It started with small things that were usually pretty cool in some way. For example, she started getting free* stickers from a seemingly infinite plethora of businesses, and the stuff she got in the mail was usually pretty cool. (*the companies normally require you to provide a self-addressed envelope with paid postage) This wasn't really a problem with me (even though it breaks the rule about not bringing in things that we don't need) since we have a sticker collection that we both started together a couple of years ago. I figured that we could add on to our already massive pile of stickers and that it would be something fun for the family, bc what 2-year-old (or human) doesn't love stickers?!

   Well, stickers became product samples from the same, near-infinite list of companies she had sent paid postage to, and eventually she subtly starts talking about people's ridiculous(ly rewarding) dumpster diving escapades and how some people will throw anything away no matter its condition. I get the hint that she feels inspired by these stories and I start to have a panic attack (not literally) thinking about her bringing actual garbage into our home. A few weeks pass by with no more word from her about her wanting to pursue this endeavor. Postal packages have slowed, all is good for now...


     Yesterday, I woke up to an empty bed, also with a feeling that she didn't join me the night before. She is not home at all when I get up to check on her. I call her and she says she is on her way home from ""diving"". I ask her when she became so interested in swimming when she replies that she meant dumpster diving. I was  shocked to see her come home empty handed, she said it was a bust.

    Fast forward to today; she just walked in the door with 9 large boxes she got out of different dumpsters. Just dropped them all in the living room floor and started going through them. I counseled her again on the way that bugs (i.e. roaches) can travel into your home. She gets upset and storms off. She goes to leave againn, and  when I ask where she is going, she says ""diving"" and  walks out the door even after another VERY SENSIBLE conversation to go search for more junk. What do I do, what do I say?
