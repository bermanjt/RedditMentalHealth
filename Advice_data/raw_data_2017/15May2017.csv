2,"So I'm a 5'5"" female and I weigh 134-136 lbs currently. Now, I know I'm not overweight and I can't call myself fat, but I'm not exactly skinny either. Overall, I'm a pretty average looking girl. I'm not hideous or really all that pretty. But I'd really like to change that. My goal is to lose weight (maybe get it down to 120 lbs), work on getting a flat stomach, slimming down my face, and work on building arm strength. I know cardio is an important part of losing fat, but that's as much as I know about actual exercise or fitness. I'm not a very active person, and I'm not good with keeping track of my diet. That being said, I have no idea what kind of workout routine I would need or what kind of diet I should try. Can anyone give me some kind of tips or idea of what I should do? Anything helps!",15May2017,4

13,"Im a 21M and she is 19F (im pretty sure she is 19) and we work together at college. Currently we are on summer break and far away from each other. Since she might use reddit ill use her first initial which is K. We never really talked while working together (rarely had a shift together too) but she did get my number off the company employee contact list and started texting me, also congratulating me on my promotion. 

Pretty soon this texting turned into snapchatting as well. We talk all day on snapchat. The problem I have with this girl is that i cant tell if she is playing hard to get, the fact that she is just a BORING texter, or if she is not interested. One minute we will be flirting using a bunch of emojis and teasing each other then all of a sudden i get these stupid *** one word responses, so i stop replying. Its like she purposefully kills the conversation, honestly its the weirdest thing and you can literally see it coming.

Then a couple hours after i stop replying, she will either send me a pic of herself (which she is quite cute so i dont mind) or start another conversation about something. Ive told her that I am attracted to her and she responded very positiviely. She also said she wants to have ""a puppy play date with our dogs"" and wants to hangout and try ghost hunting because i mentioned im interested in ghosts.

Can you guys give an explanation as to why she gets so short in text conversations? Is she actually trying to play hard to get, if so why would she ask to hangout AND play hard to get?",15May2017,0
17,"My mother is 72. She up until like the past two weeks has been as sharp as a tack and never done anything I would qualify as ""stereotypical old person"".

However, two weeks ago, she started claiming that ""her cat was peeing everywhere."" She doesn't have a cat or dog. She has fish. So I thought ""Ok maybe a cat somehow got in"". I went and looked around, I smelled no cat pee or any pee at all for that matter.

I told her that I couldn't find it and she pointed to me to her closet. I open and there was nothing in there at all beyond her clothes. I told her again, there is nothing there. She insisted there was and told me to ""fix it"" or she'd be moving in with me until I did.

So I ""fixed it"". I took a wet washcloth and just rubbed the rug a bit and that was fine with her.

That was the first incident.

Since then I've come over and found her doors wide open at all hours of the day. Anyone could just waltz in and rob her or worse. She says ""Oh don't worry nothing happens out here"".

Her direct neighbors were robbed two days ago, and she refuses to lock the doors, luckily I have a key and go and lock them when she's asleep but still.

Her house is one street away from mine and I'll go for a morning jog and find her doors once again wide open at 5am with her usually awake and when I try to relock them she'll come out yelling about ""How I need to worry about my house and how it's safe to leave doors wide open"".

Not to mention she's gotten, way more religious to the point of calling things ""satan worship"" if she doesn't agree with them. Most recently she has started claiming that any music that isn't Christian music is ""satan worship"".

I'm worried about her, my wife is seeing this, so is my younger brother. I'm not sure how to approach this. My dad died when I was 3 and she never got remarried so there is no one else who lives this close to her to see it even though we all live in the same town barring one relative.

So, anyone got any advice, how to approach this? We've tried an intervention and she called the cops on us, luckily the cops didn't arrest anyone and actually knew us so when we explained it they just nodded and went on with their patrol.",15May2017,43

Emma used to go to school with us until like 5+ years ago  when we were just kids. Emma has now moved back and is at my school last week. I haven't even seen her yet.  Emma has been sending me tons of messages and one that said ""omg I heard you went to the hospital r u ok?"". I never even gave her any of that info. I feel kind of pissed that Jessica has went and given her all if this. Jessica has never even mentioned this to me.  I'm not even sure I want to have contact with Emma.

30,"So, here's the story.

My sister and her husband used IVF to get pregnant bc he has CF. She had the twin girls at 27 weeks. So, they're fucked on their budget from IVF. 

My brother-in-law's cousin started a shitty multi-level marketing fundraiser for the twins, saying in Facebook that proceeds would go to my nieces' medical bills. 

Then, she posted each day about how much she loves the girls and the family and wants to help them. 

My mom, bil's mom, and his sister sold products at their workplace directly for this girl, and she has an online Facebook party. 

She sold 150% her goal, and the company had already agreed to match her donation, which she mentioned as a selling point. She made about $3000. She gave my sister's family $200.

We were floored by how little she gave. It would cost her about $1400 to replenish her products. 

I tried to return my product to her, and she says she only does exchanges. 

I am beyond livid, but I don't know what to do. She never said how much she would give. But, good lord. 

How do I make a point without bringing any negativity to my sister? 

TL; DR: ""Momtrepreneur"" is giving my sister 8% fundraiser proceeds, keeping 92% for her cunt self. ",15May2017,2
32,"This whole thing started back in August when me and my parents decided to homeschool me for a year or two. I wish we hadn't. Little did I know that this would eventually send me what seems to be spiraling down into depression. Today was an especially bad day. I did absolutely nothing of substance. I watched YouTube, played video games, and talked a little with friends. I feel like I'm missing two crucial things in my life. Consistency and social interaction. I'm not old enough to drive and can't really get a job. I can never get together with friends because they all live several towns away from me.

43,"I've been dating this girl for over a year now, and she recently admitted to having sex with her first ex/best friend from many years ago, who I am also currently friends with. She hasn't had sex with him ever and loved her relationship with him. 

For his birthday, in April, she and a couple of their friends had a little party while I was away, which she told me everything about. They smoked weed, but did not drink.

Recently she also admitted that when all of them went to sleep on one bed, he forced her to kiss him and then in the middle of the night she woke up to him inside of her. She pushed him away but then later he asked for her to go get water with him, and they continued. 

But this is what gives me doubts. She has anxiety, and can not say no to anyone ever. It's terrible anxiety, and it always gets to her in the worst way, she explained to me that she told him multiple times that she didn't think it was a good idea, but he continued. She was too afraid to ""make a scene"" and say or do anything because she also didn't want the others to hear her.

She has been ignoring him since. And told me she didn't want to tell me because she was scared for our relationship. 

This guy, is also a huge player/dick. He is a total asshole, and I have told her multiple times that I do not like him. 

It seems like it's obvious to break up, but I am in love with this girl and I feel like it would be right to give her another chance. She has been doing a lot better since his birthday and hasn't been getting mad at little things or throwing fits and has just been trying to make our relationship a lot better than usual.

59,"For the past 3 years I've had two best friends that I've always enjoyed hanging out with. I've had many other good friends other than these guys but as high school is quickly going by, my friend group has gotten smaller and smaller to the point that I really only hangout with these two guys. This year I was kind of struggling with the fact that I don't have many people to truly call friends and I finally felt like I accepted the fact that having a couple best friends is better than having lots of ok friends. It wasn't until yesterday when I finally realized that I didn't have anyone because both of my friends were not people I thought. I just found out my first friend is not only a rapist, but has lied to me about lots of things. Throughout high school a few girls accused him of raping them yet I always stuck up for him because ""I knew that wasn't the type of guy he was"". He always convinced me that he had these problems and people accused him of things he didn't do and I feel like such an idiot for actually believing him. My second friend is a just major druggie and I think he's going insane. He's not the type of druggie that just smokes weed but the type of druggie who will do practically anything without caring about many of the consequences. He recently has done molly, lsd, cocaine, and has also been snorting speed at least 2-3 times a day. He seems to be losing touch with reality and the people around him and I don't know what to do. I know I'm going to do whatever I can to help my friends with their struggles but I just think it's time to move on. For the first time I don't think I have a person I completely trust (other than my family of course).

We used to talk and skype evryday after the move but now he hardly ever picks up and its mostly me messagin him and this is the first text he's sent in a while and it just says ""busy""
Am I supposed to read something into this? First of all, when I took this screenshot it was 3:30 AM in Israel so what was he doing at that hour he could text me but couldnt call me? Second he hasnt called me back at all since then!! I'm worried maybe he has new friends in Israel.

Here is what I'm dealing with, in no particular order:  

1.  Birthday.  I turned 40 a few months ago and while age or a number had never been an issue to me, suddenly the realizations began:  at this age, I will most likely never have kids of my own; my life is at least half over; who is going to take care if me when I can't take care if myself. 

2.  Death.   I became an adult orphan less than a month ago.  My mother, whom I did not have a great relationship with, died several years ago. My dad died last month.   In was a daddy's girl. He was both mom and dad for most of my life. He was my security blanket, now gone.  More realizations:  dad won't be there to (hopefully) walk me down the isle someday; no more phone calls, funny gifts.

3.  Relationship on the fence. I returned home from my dads funeral and within the first hour of seeing my fiance of 3 years (together off and on for 7), ""I dont know if we are working"" came out if his mouth.  I dont know how he could be so cruel knowing I just buried my dad a week prior.   I was also told he will be moving when our least is up.  3 weeks later and tries to act like he didn't say anything and everything is ok. My head is telling me to leave him once and for all. My heart doesn't agree. 

4.  Geography.  I don't know where to live and have less than 4 months to figure it out.  The fiance and I moved 1300 miles away from home 2.5 years ago.  I kind of like it here. I love my job. I have made friends here, but no family, no support other than the fiance.   Can I make it here on my own?  Should I move back closer to ""home"" where I have some family and a few friends?  

5.  The past.  A former relationship is trying to rekindle.  This is someone I wanted to be with for so long, but our timing was always off.  This person and I have some sort of connection that has lasted 20 years.  Is timing finally on our side?  Do I take the chance?

68,"I didn't know where to go about this, and it's keeping me up till midnight on a school night, so here it goes. Every once in a while, I like to invite friends over to my house. Everyone in our friend group agrees that it is the best place to hang out, and since I have my license, I can give people rides there from school. We self fund it, bring a second TV for lan parties, etc. I had a total of four other guys at my house

The last time I had some friends over, everything was going well until around 2 am, when one of my most flippant friends went on a rant about rape and started joking about raping my puppy(eight months old.). Obviously, I wasn't okay with this, told him to quit, and he insisted it was just a joke and kept laughing at my response. For whatever reason, people talking about raping my dog and defending it struck a nerve. It's kind of a blur what happened next, but I went to my room and just decided to sleep. 

I proceeded to avoid that friend and haven't spoken to him since then. Another one of my friends( let's call him shotgun) left our group chat, citing that our senses of humor were getting too disturbing for him. Strangely, shotgun has the strangest and most over the top sense of humor out of the group. Ever since, he's been complaining about us to each other and been more rude/ less in a jokey mood. Ironically, shotgun brought up the rape stuff nearly a week later, and then proceeded to say my reaction was ""kind of funny."" I'm not sure why, but this kind of hurt my feelings and I haven't really been wanting to talk to him.  

I told Another friend who was at my house, let's call him ""Kid"", that Shotgun was calling my reaction funny, and he said, ""but it was."" This was all starting to get under my skin because it felt like everyone was against me for something that was clearly wrong. I went off on him, calling him an insensitive jerk, and trying to justify my feelings as to why it was disturbing/ messed up



The third friend was the one who talked about raping my dog.

And the fourth seems to be sort of listening to me when I've conveyed how distraught I am about all of this.

It's not really the raping or the insignificant drama going on that bugs me, it's the fact that it feels like everything is falling apart, and like I can't trust anyone right now to have my back here. I think about it occasionally, and it all just disturbs me greatly. I've also had issues of being abandoned, especially in middle school and earlier in life. What do I do in this situation?

Today, my boyfriend texted me and told me that he is going to have a combined party with his best friend [M18], at his best friends house on June 11th at 1:00, one day after my party / barbecue with my family. 

I asked my grandma [F60], who I live with, if I could go and she got extremely upset. She said that I was putting my boyfriend / his best friend over my family and she insulted me the entire night calling me retarded, an idiot, a bitch, etc. She told me that I have no class and went as far as to say that I want to have sex with my boyfriend's best friend. She told me that I don't know how spoiled I am, that I don't know the worth of a dollar and that by me wanting to go to my boyfriend's party, I'm basically ""slapping my family in the face.""

But...things weren't working. We've been long distance for a year and every time we got together, it was like experiencing the entire emotional spectrum of the relationship in a 24 hour period. He resented me for moving away; I held a grudge against him for renewing his lease instead of coming up to be with me. Politically and socially we were opposites. But together, he made me more happy than i had been before.

Part of my brain keeps nudging me to reach out, to reconnect, to check in on him. It's only been a few days. I know I can't do that.

86,"I've just been given two job offers. I think I know what I have to do but I'm scared that I'll lose my sense of purpose due to my attachment of my self-worth to my dream job. 

**Context**

My wife and I both hate our current location, *Location0*. We can't wait to leave. I've been biding my time at my current position, *Job0*. I've been building my resume in order to relocate to a more desirable place. There are many reasons for this including opportunities for my kids, climate, and lack local support and infrastructure. 

Before *Job1* came online, taking *Job2* wasn't really a question. There are significant risks associated with *Job2* but my wife and I both accepted them generally in favor of relocation for her and getting my dream job. 

**Job1**

*Job1* is a decent job that will carry me through to retirement in a company that seems to have an excellent climate for my personality and will be relatively rewarding but little in the way of challenge. I consider myself a driven person; I value challenging environments and the opportunity to be surrounded by people smarter than myself and always learn. *Job1* was never my dream job, but qualifying for my dream job coincidentally qualified me for *Job1*. Most people would not look back at a career with *Job1* and think they had left much on the table. It's with a reputable company doing things most people would consider are net gain for the world. 

*Job1* would allow me to live in the same location for my entire career if I wanted. This is not something particularly appealing to me, but in my wife's opinion, this is close to the top in priority and plays a big part in why I'm having such a hard time with this decision. 

**Job2**

*Job2* has been my dream job since I was a small kid. I had an abusive dad with whom I could always connect on the subject of this job. *Job2* is a sexy, high-profile job. It's high risk, high reward, constantly challenging, and extremely exclusive. Probably because of my issues with my dad, I attached a huge amount of my self-worth to *Job2* over my life. There have been many times in my life when I had turned a corner and thought I had excluded *Job2* from possibility. At the very last opportunity, I submitted my application, was disqualified on a technicality, and then slid in under the wire on a policy waiver that has never been done before or so I was told. Because of the roller coaster I've been through over the past year, getting the offer for *Job2* hit me especially hard; I was dazed at first and then overcome by emotion. It's been quite a ride. 

*Job2* directly conflicts with the key features of *Job1*. It moves frequently and generally to locations and social climates that disagree with my wife. The moves are so frequent and unpredictable in *Job2* that my wife would have a difficult time keeping career momentum, something that's important to her. 

When I came to my wife with the great news, she was also dazed and overcome by emotion but much differently than me. She had developed a strong attachment to *Job1* which had been offered 4 days earlier. We've had spirited discussions and eventually thoughtful conversations about what we should do for the family. It's clear that my wife prefers *Job1* for the purpose of living in one place, keeping her career risk low, and providing many opportunities for our kids. 

In addition to the qualitative measures of *Job1* vs *Job2*, it looks like we'll have to get into some debt to get out of our house unless we rent it which will have a breakeven in a static market of five years. 

**The Decision**

I'm not really looking for advice on which decision to make, although I appreciate any insight you have. It seems pretty clear that the risk is lowest for *Job1* and it also has the best potential for total family productivity in a 20-year period.

The risk I'm taking by giving up the opportunity for *Job2* is my self-worth. I've attached everything I am to this job. I've been making strategic decisions for 11 years to get me here and it shouldn't have worked out but it did at the very last second. I'm worried that if I give up the opportunity, I'll never find another purpose. I'll never find another way to give everything I have. Worst-case scenario is I fall into depression and get fired from *Job1* as a let myself and my family fall into poverty and destitution. That's dramatic, I know, but this is the kind of sorrow I feel when I think about giving up *Job2*. 

How should I deal with this anxiety? How can I give myself to a new purpose after I willfully pass on this opportunity? I'm terrified of living an empty life. I left my legacy behind because I grew up in a toxic environment so I feel isolated and like I'm responsible for starting a family and legacy that will have strength to endure. 

Thank you for your insight and advice",15May2017,1
87,"So I've been friends with this girl for about a year now (I'm a boy) and I talk to her more than anyone else. Our friends are always joking about us being a couple and whatnot but we are only friends. I really enjoy talking to her as she's there for me a lot when i want someone to talk to, as I am for her. However, during these last 2-3 weeks, it feels like our conversations over text are just forced, as well as her almost never talking to me now at school, and her seeming like she'd just rather not talk to me. She has seem to have gravitated to another one of my other guy friends, and I can't help but feel a but jealous.

92,"So about two years ago they park their car. Yup , it hasn't moved for about two years. Because they have cut the grass next to their sidewalk, and they haven't moved the car, dirt built up under the car and now plants are growing on the road under their car and EVEN INTO MY DRIVEWAY. 
I actually cleaned it up once for them, like 10% of it anyway and it was a huge fucking hassle. That took me 44 minutes. 
So; should I tell them? They're pretty dangerous people. And we've been telling them to put a screen on their fence because their pit bulls can reach into our house and bite a kids arm, and I think we've mentioned it idk maybe about seven fucking times. 
And I can't contact the city about because they'll know it's me anyway, tho I haven't said anything so far.

94,"Hey everyone,

Last Thursday, my roommates came back from a party at 4am and decided to play CS:GO. After a while, they began screaming and woke me up. They failed to realize that I have an 8am the next morning. When I told them to shut the fuck up, one of them told me to fuck off while the other was too occupied with the game to respond. 

As a result of their actions, I was unable to fall asleep for the rest of the night. The following day, I found that I was barely able to stay awake in my 8am, which will make the upcoming final quite difficult.

However, one of my roommates is depending on me for a ride to the airport when the quarter ends. Additionally, he is also counting on me to hold some of his belongings for the summer. If I left him at school, he would have nowhere to go because his parents live 6 hours away and he does not have any close friends here.

Do I leave him here or do I take the high road?

One reason why I'm having such a hard time being the better person is because he is quite annoying. He insists of heating up our room to 75F during the winter. He is always attempting to talk to me while I am studying. Obviously, I should have talked to him like an adult, rather than ignored his actions. I can't help but feel that these minor grievances is affecting my ability to act rationally. 

Edit: I've read all of your responses and I've decided to tell him that I cannot help him. Thanks for preventing a stupid 18 year old from making bad decisions!",15May2017,2

98,"I'm a 21 year old American university student (from the USA, not the literal ""American University"" in DC, FYI) and I have recently come to the realization that I may have chosen the wrong university and wrong major(s). It is too late to change both because I'm finishing up my junior year, so I am left with a couple options:

Keep on with both majors - French and International Relations - until I finish university, and overload classes on the latter because I'm behind on credits. In short, suck it up and finish what I started.

Drop the IR major, which is where I'm behind, and which is the one I don't like very much, graduate with a French major and be probably happier in university but then wonder ""now what do I do in life with only a French major?""

Drop French, focus on IR because it's more ""practical"" - would still be somewhat happy because of a reduced course load, but it'd still be somewhat of a pain in the ass.

102,"I don't know how to start this. Maybe, before anything else I should mention that I am not suicidal or anything.

Anyway. I'm 21 years old and for 3 years I have this ridiculously fear of death. I went to Greece for studying 3 years ago. My aunt and her family lives there but other than that I didn't know anyone over there. I didn't know the language. So I felt so alone during my 9 months of struggle to study despite to Greek Economic Crisis and relatively expensive life. I couldn't attend to school that time due to some bureaucratic problems between Turkey (Yes, I'm Turkish citizen) and Greece, also some paperwork difficulties. 

So I stayed in a country for 9 months all alone. There was no one I talked. I have 2 cousin but they are small. I wanted to have conversations but I couldn't because I couldn't find anyone to talk. I tried to find some friends but people most likely to talk in Greek rather than English. So with this lonely mood my sleeps were getting annoying. I couldn't sleep because I started to overthink as soon as I close my eyes. My thoughts were so loud. After few months my thoughts were about death. I suddenly realized that I'm going to die.(Like didn't know it before) But this realization is so strong, so strong that even makes me cry like babies. If I see an intense death scene from a movie, or think about my parents and my grandmother or see a video about universe itself I have this constant feeling that I'm going to die and probably miss so much thing.

In the summer of 2015, one night I went to bed. I closed my eyes and out of nowhere I started to feel like I was dying at that moment. I never had such terrible experience. I thought I was drowning or something and there was no way to run, death is inevitable. I cried and couldn't sleep till the sun rises. Next day I went to psychiatrist. She diagnosed me with Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

I had some medication therapy. My doctor said after finish these pills come back again. I couldn't have time to go back cause I moved to another city. But time to time I still have this fear, makes me awake and cry. My desire to run away from inevitable is huge. 

My last 21 years, I couldn't live the way that I want. I missed so many experience. People are having sex, they're being loved, they had girlfriend/boyfriend they loved, they've seen Paris or Berlin, learned how to play flute, went to concerts or festivals with their loved ones, get drunk and so on...  I haven't done almost any of them. Instead, I'm still trying to cope with this fear of death, lots of anxiety and daily problems. More I try to fix myself, more I sink to the bottom. 

Please give me an alternative way of thinking, so I can move along.

108,"Hi!
For the last 3 years I've worked as a venue bartender through an agency. Typically I receive a text at the start of the month listing dates (4-6 a month on average) of shows and I text back my availability.
I live with my parents and for the past month things have been very tense around the house because of circumstances beyond my control. They require that I pay a percentage of my wage as rent as long as I am working and contribute with chores etc. to the household when I am unemployed or in college.
 I recently ended my term in college and there was massive pressure on me to get a full time job or else I can't go back in the new term. So long story short I found it very difficult to get a job, and accepted some dates for barwork at the start of the month under order from my parents, and then I got lucky and managed to get a really decent full-time temporary clerical job.
 So I now have two jobs, one full time and one maybe once a week. I managed to balance the two ok, going to my full time early so that I could leave earlier and make it in time for the bar job.
Today, however I have screwed myself. I mistakenly thought that a show was tomorrow instead of today, and thought nothing of booking a weekly therapy session that I've been attending the past few weeks for a few issues. The therapist made special arrangements to see me extra early before my full-time work so that I could make it in for the last clock in.
This means I got in at 10am and can leave 6pm at the earliest. 
I got a text from my bar contact confirming the start time of the show for 5.30 today...
I messaged her and told her I had a health related appointment this morning and combined with traffic meant that I started work at the latest allowed time,  meaning I had to stay late and would not make the show.
She just sent me a text back saying it's gonna be a really huge night and she really needs me in ( with exclamation marks!).

I dunno what to do. I've considered texting back and asking if I can turn up later, but suspect that will be unacceptable. Even if it is I will be over an hour late and likely only get 3 hrs work. I will also have to bother my parents or sister to drop my uniform in to me which is really not in the spirit of what I am trying to achieve through therapy.
I know I fucked up and got sloppy with my dates, I take full responsibility for anything negative that arises from this slip-up.
Any advices?",15May2017,3
113,"I've never been very happy with my life for more than a few months at a time and I want to understand why this is and what I can do about it. I have this really strong desire to just objectively lay out all the events in my life, and hear out some insight on what the fuck has actually gone on throughout my life.

This unhappiness has gotten considerably worse in the past year, my third year of college.

I moved away from a group of close friends a three years or so ago and the distance has become very real. The story of those kids impact on my life is a long one, but they basically fell in love with how I was really effortlessly smart (for the school) but had the social skills of a middle schooler. (Yeah I know, I'm a very unique redditor. /s) With their help and guidance, I went from going months without leaving my room to going to every dance, playing sports, going to every party, and at times even feeling like I was able to catch up four years and be a normal person my age.

Then I left for college, and I slowly but surely fell back into square one. That social experience gave me a hell of a head start, but I feel as if it did little to change who I am deep down. I'm miles ahead of where I was with small talk, but I still think very slowly on the spot, make irrational decisions, and freeze under pressure. Before, those traits would all play into my persona of being smart yet stupid. But these days I can't even say I'm smart anymore without feeling like I'm lying to myself. 

I don't really have anyone in my current city I can open up to like that group of friends. Without the accolades stacking up any higher than anyone else's anymore, people don't even have many superficial reasons to want me in their life. Tons of acquaintances I met in my first years, don't get me wrong, but no close friends. Roommates, role models, friends etc. in my current city are distant, and I wouldn't even know where to start with them. I feel like my life isn't even their responsibility at all, and I also wouldn't trust them with half the mistakes I've made and kept under wraps. I feel like the people they would open up to, they're 10x closer with than I am to them.

I think part of the issue is everyone I've met and ""befriended"" since I moved here is doing better than me at, well, everything. I have a circle full of people who had hot starts, like myself, only they managed to keep it going. They managed to maintain their popularity, not fuck up in school, get decent jobs, get girlfriends, etc... you can infer where I'm at in relation.

I feel as though I've let others respect for me up here completely bottom out. I have the feeling that the ten people I see the most joke about my latest embarrassments and my ridiculously ambitious, arrogant outlook on my future, considering how often I try and fail, humiliating myself in the process. I was never shy to being teased by people I knew, I considered it worthwhile learning. I'd almost always have something on them to fire back with and I guess that's just the friendly shit talk I miss. But when it's happening behind your back, presumably because they feel to bad for you to say it to your face, you know things have gotten bad. You start to lose perspective on how ridiculous you really do sound, and just become an oblivious parody of yourself.



**Anyways, to the point..**

I've considered therapy, but my insurance doesn't cover any mental healthcare in my new city. I know my parents would cover it out of pocket, but I'm the farthest thing from close with them. If the past is any indicator, there's no way in hell I could bring myself to talk to them about something like that. 
Are there any decent alternatives?

115,"Okay, so I've just had a big change in my life and want some advice on what I should do next. 

A bit of back story; I quit my shop job in December and decided to go travelling. I soon found out that travelling with organised groups is rather pricey, but as I am a young woman I wouldn't feel comfortable travelling alone. I was hoping I'd meet someone who'd be interested in going with me by getting a new job at a big company. I moved away from my home town and closer to London for this job (which is no special job) 2 months ago, and so far it's been a disappointment. The job itself is boring, being close to London doesn't seem any different to being in my home town - it's just as dull if not more so. And obviously I have no close friends nearby so I'm very lonely. 

I'm getting to the point where I want to go back home. I feel like I can do exactly what I'm doing now (i.e. have a boring job while trying to sort out travelling plans) back in my home town where I can be somewhere familiar and with people I know. But I feel as though I shouldn't go back now that I've left. I feel like a lot of people will be disappointed in me for moving away for only a few months and then coming back. I'm worried that I'll move back home and sooner or later I'll get bored and want to move away again. My dad keeps telling me I need to make my mind up and I can't float about forever.

I've been getting advice from friends and family, but they're all biased in some way or another. I know it takes time to fit in somewhere new, but I can't help but feel like it's pointless. I moved here for the job, and the job is not for me, so why not move back for a different job? 

TL;DR: moved away from home, don't enjoy new job/ new area, want to move back home.

Any advice is appreciated!!",15May2017,2
120,"So the fantasy currency basically consists of silver / gold coins and much larger silver / gold rectangular plates. But each coin and plate has 2 types, the first is set with red gems at the center made from the blood of a living demigod who rules the land, the second dosen't have these and are just silver and gold. Easy enough so far, the gemmless versions are as such, silver cons are worth 1, gold coins 10, silver plates 100, gold plates 1000. But with the gemmed version its difficult as the gems themselves are also a source of military power giving the one who drains the gems of their energy increased strength, regeneration, enhanced senses, almost like a drug. So while it would be easy to have the gemmed versions be worth say: gemmed silver coin 10000, gemed gold coin 100000, gemmed silver plate 1000000, gemmed gold plate 10000000. Each coin only has a single gem, while each plate has four, creating a strange inequality where a piece of currency is not necessarily equal to its actual value. for example the gemmed silver coin may be worth more then its actual intended value while a gemmed gold plate is worth far less.

124,"I was at a gas station filling up my car today and a gentleman pulled in across from me and was talking on the phone like he was in a hurry.

He asked me to spare a couple bucks so I gave him $8 in gasoline before he thanked me and shook my hand. He told me that his wife was in the hospital and was expecting and the whole time I was pumping gas he was on the phone talking to somebody. I didn't give him a lot of gas money but I'm just worried that it could have been a credit card scammer or something like that. Has anybody had experience like this or am I just being paranoid?

127,"Okay so let me preface this by saying that I've always had anxiety problems.  If anxiety was a hose, mine is turned on, full blast, all the time, aimed directly at my face.  That being said, it has gotten worse lately...

Basically, my mind starts grabbing at insane thoughts and then they cause constant anxiety, bordering sometimes on panic-attack territory.  Let me give you a few examples.

My cat has always been a source of one for me.  In the last place I lived, my roomies were drinkers/partiers and I constantly worried he would get out (he's an indoor cat).  Not a totally uncommon concern I'm sure, but it would bother me day, night, all the time, to the point where once I left work in the middle of the day (yep, middle of the day) to drive home and make sure he was okay because I was starting to feel a panic attack coming on.  I just moved, and even though both my new roomies are cat lovers, I'm worried he's going to knock over something precious to them, and they're going to ask him/me to leave.  They also have a basement where I keep his litter box, which is fine and perfectly safe, but I worry he's going to get stuck under something down there and die, or get attacked by something and die (in my own fucking basement)....

Work.  Yeah, work's a good one.  I maintain an almost comical paranoia about the safety of my employment, and how my employer thinks I'm doing.  I run the leasing for a major senior living apartment complex in my area, which is a job they wouldn't usually give to a 26 year old, but I have a good resume and great interviewing skills.  I generally get praised, but I CONSTANTLY worry about things going wrong at work.  Usually, I'm worried that they are planning to lay me off when I miss a sale, and when I am not at work I will stress pretty much constantly about things at work that I may have missed or may be forgetting, like emails I didn't send or tasks I didn't finalize.

Money, thank god, has been taken largely off the plate by the job I have, so that's one less

My girlfriend.  Here's a particularly insane one.  My girlfriend hasn't been as fortunate as I have with opportunities and advantages, so she's getting by but not by much.  She lives in a house that she likes but doesn't love, she's doing OK financially but not exactly well, you get the picture.  The problem is that I worry FOR her about things.  I worry that she cries herself to sleep at night because she wishes she was farther in her life, I worry that she feels rejected and unloved by people in her life (she doesn't have many friends, because she has trouble talking to new people), I worry that she is facing steep depression and anxiety and not talking about it (yes, my illusion about her anxiety is causing me anxiety), and then, this morning, I realized that on the current path she's on, she's going to be like many of the residents I have had to turn away.  Facing medical issues, no money, very few family members, and with no real way to deal with their problems.  I got a sudden and not insubstantial bout of anxiety because I was worried about what her life COULD be like 40-50 years from now.

The problem is that medical has never really helped me.  Drinking has, but I kinda try to avoid since I have dependency problems.  Marijuana can help, but I had to stop smoking to pass an employment drug test (though I could start smoking again now).

134,"Hello Reddit!

I just graduated  with my masters degree and accepted a rotational job, one that will last about 2 years at each location.  I really like the company, all the people that I met and even visited the plant I will be working at this past week.  I enjoyed my team, the culture, and overall the company and work environment seem to be a good fit and will be a unique challenge and learning opportunity for me. I am very happy with my new starting salary and have secured an apartment in a new city that I am starting to love.  There's no turning back now!

There is one catch- my new plant manager is a screamer.  I went into some meetings to be introduced to some of the staff and he started drilling some of the team and was yelling about someone's spreadsheet because it was slightly off.  He also berated someone because their cell phone went off in the meeting, meanwhile his phone rang loudly 3 times and he stepped out of the room each time.  My coworkers were tense when he was there, and when he stepped out everyone seemed to breathe again.  Everyone said ""Oh he's being extremely nice because you are a visitor and you are here.""

This scares the living sh*t out of me.  I am not used to working with individuals with such a temper and I am really nervous about this job now.  I report up to him, but luckily he is about 2 steps away in the org. chart.  My boss said ""We will talk about him later and everything goes in one ear and out the other.""  People don't seem to take him so seriously.

152,"I'm 23 and still on my parents insurance. I've had various health problems on and off since I was 12: migraines that lasted for weeks, stomach problems, anxiety and depression. We have a very strained relationship already because they are v. religious and I am not. Also I just graduated college and moved back in with them. 

About three years ago they took me to a doctor who did tons of expensive allergy testing on me that my parents paid for. I have recently found out that he is not board-certified and his tests are specifically not recommended by allergy boards. Because of those tests I have been eating a very restricted diet-- basically chicken and rice and fruits and veggies. My parents have taken the same tests themselves and also follow an extremely restricted diet. 

When I found out that the tests were useless I figured I should start reintroducing foods slowly, the problem is my anxiety has gotten tons worse over the past year and a half- I get panic attacks 2-5 times a week, and I have a lot of anxiety about food. I also get bouts of diarrhea 2-3 times a week. I have been losing weight and am now underweight and I have a lot of anxiety about food. 

I know I should see a psychologist of some sort, but my parents don't believe in them. And any doctor that I see they don't trust because they are brainwashed into a ""natural medicine"" mindset. I am jobless and don't have a lot of money... I am not really sure what to address first. ",15May2017,3
153,"My girlfriend and I have started having sex recently, I'm 19 and she's 18 so this should be pretty normal, as we've been dating a couple years.

Sex has always been hard to do for us because of our parents philosophies on it.

My parents have always gotten very upset when I have her over to our house and go upstairs in a room with her to watch movies, they are very conservative, ""no sex before marriage"" types. They don't even like me to have any type of romantic alone time with her honestly. They always threatened to not let her come over any more and it really stresses me out... I really like adding sex to our relationship and think it would be unhealthy for us to just let it go because of my parents. My parents have never caught us having sex in my house but they have always been very suspicious any time I leave their sight with her in another room.

Her parents are better but not better in a way. They don't let us go upstairs (pretty much so we can't have sex) and because of that, there's pretty much no place in the house where we could have sex uninterrupted with them in it.

At least one of my parents or my sister is pretty much always home and it's pretty much the same case with her family except her brother and her parents.

I feel really upset about this whole situation and would like to have some comfortable place to have sex with my girlfriend of a couple years but it feels impossible sometimes and really bums me out.

158,"I've written 4 seasons worth of an original television series idea revolving around a fantasy setting and have no idea how to begin getting it made.

Obviously getting a pilot made would be an ideal next step but I just don't have the connections or know-how to do it myself. What I'm looking for is an animated series, *not anime* and I have absolutely no talent in animation. I can draw OK on paper, not so much on a computer. I can voice act (I have experience with it, not just saying ""oh I could maybe""), but not every character that's for sure. What I need is animators, other voice actors, some other writers, someone for music etc and I don't know what else. I don't know anyone that could do this, no longer studying so I can't really connect via University to talents there. None of my friends / relatives have the skills I need either. Is there a company / association / somewhere I can go to find people that would gain an interest in my idea and want to work on creating at least a pilot with me? One of my biggest concerns being security and integrity of my series. Only thing worse than having my show made in it's entirety without crediting me would be if it were to credit me but be changed beyond recognition, or edited to the point where it's lost what made it original and special. 

It would be preferable if there were such a place in my country - New Zealand - to help me get started, but if there is nowhere locally I will fly internationally if it can help me for sure.

I tried finding something close by but the commute is not realistic its about 3 buses and sometimes 2 if I'm lucky. Most of the jobs are about 15 minutes by car but the bus ride is 1 hour minimum. I thought about moving downtown but rent is very expensive minimum $1,000 all the places i've looked at.  To get a room at my sister's place I pay $400. 

I'm originally from Montreal so rent is A LOT more cheaper there and I was making about the same salary there. I simply came here cause I thought school would work out but it didn't.

The problem is right now I have nothing to offer a potential new country. I'm a stay at home parent who hasn't worked a job in several years. 
I'm also attending my local community college for a degree in Sociology. It's not too late to change my major tho! Please tell me what country you live in and if possible what sort of degree would make me a useful sort of person so that I can move myself and children away before we go full on Gilead over here. 
Any advice would be really great!

Clarification: My issue is not ""boo hoo poor me I'm a liberal and I sometimes encounter people of differing view points"" My issues is career politicians  who are only concerned with the money they can raise. My issue is that when I had my daughter last year it cost me over $4000 out of pocket even though I was fully insured. My issue is Mandatory Minimum sentencing and cutting funds to education while pouring billions into our defense budget. My issue is ""Red Days"" where I can't let my kids go outside because there's a blanket of smog that causes them to cough and wheeze. Meanwhile my local politicians are calling porn our biggest health issue and the federal government is trying undo the minimal climate change restrictions put in place by the last administration.

For some reason I get depressed throughout the day and feel pathetic when I compare myself to other guys. Even just watching them makes me down. Like at work for example, guys are always socializing and having a good time while I'm the quiet one. They know how to talk to women and seem smarter than me.

Fortunately I know basic knowledge. I'm capable of being a cashier and I learned a few things in college. Others just use better vocabulary words, seem to know way more, and aren't an introvert like myself. Now I'm no guy to complain and do nothing about problems. I like to work for what I want. What do I need to do to become smarter and/or more sociable?  I've been a loner in high school and college so I don't know if that has something to do with it.

171,"How does one go about dealing with the type of people who don't outwardly offer any conversation or input, do not talk or express anything of their own opinion. But simply hangs around to listen to others(or me), always keeping track of conversations of others, and when they come across you making a mistake, or saying something they disagree with, they'll immediately swoop down and take a bite outta you.

You know, like a vulture? Always circling overhead, waiting for the time to strike., but a social version of it.

For context, I'm in my early 20s, back in my teenage years, I used to be more aggressive if I encountered such situations. But as I try to transition myself into a right and proper adult, one thing most of these ""people"" seem to react to is to call me ""childish"" and disgustingly try to play off themselves as taking the high road if I react aggressively to any social situations at all, even when they are the ones who are taking a massive shit on me :/

Basically, what am I supposed to do? And why do I feel like I'm the only one who sees the hypocrisy of the ""adult"" world , where everyone just seems to have a massive fucking chip on their shoulder and try to play themselves off as the ""big man"" CONSTANTLY with some sense of smug arrogance, when they themselves are the massive assholes(in my opinion).

In a way, I find myself very sidetracked by my social experiences as I age because I feel like everything has become a giant pissing match in my 20s. A good majority of my conversations has become someone subtly or overtly insulting me, where in I either take the hit and bite my tongue and look like a fool and the guy gets away with his ""win"", or if I confront and snap back at him, he'll play the ""big man"" card and pretend to take the high road and make it seem like I'm a raging child while he's plays himself off as the mature dude for social points.

tl;dr ""Yo what the fuck is your problem dude"" doesn't cut it for me anymore because I'm trying to discipline myself and transition to a less emotionally explosive adult compared to my high school/college years.

So... I'm 25 and it looks to me that I don't have a passion for anything. I'm a very creative person and I've done many things over the years (writing, shooting videos, editing, photography), but none that stuck with me.

I still love all of these things that I've mentioned, but I don't have a driving passion for any of this. I'm talking about that kind of passion that keeps you up at night working on your things and you want to constantly push the boundaries.

I've never did something like this. Maybe because I'm mainly lazy. I need a dedadline to finish anything, otherwise I wouldn't do it. I need a task, because otherwise I wouldn't have the discipline required.

Maybe I don't have a real passio for anything. Or maybe I still need to find what my real passion is. What do you guys think?

* I'm 26 Male, and my girlfriend is 24, we live in different cities in Brazil.

* She always fended for herself, she was always that kind of girl that fights for better things for herself and always tried her best. For example, she always payed for her own stuff, she always worked as intern for a bank and later for and engineering company (it was there that I met her). During this time she used to work from morning to afternoon, than in the afternoon attend to her english classes, in the evening attend her college classes and around 11PM went to the gym. All that paid by herself.

* But after those years, she didn't finish her college graduation (even though just 1 more semester and she would've graduated) and has been terminated from her internship. she spent about 6 months unemployed, and got a job as a cashier at a supermarket. It’s been almost one year since she got this job and ever since it seems that she gave up on life, she just ""exists"" now, she doesn't want to finish college anymore, she doesn't want to go to the gym anymore, she just want to watch netflix, stay at home and ""rest"". It seems as she doesn't want do anything anymore. 

* Recently (about 2 weeks ago) she tried to get a transfer to the city that I live, so we could have a life together, but that was denied(but we have other options in the near future), after that it got even worse, she doesn't talk to me as much, she doesn't want to go to her english classes anymore. Even though I try to be uplifting and complacent about her situation (and try to see from her point of view), every time I mention how we should work together to change it and make things better she just ""ignores"" me and don't respond (it's her self defense mechanism), sometimes I send her many options and ways that I can try help her, but she doesn't respond. When I try to talk her about it she says she is not in the mood, or she is tired or some other excuse. It seems like she is running away from responsibility, and living this miserable life is now good enough for her. She is not remotely happy, but now she just want to stay put, and wait for life to be over it seems.

* I don't want to break up with her but lately is getting worse and worse, she is getting colder, more distant, and it seems like she is losing interest in life and in our relationship, just waiting for the time to pass. All of this is making me miserable, I can take and fight bad things when they come my way no problem, but when I see her suffering and can't help, or she won't let me help, I feel like I'm a useless junk and can't defend what I love the most.

* ps: she doesn't like to talk about her feelings, even when I try my best to make her trust me and feel secure and loved. she always has been this way, like she is protecting herself from the world, even from me (that makes me very sad and I said it to her).

* ps2: her mother is a very negative and bitter person (believe me she is bitter as hell), and she's always picking on my girlfriend and making her feel insecure about herself, she doesn't receive almost any love from her mother, and constantly is said that at her age she should've already moved out. I disgust her mother to say the least. But even so she listens more to what her mother has to say than she listens to me.

* ps3: I'm always very positive, and always try to uplift her spirit, even when things are bad, I always try my very best to make her feel loved, and to know that I'm always here for her. I'm not jealous in any way, I'm super chill, and always think what is best for her even when it sometimes means I get the bad part of the deal, or get myself hurt.

* ps4: we have this relationship about 3 years, we lived in the same city about 1 year, after that I had to move to another city to get my masters degree. So in the last 2 years we talk everyday by messages (she doesn't like to talk on the phone) and we skype about once a month (and that makes me a little sad as well, that I don't hear her voice as often). About 4 times a year I go back to her city and spend a week or so with her.

* ps5: sorry for my awful English;

He was released on probation and hasn't had to register as a sex offender for some unclear reason. We decided to give him a second chance and he promised he would never do that again. To help him out we put him on our cell plan.

About a year ago we noticed he had a ton of apps that a 40 year old single guy wouldn't have any interest in on his phone. Tumblr, Kik, Twitter, etc.. We didn't say anything about it then because we didn't want to jump to conclusions. 

We looked at our cell bill and saw Steve had sent over 1400 text messages. In previous months he rarely sent 30 a month. Out of curiosity we looked at the text log and found a number in Ontario, Canada that he's been texting almost non stop since at least March 26th of this year. 

I couldn't find the number on Facebook linked to any accounts so I decided to download a free texting app, randomized a number and texted this number fishing for a name. I pretended to be trying to find someone I went to school with and found out her name and that she's still attending high school. 

Here's my question: should I go to the police with this? I know Steve has no family in Canada so it wouldn't be a niece, cousin or even illegitimate child.

If he is honest, what are my options? We told him in 2013 if he did this again we would kick him out of our lives.

Sometimes he'll give a greeting back but most times he'll just not say anything and look me dead in my face. So then at this point I decide whatever he don't want to say nothing I won't say anything, then randomly this is when bossman decides he wants to start saying hi to me and patting me on my back. So now I'm like damn I'd probably be a jerk then if I don't say hi anymore, but then I greet him and it's back to saying nothing and looking me dead in my face. So now I'm at the point to where whenever I see him coming up I have a mini mental breakdown in my head debating what to do. I'm just wondering if I should talk to him about it or just continue with my mini mental breakdowns?



TL;DR
I greet my boss but sometimes he'll respond and other times he'll just not say anything and stare at me, should I say something?",15May2017,1

I haven't spoken to her in a year. Should I go into the interview and tell the interviewer that I will give her that reference later on in the day?

214,"Hey guys and gals, today has been absolutely crazy and my mind is running a mile a minute. I need some help.

I'm from Wisconsin and I recently started an internship for a small technology company in my college town in Wisconsin. I'm mostly doing marketing stuff for them. Although this opportunity is wonderful and relatively close to home, I don't find much enjoyment out of it and it doesn't coincide with my major (management).

I applied for an internship in Atlanta for the summer back in March as my old boss now works there and asked me to apply for an internship she is offering. I got an email from her today informally offering me the position for the summer. This opportunity coincides more with my major and seems like something I would enjoy more, but is much further from home.

To recapitulate my thoughts:

Wisconsin job
Pros: Close to home.
Already paying for a place there. 

Cons: Don't enjoy it.
Not entirely related to my major.

Georgia job
Pros: Related to my major.
Love my old boss.
Chance at more independence.

Cons: Will have to pay for housing in the summer on top of my apartment back home.
Very far from home.



Financially, my parents are ultra supportive and will help me if I need it, but I hate asking them for help as they've already done so much for me. 

The pay for both jobs is about the same.

I think I'm leaning towards Georgia, but would like some other opinions.

Thought?

216,"This guy has been gradually getting more grating over the past ~1 year and I know that he doesn't like me.
I'm in the equivalent of high school and I only see him in school, he doesn't seem to hang around with any of my other friends outside of school.
I'm willing to be civil with him and I don't escalate things but he's getting more confrontational (nothing serious) and this is getting on my nerves.
He does things like say my name over and over and is just generally condescending not only to me but to other people as well.

217,"Let me preface this by saying I have insurance through my employer *and it is shit*. They cover nothing until I meet the $2000 deductible and the only reason I got it was because they contributed to an HSA. 

So I get migraines every week. Sometimes once, sometimes twice. I'm still trying to find what can make them stop. 

I started with a new doctor last year because I've never had a primary (military brat) and I'm new to the area. 

It seems like every time I talk to her about something she hears me out and listens, but wants me to come back for followups and this and that constantly. 

Insurance doesn't cover anything so I pay $80-$150 each visit and my HSA only has a few hundred in it. 

The main issue:
She prescribed me Maxalt. 5mg since I have a very bad time with the other triptan I've taken (Sumatriptan). She gave me like six pills which would last me like two, three weeks if I'm conserving but still suffering. She did not give me ANY refills on it even though I communicated to her that I was getting 1-2 migraines per week. Last Wednesday the pain was so bad I nearly went to the ER because I couldn't walk, but I had no pills to help. 

They called me today to schedule another appointment because  ""she doesn't think I should be taking this many pills and we need to review the dosage"". Basically I have to pay another large sum of money to go over this shit that I feel should have been taken care of the first time. 

Is she purposely just trying to get me to pay her practice and banking off my suffering or is this just something doctors do? ",15May2017,1

230,"I don't want to get too detailed for privacy reasons, so I'm gonna try my best: 

I work in a high school as an assistant who helps run a department with another person who is a certificated staff member, I am classified. 

This person keeps taking advantage of me and lies and it's annoying and she is extremely unprofessional. Because this is a school, one of us must be in the room at all times, yet I feel like she's gone a LOT. 30 minute coffee breaks, saying she'll be in one place to go help somewhere, but gone for almost an hour...and when I went to go check to see if she was there...she wasn't...stuff like that. 

She also gets mad a lot and cusses a lot and even though it's in her office, if her door is open, people can hear. STUDENTS can hear.

Most recently, she got upset at a student who sent her a pretty mean e-mail reply. I agree, the student was a jerk, but she was sitting in her office, complaining about it to me, yelling very loudly when there was a double class in the room...and I saw a lot of kids turn their heads. What she said was: 

""Such a f*cking a**hole, he's going down now blah blah blah""

She does this quite often. The sad thing is, she had been going off for about 5 minutes on this kid and I started voice recording it on my phone, but after doing so, I realized my state is a two-party consent state, so I can't even use that against her, without getting myself in trouble, legally. 

There have also been such cases where she has said some mean stuff to me and has just been very odd with me, like very rude but then when she sees I'm upset, she starts telling me not to be upset over and over like a crazy person. 

Today, a person who is supposed to come help out after school couldn't make it; she couldn't make it a day last week too because she had a family member die. The person told me on Friday that she wouldn't be in today (Monday) so I relay this information to my co-worker. 

My co-worker's response was, ""Oh, I hope you said something snarky and asked her if she had another family member die or something."" 

I wish I had said something. But I didn't. I couldn't. I was too in shock. 

The thing is, this person is SO emotional. I have heard her on all kinds of personal calls, and I have seen her argue with colleagues, etc. She's very emotional and takes things very personally...it's pretty bad. 

I have talked to a supervisor is who an admin at this school. I check in with him every now and again and update him, and I do keep a log of everything questionable that she does. 

But I am just really starting to find it unbearable to work with her. I do suspect she is bipolar; I know she has gone through and is going through a lot of personal stuff, but a lot of the things that I witness, I do not think are the actions of a sane person, let alone of a person who should be working with kids. 

The comment she made today...I just can't get over. I'm disgusted and have lost any shred of respect for her. 

The kids also don't care for her and no one respects her. She makes rules and then she lets kids bend the rules and so it makes it hard to enforce anything. 

What else can I do? 

I like my job and I like my job site. I don't want to look for other work because I really like it here, except for having to work so closely with someone vile like her. I shouldn't have to leave or get transferred to another school because of her. 

I'm wondering if it would be possible, if I talked to my supervisor...and if he felt it were right or had the power to do so...to swap her out with someone else in the same job as her from another school. All around I think that it would just be better because the kids don't like her, even teachers have some issues with her. And it would be good for her too I think, a new change of pace, somewhere else, different people, etc. 

Because it's a school and there's unions, etc. and stuff involved, I don't know what's possible, I don't know what's feasible, I don't know what's likely and I don't know what to do. I really cannot talk to her. And this is definitely a ""if you're going to strike at the king, you best not miss"" kind of situation. I cannot have things be awkward between us if I put something in motion and it doesn't go favorably for me. 

TL;DR very vile co-worker in a school. Cannot talk to her, not comfortable doing so, she is very emotional and it would be a mess. Want to do something about her but don't know what steps to take. My supervisor knows I have been having issues with her, but I don't know what can be done. This is a if you're going to strike at the king you best not miss situation. ",15May2017,2

I am just sort of freaking out, and I guess I just need calming down, i don't really have anyone I can talk to, as one of the big reasons I am going off to college early is to get away from my family.

246,"So I started a new job 6 weeks ago. Management have now asked me to interview for a position that I assumed required a Master's degree (something I do not have). I happily accepted the opportunity thinking they noticed my hard work or thought I possessed genius (something I also do not have). 
I have found out recently that they actually do think i have a Master's degree. 

To be clear, I have not lied on my cv or interview, or to any of my colleagues. I do have a bachelor's degree, and it is in the field related to the job, but it was a low mark - all of this is on my cv. However, I am a number of years out of university, and someone from management must have seen my age and assumed I had spent that time studying (I hadn't. I spent it high) and now they all think the same. I found out from a colleague in management at another part of the company, who can be trusted not to say anything. 

My question is: do I tell them, or go to the interview and see how I do? 

If they ask about or mention a Master's I would not lie, but if I interview well otherwise, isn't that good enough? 

Or if I get the job and they actually do their due diligence properly and I get found out? (Remember, there is at least one copy of my cv somewhere in the office). Could it come back to bite me in the ass? 

Is it morally wrong? (I would like to point out that this job, if done badly, would harm no-one).

I asked her to prom, but she again declined. We still stayed friends. I even gave boyfriend advice to her on occasion.

Freshman year of college, I don't think I was very...emotionally stable. I constantly vented to her and shared my worries, to the point where she told me I was relying on her for far too much. We had a psychology class together the first semester, so we studied for tests together. During the second semester, I asked her to hang out several times, but she didn't want to, and I could tell she was making up excuses. I brought it up in a text, and she suggested we stop being friends. In the moment, I agreed, and we haven't spoken since.

In the remaining years of college, I walked by her on the sidewalk on occasion, and we'd smile awkwardly at each other. It's now been over four years since then.

260,"Probably a ridiculous question but hear me out: I am visiting my grandpa, who is an odd man, but my favorite person in my family, he likes to fix things in... unique ways. He has a light in his house that is part of the house (it's not just like a lamp or something that can be replaced) and when he changed the lightbulb recently it stopped working, he tried putting the previous bulb (one of those cork-screw shaped energy-saving ones) back in and it didn't work either, and he says he already looked at the brass contact in the end of the bulb. He screwed it in about half way and then (I guess the bulb is a little small for the diameter of the socket) tilted the bulb to the side a bit and it worked, but when he screwed it in all the way it did not work. So he has used a nail to ""fill in"" the gap between the bulb and the contacts at the side. I know absolutely nothing about electricity, so this seems dangerous to me, either because it may shock someone who touches it, or because it may present some kind of fire risk. He is always fixing little appliances and I think is pretty sure of what he is doing when it comes to electricity, but he also sometimes does things he knows are dangerous for reasons like ""it saves money"" or ""it's good enough as-is"". If it is dangerous can someone please explain to me why it is dangerous? If it is not dangerous I am happy to leave it alone, he always does unconventional things like this and my family is always harping on him for it, I only care if it is actually dangerous because he does live alone and is old enough that his sense of smell isn't great, so if it was actually a fire hazard I'd be concerned. I'm also slightly concerned that someone who is visiting and doesn't know about it might have some kind of accident. For reference the light in question says MAX 100 watt A19 on the side, and the bulb is a 9 volt bulb.

It turns out that wasn't true, and for the last 4 years I've been paying an automatically deducted service fee for having two Checking accounts, instead of one of each account like I thought I had.

I was unemployed for 60 days and during that time, my ""Savings"" account was apparently in the negative. It was at $-5 which, you guessed it, is the automatic service fee for having two Checking accounts. 

I got back to work and resumed my direct deposit into my ""Savings"" account as usual, but Wells Fargo deleted the account. Instead of alerting me that I was in the negative, or charging me an overdraft fee, or taking it automatically from my other account, they closed it without sending me so much as an email.
