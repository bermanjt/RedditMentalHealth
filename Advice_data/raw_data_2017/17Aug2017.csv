0,I need help knowing how I can deal with it. I'm going into a tough school year and a demanding sports season and to make things worse my dog of 13 years is slowly getting worse. What do I do? Any thing to help would be great. Thanks.,17Aug2017,2
1,"Hello everyone.  I need some objective perspective here.


I've a friend who makes very poor and debilitating choices that fill me with a deep seeded rage, and I don't know what to do.  Her choices come in the form of her giving the little she has to support toxic family members who have no second thought about walking all over her and depleting her of everything.  The most recent event was her brother totaling the only form of transportation she has, that she scraped up her last dime to buy.  Was that the first time he totaled her vehicle? No, the second.  She didn't learn from the first.  She seems to carry an irrational fear of him going without, or being in a poor position that she could have prevented, so she gives and gives and gives, in spite of knowing she is going to get the shit end of the stick.  To her, putting up a line and saying, ""No I will not help"" = Abandoning her family.   She lives in a perpetual state of poverty (Mentally, emotionally, financially) because everything is funneled to dear brother. 


Early on in my friendship with her, she would confide in me and I was a support system, I just thought she was going through a rough time and things would get better, but as the years went by and I realized this was ""normal"" for her, and I started to blow up out of frustration.  You know, like, ""SAY NO TO HIM!"" ""DO NOT LET HIM USE THAT."" ""DO NOT GIVE HIM MONEY."" I was trying to protect her; she stopped confiding in me because all I did was ""lecture"" her, and now she thinks I don't care about her, or that I don't understand, etc.  We ended a 5 year friendship over this, and were unable to carry a successful romantic relationship because dear brother &gt; me.  


It's now been months since we have spoken.  At first I felt free. Like, it felt good to not worry about her and her toxic choices, or to be told I don't care when I feel I am the only one in her life who actually does.  I just let it all go.   I will stick by someone and fight with them if they have a willingness to change, in her case, I felt it was stagnant.  In my absence, she is still making those same shitty choices (worse, yet, because dear brother decided to get his gf pregnant....) but I am beginning to feel a little bad knowing she's suffering with no one to talk to.  Like, if she's going to make shit choices regardless, I'd rather her have someone to talk to during the aftermath, than have her just cry herself to sleep at night.   


I don't know how to be a friend and listen to the results of her bad decisions without blowing up.  To me, it's cut and dry -- Don't want pain? Don't make choices that have caused pain.  For her, I don't think she has the emotional capacity to be that cut and dry regarding her family. But, I worry about her.  How the hell do I offer comfort when she makes bad choices, without letting it affect me?

9,"I think I was 8 or 9. My mother's cousin's husband and his oldest daughter, probably 17 then, were in the dark living room of my grandparents' house watching a movie along with all of the grandchildren, the 17 year old was the oldest of all the grandkids. 

I loved to have my back rubbed at that time, so I was going around the room asking my cousins if they'd scratch my back. I asked my cousin who is my age, he said no. Then I asked my girl cousin who was about a year older than me, she said she would for two dollars and I was like no shit I don't have two dollars. 

So I approached my uncle, the mother's cousin's husband, and asked if he'd scratch my back, he agreed. I didn't realize that it wasn't exactly right for your mom's cousin's husband whom you'd only met earlier that week to give a 9 year old a back rub, so I didn't hesitate, I just plopped down on the couch in between his legs. 

He started by rubbing my shoulders, but after about a minute he was rubbing my lower back. I was wearing a shirt where the end reached just where my shorts started, so when I sat down, a sliver of skin showed. It was his hands on my bare back. He even went a little into my shorts and started rubbing where my butt crack started, but nothing worse than that. 

I felt uncomfortable, but I remember thinking to myself that I had asked for it. I let it go on for maybe half a minute and I recall being super flushed, but eventually I got up as he was still going , I said thank you, then joined my cousins again as if nothing had happened. 

I never told anyone about this because I'm not even sure if it was considered molestation. I think that may have been the first interaction I ever had with that uncle. 

A few years later he was arrested for molesting his own daughters, surprise. But I'm just trying to figure out if what happened to me was molestation. I know that if it is, it's probably like the least harmless act, I know that's it's somewhere right on the line of appropriate and inappropriate. And I know that it was a little my fault because I did approach him asking for a back rub, and that's exactly what I got along with a butt rub. 

But I need to know if it is or isn't child molestation and if I should tell someone about it. ",17Aug2017,1

13,"Someone please, please, please offer me some advice regarding this. I'm going to Toronto next week to see a cousin I haven't seen in 19 years- she's visiting from Poland with her boyfriend. We are both extremely excited to see each other- she's two years younger than me and is closest in age to me compared to the rest of my cousins who are 10-20 years older than me. I am really happy that I am going to see someone who is my family and who is excited to see me. The only thing that concerns me about this trip is that my ex is from Toronto- and the last time I went there (in April) he dumped me before I went home and it was an emotionally traumatic experience to say the least. I'm worried that going there is going to make me really depressed. This past week I've been really excited about this trip, but I think all the 'excitement' is coming from memories of when I used to see my boyfriend, it's as though my brain can't register that he broke up with me and while he said he considers us ""friends"", he hasnt made an effort to contact me since April and I know he was just being nice- things are over. I have to keep reminding myself ""he's probably gonna know that you are in town based on what you post on instagram or facebook, but no, he does not want to see you and will not reach out to you. focus on seeing your family and try to forget about him"". I need some advice on how to mentally prepare myself for this trip as well as to not 'have my feelings hurt' when he doesn't acknowledge the fact that i'm in town or reach out to me.  it sucks that I still have strong feelings for him despite all he did as well as all the stress I went through while dating him. ):",17Aug2017,1

16,"I like a lot of things about my job and my boss is great in a lot of ways, BUT she also drives me crazy and several things about the job/how I'm treated have made me consider walking. I figure at this point I have nothing to loose so I'm going to talk to her tomorrow, about one thing in particular.

We have multiple, spoken word policy changes sometimes that happen within the same day. So and so can have a conversation with so and so and decide they like the way orders are being processed in another department better and suddenly that's the way we're doing it-I'm not even told that-and then I get in trouble for not doing it that way. Or I'm told the wrong thing. Or I misunderstand. The list goes on. It's happened so many times. The last straw was today when I asked for clarification and was chided because ""that was decided last week.""

I'm so frustrated and feel like I don't even know how to do my job anymore. I've lost confidence in my own accuracy. 

Here's the gist of what I want to say-I need policy changes to be submitted in writing and dated moving forward. I'll type them up if that makes the work load easier for others, but spoken word cannot override these memos unless it's a specific situation apply to an individual order. If I'm going to be held accountable for changing a step in a process it needs to be written down.

I don't think she'll like it because it will be a hassle, but I don't think what I'm asking for is unfair.

Now, my questions is this-how do I say this in a way that won't get me fired and what do I do if she says ""no."" I'm ready to walk if this doesn't get resolved because I'm at the end of my rope.

Next topic of conversation is how she speaks to me in front of other people when I make a mistake, but I don't think that's a topic of conversation for tomorrow...",17Aug2017,3
17,"I have new co-worker, and she makes comments that, while true, can be hurtful.  For instance, today she made a comment about one of my co-workers who has a fairly quiet demeanor.  And, I found her comment to be a  bit derogatory.  Basically she was saying that because of her demeanor, she wouldn't stand a chance in the 'real' world.  She said this while the girl was there, and I saw her sort of freeze up in embarrassment when she heard the comment.  

She does this a lot.  Comments on people's personalities in a way that feels sort of harsh and critical.  The thing is, a lot of what she's saying could possibly be true about people, but it just feels mean.  And, well, rude.

I have a wide variety of interests. Alternative medicine, Visual Art, Fashion Design, Aquatics, Sociology and Political Science, even owning a small business.




I'm not very wealthy, actually pretty poor. I'm not able to fund all my interests. Right now I'm just searching for how to make a living. I'm about to finish massage therapy school. I'm fairly good at it and it's a subject I find mildly interesting. However, I consistently hear that many people don't make enough money to support themselves just from massage or they burn out too quickly and leave the practice. This makes me feel unstable like in 5 years I will have to find a new career. 




I'd rather not have that happen so I keep thinking of other options for myself that would be easy to access. I've thought about becoming a lifeguard/CPR Instructor/Swim Instructor but kind of squirm at the idea at the same time. 



I keep switching from idea to idea thinking things like ""Well maybe I could turn (this) into a business..."" but then I have other ideas ""Maybe I could make this film I'm thinking of..."" or ""I really want to do a study on (this) behavior...""




Some people know what they want to do. But I've never been one of those people. And I've always had a hard time making decisions. I need to refine my choices or I'll be ""deciding"" forever.

24,"I just started school last Thursday. I just started at this school so I had to adapt to new people and make new friends. On the first day of school, during an assembly, a girl looked over to me, waved, and smiled. I waved back unsure if it was me she was waving to, but luckily it was me. 

The next day, I realized that this girl was in ALL of my classes. I would often look over at her, and see her quickly look away from me. It was a daily thing now for her to wave from me.

This happened yesterday: 
In my engineering class, we were put into groups made up of 4 people. I ended up in her group, and we became good friends. I also got to know her sister a bit too. I barely spoke, but she understood how I was nervous.

Today was even more weird. She actually started talking to me a lot, and we got to know a lot about each other. She opened up to me a bit, telling about some personal stuff, as did I. Eventually, when our groups split up and my class conversed amongst themselves, I overheard her talking about me to her sister. 

Do you think it's possible that she likes me? Or do you think she is just way to friendly? (BTW, I noticed she barely talks to many people, and is very antisocial, but she really warmed up to me.)

25,"Hello, I hope this is in the right place.

I'm new to dating after a one serious relationship, it seems like I'm in a cycle of meeting new guys, getting excited, but after a while they just pull back and the whole thing falls apart.

One guy claimed he was so busy with university, and expressed feelings of self-loathing and not knowing who he is anymore before being distant. (Would only reply to messages and complain about being busy) we had been talking intensely for three months  and he started pulling back weeks before he was finally returning back to our country.

The second guy, had two great dates the latest of which I spent the night at his (but we didn't have sex which he respected) but a few weeks after would only respond to texts if I sent messages first.
 He's a workaholic and travels a lot.
After two months of waiting I confronted him and he apologized, blames a promotion and his inability to hold a relationship due to always prioritising work. He says he wants to think about things before dating again because he just ends up disappointing the other person.

I guess I'm just wondering if this is normal or am I just unlucky with relationships? I would appreciate some advice.",17Aug2017,3
26,"I have been dating my bf (him 31) (me 25) for a year and a half now. Relationship is good for the most part normal dating hiccups here and there. We live together and have good communication in our relationship. A little past 6 months of dating, I realized my boyfriend has a friend that is a girl, let's call her sally. Sally has been friends with my boyfriend for a few years now. I normally don't care about my boyfriend having friends that are the opposite sex. Hell, his best friend is a girl (no history of them dating or hooking up )and her and I just adore each other and hang out all the time. Sally on the other hand does have a past with my boyfriend. From my boyfriends own words, he said they never dated but did have sex a few times but they ended sex because they were better friends.
Sally has been testing my patience. I'm a fair and very secure person so I didn't think them being friends was a big deal. But after month or two of her calling in the middle of the night and texting him all the time I had to have a talk with my bf and let him know, hey this is making me a bit uncomfortable because not even your best friend I get along with needs you that much. can you please put her in a place and let her contact you at reasonable hours and limit the communication. Clearly stated I wanted them to still be friends but it started becoming inappropriate. 
My bf understood and did just that it took awhile for him to do it but it happened.  Things were good until this past moth or two I don't know why but she messages him that she misses him so much and loves him (as a friend) invites him to shows, then today saying she's crying because she misses him so much.
Ive become so upset because I'm feeling disrespected. It's very clear what's going on and my bf doesn't see it. He says there just friends and not even that close and I ask if your not that close why is she acting like this.
I know the character of my bf and I know he is the rare breed of not being a  cheater. He is a loveable nice guy and I think people just love having him in their lives.

27,"Hello everyone, I'm feeling lost and confused and I would love to get the input of anyone willing to share wisdom gained from their experiences.

I'm 25 years old and I make decent money working in the field that I went to school for (I'm a software engineer/programmer analyst/your favorite title that describes this position). After graduating, the company I was interning at offered me a full-time position in my small hometown with a population of ~10k.

I've always fantasized about moving out of this town to a larger city and that this somehow would equate to me being happier. Recently, I've found myself looking up different cities around the US that I could see myself living in and even looking up the job market in those areas out of curiosity. I wouldn't like to move to a big city (not a huge fan of big cities) but I could see myself living in a moderate sized city of ~100k people that isn't as depressed as the area that I currently live in.

The idea of up and moving sounds great but it is also very intimidating. I have a very stable job that I would be leaving for a potentially less secure position. At the same time, I almost certainly would be seeing a significant pay raise wherever I went (I make ~60-65k with 3 years experience currently). I'm not extremely happy with my current position but I don't dread going in or anything like that.  I disagree with the companies outdated policies and I'm not at all passionate about the work I do. There aren't a ton of people that I would be devastated to be leaving behind but there are 4-5 core people in my life that I would see significantly less if I were to move.

Nothing is tying me down to this location right now and I'm young so I feel like I should go out and make these moves while I'm young and uninhibited. At the same time, I also have a nagging feeling that that is just the romanticized version of being young that everyone tells you and I'd be making a huge mistake.

I know I've left out a ton of details and didn't word this the way that I would have liked to but I would love to hear from anyone that could give me some things to think about or share their experiences because I'm totally lost in life and unhappy with where my life is at this point.",17Aug2017,2

42,"Hi all - I am looking some advice on my situation. My wife and I are unsure what way to go about the next step in our life and we want some input.

Let me lay out whats happened, the quick version. Born and raised in San Diego, worked as a full time Medical Biller but was terribly unhappy. We had it all, cars, house, lifestyle, etc. but we decided it wasnt what we wanted. We started a popcorn company on the side.

Soon we realized if we want to go anywhere, we needed to get out of CA and make our own path. We chose Vancouver, WA because we always loved the area &amp; it was affordable. So bam we had a retail popcorn shop up and running.

A couple months in, business slowed and we couldnt pay our lease anymore. At this point, we've invested about 65k of our 80k net from the sale of our home. Eventually we closed the doors &amp; filed bankruptcy.

Fast forward one year, we partnered with a friend to start a bag company. The company sustains itself but thats about it. We moved in to a rental from our friends parents and have been running the business ever since from the large garage/workshop.

Just earlier this week, we were confronted from our friends parents that they don't like the progress we've made in our lives (my wife and I are both 30 Years old!) and we have to be out in 60 days, well they are OK with 90 to be nice.

So here we are, zero income from our business, I've worked part time over the last couple of years to help keep food on the table but its not enough. We are very rural, very detached and we are both experiencing huge mental issues with depression, anxiety and panic attacks.

It's like we've come full circle, but this time we are crippled by our minds and our children will eventually begin suffering if we don't make a change.

Here we are no jobs, terrible credit (recent late payments because we have had ZERO income) and a bankruptcy on there &amp; zero in savings.

I should add. My wife and I have both applied for hundreds of jobs in the area. We've been interviewing and have never once been offered a position. Two dual bachelors degree holding individuals can't even secure a job at Burger King. Yes, I went in &amp; interviewed and was rejected.

Here's what I think my options are:

1. Move to Spokane, WA because we can drive for Uber &amp; Lyft with our current vehicle, and I am able to find a job caregiving over there. 

2.We also have tons of family back in California. The cost of living in San Diego is terribly high and we'd be sleeping on someone's couch (i'd assume). Rent on a place for our family would run about $2000/month plus all the other inlfated costs.

3. Choose to become homeless. Give up our two kids for adoption and get our finances in order.

4. Load up the gun and start shooting.

I'd like anyones advice. My wife thinks we'll eventually find a rental that will let us move in and pay the deposit over time. I on the other hand, do not. I know rentals are one of the hardest things to find, and without a verifiable income and perfect credit, I'm destined for failure in finding a rental.

Thanks in advance for your reply. I am very curious as to what others would do. ",17Aug2017,1

My friend took a course in the Spring, there's only three graded assignments for the class, all exams. She needed a 90 on the last exam to pass the class and she got an 88.  Professor says all grades are final. 


Two weeks after the class ended the professor posted an announcement online in Blackboard that be would be adding 4 points to all final exams. This should have brought her up to passing.


Fall semester is 2 weeks out and she sees that she's still listed as having failed the class. She emails the program director and is told that the professor ""went student by student and was as generous as possible"". Her final ran grade was not changed.


She wrote an appeal letter to the department head, and was told by the department head that the original posted announcement ""was a mistake"" and negates her claim.


She can continue the claim up the ladder to the Dean, but we're trying to figure out if this is something they can simply dismiss as a ""mistake"".

I know Reddit can't (and shouldn't!) help me find someone's personally identifiable information or contact information, because there's no way for the community to know I'm not being an awful human being.

That said, I think she told me enough about herself (non-identifying information) for a friend of hers to recognize I'm describing her. I don't know how much she remembers about me or the night we met, but I'm reasonably sure it will be enough for both parties to confirm they are who they say they are. To clarify, I'm *all but certain* she would like to get in contact with me, otherwise I wouldn't bother doing this.

I have the following pieces of information to work with:

* First name, uncertain of spelling
* Level of education and specialty
* Professional specialty
* A specific medical condition (not sensitive/private)
* City of her employment
* General physical description

The education and type of employment are sufficiently specific and uncommon to narrow the field considerably.

56,"I'm 15 years old and I am currently going into sophomore year of high school. This last year I went to online school after a clusterfuck of health problems I got hit with. I was very healthy before I was diagnosed with IBD, then Sleep Apnea, then Migraines, and then School Anxiety.  My parents didn't want me to take Online school but after a few months of attempting to goto in seat school they just gave in to Online School. I dropped out of my in seat classes for the second semester of 9th grade and switched to all online. Online school was great. I got A's and B's for all of my classes. I finally was learning. The only downside to it was my social life but I have 6 very good friends that I hanged out with often even out of inseat. My anxiety never was solved although. I have tried too many medications and all of them gave me horrible side effects. Some even worsened my anxiety. I don't remember the names for any them but they all didn't work whatsoever. Not just that, but all my health problems didn't get solved. This is were the problems rolls in with my parents. Now that school is coming back up I was expecting to do online again. My parents then appealed to me that I was accepted into this private school and I have the option of going back to the public school I attempted to goto. They told me that online school was not an option. I told them thats not even possible due to all my still relevant health issues. They haven't gotten better and in fact have gotten worse. They know this is the case. When I explain this to them they tell me I'm not taking online again. They threaten me by saying they will take away my phone, pc, friends, and money.  Even if I went into public or private school it is starting in literally two weeks. I can barely walk into a school, wake up earlier then 2pm, and go an hour without any stomach pain. If I went into the school I would be in the bathroom the whole time. No matter how hard I try. Anxiety and IBD don't mix well at all. With all these problems I'm dealing with they don't seem to have any sympathy at all. I really need help with this. I'm not sure what to do at this point.

70,"   My family lives across the street from an accidental death waiting to happen. A few nights ago, my elderly neighbor's husband was having a heart attack and the ambulance had to take him to the hospital. He had a severe blockage in his artery that they had to go in an operate on. 

   His wife is a major alcoholic, I've experienced her drunk paranoia first hand. So while at the hospital she was forced to be sober for the first time in awhile. 

   My mother, being the kind hearted woman she is, went with the elderly wife to make sure everything was alright. While sitting with her in the hospital, my mother found a shocking discovery. The wife has severe alzheimer's. The wife would constantly say, ""Did you know my husband is in surgery?"" and recount how her mother had alzheimer's as well, telling the story over and over again.

   When the doctor came out to tell the wife about her husband's condition and what medications he needed, my mother told the doctor that she had severe memory issues and she needed her in there with her during the talk. The doctor denied the request saying that only family could be in the room. So my mother relented and waited for the wife to leave the room. When the wife came out, she had no memory of speaking with the doctor. When the doctor came back to check on her a second time, the wife asked the doctor,""Did you know my husband is in surgery?"" The doctor then said that he would talk to her again and this time invited my mother into the room. My mother wrote everything down and handed it to the wife so that she could remember and left the hospital.

   Fast forward to today, my elderly neighbor called my mom and grandmother over to their house to help change the sheets and get the washer running. When they arrived, the linen was obviously changed previously and the washer was running. My mother asked when they got out of the hospital and her response was they just got home, however my mother found the discharge papers that said they got home yesterday morning. 

   My mom asked the wife if she went by the pharmacy to get the medicine and she said yes, but the husband gently said that he couldn't remember going to the pharmacy. They looked around the house and couldn't find the medicine she supposedly picked up, meaning she never did. 

   They then questioned the husband on his diabetes. He said he had to take oral pills regularly and had insulin shots that he needed to take as well. They found a massive stash of insulin shot dating back to 2013 and another set dating back to 2016. It's like he got the prescription filled in 2013, never used them, and then did it again 3 years later and never used them either. 

   This couple can no longer take care of themselves and their children and other family have completely disowned them. My mother is literally the only person who cares enough to help. We are shocked they have made it so long. There was old and rotting food all over the kitchen. 

   All that being said it is not my mother's responsibility to be their 24/7 caretaker. We want to call someone to come handle this situation and move them to somewhere they can be taken care of. However, we don't know who to call. Their entire family will not speak to them and we have no intention of getting that involved and speaking to them ourselves. Any suggestions?

TL;DR: Old couple lives across the street and the wife has alzheimer's and none of them have been taking their meds for the past 3 years. Family has disowned them and we don't want too get to involved in this mess. We need to know who to call to come and take them to somewhere where they can be taken care of. ",17Aug2017,2
71,"I don't really know why I'm posting this except in the hopes that someone can relate and maybe help me sort out some negativity that's been in my life for many years now. Just a head's up, this obviously deals with addiction and it's probably going to be super long. I'm sorry for that, but it's a lot of baggage. 
So, to jump right in. Growing up, my brother and I were super close. He was the eldest and I was the youngest, so I think that happens quite a lot. (My sister is my entire heart, but when we were kids I did what the baby usually does and gave her hell.) I have a few really good memories of my brother, but it's only a handful and I'm sure they've become a bit embellished in my mind because up until the last six years or so, I wanted to have him as a brother, not just a limb on a family tree. 
But anyway, he became addicted to drugs sometime in high school, I was still in elementary school then, and he did all kinds of horrible things like stealing money from grandparents. You know how it goes. He moved out of the house to live with his dad (seperate dads, same mom) and I would only ever seem him every so often. He hated my mom. 
Sometime while I was in high school, my mom jumped through every hoop she could to try and help him. She paid out of pocket for treatment, bought him a new car so he could get to a job. I mean, he's her son so of course she would do anything he asked. I don't know when he started using heroin, but that became the worst time of my life. Also mind you, all this time I've been dealing with an alcoholic dad too, and it was just a really dark time for me. I kind of checked out for a while because I couldn't handle the stress. No matter where I went, someone was about to die. A few more years go by with him cutting all of us out of his life. 
 He ended up getting his girlfriend pregnant while I was a junior (I think) and everything changed. Suddenly, my brother was different; he wanted all of us to be there as a family and I couldn't wait to be an aunt for the first time. My mom was so excited too, she was on cloud nine. Her first grand baby! That's a big deal, you know? 
My mom paid half of their rent on an apartment so her grandkid would have a decent home in a safe neighborhood and bought them a digital camera so she wouldn't miss anything. And this is the part where it turned to shit. When the baby was born she was born addicted. 
This is something that was completely kept from me. It started to get rocky, and my sister moved in with their dad too. My brother's girlfriend would straight up bully her and started to steal her things (their apartment was right next door to their dad's). I didn't know about this until recently, another reason I'm posting here. 
Obviously, we all crashed and burned.  We were no longer allowed to see my niece. Not even attend birthdays. No Christmas. No nothing. My mom, sister and I were devastated. We didn't know if my brother and his girlfriend were using again, we didn't know whether the baby was being cared for. My mom was actually invited to one birthday party and made the ""mistake"" of taking my sister with her. My sister ended up getting slapped. 
And that's when my mom decided she was going to court for grandparent visitation custody. 
My brother showed up in court with a novel of true stories he'd contorted into complete lies to make my mom look evil. For example, he nearly drowned once. He claimed that my mom had left him alone when in reality she dove right into the water since she was supervising like any sane parent does. 
She was gutted. The judge declined her petition but told my brother he should be ashamed of himself. I should also mention my mom is a social worker. She is around kids every single day. They come from horrible places and it's been her life's work to protect them. She was completely wrecked. And she's never been the same. 
One day we were shopping when we saw my brother. When my mom ran away, I ran into battle. He called me my old nickname. I snapped. I told him that I was ashamed to call him my brother. When my mom would see him sometimes after, she would run outside to cry her eyes out. Often he would turn around and give her his back. I started hating him then. It wasn't enough that he had broken her repeatedly for his entire life. It was never enough. 
So fast-forward to now. Two years ago my mom got a text from him asking if she would meet to talk. He missed her. (Mind you, no apology.) 
So now he's back, my mom has two grandchildren and he's clean and sober. My sister talks to him, they have jokes together. He comes for the holidays.
I want nothing to do with him. While my mom and sister were shattered, I was furious. I had to hold them up. I'm not complaining either, I would do it again. 
But suddenly I am the bad guy for not being able to forgive. Pardon me, but I have never been approached, looked at, nothing. I am NOT the one who needs to apologize and I won't forgive him until he accepts how much he fucked up and I think he understands the hell he put us through. I just can't. 
My mom wants me to talk to him. She says he apologized to her, that I shouldn't carry all this anger. But I have NURTURED this rage. It's not a weakness to me. 
My question is what would you do? Should I ""get over it?"" Or am I right? It's driving me crazy how my mom is pushing me to do it. And I want to for her. But I can't for me, and for all of their pain, if they makes any sense. 
I tried to cut it down to just the necessary information, but it's kind of a long story. I'd be here all night if I told everything that had ever happened. Thanks in advance. Xo.

81,"I'm a college student who lives with 3 athlete roommates in a house, all of us are 20F. I'm not an athlete. My roommates increasingly use our house to throw parties when their team wants to go out but there aren't any other parties going on. There's been times when I'm sick or just want to go to sleep early, and I've asked one roommate not to throw a party in our house and she essentially tells me she doesn't care about my opinion. 

By ""party"" I mean 40-100 drunk people, lights, loud music, drunks throwing up in the front yard, the whole nine yards until 2 or 3 in the morning. We live in a quiet suburban area and all the houses surrounding us are families with young kids, so I'm also concerned about a noise complaint that could end up getting us in trouble for hosting underage drinkers.

I just received word that they are going to throw a party with their team the **night before school starts** since it's the only time they don't have practice the next day. I told one roommate, who I'm closest friends with, that I have work early the next day (it's a Wednesday) and she said ""well we have school early the next day too"". I guess she's right but that doesn't mean they should keep me up all night and subject me to possibly having a shitty day at work and school the next day. 

I had a conversation letting her know what had happened with the first roommate dismissing my feelings, and she said she understood where I was coming from and that she gets that I don't want to live in a frat house. She said they try to only use our house when there aren't any other parties going on. 

I'll probably just go downstairs and join them and risk being exhausted the next day because arguing doesn't get me anywhere and I don't want to sit awake upstairs in my room and be pissed about it. My roommates and all their friends/teammates are my only circle of friends--granted, it means I have a lot of friends but I'd lose them all if I pissed my roommates off. I know I'm in the right and they shouldn't be throwing huge parties in our house on weeknights (my third roommate agrees but isn't ever home so the parties don't really affect her), but I don't know how to get them to stop or to compromise in a way that won't piss them off. I worried about it and stressed myself off all last school year to the point where I didn't talk to anyone and lost a ton of weight from being constantly anxious about my roommates. I like going out and being around them, and otherwise I like my roommates as people, but they're selfish and disrespectful when it comes to the parties. I've resolved to just party with them instead but I also don't want to feel like I live in a frat house and like I'm subject to every whim of this team of athletes.

I'm mixed race and  I get it... some people will ask about my nationality because they are curious. I let employers ask me this because I think is normal even when is not totally legal to do it. Today I got an interview for this position, interviewer asked me about my nationality, so I told him the usual ""my mom is from x country my dad from x country, but I was born in X country"". The doctor who interviewed me  spoke one of my parent's languages and he said that he loves the culture from this country but he had bad experience when working with this people (because they were lazy, left the job in 3 months) but he was willing to give me a chance because I had a good resume and he had a ""good"" feeling. 

Then, he ask me with whom do I live with? It was awkward, I told the truth but I didnt see anything relavant to the job, but I let it pass. (is it legal to ask that?)

He explained how much time and money will invest in training me, he will need to put me under observation and see how fast I learn, by the way there were two girls being under ""observation"" when I arrived. I know there is two position to be filled, he implied that this observation and the training I might not be paid for. The interviewer seemed to ""sell"" me a job with stuff like ""you will learn things you can use everywhere""""you will be hired everywhere"" ""you will learn to take electrocardiography "" I felt bad when he told me that I might learn electrocardiography, don't  get me wrong Im curious but I have a friend who spent 3 years in a program called "" Electrophysiology"" she can do electrogradiophy"" ( and she cant get a job and she studied for it. The only difference is that I dont have a diploma so they pay me less but my friend can ask for a higher salary and she deserves it to be honest. 

This clinic had a doctor who had his licence removed because of bad practises and I found out after the interview, it is the brother of the doctor who interviewed me.

At this point, It looks amazing that a company will invest in teaching me, but my ""gut feeling"" and these facts tell me to turn down that offer. I need a job, but I can survive for a few weeks more (for now) , but if I take it I feel like there is something wrong, I wouldn't be surprised if they cheated, lied or something. I can feel I can't  trust them,but I think about the money, the experience and HOW FLEXIBLE they are if I take a vacation or I go back to university. I'm not sure and I'm lost.

**Background**
Briefly, about me: I lived in a finished basement for nearly a decade. I know how footsteps, sounds, smells and voices carry. I also know that these are inherent conditions when you share a building with someone. That being said, I have always done my best to be a good neighbor and minimize the suck from my end; when I come home I take off my shoes, I disconnected my sub-woofers, use headphones when gaming or watch late TV, etc. I have never in my life had to call the police because of a person, nor have I had the police called because of me. I have never threatened anyone or been physically threatened. Despite practicing martial arts for decade and being well-able to handle myself, I have never been in a fight outside of a ring, and I would consider myself to be an extremely mild-tempered and patient person. Law abiding square, not even a speeding ticket to my driving record.
I moved to NJ from NY for work. Word-of-mouth on an apartment at a fair price 15 min from my job on even a bad day. The co-worker who referred me lives behind me on the second floor of a two family house. Our Landlord lives below her (we share a giant backyard). I live on the 2nd floor of my house and, initially, a family of 4 lived on the first. Things were fine for two years, screaming kids and all I never made one complaint or had a single problem with the family below. A year ago the family bought a home and moved out and in moved “Jane” (name changed).
At first, she seemed relatively normal albeit a tad neurotic ( wayyy too open with a stranger regarding her history, thoughts etc. but I suppose she was decent). A few red flags that I brushed off were 1. Her trying to paint our landlord as being a pervert who wanted her (told me the same story 4 times).  2. Constantly referred to the layout of house [of which she does not approve] as “polish” (meant as stupid, as she assumes our landlord is Polish when he is in fact Slovak). 3. She was a hardcore Trump supporter (half kidding here). Anyway a few weeks after she moved in her place flooded. She was so stressed and overwhelmed (did more complaining that take action) that I literally went into my cabinets and gave her a box of cleaning supplies, disposable box of rags, etc. I did everything within my power to make her feel welcomed. 
The only other important thing to understand is the layout of the house. It was definitely converted from a large single-family. There is a front door that leads to her place. The side door has stairs that lead up to mine but at the bottom of the landing is also a door that leads to her kitchen. 
The property owner takes a great deal of time and pride in maintaining the grounds. He has a large garden, crosscuts the grass, etc.  He does a phenomenal job.

**Mail tampering**
The first “off” behavior was in early October. I was waiting on a package from FedEx which contained a birthday present for my brother. Despite it tracking as delivered, it was nowhere to be found. Jane had been home for hours and made no mention of it. At 8pm I text her and she does not answer. I walk out to the front door and knock, she comes out with the package and proceeds to make small talk.  Chalked that one up to a WTF…
Mid October I have a replacement bank card sent via express mail. Same thing. Nothing all day but this time she reached out first and sent a text late at night telling me she had a fedex envelope for me. Is this normal for people to do? Once again, I have to go knock for my mail. 
When the previous neighbors intercepted my packages, it was only to get them inside out of rain or snow. Even then, they would then place them in the side hall where we both had indoor access without having to ask. I did the same for them. 

**Smoking**
Late October she started smoking inside. I would never rent in a place that does not specify no smoking as  it has (for me entire life) detrimentally affected my breathing and allergies. Also, on a non-medical note, I absolutely loathe cigarette smoke. There is nothing worse than having to smell it in your own home. In my office, in my closets, in my kitchen.  Due to the conversion of this house for some reason there are vents that I am pretty sure lead only to the apartment below, and not the furnace. I have since sealed all of them with a non-stock type of duct tape. When I sent a text asking if something was burning her reply was “just some new incense”. She also smokes weed, almost every night. That is actually far less offensive of a smell to me. I never mentioned that to my landlord. When I mentioned the cigarette smoke he seemed to have already known. He was disappointed that that she lied on her application and was more upset about the butts she was dropping all over the place than anything else. Anytime there is an issue the smoke is significantly worse that night, would not be surprised if she was down there blowing it into the vents. Lately, it is the first thing she does (inside) when she gets home.

**Speaking of allergies**
She also has a cat. Nothing against them but something else I am allergic to. Again when I rented it was a no pet premises but apparently she worked something out with the landlord and was allowed a cat (it has its own bedroom). I have suspiciously found globs of car hair in my apartment. Again, I have since sealed the vents, but how? I have phots of what appears to be glob of cat hair one would normally pull form a cat brush or mitt, placed near my door and on my steps. Initially I thought maybe this was some trash that got away, but her behavior since then has totally opened me to the idea that this too was intentional / psychotic behavior.

**The trash – opposition begins** 
As the landlord has shared with me well after-the-fact, he once reminded her that this town has recycling regulations (clarifying that if she chooses not to, that is fine, but she has to at least hide the recyclables in a trash bag). Ever since that day she has not only continued to put lose catfood cans, kitty litter jugs, and cardboard in the trash bins, she refuses to even use trash bags and refuses to take out her trash *all* together. Yes, you read that correctly, she refuses to take out her trash. Why do I care? The bins are on the side, uncovered, just next to and under my entrance. When hot organic trash  (+kitty litter and diapers) sit in the summer uncovered for days and weeks, well you know how it can get. She has even gone as nasty as tossing loose baby diapers in there. For this, I have two options: leave it and let it smell worse OR take it to the front twice a week. The only problem is back to the previous point; she refuses to recycle. So in the event the town issues a ticket (which has actually happened to me before) I get nailed with a fine for dragging her trash to the front? No thanks. The trash on the side as I type this has been accumulating for 2 weeks. There are times the landlord will dig thru and separate her recyclables before dragging it out. I refuse to do this for her… I can go weeks without even making landfill trash. I run my cardboard to the recycling center once a week, and all organic waste goes into a compost we have out back (however, she has led me to realize people like her offset 4 people like me, which sucks).

**Storm door Breaks / mail situation continues**
In November something happened with her storm door. Mind you, it was the original door from the 50’s. She complained about it to the landlord so he took it off to evaluate / order parts. She was so mad about this that she was texting me and stopping me to talk about it constantly. Should probably mention that behind the storm door she has her regular front door, a foyer and French doors. However, she really wanted that screen ASAP. It was eventually replaced. There was a day where I had some allergy meds overnighted from Amazon, I get the delivery text and don’t find a thing. Luckily, Amazon had just started the photo evidence of delivery; I had a delivery time with a photo of the box right between the storm and front door. That day she took my package inside and left for the day. That night, while she was home I knocked until she answered. She answered angrily and told me that delivery people need to stop putting packages inside the storm because her new storm will “break from all the pressure” (packages were so flat). I apologized for their mistake and asked for my package. She had nothing in her hand and did not answer, I had to follow up with the fact that I have a picture of it inside her door, she eventually went to get it. Now, I can understand how someone else’s packages in your screen can be annoying I wouldn’t want it either, but why take it out on me? I apologized anyway and sent a text explaining that I would do everything I can to make sure they do not put packages in her storm door. I even personally approached all known USP, USPS carriers, as well as went as far as having my address changed to SIDE DOOR with amazon (none of this has helped and they continue to deliver to the front). I eventually have two other “delivered” deliveries go completely missing. Between that and finding scratches on my car / rocks on my windshield blade, I decide to buy a surveillance cam for the front (props to Amcrest for a solid product).

**Weird Easter Story**
Thing were super weird by Easter, which is why I was really taken back when she knocked on my door and offered me a plate of food? Friends warned me not to eat it but hey, free food. I thought maybe she was turning over a new leaf but it turns out she gave me chicken that appeared cooked but was raw on the inside. She had relatives over so she might have been trying to show them how nice she is (and done it on purpose), or she was encouraged to do so and is just a terrible cook, not sure. 

**The Newspaper**
While I initially found this part petty, it seems to be a sticking point for Jane. It was cited by her hit squad as well as to the police. Anyway, every Friday the “anytown” Journal delivers to our property. We’ve never ordered it I guess it is a town-wide thing. It has relevant news, politics, local  events, coupons etc. Because we have two mailing addresses, they deliver two, usually on the walkway or lawn. My previous neighbor would take theirs in and leave mine under my mailbox.. Modeling that If I came home first I would take mine and leave their under their mailbox. We took and disposed of our own trash.  At first, I thought I was mistaken when I would take mine only to find another under my mailbox the next morning. Did not take long to realize Jane was refusing to dispose of her paper, I guess she wanted me to that that as well. Well like the rest of her trash, I refuse.  Again, the landlord is very particular about the grounds, one day he asked me if I read the paper, I said yes. I was also sure to let him know I also throw mine away. I realized by ignoring when Jane left it under my mailbox made it look like I was the lazy jerk, so I started moving it back under hers.  Not surprisingly the next morning it was back under mine. I actually found this as amusing as I did crazy but on sheer principle, I refuse to dispose of her paper. One week, two weeks, three weeks go by her papers are soggy and piling up on the front steps. Eventually the landlord clears them but only if they are in the same place for a while and he notices. Actually hilarious the amount of effort she is taking to move these things as opposed to tossing them. She started hiding them in the shrubs, in the trees, etc. I was mildly annoyed when she once put it into my mailbox, and I sent her a text reminding her mailboxes are for US mail. I got REALLY annoyed when I was leaving for work (2 briefcases in hand) and almost tripped down my stairs because she crossed the line and took one inside to place in the [middle of my steps]( https://puu.sh/xbkHc/81eae597c9.jpg). 
Crazy protip: If she has company or family over she will typically pretend she is normal and take the paper instead of stepping over it. When they leave, it would typically reappear outside. Similarly, the only 2 times I know of that she has taken her trash to the front were on days she has company, she plays the “normal” part well.
When I first sent a text about the paper, she played stupid and said she had no idea what I am talking about. Her next reply was “ I have no idea what you are talking about” &amp; “I am way beyond head games of any kind”.  Oh ok.
If she wants to not toss her paper that is between her and the property owner, I really don’t care where she puts the things, as long as it is not at my door, car, stairs, etc. and I made that clear. I left her a note along with the paper and leaned it on her door. Nothing rude, no cursing, just asking her to stop intentionally placing her trash in my path.

**Major turning point – breaks her own storm door and blames me. Assaults me with door. ** 
I started noticing that in the morning, after she turns her TV as loud as possible before slamming all the doors on her way out, that she was leaving though the side door. Unusual as it’s significantly further form her car. Upon looking for a delivered package, I came to discover that she was locking her storm door and leaving through the side. I guess this was to solve the problem of packages placed there. The screen only locked from the inside and out no key hole on the outside so this forced her to use my entrance to exit. Whatever.  I took part in a killer deal and purchased a gaming chair on massdrop. The day the chair arrives, due to the space needed to assemble it, I decided to do it outside (mild spring day).  Jane came home while I was doing this and apparently chose to not say excuse me or pass me at all, as such she breaks her new screen door (in the front) to get inside. Five minutes later she goes to tell the landlord that her new screen is broken and she is sure that I did it. WHAT? He came over to say that I need to make peace with her. At this point I am confused and can get of very few words before she bursts out the side door screaming. I was sitting on the steps speaking to the landlord when she hit me with the metal screen door. The sharp corner was literally digging into my side so I pushed it off of me so that I can stand, she then screamed louder that I was trying to close the door on her arm. I was in shock. In the middle of her yelling she is waving the last note I left her along with her newspaper [that she left on my steps inside]. For the first (and last) time in  nearly a year she disposes her own paper (because the landlord was standing there). She was in such a fanatic state talking was not worth it. I proceed to explain to my landlord that she had literally just broken her door to allow herself in. I was assembling the chair on the side, likely in his view as he was gardening. There was no other way she would have been able to get into the house. 

**Television / Music** 
Like I mentioned I know how it is to live under someone. When Jane moved in I gave her my cell and told her if I was ever too disruptive, or my company too loud, just shoot me a text. The ONLY time she took me up on this offer was a text that literally said “your pacing and talking just woke me up”. Is she kidding me? I had actually fallen asleep on the couch and got up to brush my teeth. My talking consisted of “hey Cortana, turn off”. Yes the floor creeks, what do you want me to do, levitate? Not walk after hours? Especially after the way she had been treating me her text kind of annoyed me. Regardless, I apologized and said I would try to keep it down.
Since she is now as passive-aggressive as possible, she does anything she can to [attempt to] annoy the heck out of me. The first time she left music blasting on an early Saturday morning (not to return until 1am Sunday) my [naïve] landlord replied “ ah maybe she forgot”. EVERY weekend since (for months now), she leaves music on when she leaves for the day.  Typically blasting in her kitchen, under my  office. It is not even Pandora or something that times out, it’s freaking FM ?! Luckily between fans and / or noise cancelling headphones I can typically drown it out, but the fact that she tries so hard it pretty bad. Additionally, she blasts Christian TV programming weekdays at 6am, under my bedroom. If I have no fan running it does wake me up, so I now run one just for the white noise. 

**Busted.**
So this part illustrates the extent this lady will go to screw with me, not that is very effective as I find it amusing that she is essentially spiting herself with all of the wasted time and effort. My new IP cam has a motion sensor feature. I has since set the zone where I typically park to be more sensitive. When there is a detection you can set it to email, alarm, or do a variety of things, including take 10 shot burst in addition to video. Back on the 5th is seemed someone had gone very close to my car.  Upon reviewing the footage I find [this gem](http://puu.sh/xc7yZ/206aa8b295.jpg)

(I have omitted any that have her face is showing)
Like I had been telling people she takes her paper in, or maybe has a stockpile I don’t know, but when there was no paper she went as far as waking up 8am and *while not even dressed yet*, *in the rain* took a paper and put it next to my car. I just thought it was gold. I had to show the landlord I wasn’t making this up. He tells me he believes me now, and suggest that I show her I have evidence and perhaps she will stop. I guess that was a big mistake. I have always been a fan of having things in writing unless there is a 3rd party or voice recorder, I simply leave the photo in the side hall so that she can see how foolish she looks. This did not go over well. For whatever reason she was in there within the next day or so and took it. 

**Guys knock on my door to threaten me.**
3:30pm last Thursday someone knocks on my door. I have a friend that sometimes stops by after work around this time and I honestly thought it was him or I would have been way better prepared for this (audio, video, etc). Some guy introduced himself as “Johnny” and says he is here on behalf of the tenant downstairs. He has the stature and accent of John Leguizamo. Behind him was a guy that had at least 100 lbs on him, barely spoke but stood there with his arms crossed.  These guys literally thought they were in a movie. He says he does not want to talk through the door to step outside , I had to have declined at least 4 times, repeating that I do not know them and I have no reason to open my door as we could see and hear each other just fine. I went on to say that I do not believe we can have a productive conversation without the presence of Jane and the landlord, but if she were not available I would at least like the landlord to join us and we could go sit in the back and talk; he repeatedly declined. He claimed he and his sidekick were son-in-laws of Jane and that she had told him I was harassing her and photographing her. Now, I am sure a great portion of males out there would want to confront someone on myhalf of a middle-aged relative, and who knows what this lady has told him obviously he is missing a lot of information and this is the only thing keeping my from loosing it. The problem is he was not here to reason or listen. He was a hot-headed motor mouth and he spewed countless threats against me ranging from my safety to my job. He added that I am to pretend I don’t know her, not to text her, and not even look at her, or they would be back. The problem is once things turned weird I had not texted her other than to ask for MY mail. As far as talking to her, happened only once; I was getting my mail one day and she yelled some insults out her window. I did not insult her back, I said something along the lines of “Really, you’re going to yell crap out of your window? Real appropriate.  Anyway this guy proceeds to tell me he knows where I work and can make some phone calls to the board. He also managed to squeeze in the fact that he owns six houses? ( it took a lot to not  ask why his “mother-in-law” is renting from a stranger if true). He stated that this is HER house and she can smoke if she pleases (for someone that own 6 properties you’d think he would be familiar with a lease agreement, again I said nothing.) He also started bragging about how many cops he knows and added “I have so many gold cards that I could kick your ass up and down the street 15 times in broad daylight and never spend a day in jail”  He ended it all by saying “this is a new America” and if you don’t think I can kick your ass and get away with it, you live in a different world” (reminder: he is clearly not white?, very confusing). 
Anyway I did my best to say as little as possible despite how aggravating this guy was. He used my name over and over. I don’t even know why I was trying to reason with him but I am glad I did not get as angry as I got when he left when the reality of it all set it. These guys came to my house to threated me at my door and walked away.
I checked my IP cam but it somehow only got them [walking away]( http://puu.sh/xc99q/c554deed11.jpg) not approaching. Either they came thru the back or from inside her place. They did not drive or pass again, when they left, and neither turned around as they walked away. I was advised but multiple relatives and friends to file a police report. I called the police at 4pm and they arrived at 9pm. They were super courteous but honest about their limitations. They took descriptions, my notes and  my pictures but were sure to explain it is my word against theirs and that they cannot act on anything unless I were actually harmed. Is this true?
They said next time answer with a camera rolling which I am still kicking myself for not doing, especially with all of the tech I have. Despite them taking so long to come, they seemed vested in helping. They said they would start the report outside and see if she came around, an hour later she did. They approached her as she exited her vehicle. She basically did what they thought she would do and denied all knowledge of sending anyone or knowing who it could have been. She also told them that I broke her screen door and something about the paper. The police were firm and fair. I heard them explaining that if something happens to me she would be the first place they came to, they also encouraged her to simply take care of her own trash. 
After the police left a friend of mine was able to discover [via FB investigation and crappy privacy setting of some parties] that the “Johnny” guy is in fact the boyfriend of Janes daughter. No luck on the other guy. Is this information I should share with them, or is it not worth it? 

**Yesterday**
After a relatively quiet day the day prior, Jane has some company on a Tuesday. Seems she had both daughters over. As a friend suggested I got the plate of the car that may or may not belong to “Johnny” . Jane proceeds to put her music obnoxiously high which I am basically used to zoning out, but I can only imagine that she really wanted me to say something (which I never have) or even more stupidly, actually go down there. While at my desk working, I kept hearing the rev of a pretty large engine (maybe one of those 5.8 litres). I peek out front and notice there is a pickup with dudes pointing at the house. When they see me they start rolling but they did not actually leave for 20 minutes or so. They circled the block several times, frequently stopping in front of my house. It was hard to make out who was inside but similar to the last visit it was a tan guy and a Caucasian guy.  Should I have called the police or would I seem like a paranoid fool?
 [Here is the truck 6 minutes apart in opposite directions]( http://puu.sh/xc9v6/e77b014f9e.jpg)

I am otherwise happy with this apartment. I come from a word-of-mouth referral and the landlord had not raised the rate for this place for at least a decade (frequently citing that he rather have problem free reliable tenants than make more money). I am not going to find a two bedroom (home office) anywhere around here for this rate.
On the other hand, the police are pretty much telling me nothing can happen unless you get hurt. The landlord wants nothing to do with police, or even hearing complaints. 
Would any of you move at this point? Should I stand my ground?

**TDR**; I have been ignoring but documenting ongoing petty and abnormal behavior by a lady who lives below me. This eventually led to people knocking on my door and making threats as well as attempting to intimidate me. Police say nothing can be done unless I am harmed, landlord want nothing to do with police or people that threatened me. I don’t want to move.

I am constantly busy with school, work, etc. She is still attending high school and is in two extracurricular activities. She is in marching band (as I was), so her schedule basically eliminates most chances to be with her for September and October. Also, since she also working, that eliminates most days she does not have marching band and track. Her schedule and mine are not compatible for any time together.

We have not yet told each other that we love each other, so we are not ""in love."" Also, any intimacy feels bland and causes no sparks to fly.

Since we are in very different chapters of life and have almost no time to see each other, should we break up? I don't want her to have to keep on waiting when we're gonna see each other, neither do I. I am frustrated with how we are together, everything we do is bland and boring. Advice?

100,"So today is results day for sixth form students in the U.K. and as I expected my little sister is having a meltdown because she didn't get the results she wanted. She's just finished her first year of sixth form and she's really upset because she got low results. I obviously don't want her to feel this way because I want my sister to be successful and get good results but she doesn't understand what working hard is. She says she works hard but I know for a fact that she doesn't. Her idea of being good at something is just having a natural talent at a subject and getting an A without putting any effort in. She has an extreme case of a self-defeatist attitude where she's like 'I'm not gonna put any effort in because I know I'm gonna fail and I'm dumb', I've tried so many times to say to her that she's good at her subject when she puts the effort in and gets her head down but she either just tells me to fuck off or she's like 'there's no point'. I know it isn't my position as an older brother to tell her what to do and I don't want to come across like I'm controlling but I want my little sister to be successful and I don't know what to do. Do I just let her continue on and she'll find her own path in life? Do I try another approach? I don't what's the best route for me to take as an older brother.

102,"As per the title, I cant shake off the feeling that I've failed at life. I'm 27 years of age in three weeks. Everyone else seems to be having fun during their 20s makin lots of friends, getting lots of sex, going to concerts every year, etc. The only thing I've found is that my 20s has been a period of instability, anxiety, and loneliness interspersed with some fun along the way. And, they are nearly over. 

The most fun decade of my life where people are meant to come out of their shells and make lots of friends, gone just like that.

I've always been a quiet withdrawn person with few friends. I have a good personality but it takes me a while to “let people in”. I almost never approach someone I don't know and just talk to them for the sake of it. I almost never push my social boundaries by attending classes or meetups or anything of the sort. The only time I feel like I can talk to people is when I have a few drinks on me. 

I have done a lot of traveling in my 20s, influenced by feeling out of place at home and also by growing a huge fondness for another country's food.  But most of my world traveling has been done alone. Which causes me to think “I might aswell have not traveled if I've not made friends along the way.” 

I've quit drinking as much as I used to because of the next day anxiety it brings, so I guess my loneliness comes to the fore more. I just feel like a failure at life because of how introverted I act. I read religiously, work from my computer, and only really put myself in social environments when there's sports on tv that I like. 

I still feel like I'm figuring things out that everyone else has sorted now: coming out of my shell, how to talk more to people, how to build a social circle. But I'm 27, meaning I don't have long left to enjoy my youth. 

Sorry if this comes across as a pity post, but maybe someone can give me advice on dealing with such an unhealthy self-image.  ",17Aug2017,91

104,"**TL;DR:** **Father of a former friend whom I have feelings for died of cancer a short while ago. Don't know if asking her how is she holding every two weeks is what I should do. Not sure if I'm helping because I really want to help or because I like her.**



A couple days ago the father of an acquaintance of mine (20F) died of cancer. This acquaintance was my friend since we were toddlers, but in the last two years or so we grew apart (mainly because different choices of studies) to the point that instead of meeting every day we just see each other once or twice every couple of months or less frequently.

I (19M) want to help her as I'm pretty sure she is going through some tough times and seeing her in so much pain affected me (she is one of the most cheerful and kindest people I know so seeing her crying hit me hard). I had thought of waiting a couple weeks and then asking her how she is doing and offer her help if she needs it, after that ask her every two weeks or so for a couple of months. Because as far as I know, those are the moments (two weeks-some months after the death) when support is most needed, as people start moving on and stop checking how one is doing.

Thing is, I developed feelings for this girl some months ago. Every time I think about trying to help her I have this voice inside my head who says that I'm doing all this to take advantage of her grief. This has reached the point where I'm not even sure about my real intentions anymore. This disgust me, but it may be true, as I didn't supported my cousin as much as I'd have liked  when my uncle died a year ago. I still regret it, but I didn't supported my cousin as I should.

So what do you guys think? As an acquaintance am I overstepping trying to help? Should I just step aside and let her cope by herself to make sure I'm not making profit from her pain? Should I help her in a different way? Is there anything you think is worth knowing that I don't know of?

As you people may have already realized, I'm not really used to this kind of scenarios.

Bit of a weird one here, but I figured I'd ask and see if any of you had any other similar experiences. I had a look at my bank account this morning as I've been a bit worried about money this month, so I wanted to see what my budget was after my rent came out.

Well, when I looked, the amount was MUCH larger than usual. Like, several thousand more than usual. I checked to see where the money came from and it was sent to me from an account in Brazil. I obviously called my bank straight away and they asked if there were any other weird transactions but, nope. Just that. No money taken out - just a massive sum transferred in.

The bank have now frozen my account whilst they do an investigation into it, and they said they'll give me a call as soon as my account has been deemed safe to use again. If any of you guys have experienced this, what was the outcome? What should I expect? I'm obviously aware that I probably won't be able to keep the money, though that would be nice. But how long do you think this investigation will take?

She has admitted that she does feel absolutely horrible about the breakup but wont change her mind because she is getting to finally study properly.
this has kept me in severe  depression for the last 2 months and yesterday she said she doesn't love me anymore, but does still care greatly.
She further specified the reason she doesn't love me is because she feels her drive coming back and that i pushed her away by being too emotional recently.

our personalities did match up almost perfectly and we dated for just over a year and it was the happiest i had ever been.

was it truly my fault for her losing motivation? If it is then how can I prevent this from happening when we are so happy with each other that other things stop mattering as much?

Apparently there is a high chance of us dating again in the future, but not with the way I am now with depression and being so clingy that i can't go 2 days without just seeing her for a short amount

Although the strain of trying to bring a baby up together meant our relationship ended, we have done quite a good job bringing her up so far and she is an incredible kid.

Basically the problem I have is, my ex (baby momma) decided to stay studying to get her university place in the last two years, and told  me she would get her relevant qualifications and then wait until our daughter is at school to go to university. 

She has just told me this week that she starts university next month.

Since then I have liked two girls, neither of which has reciprocated my feelings. No, I didn't anime it and tell them I like them, I just asked them out. One said yes but later went out of her way to say that it wasn't anything special, just something fun.

I want nothing more than a loving relationship. I just want someone to love and someone to love me, but it seems like it will never happen. I'm not suicidal, at least, not to the point of genuinely considering it, and will not at any point take my own life no matter what the circumstances are.

114,"The game is open world, players can buy certain items and sell others.

Players also have the ability to get items from the world itself (picking berries, killing beasts etc..)

I would like to set an economy that would encourage players to vary their means of gaining money over time, so at one moment in time red berries would be the go to for money, until over time people mechanize berry farms and the price of the berry should ""drop"", causing another item to become more popular. So changes should be gradual and prices linked to the production of items.

I have devised a system quickly but I don't see it as a perfect system..

I have made a system that calculates every 4 hours the item that is bringing in the most money into the players pockets. So the money it brings in is equal to ""amount of items sold"" x ""price of the item"" This is compared to other items and the sell price of the items bringing in the most money are set to go down, at the same time, items are chosen to compensate, random items that aren't selling (I still need to add a comparator to check which ones are selling the least/making less revenue) Those items are affected by a raise in the sell price. I am looking to create a stable economy with prices that don't change too much but just enough to change how players make their money.

Items are categorized in categories and sub categories, so high end prices won't be affected by low end price changes. Each subcategory will contain produce that can be farmed differently from the other subcategories, ex: black berries and strawberries are farmed similarily, so in the same subcategory. When an item from one subcategory is heavily exploited, it randomly chooses an item from a different subcategory of the same category.

First of all, I want to thank anyone who cared to read and 

apologize for the long post.

About 2 days ago while I was coming back from market, 

some old man approached me and asked if I could give him $10 

for his bus fee and that he had to go see his grandma. 

I've seen a lot of people out on the street holding signs asking for 

money but this was the first time anyone ever approached me 

directly. 

I believed his story and felt bad for him. 

I gave him the $10. Then, the man started asking me for 5 more 

dollars for diapers. That was when I realized this man was a 

scammer. I told him $10 was all I could give him and I 

started walking away. He followed me and asked me if I believed 

in god. I was a bit creeped out and quickly made my way back 

home. I think he stopped following after asking few more 

questions.

When I got back home I started having this weird feeling in my 

head that I could not get rid of. I felt scammed, scared, and 

disappointed. More specifically, I was disappointed in myself for  

falling into the scam. I never considered myself a smart person 

but I thought I had what it takes to live through this world. 

And yet, I easily fell into manipulation the other day.

I like him a lot, but a) he's known for having commitment issues, b) his friends think he won't start anything romantic with me and c) I'm not sure how he feels. 

We hang out a lot, due to both our suggestions, and when our friends leave he often stays behind and hangs out with me alone then walks me home. We've been alone to the zoo, the city, my local mall, my house, a Mexican food place (where I met his brother) and a few more in the span of a monthish. Not to mention the many group occasions. 

He'll give me compliments, stay up till 3 am on the phone with me, be gentlemanly, and watch movies with me (his suggestion) but at times he can switch to texting in short messages or just generally being moody. In real life we don't have this issue, we constantly talk and are happy hanging out together. 

My/his friends have asked him if he has romantic feelings for me and his response is usually to avoid the question and then say something like ""yeah, yeah, she's heaps of fun."" 

I have a feeling he likes me but it's just those periods of moodiness and acting colder that makes me doubt that feeling. 

Pair that with the commitment issues (his shortest relationship was 24 hours because ""he got bored"" but that was 3 years ago) and got a bit of an issue here.

However, he told me a while ago that when he used to work in construction one of his contractors he worked for was President Donald J Trump and that he (my father) made videotapes to make sure his record of the work was noted and that he didn't get stiffed by his bosses.
Anyway he has said that on one of these tapes was Trump himself using the 'N-Word' and pretty frequently (this was back in a time when it was more acceptable to use). My father is quite conservative but not racist and was shocked about it but didn't think it was important.

However, since Trump got elected President my father has become extremely paranoid that the videotape will be stolen either by a member of the media or a government individual or a member of the Mafia (His reasoning is that Trump he has said used to hang around with Mafia known individuals and might send one of them to finish him off). My father has been transforming his house into Fort Knox (extra security measures, more alarms) and he has acquired some (legal) firearms as well.

137,"So I'm 18 and I have fairly severe social anxiety. I don't really have any true friends, I really only have acquaintances, but no one I would really call a best friend or a group of friends I regularly hang with. So I'm quite a loner. But although I have dreaded this for a long time and I do feel quite lonely from time to time, most of the time I feel quite content, maybe even happy being on my own. But I still have a desire to meet new people and just put myself out there (going to clubs, courses etc.) Although at the same time I have almost no desire to contact/meet up with the people I do know, and feel comfortable contacting/meeting.  That includes people I have similar interests with. I just don't understand why I have no desire/ don't see the point in meeting the friends I do have, because I feel content with being alone or don't think they can help my loneliness when I do feel lonely, but at the same time want to meet new people? I mean I know people with similar interests so why do I feel the need to find other people?",17Aug2017,2

140,"Since I started researching this issue I think I have accustomed myself with a lot of the theory on the origins, the purpose, the triggers and the mechanism of action and the way of treatments of shame, however I feel really stuck when it comes down to actually healing my toxic shame. 

The latest research and the modern day consensus is that self-compassion, empathy with oneself and self-acceptance is the antidote. 

I have tried several popular exercises but I am unable to enter the grieving state or the self compassion state. I do not know how to access my emotions. I can do the exercises on a mental/intellectual level but I feel cut off from my feelings and apathetic all throughout. Thus, I do not experience any emotional relief and my shame thrives. 

One insight I had once I was trying to do the mirror exercise suggested by Nathaniel Branden (in which you look at yourself in the mirror and practice self acceptance by repeating certain slef-acceptance phrases) is that I have an immense resistance towards accepting myself as I am especially accepting my physical appearance. And I contemplated if the reason for my failure to have self compassion is more due to me not wanting to accept myself rather than not being able to find a way how to. 

So I am stuck at the phase of not knowing how to make myself not want to self sabotage my healing process and resist wanting to accept myself and my flaws.",17Aug2017,1

And I'm blessed that I have special skills in my field and love the things I do. I was really lucky that someone discovered my works and quickly contact me to work with a big project last couple months ago.
I did well in the first part of project because that time it was our vacation. So in the first month I earned a lot and I was also able to get some part time job excluded this project because I had plenty of time.
And now I'm struggling to finish some milestone/tasks because I have to study in the noon until early night so my time is really tough to manage. Everytime I arrive from home to school I am really tired. I'm trying to do some task in this project but it was not the same.
What should i do? I also have final project to work with. I should decide now although there are many factors that coming into my mind like my family wants to finish this school thingy.
This current job is really great. If i finish this proj within 2 months. I would earn a $2k bonus. Thats huge And this is my stepping stone. If I could work with them at long term , my pay fee would ascend

I am in the process of interviewing at my DREAM job. Perfect supervisor, perfect setting, perfect salary, perfect everything. It's what I have been working toward for years. I am currently working at a place where I'm very unhappy for reasons I don't need to go into. 

So... the catch? This dream job is approximately 330 miles away. Connecticut. I live in Maryland. 

I have a family. Three children. One middle school, one elementary, one baby. Husband has a virtual job. But he is very extroverted and likes Maryland for its many outlets. Still, he's willing to support my career. The kids are very happy where they are. One is having her bat mitzvah later this year. That's one big reason I cannot just take my family with me; she needs to stay with the same synagogue to continue her education in preparation for this huge event. And our middle child is happy too. 

I don't know what to do. I could attempt to work at this new place during the week and come home to Maryland on weekends. Would that be feasible? I could keep the baby with me (currently in daycare) but then that'd mean the baby has to drive me with me when I travel back m forth between both states each Sunday/Friday. 

We could continue this until the summer when school lets out and then the family moves up here. But what should I do in the meantime? Is this really feasible and fair to my children? I work in a very specialized field and this kind of job opportunity is NOT easily available. That's why I can't let it slip through my fingers.  My job happiness is very important to me.

I am 23 years old, I have had a “career” type job for about a year and I make pretty good money, I think, for my age but still not enough to move out on my own (I live with my Mother and pay $600 in student loans a month). I never thought that I would have pets at this point in my life but both my dogs were in dire situations when I got them, they were very sick and needed medical help and I couldn’t in good conscience let them stay where they were I didn’t intend to keep them but I go super attached to them and I had a lot more time for them originally. I have had them for about a year and I love them more than anything in this world. They are about 2 years old each. However, I live in the boonies and its about an hour and a half to the closest place I could find a job so my commute is brutal and im gone about 14 hours a day. Currently i take them out in the morning around 5 am, I pay someone to take them out at noon, and I’m back at seven to be with them but I’m worried they aren’t getting the attention they deserve. Their needs always come first and they are always well fed and given the medical attention they need (often more than they need because im a bit paranoid since they were so sick when I got them). Everyone in my family are huge animal people and I have never in my life condoned putting a dog up for adoption for selfish needs. But, I’m beginning to think that keeping them for myself is the more selfish option. I don’t know when my situation will change and their living conditions I feel are not good enough for them at the moment. It would probably be the hardest thing Ive ever had to do if I had to give them away and I know theyre attached to me as well but im having a really hard time with figuring out what I should do and what is best for them. Any advice would be good, any opinions are appreciated, and If you have had to go through this id love to hear your story. To be honest im choking up just writing this, thinking they’ll always remember I gave them away but I just want them to be happy, and healthy. One is a pit mix probably and the other is a blue tick coon hound and they are seriously great dogs, sometimes they are little trouble makers but they have never had any signs of aggression ever in their life. Thank you in advance.

Summary: I have 2 young active dogs, I love them to death but I am gone 14 hours a day with my work plus commute. I pay to get them walked once a day but I still feel they don’t get enough attention. I would hate to get rid of them more than anything but I don’t know when my situation will change.

152,"[xpost from /r/bpd] Hey friends - sorry for the throwaway, but I don't want this attached to my main account. I'm looking for advice on how to stop sabotaging my relationship and trying to find anyone who can relate to this. I'll clarify and add detail if needed. For reference, I am 25F diagnosed with PTSD and borderline personality disorder. 

The summary of it is I was dismissive and emotionally abusive to my former partner for months and months. I've recently been trying to correct the past mistakes that I've made and atone for what I've done. This is the first relationship that I've wanted to salvage instead of walk away from, but something keeps happening in our conversations that is extremely damaging. 

Often, when I'm confronted about what I did wrong or if I said something that was a bit confusing and am asked for clarification, I will freeze up and ""disappear."" My heart feels like it is coming out of my chest and I drop into a monotone voice. My partner has told me that my face also undergoes a visible change. I'm scaring them with it because all my answers that are supposed to be calm, assuring, and understanding sound fake and heartless, even if I am telling the truth. This will go for hours, with my ex-SO afraid of me and me stuck watching them inside this alternate self that can't offer the comfort I want to give. Watching this from inside myself only adds to my distress and makes it harder to bring myself back to the conversation.

The trigger for this could be as simple as being asked ""Why did you do this?"" Last night, I disappeared while trying to offer reassurance after a long discussion. Things have really deteriorated. I've been working through a DBT workbook, going to therapy and having really intense/focused sessions, listening to meditation tracks, reading as much as I can find on repairing relationships, and trying all the self-soothing things I can think of in the moment, but nothing seems to help until they threaten to leave or do something destructive.

157,"My husband and I enjoy a fun, loving 10-year marriage. We have been through a lot, share important values, have a diverse group of friends we adore (including spending time with their kids). We practice yoga, cycle competitively and volunteer in the community -- together. We are affectionate, share responsibilities at home, travel. We are both lawyers. He is proud of me. We are from different countries / cultures and now live in a third country. We have learned one another's languages. We deeply love and respect and believe in one another. 

We have challenges with our childhood families and childhood issues that affect our marriage and make us fear having kids, even though we would like to expand our family. We are both 38, so need to decide.

For my part, I had a warm and loving family growing up. Looking back, I realize I had abandonment fears and enmeshment issues with my parents due to severe trauma that happened to me early in life (not my parent’s fault). I still struggle to resolve these feelings and have gone to therapy to do so. 

My parents have never really accepted him. I am an only child, as were they. Grandparents all died when I was a baby. My parents have never been good at accepting anyone outside of our family because of what happened to me as a child. It hurt him to not be welcome into the family. Sadly, I did nothing to address it early on.

He resents them a lot now. I have since learned to speak to them about it (with the help of therapy) and they want things to change. He feels the opportunity has passed. We live in different countries, so I visit them once a year on my own. It was awkward when they visited us. I worry how it would be with a child.

My husband's childhood was more difficult. He has a beautiful relationship with his mom, but had a raging, physically abusive father. Knowing this now, I can see why me not sticking up for him with my parents was so detrimental. I have a warm relationship with his mom and go visit her often. Things with his father are difficult.

Understandably, given his childhood and paternal example, my husband struggles with anger too, and in my opinion, with repressed rage and sadness. He sometimes rants and raves in ways that scare me and remind me of his father. There are times when he is completely irrational, yells at me and calls me names. He has never been physical. (That is a firm, firm line for me.) His anger is not a frequent occurrence, perhaps 4-5 times a year. 

I have learned to just listen and be silent during his rants. Sometimes they are about my parents or things I may have legitimately done wrong (correcting him in front of friends for example.) I try to improve. After ranting, he will sometimes ignore me for a day. When he calms down, I apologize. We move on. 

He has struggled with depression at times. We've talked often about working with a counselor or psychologist. He refuses. I love my husband and know he loves me. I feel deeply empathetic for the reasons why he is the way he is, and try to focus on my own behaviors. We have a wonderful marriage most of the time. However, when I look to the future and the possibility of having children, I have fears about the enduring rift with my parents and his bubbling anger that can boil over at any time. I also worry about my own issues. But I love children.

I know, no marriage is perfect. How seriously should I take these concerns, especially in regards to the possibility of having a child? Thank you for your thoughts and sorry for the long read. (NOTE: EDITED TO MAKE SHORTER).",17Aug2017,1
158,"So I'm feeling really confused about everything right now. This is probably going to come across as self-pity at times, I'm aware that my mindset is quite negative at present so I will try to stick to fact as much as possible but I would really appreciate any advice/support anyone can offer me on how I can get out of the negative place I'm in and improve my life...

I'm 25, turning 26 fairly soon. When I was 19 I had my shit together - good career, stable home environment, some good friends and a partner plus reasonably good health. Unfortunately I developed a chronic illness at age 20 and slowly my life started to go wrong. At 22 I lost my job and had to move out of my home plus my long-term relationship broke down (and in a very traumatic way where I realised he had never really loved me or cared for me as I needed). 

At 23 I decided to go to Uni since my health was still too bad to be able to handle full time work. I chose to study in a field I had always been passionate about and was really excited about it. In the months prior to starting the course I was feeling good, trying to improve my health and looking forward to starting life over again. I managed to make some friends initially and even though I didn't enjoy the experience as much as I hoped I would, I had a decent enough first term. 

Over the Christmas break of first year I went back to my parents and got very depressed. I don't exactly know why, but when I got back to uni I didn't feel like the same person I was. This period of depression lead me to make the stupid decision to get back together with the ex that never really loved me. The only reason I can give is that I was lonely and still had feelings for him and wanted to believe he had changed. The relationship didn't last long and we have been broken up again for almost a year now. 

The problem is, I haven't managed to get back to the place I was in when I started uni and got my life back on track. I have made multiple attempts to get back into the swing of things but something has changed. I no longer feel like I have any friends at uni because I've been in such a low mood for the past year I think everyone just sees me as a downer now and tries to get away from me as quick as possible. I really feel like I wasted my uni experience, which is sad... But not as sad as the fact that I feel I wasted my whole life. 

I was betrayed really badly by some friends when I was young and ever since then I have always chosen the wrong sorts of people to hang around with, which leads me to having to isolate myself to separate from toxic relationships. Because I've had such crappy experiences it's led me to feel incapable of healthy relationships which leads me to not even try. For the last few years my life has gotten smaller and smaller and its got to the point where I don't really do anything except a few hobbies. 

I have recently had a lot of revelations about things I'm doing that don't help me (for example smoking excessively and not exercising) so I have decided to change my life. I quit smoking cigarettes a few days ago and I will be quitting weed tomorrow. I desperately want to make my life better but everything seems so difficult with my illness. 

Every morning I wake up in pain and although I want to get out and do things I don't know what I can do and have no energy to do anything so I end up staying at home to work on hobbies, or browse the internet. I would love to have a good group of friends to meet up with and talk to but I feel like I've ruined my chances of having friends. I'm in the process of trying to reconnect with old friends but due to how down I feel on myself I find myself not wanting to answer messages because I fear they will all think I'm a pathetic failure if I share too much with them. My parents no longer live in the place where I grew up and I don't know anyone or feel any sort of connection to the place they moved to so its not like I have a community when I'm away from uni. 

The other big problem I have is how expensive my university city is. The accommodation is extremely expensive and difficult to find anything that's not sharing with loads of other people. On one hand I would like to share with others because they would be potential friends... but because of my illness I feel my life and daily experience is so different from regular people's that it will be too hard for me to be friends with them. I guess I feel isolated not only physically but also in terms of having nobody who understands me. 

Part of me is tempted to change university and have a fresh start somewhere else so I can try again armed with my new knowledge (and healthier habits) but I know this will lead to more debt which is already causing me stress and it will just be longer before I graduate, plus it might be the exact same situation just somewhere else. Having said that, if I lived in a different city I would be able to afford decent accommodation and a better quality of life, so that's something. 

Sorry for the length and poor formatting of this post, the short version:
- I have been ill for several years and feel like my life has slipped away from me in that time
- I went to university to try and have a better quality of life but feel like it's just made things worse
- I currently have no friends and no boyfriend, I don't go on dates and rarely go out anywhere 
- I am struggling to find a place to live in my university city so I'm wondering if I should change University or maybe do something completely different
- I'm implementing other changes such as quitting smoking and open to any further changes which will lead to self-improvement and a better life

If anyone has any suggestions, questions or advice it would be most appreciated!
Thanks xxx

159,"Hey all.

So I really am just looking for, I don't know, a fifth opinion at this point probably. My friends tell me I'm being a downer or too negative and that things have a chance of working out, and I truly do wish for that to happen, but I'm not dumb, I know it's gonna be hard and the chances aren't great.

Basically I transferred home last year to a local college. I began talking to this girl who I went to high schoool with and who, without sounding corny, was the smoothest and easiest relationship I've ever been involved in. Even with the two year age difference and her being a senior in high school, nothing felt weird or awkward, it just felt nice. Out of every experience I've had with someone before, this just felt right.

That was last fall, in February we amicably ended things because she knew she would be going to a college about 4 hours away and didn't want to continue seeing each other in case she ultimately decided she didn't want a boyfriend while at college and if that would make it too difficult to end things come August. I respected this decision as I have already gone away and I don't want to rob her of the college experience she wants, so we stopped being friends and went separate ways.
Fast forward to mid July- she starts sending me occasional snapchats, asking me questions about life and such. (Truthfully my feelings never really went away for her, I just stayed out of the way out of respect for her wishes). We began to talk again, in the same way that we used to, but I had no intention of asking to see her again because of what we had discussed months ago. Eventually she asked to see me before she left, and we spent the day together Monday, two days before she left, which was honestly one of the best dates I've been on in my life, and neither of us wanted it to end. We kissed goodbye and said maybe we'll see each other again some day, maybe not, and I left.

I didn't bring up anything serious because it was such a nice day and I didn't want to ruin it with the ever present situation, and after a long Tuesday I wound up calling her (with her permission). I told her basically what I wrote before, I didn't want to hold her back from experiencing anything and I recognize how difficult it is to have a connection like this back at home, and that it was completely understandable if she said she didn't want to talk to each other anymore. She told me she would be sad if that was the case, and that she fully intended for us to see each other in November and see where things stand, that she was very hopeful we wouldn't move on from each other and we could take things from there. Basically for the first time she said how much she cared for me and wanted to be together one day, and that this felt different to her too, that she felt the same way I did.

We stayed on the phone for 3 hours, until 5am, and she kept telling me not to say goodbye, to stop saying if we see each other again, to say when we see each other again. How sorry she was for pushing me away in the winter and how much she has and will regret it. That she was going to miss me a lot and she couldn't wait to see me again, or that she would likely cry after we got off the phone. On the drive up yesterday, she asked if I would play her a song on guitar when I got back, and that she would hold me to that. And I believe she means everything she's saying now, and I want to believe it will happen.

Now I know what anyone is probably thinking here: she hasn't even started yet (she's just moving in now) things change, people change, intentions and feelings change. I'm aware of all of this, in fact, I think I'm actually expecting to wind up being disappointed come November when she has moved on and doesn't feel the same way. And that's alright, I know I'll be sad/heartbroken and I'll always care about her in some way, but I never want to be the guy at home who stands in the way of her college experience and those feelings of mutual adoration turn to resentment and anger. I want her to be happy, truthfully I do, and whether that's with me or not with me, I can accept that.
I guess the point of this post is for me to just get that all down somewhere, so I can stop going crazy in my head. This isn't one of those typical ""is there a chance my girlfriend and I stay together long distance at college?"" kind of posts. I know how small the chances are. I know it's unlikely. I know I have to live my life, and she has to live hers.

I told her if she meets someone else, don't throw that away over some old feelings you have for me, and she said she didn't think that would happen, but it goes both ways. And I understood that. But I'm a one person kind of guy, and until she one day tells me things have changed, I don't think there will be anyone new in my romantic life. This may be sad, I may be an idiot, I understand things probably won't work out.

But I can't help but hope.

TLDR: Hopeful for a future but aware it isn't likely.",17Aug2017,1
162,"My fiance and I have been together for 4.5 years and much of it has been semi-long distance until last year when he moved closer. We've been playing with the idea of moving in together for a while and I think it'll be great for us once I graduate from nursing school in December. He disagrees.

I had a long talk with my parents about how a change in environment and lack of space may negatively contribute to my grades right now. I agree and I don't want to risk failing my last semester before I graduate because I have a hard time managing stress in new environments. I assured my parents that my fiance would be totally supportive, but I was completely wrong. I texted him and I told him my concerns. He countered every one with why I should move in next month.

I then asked if he knows I only want to wait a few months, and again he repeated ""I said I'm done.""

163,"So I've recently finished college in Ireland with a first class honors in Applied Physics (that's like a 3.7 - 3.8 on the whole GPA thing). I have a solid academic record, with a funded internship behind me as well. 
However now I'm out in the real world it seems like I may as well not have bothered. 
Not a single place seems willing to take someone with a physics degree, I've asked and apparently software companies and financial institutions are happy to recruit but so far these have all been dead ends.

I didn't make any assumptions at the time and asked them what that status was all about and if they were okay. I was then blocked without reason.

The problem I'm running into is that now, since the depression is gone, my emotions are starting to come out of hiding and I've never had to deal with them before, other than a few other than a few instances of grief or rage which I never tried to control. I'm under the impression that my emotional level of maturity is a 4 year old child who won't allow anyone to see their temper tantrums.

At this point, the biggest feel around is loneliness and I don't know what to do about it.
I can't leave the house unless I'm going to do something, depression or myself have managed to push away anyone I'd like to be friends with or without whom I'd want to develop a partnership, and I've been burned pretty bad with dating online and the apps.
It's not like I don't see/deal with people, I live with my parents and younger sister, there are more than 20 people who are my co-workers, and people come in the store I work at all the time, but no one I've been able to connect with.

This is relevant because what I'm about to say follows is about my dads strange behavior that has been going on for a few years now and I don't want you guys to think it's child abuse or anything

He's been extremely verbally abusive, in a way where he calls me and my brother names and taunts us. He even said that he's trying to tough us up a bit but I told him that it isn't working and he needs to stop and do it the right way. He says that I should suck it up and grow some balls and stop being a little bitch. There were times that he would be compulsively angry and he would say hurtful things to me which I know for sure wasn't  to ""tough me up a bit"" like he always says...

I tried to confront him about it and low and behold he tells me to stop being a bitch and suck it up. I have a low self esteem due to bullying in the past and what he's doing is just making it worse. I sometimes feel like killing myself but never had the urge to want to because I'm personally very afraid of death and pain. I don't want to bring it to anyone's attention like my grandmother or any of my family members or the school psychologist because I'm afraid that it'll get worst and they'll force me to move away from him and possibly get my younger brother takin away and maybe my 4 year old sister.

It has gotten out of control and I need guidance and advice from some of you guys on how to approach him and somehow have him come to a realization that what he is doing is wrong. 

Note: like I said, I did approach him before but he always has to compare my mom and bring up bad things about her that she has done way back in the past like if he's the perfect parent. He does love me and my brother and my sister but i know there's something that bothers him which isn't really any of my business but I think he should be considerate enough to know that taking out anger on your offspring is wrong. He doesn't do this to my younger sister thank god.

Edit: He is a good guy, He's never hit me or my brother for no reason but this isn't him and I really really need advice on how I can deal with his behavior. 

Another thing is (which is irrelevant btw) I think he is dating someone two years older than me. A handful of you might think that's not wrong but it's unusual to me and it's really bothering me and he told me not to talk about it again and he said that he isn't dating her. ",17Aug2017,1

The argument started with my friend telling me it would be ""faggy"" of me (his eloquent words, not mine) to get hats or snapbacks that have logos of local beer brands that I enjoy and want to support. He however sports a hat bearing the logo of the LA Dodgers, a baseball team in which he cannot name a single player, because and hasn't watched a single one of their games. He doesn't even watch or like baseball whatsoever.
His argument is that it's cliche or ""trashy"" to sport beer brands, because it's all ""look at me! I drink beer!""
So my question is, is it ""more faggy"" to wear a hat with a beer logo that you actually really like and enjoy to drink, or wearing a hat of a team that you have zero knowledge of nor the sport they play in?

188,"Hey guys. I have a window outside that was for my basement, with a piece of plywood nailed over it. I cut a hole in the plywood to fit an extension cord through so I could run my saw in the backyard.

The problem is, I want to be able to tuck away the extension cord without having to run to my basement twice every time I want to do a small project. There is also a piece of plywood at an angle over top of the window.

So it's 'fairly' safe from the rain, but I was looking for some type of cover to guarantee that no water gets in the cord. The window is about 5-6 feet off the ground so ground water isn't a problem. It's just when it rains that I am worried. Here's a quick sketch of what I am looking at.

http://imgur.com/a/FdsmC

The circle is the hole in the plywood that the cord goes through. The squiggly line is the cord. The angled square in front is the plywood that protects it so rain doesn't directly hit it. The line at the bottom is the ground.

Any ideas how I can set this up as to prevent water from getting into the cord without having to pull it inside?

I was looking at something like [this](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Extension-Cord-Safety-Seal-Green-2-Pack-H-EXT-302/204485133) but it looks like all variations of that safety seal require it actually be plugged into something so both holes on either side are filled with cord.

I'm not trying to act greedy or anything I'm just saying, like, that's a problem. I've tried to express all of this to my dad. He just says ""you have to respect her. You have to show your appreciation to her. She's your elder. She's the lady of this household"" and other things along those lines. I told my dad what happened and he said ""just make it right and let it go"" just like he always does. See what I mean?? When my dad got home she started to cry, threw another hissy fit, and ran upstairs. Keep in mind she's 65 and acting like this.

204,"As the title states, I just received a job offer that was a bit lower than expected. I wanted to get some feedback from more experienced redditors.

**Background**

I live in a major US city where I make about $75k per year at a large and well known company in my field, I don't receive a bonus. I am a marketing manager. I have frustrations at my company, and feel I'm fundamentally underpaid for the workload and my capabilities. I was recently promoted and given a title at the firm (better bonus structure). That being said, I like the people I work with and I like the city I'm in.

Recently a friend of mine living in a small city across the country told me his company was looking for a marketing director. They have previously operated without a marketing expert but as they are growing quickly they've realized they have a strong need for one. They flew me out to interview me and it went well. They seem excited to have a professional from a major city coming to help them.


**The Issue**

I asked for $75k-$85K from them, depending on the benefits. I also asked for $5K moving expenses to be covered by them. This is a pretty generous salary for the region I'm moving to, but it seemed fair given that I'm moving to a tiny town and leveraging my considerable experience in marketing for them. They will get a complete marketing dept. rebuild out of me with knowledge you simply can't find online. I'm a talented writer, solid art direction skills, and experience with client-facing sales roles, communication with press, etc. IE I'm the full package, despite my age.

I got the offer today and it was only for $70k + 5k for moving expenses.

**The Question**

My question is whether I should counter-offer. $70k is still a great salary for the area but I feel its leaving money on the table not to counter. That being said, the latest e-mail seemed to be implying that they really wanted me and felt this was a great opportunity and that I should really seize the day. It felt a bit like saying ""this is a final offer"" without actually saying that.

Would you counter-offer in my position? I was going to say I would prefer 75k firm.


**TL;DR**
Small company in small city offering me a good salary for the area, my experience, etc. but I would really prefer higher given that I'm leaving my whole life behind to pursue the opportunity. Do I counter offer?

So, to the point I suppose. I had a girlfriend for 6 years (we started out pretty young, yes), and we broke up 2 years ago. It was peaceful. I was starting to get pretty depressed, couldn't get into college, barely had any friends, and I just hid away in my computer games all day mostly. We broke up because it was starting to affect her too, and I agreed it was for the best. 

However,, 2 years later, I'm finally getting better. I'm in university already, I've got things kind-of figured out. I'm definitely not the same depressed dude. I'm currently seeing a girl, nothing serious, and I've had a short-term girlfriend last year (went for bout 3 months, then I broke up because she was an overjealous person). I have some friends (althoough I don't really get invited to anything by anyone during summer vacation so I just had to learn to enjoy my own company), but there's always the same questions in my mind.

Does she think about me? Does she miss me? Were we 'soulmates' and my stupid depression ruined everything? Will I ever find anyone like that again? Will I ever get past this whole thing?

I think about her almost every day, I dream about her most of the time, everytime I do something I'm proud of I think to myself ""Damn I wish I could show this to her.""

Any men in a similar situation and any advice... should I find an evening/weekend job and miss out on family time.

213,"Sorry for any formatting, spelling, grammatical, or auto correct issues... I'm in my phone.

Our city has a partnership with Waste Management to pick up recycling from every residence in town free of charge.

Every once in a while they mail out an info pamphlet that tells you your day of the week that your recycling will be picked up, as well as provides little stickers to put in your calender to mark the day.

The pamphlet explains that recycling will be picked up every two weeks (on Wednesday for me) and the recycling bin must be out before 7am.  The reminder stickers also say 7am.  This time is super convenient for me because as I leave for work I can just take the bin out.

Two weeks ago we set out our recycling can just before 7am.  Shortly after we set it out we saw the garbage truck traveling Eastbound on our street so we knew we missed it, no big deal it happens.

A few minutes later the garbage truck returned and collected our recycling.  The driver then got out of his truck and wrote on the lid of our can in black Sharpie ""OUT BY 6a.m.""

Yesterday (wednesday) as I'm leaving for work just after 630 I saw him drive past our house picking up the neighbors.  I hadn't put out ours yet, but I just left it alone because we only had half a can anyways.

Today I decided to call WM to clear up any confusion.  They didn't answer so I called the secondary number on the pamphlet which turned out to be the city.  The Secretary told me that the bins have to be out by 7am.  I explained my story to her and she agreed that I should contact AM because they are wrong.

I got a hold of WM.  The first thing I asked was, what time do the bins have to be out.  The guy told me 7am.  I then asked if I could file a complaint.  He said sure.

I explained the story to him.  His reply was, well they are obviously getting out early, why don't you just put the bin out the night before. 
I told him no and that I shouldn't have to modify my routine when their schedule specifically says 7am in multiple places, and the city, as well as he, told me 7am was the time it needed to be out by.
His response was, well I guess there's going to be an issue then... He then said he would call someone to see if there was any solution, but I doubt, based on his dgaf attitude that anything will change.

I just feel like I'm rambling now, basically my question is am I being unreasonable, or should I try to get a hold of someone higher up.

224,"Just looking for some thoughts or help here.  

I am the main tenant with my name on the lease for a house.  Recently I had 2 roommates move out at the end of july, and I placed an ad for new roommates before that to get new tenants for August and beyond.  (I live near a big school and I always have college roommates even though I recently graduated).  I found 2 people who were preparing for the fall semester and agreed to move into the house.  1 of them moved in promptly with all their stuff, and the other one paid the full deposit and first month rent but never actually moved in yet.

As it would happen I just found out about a new job opportunity for myself, out of state.   I am accepting the position and will be moving for the job.  Of course this also means the lease will be terminated, and the roommates will need to find a new place or sign a new lease with the landlord.  I feel really bad about this, as they just moved in and I know it is difficult to have to find another place and go through the process again...definitely sucks and I feel that. 

 I informed the 2nd tenant (who never moved in yet) yesterday, when I found out I would be taking the job.  Since he never officially moved in, I am willing to consider their ""rent"" owed to only be the first half of the month.  Essentially I think it is fair to refund half the rent to them, as I have already paid the full rent in full to the landlord and the room was technically theirs for this time period.  

However, they are demanding a full refund for the entire month, based on the fact that they never moved in.  I feel I am doing them a favor by offering the half refund, and that I do not need to refund the whole amount.  Even though they never moved in, the room was still theirs and I could have potentially rented it to someone who would have used it for the full month and hence paid for a full month.  

Should I be paying the full month back to them out of my pocket?  Or is offering a half refund (still, out of my pocket) a fair and reasonable offer?  Any outside/objective thoughts and advice appreciated.

TL;DR - roommate never moved in during the first month, I found a new job out of state, told said roommate, roommate wants full rent refund even though we are halfway through the month, the rents been paid, and the room was theirs this whole time. ",17Aug2017,1

A lot of the times, he just completely ignores me. He doesn't seem to bother with our relationship anymore. He's kinda ""oh, whatever"". He hardly compliments me, he hardly kisses me, he hardly cuddles me, he hardly even touches me. I miss the old him. I feel so lonely, even when he's sitting right next to me. He doesn't want to be with me, he'd rather play video games, go on his phone or sleep. We actually had a conversation about how I get upset about the fact that he doesn't give me a good night kiss and say good night and doesn't give me a good morning kiss, whatsoever. Might sound pathetic and cringe, but that's how I feel. I mean, some nights, I go for a shower and by the time I come back into the room, he's asleep. Yeah, I'm not crazy, I know he's tired, but once it becomes sort of a routine, it's kinda hurtful; going to sleep on your own, when you have someone right beside you...

230,"Ok so there is a long story attatched to this question but, the gist is, there is a guy that I've liked since the beginning of this year. He has given me lots of signs that he likes me &amp; we've hung out and kissed twice.

We always make really awkward eye contact in class, the type where you stare at each other &amp; then look away, and he'll smile at me &amp; give me more attention than other guys. Earlier in the year I asked him to hang out &amp; I got to know him a little bit better &amp; that's when we kissed.

However, things didn't really work out &amp; we only hung out twice. Here's the thing, I have a theory about maybe why he'll show he likes me but, doesn't know what to do. He's a more popular guy, not crazy popular but, one of those people who everybody knows of &amp; can talk to most everybody. I'm not really that way, people know me but, I'm definitely not popular. Yesterday in class, for the first time ever, he came up and just started talking to me, asking me about my summer &amp; classes. I've always been the one to start conversations before that. However, today in a different class that he has more friends in, he kind of ignored me and went to talk to another girl.

I feel like, I know he likes me but, maybe because of who his friends are and how he's known, he might think it's weird to have a full blown conversation with me in front of a lot of people. The interaction that we've had, like kissing and hanging out, nobody else knows about except for us. So to the average person in our school, it probably would seem a little strange if we were just having long conversations a lot since, we never really hang out or talk a lot in school. Hes the kind of person who cares a lot about what other people think and I think that may be part of it too. Because, he'll give me all the eye contact &amp; try to make me laugh at our table and he even outright came and talked to me around one of his friends but, when we're in a class with a lot of aquintences and friends suddenly he kind of ignores me.

236,"Around January, my teacher introduced me to a guy a few years older than me who started his own software company. My teacher believed we could mutually benefit from talking, as I have little social ability, and he doesn't have much programming ability. 

A month in to helping this guy (for free), I asked him whether I could have shares in the company for the work I had done, and the work I was going to do with him. I also requested that the code I contributed would remain my intellectual property. This, he declined, stating that the company couldn't sell the software unless it owned it. I reacted badly and impulsively to this, and said that I didn't wish to work with him anymore. We stopped talking immediately.

Few months later, we met each other on a trip to the AWS Summit, hung around, and spoke about some development stuff. He didn't seem very bothered by what had happened.

Fast forward to now. His company looks like it's going okay. From what I can see, he's got a prototype product running. However, even just glancing at the front-end code I can see horrific security flaws. He really needs some assistance from somebody who knows what they are doing, not to be condescending to him.

In a way, I enjoyed working with him. He's a cool guy, incredibly outgoing, and could probably sell anything. I want to ask if he's up for working together again.

What I currently do would be considered middle management in most other places. 

So now that I've decided I want a job at another company I've been sending out resumes, cover letters, and portfolios to various different companies but they all get denied.

I have past work experience at a retail store and my college job (which was same field but for my college) so its not like its the ONLY thing on my resume, but its certainly the majority. 

I guess what I'm asking is, how can I get people to look past the fact that my last name is Zimmonda, and I spent 10 years at Zimmonda Enterprises?

It says hes online and playing a game but when you message him he doesnt reply. You might say that he's just AFK or forgot to turn his PC off, but for a whole week? The keyboard sounds and breathing in patterns makes it even more creepier.

256,"Hello,

Recently I had to cut ties with my friend as she no longer put any effort to reach out and hang out with me and I was no longer important. So that leaves me with one other acquaintance who lives in Steamboat and my boyfriend. I'm 21, graduated college and work night shifts due to a lack of other income. I live in a small town between two major cities. Im sure you have had this question, how do I make friends? I like board games, football and anything outdoorsy, but I really lack alot of money to spend on expensive things like sports and driving really far to other places. I do have an XBOX 360. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated thank you.

259,"I started working at this retail place 3 months ago, and suddenly a lot of people quit and ive been working 50+ hours/week since. Im trying to study and do other things with life, so that doesnt vibe with me. 
I got a job offer, and i'd really like to take it. Problem: my current job could reeeally use me, and i honestly don't know howd they cope without me. And theyve treated me very well except for the hours. Its more like a family. It would be so hard to walk in and put my two weeks in. I'm a very anxious person and hate confrontation. 
Any advice/tips on how to go through with quitting?",17Aug2017,1
260,"Family member died weds morning, I had off that day and called work that I was leaving the state for a death in the family and funeral, I told my manager if she couldn't get coverage then I wouldn't go but she assured me it was fine. 
I had said I could make it for my Saturday shift because I'd be flying back at day, but after booking the flights realized I wouldn't be able to make it with traffic. She told me ""it's your responsibility to find coverage for Saturday"". I found coverage and let her know. 
When I got back I worked two shifts without seeing her. Today she called a meeting with me and wrote me up for two other things that happened more than a month ago. When I called my coworker to vent about that she told me that both my managers while I was gone had insinuated that I was making up the family emergency. 

So I have to questions:
1) do you think the write up was retaliation
2) how do I prove that I actually was away for the funeral and should I even bother?

Quitting is not an option. ",17Aug2017,1

264,"So I just received my final bill for the house I was leasing. Everything looked normal until I looked at our water usage, which was over 5000 gallons of water. This was kind of shocking because the usage period was from July 11th to July 31st, we also never even got close to this amount before on our regular billing periods. 

So I called the utility company and spoke to someone on the phone and they were able to look at our day to day usage for that month. The lady on the phone said that everything looked normal until July 29th where she said from 9am to 9pm we used around 3000 gallons of water, but then after 9pm our water usage went back to normal. I told her that seemed impossible and she said that there's nothing we can do because the meters are accurate and we get charged for what the meter says we used. 

However since this was our last bill everything was paid using our security deposit and we still had enough left over to get some of the deposit back. I was just wondering if anyone had some advice on what to do about this situation.",17Aug2017,42
266,"I feel on hard times and I moved in with a 'friend' whom I have know off and on for close to six years now.  
Over those years, I've given him things as gifts and lost some in gambles. 

I've always known he was never the coolest person to know — he is a hot head, and we have had some serious ups and downs. It hasn't been until recently that I realised just how evil he is. I've been staying here for close to three months now, and suddenly he has become very passive aggressive about minor things. We just got into a major argument about — stiff bread. Bread which I bought with 
 own money. Off and on its been very random. 

I am %100 positive that he has stolen money out of my room. $50 bucks to be exact.  I have no evidence of this but seeing as how we are the only two that live inside the house and he asked for $35 the last week. 

I also have to mention that he is/was physically abusive to his (ex) girl friend. I remember it being deep into the night with them coming in drunk and after a few angry words, I could hear him slap her. It was extremely sad and dark. I never actually knew he was capable of something like that until then. 

Mind you, I've heard terrible rumours that he is a cheat as well. This was when we use to gamble together.
Basically — I want everything I've ever given to him, and I never will want to see his face again! Things are much deeper but I will have to spare you. 

But how can I do this without it being illegal? 

He has a photo (someone famous), coffee table, guitar and speakers. 
All of which he got from me. What's really pissed me off is he had the nerve to put the photo in the room I'm sleeping in just last weekend...
I'm not on the lease. I also have a feeling he has a nanny cam in the living room somewhere. 

What are my options Reddit? 
I could just up and move in a couple of months and take my old items. However, they have been at his house for years now, and I have no proof of purchase. Or I could move my stuff and return the key and come back within the day and take it in disguise? 
I don't care if he knows it was me, but, what about the authorities ? 

Would they care  (the authorities) if it's all worth less than $500 ? 
What if they can't see my face within the disguise but some guy returns and only took certain items — that's suspicious of the guy who just packed up and left that day ? 
Isn't this what OJ just went to jail for....

Basically, I just want my stuff back, and I at no time want see this ass hole again. I am positive he will never give it back if I ask.",17Aug2017,1
267,"Hey, I'm sort of in a bind here.

My cousin's girlfriend just came to my apartment with their daughter. He's yelling and breaking things, and threatening to kill her pets. From what I understand, he's been violent with her before, and she's scared that he'll start going after their daughter.

The apartment belongs to her, he's not even supposed to be there because of all the damage he's done to her previous apartments. She doesn't want to kick him out, because he won't have anywhere to go (no one else wants him in their house for obvious reasons).

She says that she doesn't have a very good family, and can't go to them for help. 

I know that the obvious answer is to immediately call the police and file a restraining order against him. Personally, I would have done it a million years ago, whether he has somewhere to go or not. The reason I need advice is because it's important that she makes her own decisions in this process, but she feels like she can't do anything.

She's stretched thin enough as it is, so it makes sense that it would be overwhelming for her to take action. I just want to know what I can do, as an outsider in this situation. 

Any and all advice would be appreciated. I'm not in the greatest financial situation right now, so I told her that she could call me if she ever needs me and that I'd help her out in any way I could, but unfortunately that's all I can do. I don't want to call the police if she doesn't want me to, again, because I think it needs to be her decision. She's called the police on him before, I don't know what came of it. Apparently not much.

TL;DR: My cousin is abusing his girlfriend. I want her to call the police, but she doesn't want to. I don't think it's my place to call the police for her, or get any more involved than I currently am. ",17Aug2017,1
268,"Hey, guys. I'm sure this is a fairly common situation but here we go: so my mom's account was most likely phished (?) and started sending those cookie-cutter ""follow this link to my new private video"" with a weird tinyurl link. That's well and good, we caught it, I helped her clear out apps she had connected to her account, changed passwords both on the account and on her email, logged out all on-going sessions and put up a post to let her friends know not to open the link. Thing is about 20 minutes after changing the password, I got the same message again from her account and we noticed some suspicious log-in activity going on on her account (which I immediately manually logged out). I'm all out of ideas how to prevent this from happening again, given that in this situation, I wouldn't feel safe putting her number up on FB until I'm sure the account is secure. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",17Aug2017,1
