1,"So I am a senior in high school doing robotics. My team consists of 5 people including me (2 filler people because no freshmen on my team plz) and the non filler people both have jobs. So it led up to me being the person that does all the hands on work. I wrote most of the logbook and built the robots from scratch, put my blood, sweat, and tears (sadly all 3 are true) into making it. The conflict started when on of my teammates said she didn't want me going to a competition alone despite already having agreed on me going solo 2 months prior to this event. This argument developed into me ""not taking the team into consideration,"" the same team that struggles to show up once a week to a meeting. When they show up, the girl goes to her boyfriend and my other teammate just plays on his phone. Fast forward to today, i ended up having it my way and went to the competition but the girl said we didn't get an award because i didnt ask others for help. Which i may add is a lie because i was asking multiple teams from my school and others to help me. Essentially people have made me out to be the enemy because she started crying at one point since she felt like ""she wasn't being part of the team."" (If she showed up more she could). Am i being a dictator for the team or is it justified that Im making the decisions since nobody else is moving an inch. Im going to talk to them tomorrow but i am heavily considering switching teams.",21Nov2017,2
3,"Hi all, this is actually my first ever post to reddit.

I've been thinking about this for over a year now. I've played the tuba/euphonium/trombone since my sophomore year in high school, and I decided last year (my freshman year of college) that I love music and playing so much that I would rather play my instruments for a living rather than continue down the path of engineering. Specifically, it would be my dream to become an orchestral tuba player, which I know is extremely difficult to do. 

I am currently a sophomore engineering student at a small private school. I really do not enjoy it at all. When I applied for colleges my senior year of high school, I only applied to engineering since I was relatively new to music and everyone discouraged me from doing it. The reason I am at this specific school is because I was awarded a full scholarship here, which is something that makes wanting to transfer a hard decision.

What do you guys think? I am in the process of finishing my music applications and am planning to audition in January and February. If I switch now would I be a more successful musician than if I were to finish my engineering degree first? Also, just going through with my current degree would be a pain, I REALLY don't enjoy taking these classes I feel like I'm wasting my time.

To start off, I am a 20 year old female who has recently graduated with a bachelor in digital media. I am in no way stupid, but for some reason I struggle with hospitality jobs. Always have. It seems to come so naturally to others, but for me it's a real slug.

Things I struggle with:
- being able to juggle tasks
- putting one thing down to come back to it later
- being aware of where I am needed or what I should be doing

9,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text...So I have been working for this company for a little more than a month now. When I first applied, I applied for a certain position I was really interested in and wanted more than anything, (I still do). I went through multiple interview processes and even did a working interview. However, I did not get chosen for the position but did get offered another position at the same company. Although the position I was offered was not one I was after or cared to have, I really wanted to get my foot in the door and work for this company. I did let my boss know this and that ultimately I was still very interested in the initial position and that hopefully I could eventually get it in the future.

The person who did get chosen for the position I was after did not last very long and has recently gotten fired after only about a month and a half of working here. My boss came to let me know, and also let me know that she knows I am still interested and that she would like me to have some more experience with the company before getting that position. Let me mention that I am qualified for the position and I'm not quite sure what it is about me that is making my boss hesitant. Could it be my age [21F]? Although I haven't worked there for awhile I have worked my ass off and even helped out with some work the person who got fired wasn't getting done. 
I mentioned how interested I still am in the position once again when my boss came to let me know she had let the other person go. Her response was a bit upsetting for me to hear and I feel a bit let down. 
I need advise on how I should handle this situation, because I really want the chance to prove myself to my boss and show that I could do a very well job in that position, if she will let me.

What should I do? Should I continue to push and let my boss know how bad I want this and how I'm willing to prove it? I would let her know that if things don't work out I'm totally okay with going back to my old position. My mother's advice is to let my boss know once again how bad I want it and let her know she has nothing to lose if I could just have a couple days or so working in that position to possibly prove myself to her. She also thinks I should let the President (who I have gotten to know since I've worked here) know that I am interested in filling that position still. Or should I just leave it alone and stop pestering and pushing at it, and wait for 2 years to go by for my boss to want to give me the chance in that position? I just don't want to further ruin my chances by continuing to bother her about wanting this position so bad.",21Nov2017,2
10,"So there's a lot to my story and why I dropped out of school and don't work but I'm only here to talk about the actual importance of a GED.

So I've been working on getting my GED I passed the first three sections without studying with ease. I've always had trouble with math and stopped doing anything above basic math many years ago.

So I've been studying hard but it's starting to drive me crazy. They increased the difficulty of the math so much most people no longer pass. Its down to below 40k people a year all because of the math section.

I've been playing around with the idea that maybe it's possible to find work without a GED.  

Is a GED necessary to survive? I'm NEVER going to use any of this stuff I need to learn anyway. I know basic math.

13,"As the title says, I'm a fourth year medical student. I'm applying for psychiatry and I just interviewed at a program that I ended up really liking. Didn't know what to expect going in and ended up falling in love with the program. 

During my third year, apparently I was extremely intense somehow. One attending physician sat me down and tried to talk to me about how I come across as so intense, ""your energy is just really powerful. You ask a lot of questions, sometimes at the wrong time, it'll come with time. You need to redirect your energy from what's wrong with the patient to actually how to make them better"" things like that. 

edit: I tried to taper myself down after he made these comments, but I guess I didn't do a good enough job because others still felt I was intense. I don't know. I'm feeling really insecure with myself and uncomfortable in my own skin

Well an interviewer asked me what all of the people (3) meant when they wrote how I am an intense person. I honestly wasn't expecting this question and didn't know what to say, I was flustered. I ended up saying how it's just passion and how I just love learning and trying to figure out whats wrong and what we can do to make the person better. She said she noticed how they also wrote how I am open to criticism and do not get upset when people give me criticisms. 

Needless to say, this really fucked me up in the head and now I""m extremely stressed out. I applied to 110 programs for psychiatry and only have 9 interviews, with rejections from EVERY other program (30 rejections) so far and radio silence from the remainder.

15,"I'm not sure where to start.

I've always had anger issues, and I do mean always. When I was younger I was constantly fighting with my younger brother. These fights lasted into our teen years, then just stopped. I didn't want to fight anymore.

I also want to say I never picked fights. I didn't fight because I enjoyed it, he pushed my buttons and made me angry enough to fight him. It took my parents years to see it. We're past that.

Now, I don't speak to my brother anymore, and the reason doesn't stem from our fights. He turned out to be a much worse human being than anyone thought, and everyone severed ties with him when he did the same to us. It was almost like collectively the entire family, including him, decided to just stop.

I wasn't as angry after that. Until now.

Now there's this guy. He has a professional relationship with my parents, but the guy is an asshole. I've never felt the kind of anger I feel when he comes around. Even hearing his name is enough to set me off. He's constantly starting arguments, taking them to the point of calling out our nationality and telling us that we're what's wrong with the world. He's so much better than us, because of where he comes from. He calls me names, broke into my room, I mean the guy just pisses me off. I think I have a right to be pissed off at him.

However, my parents are in a position to keep things civil with him until a better time. Basically I have to endure this for a few more months, but it's getting ridiculous. He was just standing outside of the house, yelling at me, because my dad hasn't returned his calls. 

My dad hasn't returned my calls either, his phone is broken. I tried explaining this to him, but he slammed his truck door and drove away slinging gravel as he went.

So, I'm angry. I'm not doing anything with my anger, and it just gets worse and worse. I'm afraid I'm going to snap. I'm not sure how to get over these things without acting on this anger. I'm trying really hard. 

Any advice?

16,"Hey all, so my girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months, 5 of which have been long distance, 6 weeks of that with no communication because of boot camp. She's a senior in my high school, and I'm a freshman in a military academy, so my life is pretty regimented right now. Long story short, the first 3 months were mind-boggling, this girl is perfect. We've had some rough patches in the last few months, but we've mostly resolved them, or so I thought. She went a spirit week dance last week and told me she wasn't going to grind on other guys, just hang with friends. Well the night of she ended up going with a friend. I texted her how it went after, and she said that she had a lot of fun, and ground on like 10 or 11 guys. Not like a quick butt tap, but like 1-2 songs a piece of straight grinding, with guys pushing her down for more, according to her. She basically said that she had her hands on the floor and was really giving these guys a show, if you catch my drift. This is also her first time grinding at any dance, she only did it once before with me. I'm just sitting there like ""oh ok"", and I felt like shes trying to make me jealous. But I kinda went along with it and asked her like how was it. She honesty acted like I should be impressed by all this, and was bragging about how sore she was and could barely walk the next day. I honestly wasn't bothered at first, I was glad that she got out and had a fun night. I even told her to live it up and have fun. I just didn't really expect this from her. I don't want to be a controlling boyfriend, especially in the position we are at right now, but I'm pretty bothered that she did this. Do I let this go? Do I make a bigger deal of it? I don't know, because I really love her, but I almost start shaking when I think of that scene.

17,"First I would like to apologise if I get any etiquette or anything wrong here - I don't really use reddit. I am here because the normal advice board that I use has not been very helpful.


So here is the situation. I am 19, currently living with my mom in Boulder county Colorado. I have a highschool diploma and a few certificates from Front Range Community College. My mom is currently in the process of moving to an apartment, and in her own words she is ""not bringing [me] with [her]."" 

So I am not sure what to do. I am highly autistic and anxious, so it is difficult for me to communicate with other people in person, which is a huge problem for getting a job. My only skills are with computers, like a lot of autistic people. I am a decent programmer, but most of my knowledge is in server configuration and data management. I know GNU/Linux inside and out, I know ESXi, Xen, Proxmox. I know Cisco switches and routers, I know PfSense. I know Tahoe-LAFS and Ceph. I know SAMBA and Windows AD/DC, that sort of stuff. The issues are, I don't have much ""real world"" experience. I have had two internships, one which lasted one summer and one which was two summers, both tech related, but I got both through connections who where already aware of and accommodating of my condition.

So what do I do? I am going to be homeless in less than 3 months. If I sold all of my possessions, I could maybe afford first and last months rent. I have no idea how to apply for a job or do an interview. I don't think I could even get a job in IT because of how bad I am with people.

24,"So some backstory: I grew up in an Asian Christian family, so they have conservative values on both sides of the board. I recently graduated from a pretty big university in the spring, with my parents paying for tuition. I always felt like I was wasting their money or disappointing them. And when I realized that I was trans, it got even worse. It took me a long time to accept that that was who I was. I ended up coming out to my parents while living with them during the summer. They seem to blame the whole thing on ""playing too many video games"". It's true that I spend a lot of time on my phone and my computer, but that's because those are the outlets where I can be myself and escape all the church people, family, and judging eyes. Anyway, they implement a ridiculous ""rule"" where they would confiscate my electronics for 22 hours every day. I'd understand that if I was just lazing at home doing nothing, but I'm 22, and this was right after I had switched from part-time to full-time work. So, regrettably, I cut myself, called my therapist, got an assessment at a mental hospital, and went to crash at a friend's place. Now, my parents are essentially guilt-tripping me into moving  back with them for the holidays, saying things like ""you'll appreciate this when you're older"" and ""we're going to move soon, so this is your last chance to spend time with us"", and ""you're being such a burden by freeloading at their place."" 

The friend I'm crashing with is also part of the church group, since I barely know anyone outside the church thanks to the church. I'm currently working 3 jobs to try and save up money to be financially independent, but my cell phone, car, and insurance are still under the control of my parents. Last time we had a talk about this, they said they'd be happy to support me in anything I needed, UNLESS I was queer. 

The way I see it, I can't change whether I'm queer or not. I could pretend to be cis and straight, but then I just feel like after a few years, I'll end up still hating myself even more. I feel like I'll just be pretending to be someone I'm not, like I have been basically my whole life. And if I keep doing that I'll drive myself insane.

25,"So two semesters ago I took a math teacher at my university who was incredibly unfit to be teaching that subject. He did not fully explain concepts and would cut out a bunch of middle steps to move faster through the lecture. Several students would ask him to reexplain what he just did and he would wave them off. If we answered questions with the wording and structure of the book, we were marked off. I have several accommodations with the Disability Resource Center through my university and he did not comply with one of the accommodation even though I approached him about it, with the proper paperwork from the DRC, and he signed off on the paper. 
 
Several students made formal complaints about the professor. I met with one of the heads of the math department to discuss this professor and he himself told me that the professor had gotten a remarkable amount of complaints. 

My grade appeal with denied by the gentleman that manages them, on the grounds that he did a fine job teacher the course and that it was my fault he did not give me one of the accommodations. I find this to be ridiculous because of how many students formally complained and all the negative end of the year reviews. I had no other choice but to retake this class online (online calculus was just not for me) and I did horribly because of some events that took place over my summer, so now I have to retake this class AGAIN (I’m a failure I know). 

A few weeks ago I heard from a friend I took the course with that this professor was no longer allowed to teach this subject. I didn’t want to blindly believe this possible rumor so I emailed the head of the math department that I made my formal complaint with, asking if this is just a rumor or if he really is no longer allowed(?) to teach that course. 

Today I got an email back saying that he is unable to comment on such a personal matter. Now, I don’t want to just let this be because I am spending so much money at this university and I expect a certain degree of instruction for just the amount I’m paying. I feel that my grade appeal should be revisited. I’m not asking for them to change the grade to what I personally feel I should have gotten, but I would at least like the fee to retake the class to be lowered substantially so that I can show that I am perfectly capable of performing well in the course given that the professor is capable of properly teach this subject. 

How would you suggest I respond to the email “unfortunately I cannot comment on a personal matter like this” and do you think it is foolish of me to try and have my appeal revisited?

I am about to turn 25 in a week, and I've reached an absolute dead-end in my life. I received a BA in something I don't value a whole lot, and only pursued it out of a childishness nostalgia. I did however choose two concentrations, one of which I would enjoy pursuing a PhD for if it were to pan out in an ideal situation, but that's a big what if. I fucked up early on in college and experienced some major mental instability related to psychosis that I would rather not discuss, but but it effected my gpa, it's around 2.9 I think.

31,"I am a 22-year-old engineering student. I am the oldest in the family with two younger siblings, a brother 5 years younger &amp; a sister 10 year younger. I grew up in a rural farming community in the United States where Methamphetamine use is extremely common. we are an upper middle-class family. my father owns a construction company and my mother was a stay at home mom. when I was 10 my sister and mother were almost killed during childbirth due to complications. My sister was due mid-November but to save her and my sister, was born late August. my sister spent 4 months in ICU and did not leave the hospital till she was 8 months old. my mother almost passed away during labor and was in the hospital for 3 months after delivering my sister. The complications were caused by my mother abusing methamphetamine during her pregnancy. my mother was admitted to rehab shortly after. the entire process pushed my successful family into massive debt. I will summarize the following years as quickly as possible without leaving detail. 

*	my mother went in and out of rehab slowly changing from a stand-up soccer mom to a criminal.
*	she cheated on my father causing a divorce
*	during this divorce she fought for every penny we had
*	turned me and my younger brother against my father claiming “he was evil” and brainwashing us to hate him
*	received less than she hoped from the divorce and so burned 2 of our company cars, 1 personal car, an ATV, a Boat, destroying one of our houses. and slandering my father’s name across town.
*	used all 3 of our college funds to fuel her drug addiction and lifestyle 
*	Totaled another car through a DUI. 
*	my father won custody of us after her DUI 
*	she fled with us and for 2 weeks we were homeless sleeping at drug dealers houses. 
*	she dropped me off one day in the middle of town as I was slowing her down from escaping the police, she was apprehend later that day
*	she was sent to prison for 2 years and when she was released came after our family. 
*	our family business was ruined with thousands of dollars of debt. I spent the remaining 8 years of my childhood extremely poor and left raising my two siblings as my fathers worked constantly to keep our family afloat. 
*	after release she would repeatedly break into our homes and steal documents, family momentous, non-valuable sentimental items 
*	Everything came to a head when she saw my father and siblings driving and tried to crash her car into them. 
*	she was captured and sent to prison for 4 years. 
*	I am now 14 and we all have restraining orders against her. 
*	we see her under supervised visitation sessions. 
*	she no longer shows up and I learn she was violating her parole possessing a firearm and had enough meth for an “intent to distribute” charge. 
*	she was sent to prison again.

She was released during my second year at university, I am 20 at this point, and she sues my dad claiming she deserves more than what she got from the divorce. my family business has become successful again and she feels she is owed some of that money. she stalks me through social media and shows up uninvited to my girlfriend’s work asking her about me trying to get information about my whereabouts. I blocked or deactivate all forms of social media for two years until about 6 months ago. My brother recently left to serve the military and wanted one of his last requests before he left to speak to her. Through this interaction she has been reintroduced into our lives. As far as I can tell now she is a clean, god fearing woman who spends her days volunteering at a soup kitchen. I know nothing about her beyond this until today. she recently messaged me through Instagram asking how I’m doing. I now view this entire experience as positive and I have calmed down a lot as I’ve gotten older. I am no longer angry at her and count this upbringing as a blessing as it taught me so much about life. I do consider her a stranger and feel as I’m an adult about to enter my career I don’t really need a parent anymore, that time has passed. Through this, should I respond to her Instagram message or block her again? I am expecting some type of resolution or closure, but I don’t think she can comprehend what she did to us. 
Maybe it’s time to move on and stop giving her chances to do wrong to our family. 
Maybe I should talker to her and holding on to the past is unhealthy.
what should I do?

People really look forward to their check, and I do *not* want that negative attention, so I'm biting the bullet here.

I'm already here and we're working overtime all week before we get a day off. I won't get holiday pay if I don't work the day before and the day after, and I need the money. My doctor's note says I can return to work with limited use of my right hand.

Am I justified in keeping the injury to myself and leaving the splint in my car as I work? Have any of you worked with broken bones/injuries without notifying your employer?",21Nov2017,2
35,"Ever since I was a little boy, growing up in the harsh plains of Agra Bah, I have always dreamed of aspiring to memedom. Every day I would wake up look myself in the mirror and say ""memes, memes, MEMES, MEMES!!!!"" slowly building up to the point of shouting the word memes into the mirror. Years went by as I endured the abuse and torment from my peers, enduring such as ""normie"", ""retard"" and ""gay boi"". I never stopped searching.

But as I grew older and more wise I realized this dream of mine would never come to pass. Eventually, I succumbed to the pressure and earned my wages as a microwave repairman. Now, as I lay here, bare naked, with tears streaming down my face, I write to you now from my lowest point. I don't know what I should do. The memes aren't dank enough and the normies have slowly but surely taken over my life. Please help me. ",21Nov2017,0

38,"So my ex has always been a little nuts over me and always gets me back when we break up. We have been on and off for about 5 years now and we aren't good for eachother.

So recently in the last month I have cut all contact from her and she hasn't taken that lightly. Hacking in to my facebooks (old and new one). My instagram and unblocking herself to try talk to me during work. Coming 2 hours each weekend to see me when I go out clubbing and 'surprise' me and try catch up.

Last weekend however, she broke into my house after a night out, snuck inside (I only assume to either seduce or talk to me but I was passed out from a night of drinking) and went through my phone, unblocked her number. She saw nudes on snapchat from a girl and she took photos of them and block that girl. She then sent those photos to a guy that girl used to date to start shit. Is this illegal, wtf do I do at this point because each week something else happens or I find out some other crazy shit shes doing

TL;DR - Ex has broken into my house, snuck inside went through my phone and sent nudes of a girl she knows to the guy she used to date

39,"I'm a senior in College about to graduate with a business degree(logistics to be specific). I am applying to jobs but without too much success. I'm not too worried I guess, but I'm more concerned with the fact that I will live a boring desk job for the next 20 years if I just follow the standard footstep. I want to have an exciting career path.

Recently, I figured out in myself that I'm more artistic than I thought. I'm very interested in films, architecture, and leisure industry. I would love to use my business degree to get a job within there(and hopefully slide into that category of work instead of the business side) instead of a company whose product I could care less about. Most of the companies on the career website seem very dull and none of them seem to be related to the three industries I mentioned above.

What can I do in order to make sure to get a job I like coming out of college? If getting a desk job is unavoidable, how can I make the switch later in life?",21Nov2017,3

44,"I just moved to a rougher neighborhood. A few houses down, there’s 3 kids that have 2 ATVs and 1 dirt bike. They ride them really late at night, and it’s really loud. Ontop of that, they speed. I’m afraid they’re going to hit a child or a dog one day. They think it’s funny to pop wheelies when they see oncoming traffic, and they swerve into cars. I almost crashed last week, and my boyfriend said they taunt his car while he’s driving. 

I’m childish, so I swept all my pine straw from my driveway into the street, in hopes that their tires would loose traction and they would eat shit. 

My boyfriend and I are also considering buying a few pounds of gravel and dumping it in the street for 6 houses length. We could also call the police, but I just think they would give them a warning. What can I do about this? It’s been 6 months of torture and my boyfriend and I are about to loose our minds.

45,"In university, a professor offers extra credit for those that submit a summary of some texts related to the current topic. We all know it is sent directly to the TAs and the files usually aren't even opened. Supposed to be easy points to help with your grade, especially because this time of the school year is very stressful, with tests, essays and papers piling up, altogether with the pressure to not fail our classes. I am aware I'll probably need some points so I won't have to take the final exam, and because of that I tried to do the summaries last week. One of the texts was a specific chapter of a book that wasn't available on the internet nor the library. The deadline was closing in, so I decided to do the dishonest thing: I looked up some summary online (that I believe wasn't about the recommended chapter) and copied/pasted it in my file, tweaking it a bit, but there wasn't any substantial difference. I sent it in anyway last monday, 90% confident I wouldn't get caught.
Today, i got an email from the TAs saying they identified my plagiarism. I don't think they'll tell the professor, so the only consequence is that the extra credits won't be registered. I emailed back saying I'm sorry for that and asking if I could redo it or compensate these points somehow. I was at the heat of the moment, angry with myself, and I know I won't be able to actually do these summaries once more. I'm just an overachieving child that grew up to be quite normal academic-wise, but cannot deal with anything less than excellent.
I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that plagiarized, because no one in this class could get their hands on the text, but a lot of people are in need of some points to pass. I recognize my mistake, and I know that being stressed and overwhelmed is not a good excuse to do what I did. I'm also very aware that plagiarism isn't acceptable in the academic field - I would never simply copy and paste something in a mandatory piece of work. I just need some advice on dealing with this guilt that I'm feeling, no matter how hard I try to convince myself that I did my part and took responsibility for my actions - there's pretty much nothing else I can do.

My only problem is that I honestly have no clue how to do this whatsoever and, although I do enjoy doing some things, once it’s over I just fell worse than before. It’s like I’m at a state of equilibrium until something actually happens, but then I get excited and have some fun and it escalates.

I'm doing this so I can go to a four-year university, as soon as possible.

Whenever another friend gets into a relationship I feel like shit for a while because it just serves as a reminder of something I will never have. I know this shouldn't bother me but it sucks seeing people happy together while I'm alone for most of the day.

55,"College senior. F22. My dad had his first heart attack like 11 years ago and has been on the decline ever since. That same year we got a puppy. This year, the dog passed away, about 3 weeks ago. He was my best friend, especially through my parents’ divorce in 2012-2013. He kept my mom
company after I went to college. Losing my 10 1/2 year old dog was one of my hardest moments. However, it doesn’t take away the fact that my dad’s health is on the decline. He had a hard time with being divorced and being sick and became addicted to hard drugs, tearing apart his body much faster, and went to rehab in 2015. He’s in and out of the hospital all the time. Today, he signed a DNR and DNI form. When doctors talked to him about lifestyle counseling, he said he wasn’t interested. He’s 54. 
Basically, he’s done trying.
On top of that, during the divorce, I spent a lot of time with my grandparents and we got very close. I’m closer with my grandparents than i am with my dad. They’re well into their 70s though, and not getting any younger. 
I don’t know if there’s anything i can do. I don’t know if i can help. Watching everyone i love slip away from me is slowly destroying me. It’s making me absolutely terrified of losing everyone, damaging my relationships, and making it hard to finish out my last year of college.

56,"I always knew that one of my friends would have a jerk boyfriend, but I never really expected the one I ended up with.  There'll be a tl;dr at the end, because I'm going on a bit of a rant here.

I made a new friend this semester.  She has a tendency to overthink and go off on philosophy tangents, but she's really cool.  She ended up joining a club with me, we roomed together on a club trip, I really enjoy spending time with her.

The problem is that her boyfriend is like her times ten minus any regard for others or actual logic.  He's pretty much the walking ""iamverysmart"" and it *never stops.*  It's impossible to have any kind of conversation with him because he's incapable of accepting even the most simple fact of life without quasi-intellectual overexamination.

Example from today: he interrupted class to pick up something for his girlfriend/my friend who was absent today.  One might think this would be a simple.  But with no prompting he launched into a philosophical tangent about the *intent* of interrupting.  The teacher tried to get him to leave, but he just went on and on about how she couldn't assume it was his *intent* to interrupt.  I rather bluntly said ""You're interrupting right now,"" and was told that I didn't know if that was his intent.  He basically waylaid class for a solid five minutes.

Other highlights: 

* Him telling me I obviously haven't studied a subject I *have* studied for four years because I called him out on misunderstanding a basic concept of it.

* Him sitting in the back of a club meeting drawing on the board and talking loudly about formal logic and philosophy while we were trying to have a club meeting.

* After being asked to leave by our teacher (during the same club meeting), him saying that the teacher was simply arrogant and unwilling to accept Truth.

* ""We don't have time to get muddled down in details.  We're seeking *Truth* and finding the Truth is difficult.""

* After he scared everyone away from his booth at a club fair: ""I don't think they would be able to keep up with our pace, anyway.""

* Him about my club: ""I think I'd enjoy the content, but nobody would understand my arguments.""

* After I mentioned I'm religious to someone who was not him: ""Well, regardless, I think you have potential.""

* ""But you don't have a perception of the intent of my perception of my perception.""  (I swear to God this is an actual quote.)

After my intitial few meetings with him, I thought that he *must* have some degree of Asperger's or something similar.  I tried to not get frustrated with him.  Surely somebody could not be so pretentious and still understand social cues.  But according to my friend, he simply doesn't care about other people's opinions.  He's begun a handfull of his insults to me with ""no offense,"" and when he's called out for being rude, he says that the other person is wrong, stupid, or arrogant.

*I cannot stand him.*  And it would be enough to simply dislike him, but he's always there, always interrupting club meetings, always randomly barging into classes.  He tries to have conversations with me and it's impossible because he makes *no fucking sense* and when I point out any issues with his arguments (and it's *always* an argument) he tells me that I have no idea what I'm talking about.

*How do I deal with this?*  They've been together for years.  They live together.  My friend seems to be completely aware of how insufferable he is, but doesn't mind.  I just don't understand, and I don't know how to deal with it.

It's turned some people into doormats who let others walk all over them, and others into insidious gossips who will talk to everyone except the person they have a problem with. I see myself following in both of these paths in different ways. 

Funny enough, I'm known in my family for actually telling people what I think. I do so more than the rest of them. However, it's always been ""too little, too late,"" and I've stood up for myself after too much damage was done. I've allowed friends and family to hurt me because I didn't stick up for myself. (Their actions are their own fault, but I would like to be able to stop them in the future.)

My questions are:

* How do I know when to speak up for myself and when to let the little things go?

* How do I maintain relationships without being a doormat?

* What reactions should I expect from others when I challenge their behavior?

81,"I'm gonna start college soon in USA(in Staten Island New York) and wanna find a place to stay. Because I'm an international student i can only work 20 hours a week which results to an income of about 1500-2000$ per month. I'm looking for an apartment or for people who are looking for roommates, but don't have any idea where to start. Are there any subreddits, websites or apps where i can search what I'm looking for.",21Nov2017,3
83,"Context : I’m a student living in a studio apartment. A few months ago, my cousin asked me if she can stay with me for a few months. She promised that she’ll look for a job and help me with the monthly expenses (rent, electricity, water, internet, etc.). Naturally, I agreed. She moved in, got a “*job*”, and goes out every morning to *report* to work. The first few weeks were okay, but whenever I ask her share, she’s always tell me that her salary’s delayed, she had to send money to her brother, and stuff like that.

Two weeks ago, I went out for a vacation, leaving money for my share in the expenses, and told her that everything is due on the 15th, and she just said “*ok i’ll give this to our landlord*”. I was skeptical with it but still left the money to her anyway. Yesterday, I found out that the expenses aren’t paid yet, and we’re facing multiple penalties.

Now the question is, how do I tell her that she’s not helping out in the house at all? I’ve been thinking about it while I’m on vacation (which is a hassle because I wanted to destress myself yet I still am lmao). According to my cousins, she is diagnosed with clinical depression. Her brother buys her antidepressants yet she doesn’t take them, and she’s had multiple suicide attempts, which scares the hell out of us like “*yoooo hide yo meds, hide yo knives, coz she gon’ use dem to kill herself*”

Sorry for the long post :—( 

**UPDATE**: I talked to her about this issue earlier today. At first she was ~~being a crybaby~~ asking me to reconsider, but I did my best to be firm. She has to be out of the house before December. Along with that, she has to pay all the remaining dues/penalties for this month. Thank you everyone for your help! (⌒▽⌒)",21Nov2017,30
86,"So it’s been 3 years since I’ve been in an actual relationship. Recently I (male) have met a guy and we’ve been talking a lot. We’ve made it pretty clear that we’re really into each other. 

I’m 20 and have recently decided to put myself back out there since I’ve grown a lot more confident in myself and as soon as I did, I met the guy I’ve been talking to. We always have something to talk about and we’re making plans to hang out for the first time sometime soon...but the thing is...I haven’t really gone out, or dated someone in 3 years. 

Every time I tried...it didn’t go well. Probably because I was very insecure when I tried. They always ghosted me or lost interest, but this guy seems far from that.

Im a 20 year old male, graduated 2016, big athlete in a couple sports, big into technology, got terrible grades tho lol but all i had to do was maintain a C to be eligable to play on friday nights. But im sitting here, 20 years old, with 4 cents to my name, my phone was just shut off 2 days ago, i barley paid this months rent, i have no one to go to for any help. Junior year i lost my dad to liver failure, and was kicked out of the house i was in because i didnt want to give them any money i was receiving from the passing of my father ( they had no entitlement they were my moms parents) so we had our differences and that causes a huge chaos causing me to be thrown out and forced into a foster home rather during my junior year of highschool. At the time i had an awesome girlfriend who supported me who then ended up dumping me after highschool lol but thats okay. Huge depression struck me harder than ever until i recovered towards the beggining of senior year. But once senior year ended my life went down hill. My foster family wanted me to move out because they ended up moving states, my mom is a full time alcoholic and never could take care of since the beginning so i was just stuck. I hung around adults and started getting heavy into drinking at a young age. I got into a little accident a week after graduation, with a tree. I got a hit n run of property, and a no insurance ticket because i was not notified from my grandparents that they cancelled my insurance early.  then 3 months went by and my dumb ass got a DUI. at the age of 18. and have been dealing with it since but its my fault that my dumb self was drinking and driving. i totally regret it cause im here, 20 years old, cant drive anywhere, cant drive to dates with my girlfriend i just feel worthless. I owe 2 seperate court systems a ton of money, im just so bad at managing my money i was never told how to so i just kinda go crazy with checks on stupid things. ive been dealing with heavy depression and loneliness. I haven't seen anyone from my family since the death of my dad in 2015, the occsaional phonecalls from my mom turn into arguments because shes normally pretty drunk. and i just dont have anyone to turn to. I kinda feel like im just stuck in this rut that i cant get out of. And im seeking advice cause i cant afford a counselor or anyone in that field to talk to so i thought id reach out. Thank you

Ok, so they are completely different than me. I live in the south and they are so southern... and I am not. They hunt, I go to vinyl shopping. They listen to country music, I listen to alternative. I’m not saying that it’s bad that I’m different, but because we are so different I only do one thing when I’m with them, which brings me to my next point. 

All we do is get high. A typical night with them would be going to one of the usual hangout (one of their houses) and go to the shed in the backyard, get stoned, end up sleeping on the floor, in a car, or in that nasty, cold shed.

101,"Through high school and college I've been really close with a friend and she and her mother saw me through a lot of tough times when I was, quite frankly, an intolerable and lonely person. But the last couple years of college I grew close with a friend who has really helped me become a better person and I feel emotionally intimate with him in a way I never did with Friend #1. 

Recently I realized that the patterns of interaction between me and Friend #1 leaned to the co-dependent and toxic. We seem to only complain to each other and her attitude is really negative, which negatively colored the way I saw and reacted to things for years, and made me afraid to suggest things or express my own tastes around her for fear of being judged or shot down. I kind of feel responsible for this, since I never bothered to filter myself when speaking with her, misconstruing candid speech with trust when I was really being rude and insulting and thereby establishing a bad dynamic for our interactions. We are starting to grow apart taste and interest-wise as well, but I still care about her since she was like my second family for years and her mom was like my second mom.

I have been trying hard to be tolerant and patient and not be passive-aggressive, but today at dinner (the first hangout in a while) I accidentally said ""my best friend and I...."", referring to Friend #2 and it got a little awkward. It sounds like kindergarten problems, but I know she is sensitive to those kinds of references and has felt that I've been less available since finding more friends in the last year or so.

104,"Ok so context.

There's this guy I met in the first week of school. We're both seniors and we're assigned to sit next to each other in English, and we became friends immediately. I've been in the same school as him since 4th grade but we only started to know each other this year. We're both 17, he's a guy, I'm a girl. Anyway he was forced to go to military school across the whole state (Cali) literally 2 weeks after school started, so there's that. We still kept in touch over Snapchat and texting though.

Because he's coming home for Thanksgiving break, I decided to get in touch with him and see if we could get together. We made a plan to go to the mall today, and it went really well. He's flirted with me over text too like when we were talking about his dogs he was all like ""though you know all about being cute lmao"" 

And today at the mall, he was really flirty. I decided to test the waters by flirting first. I put my arm around him at the most random times, and hugged him when I first saw him. I hugged him a multitude of times today.

Examples...
- slid his arm through mine while we walked
- teased him and hugged him at the same time

He responded and pretty soon he was randomly hugging me too. I tried staying in the dressing room while he was trying on a suit and he told me to ""skedaddle."" When he was trying on a suit, he asked me to put his tie on cause he couldn't, and I put it on and he hugged me and we stayed like that for a while.

We were at the mall for 4 hours and the entire time we were hugging and touching. So the touch barrier has definitely been broken. We haven't kissed but I have a feeling he wouldn't mind if I did kiss him.

He also comment flirtatious things a multitude of times...

Examples
- when I jokingly showed him a crop top and told him he should wear it, he was all ""no thanks, but I'd love to see you in it""
- I told him he looked good in his suit and he was like ""you have a thing for guys in suits don't you"" and then hugged me
- ""how do you make a free college shirt you got in the mail look that good""
- I was telling him how my parents don't like me eating chocolate and he looked at  me up and down and said ""well you're not getting fat anytime soon"" and hugged me. However I am kinda fat lol my doctor has said I need to lose 10 pounds at least
- he told me I was cute a number of times


Ok so it seems like he likes me. But we're both seniors, he lives in SoCal and I live in NorCal. How would we even make it work? To top it off we might go to different colleges too.

105,"I am a relatively normal person. However, I have a lot of anxiety and it makes me introverted, so I have almost no friends but I do have a boyfriend.

106,"I am a 19 year old female and I think I need a bit of advice...

Basically I was a girl who didn't know how to love herself and gave her body away too easily to people who don't deserve it. I was pumped and dumped by many many guys as I didn't understand how guys work and 'the game'. Some really good looking ones and some way below my league. Point is, none of them stayed after they managed to have sex with me. Those who did are just a burden to my life - too clingy etc etc.

Living in a conservative asian country with a very liberated and western mindset I get a lot of stigma. I mean I'm not the type to dress like a whore or anything but when it comes to sexual conversations or whatever I can be very open. I did not foresee that this will bring about so much bullying from my peers (highschool) as well as by my parents. I've been called 'sl*t' openly by my peers, my parents as well as my significant other (who i left bc he was too abusive).

I'm recently deeply heartbroken by someone I like who only wanted to have sex wth me. It didn't come to me that having lots of sex as a female is a problem until I fell for him. He has the view that girls should not be promiscous and shamed me for what I did. If I didn't love him I wouldn't be that bothered to be honest.

As any other normal person, I'm deeply hurted by the bullying. In fact I have been falling into depression for the past few months. Counselling and anti-depressants are not helping much.

A part of me believes that people should be allowed to do whatever pleases them (sex) as long as they are not hurting anybody in the process. A part of me hate men who lied to me / coerced me into intercourse and threw me away afterwards. A part of me feel like a dirty prostitute who has been used by men because I was too naive. A part of me feel that I don't deserve this stigma and people are generally mean-spirited and cruel. A part of me just want to end it all...

I act like I'm happy and fine outside (social media / with friends) but inside I'm just dying and in pain... I've been like that for months and the pain is not fading...

I really don't know what is the right way to feel - leave my sexual past behind and start a new life / stay strong in what I believe. And I don't know who to seek help from. I don't know if this is the right place to seek advice from but I hope someone can help me...?

Furthermore, I can live by myself easily enough, as I have had a fairly independant upbringing. I am not worried about finding or keeping work, as I am pretty good at what I do. I am not worried about keeping myself fed or general ""adulting"" things. 

What I am worried about is this: I know several people a bit older than me (including some recent grads) who are struggling in post-grad life to find friends, community, or things to do outside of work, and such a prospect terrifies me. Add to the fact that I am introverted (as in being around people tends to drain me, not that I lack social skills.) So long story short, I don't want to end up being a social shut-in who doesn't have any friends and only works all day.

She has food shelter and water but nothing else there. I visit her every week almost. She whines horribly when I leave ):. I got her spayed and got her shots. 

She is great with me and is a great dog but growls or cowers from others. She tried to bite or nip the vet and I had to hold her head while she got treated. She is also terrified of cars and pees if yelled at. She is great with cats and dogs however. 

I am moving soon and am trying to find a place that allows dogs.  I can only work part time as im a fulltime college student and only make 150 a week so and almost for sure need a roommate.  I am using a student loan to pay for housing for 1 year till I graduate but that covers rent plus bills only. 

With my dog how she is right now she would not be able to handle another person. I got a quote for recommended training for her at 150 for an eval and then 500 for 4 private lessons with a dog trainer and behaviorist. Would this be the best way to go? Would it work? Do places like that offer payment plans? 

I also wanted to know if it seems inappropriate to have a gofundme for her? I was thinking of filming her behavior issues. I would want to set up some kind of guarantee that it would go directly to a trainer as well. If this isn't a good thing to do please let me know haha. 

If training probably wouldn't work I was thinking of contacting some rescues to see if they can help her find a home, but not sure if her behavior is too much for them. Plus she is really attached to me ):

I’m 16 and I live in Germany, I wasn’t born here though. I moved here like 3 years ago. We’re a small family with a small apartment. We’re not rich or anything, but we’re not poor either.

Both of my parents work their asses off in order to get what I want, because that’s the kind of parents I have. They’re amazing and always put me first before anything.

My grand mother including my aunts (almost all of them are divorced), they would call my father and cry like idiots on the phone about not having enough money to feed their children.

My father, being the only generous man in the family, of course sends them money because he always says family should stick together. Here’s the thing though, they manipulate my dad into thinking that they need money to feed their children or some shit, but they waste the money.

They used my dad’s money to get plastic surgeries so they can look like total sluts and move on to wreck another man’s life before getting divorced. Not only that, but I see my cousins on my Snapchat going to fast food restaurants 24/7.

And it was all from my dad’s money. All of it. How does this affect us? If I wanted to buy clothes or something then my parents would tell me that they can’t afford it, but that’s like totally fine because I would never complain about it or anything. 

Here’s where it gets awful, since my parents always put me first, they would spend their last cent on me. It’s been like almost a year since my parents bought something for themselves. I don’t want them to live for me, I also want them to enjoy life and spend the money they earn on themselves too, but how could they when my grand family asks my dad to send them money each month?

They disgust me. None of my cousins go to school, but they still get to get stuff that they don’t deserve, FROM MY DAD’S MONEY!

They’re a disgusting family, literally the grossest people I’ve ever met in my life. There is so much more shit, but I don’t want to go too much into detail.

I had gone on dates with B girl and C girl, when out of the blue I got invited by A girl to a night out. And on that night out I slept with her. In the same week I had a 3rd date organised with C girl, which we had a really nice time and ended up sleeping together. At this point I was advised and thought it was the right thing to end it with two of them. Bearing in mind I had only been on 1 date with B girl and got the feeling that A girl was something casual and one off, so I broke it off with A girl and B girl (had to tell B girl the honest truth that I was seeing someone else and it wasn’t fair for me to string her along).  So after ending it with the two girls, girl C says she’s not sure about seeing me again and wants to call me to talk.

147,"Hello all
would like some advice from people who have experience with PTSD either themselves or a loved one. What follows is an account of my relationship with a very good man who has some issues to deal with. these issues made me ill and so I left him. I still want the best for him. Please read on for the whole story.

I fell in love with a man whos quite a few years younger than me; but we matched in lots of different ways and things things felt good.

He showed signs of mistrust and insecurity very early on  which I thought was due to our age difference and that my career is quite ahead of his. He would question me on my male friends which became tiresome very quickly as I have a large social circle. His temper would often flare up when he perceived that I was checking out other men; whilst I was with him, I never looked at anyone else, I liked him the most. He would often bother me whilst I was away with friends or family and he wasn't there - questioning me about who I was with or starting arguments so that I paid attention to him.

I broke up with him a few times, each time though I would get back with him after writing a letter of things he needed to work on and things I would try and do. I made it really clear what I needed - trust and kindness. The year that I was with him was very difficult for me because i felt he controlled when i was having a good time through his acting up. i was back at university and had family issues too so all of this quickly built up and I became depressed with symptoms of anxiety. He noticed this but despite his attempts at improvement, he never seemed to be able to stop the things that made me ill.

Finally I'd had enough and told him that I knew he was a very good guy, he is, but that our relationship was toxic. He then told me that he knows he has trust issues and thats because of something terrible that happened to him when he was young.

It makes sense to me now - I think he has PTSD - he is hypervigilant - always looking and waiting for bad things to happen, he doesn't trust people, even his closest friends and he has extremely low self esteem.

I have split up with him finally after I had a massive deadline and I was taking steps towards medical care - during this he read my facebook messages (after promising he wouldnt look at the fb Id left open on his phone) and accused me of a thing with an old travelling pal. For my own health, I stopped our relationship.

I now worry about how this was all affect him in the long term. He is a very good man with a lot of potential. He is also very immature, selfish and suffering the effects of a traumatic past. I have protected myself and not replied to his messages. I sent him a birthday present of books - one about happiness, and I wrote he should try to leave his past behind and focus on nurturing those around him (his family).



Its a vague request - but does anyone have any insights to offer? Should I stop talking to him completely? I am getting better now after having received treatment. I still get very angry about how he treated me and the hypocrisy of his behaviour. Help!",21Nov2017,2

150,"I (24) live with my mum (44) in a two bedroom flat. We've rented the apartment for 20 years (although I moved out for Uni and moved back in), the location has always been convenient, she's within walking distance of my grandparents house, her job, the bus stops (she drives anyway), the supermarket and her friend who lives at the other end of the street.
My aunt (mum's youngest of two) is what you'd call a hopeless romantic. She got married at 22, was divorced at 30 (no kids) and has pretty much had a boyfriend consistently ever since, if she was single it wasn't for very long. She has a knack for picking materialistic men and has gotten herself in with a guy who is fairly reckless, he's an adrenaline junkie, spends wildly and they're always going on holiday. The guy is successful but fails to realise that other people (namely my aunt) can't keep up with his lifestyle and my aunt has since spent a significant amount of her savings in trying.


My aunt has a house near us but is further away from all of the amenities - add 15/20 minutes to every journey by foot as she is moving to a new town to be with the guy that she's with and wants trying to rent the house out. She wants me and my mum to move in, I flat out told my mum that it was a bad idea, but my grandmother thinks it's a good idea (which it isn't since we live 5 minutes from her house), my worry is that my mum is spineless and easily manipulated and I feel like they're convincing her of this in order to do my aunt a favour.


Even though mum rents social housing, it's a place she's secure in and at least she has a degree of autonomy, if my aunt breaks up with the guy, then that's 3 of us living together until my aunt decides to shack up with Chad#3456324 and I'm planning to move back to London at some point anyway; but the flat is safer. My aunt and her partner have also talked about moving to California in the next few years, an issue there is that if my mum gives up her home and moves in and my aunt needs money to move to the US, she may need to liquidate the house she already lives in and that leaves my mum without any leverage since she doesn't own anything.


This reeks of my aunt looking for a quick fix under the pressure of her new partner since she has a house that's empty that she's not making money from. Any advice?


TL;DR: Aunt wants us to move in, sounds like a bad idea

154,"Hey guys, sorry in advance for the long post. There's a lot going on and I need to get it out. I'll try to sum up what's happening:

* I've just finished my first year of graphic design at university, got two more to go. 

* My workplace is closing down in 6 months and I'm not counting on getting transferred. I've been looking for work but it's hard to find something I can fit in with University that gives me enough to live on. Here in Australia, I can get government payments while I'm studying but it's not enough to live on. 

* If I haven't found a job by the time my workplace closes down my landlord won't renew the lease. 

* My partner (who I've been with almost 3 years) is terrible at looking for work. He's been unemployed for over a year now and he's barely even trying. I keep telling him to try harder and he never does. I've threatened to break up with him if he hasn't found a job by the time I lose mine. I don't want to break up and I'm scared I'm going to lose him because he's still not trying. 

* I don't have a car, I haven't been able to afford one since I've been spending the last year supporting my boyfriend and trying to get myself through university. 

I've recently realised I have to make a decision now. If I wait to see if things work out, I run the risk of not having a job in the next few months. On the other hand, I could try to find a job with enough hours to support me but that means I can't return to University next year. I could try and develop my skills on my own to find an entry level job or try my hand at freelancing. Or I could postpone my studies for a year while I try to get my life back on track. Living with my parents is not an option, they both live in remote kind of areas that leaves me with even less options. I don't really have any friends I can move in with or rent a place with either.

162,"Hi all🙂

Just thought I'd pop in here and see if I could get some advice on a situation at home. 

So I'm currently sixteen, and have been playing the 'cello with private lessons for about six years. Last year I completed my grade eight AMEB 'cello exam, and personally had has enough of the instrument. Don't get me wrong, the 'cello is a great instrument, and I still wanted to play in small events, I just wanted to stop lessons and formal playing. Not too much to ask IMO.

Anyway, I proposed this to my parents, but they^1 wouldn't have a bar of it. They refused to let me stop taking lessons. I argued that I didn't enjoy practising for an hour a day, nor did I enjoy lessons (an extra 2 hours a week with travel). My argument is that I get no joy out of playing and there's no monetary value either (infact it has cost them thousands of dollars). Theory argument is that I can't see the bigger picture.

You'll notice I've moved into the present tense now😉

I have a lot of respect for my parents. This is the first time I've really been opposed to their plan. So I go along with it, I'm having lessons. But then I find out they want me to not only take lessons, but attend an orchestra (Percy Grainger^2) and also *go for my AMusA*!? I'm not happy...

**TL;DR**
So here's the advice I'm looking for: 
1. what to say to my parents
2. how to find the motivate to practice/play

**Footnotes**
1. When I reference my parents *they*, I really mean ""my mother with the support of my father"". I honestly think he would let me quit, but it's supporting Mum because, well, she's his wife. This is perfectly okay with me.

168,"Hey,

Throw away account for obvious reasons.

So here’s the situation. Recently went to visit really good friends of my parents, who are actually my god parents, so they’ve always been around and I love visiting them. But this time I had an unpleasant experience, one that have left a mark on me, and is haunting me.

My dad is tech savvy, so he always help people with their computers or whatever. This time was no different, my godfather who I’ll call Michael, asked my dad to look at his computer since he felt it was running slow. I join them in the computer room and look on, as I figured I could chip in with something too. So, my dad is checking his internet browser, loading pages to see what’s going on, and seeing how slow it is. As he clicks on the top of the search bar in the browser, recent searches comes up, and for some reason my dad is going down the list highlighting them (don’t ask me why) I obviously look on. Well here comes the disturbing part, while running through the list, there’s searches including “pedo pictures” and “small child porn”. My dad saw it too, and quickly clicked out of the drop down menu. I didn’t say anything, neither did my dad, but Michael knew we saw it. Didn’t try to really cover it up, but said shortly after that he hadn’t used that browser for a year. Which really doesn’t matter. - he was actively seeking pedophile stuff. I left the room shortly after because I felt sick to my stomach and also uncomfortable. I went about the rest of the evening pretending like everything was normal, which was really hard for me, because of what I had seen. The rest of the time I just wanted to leave that house and never come back. What really makes me uncomfortable is that his wife runs a daycare for children. Not from home though. But it’s really disturbing.

I never brought it up with my dad, or anyone else in the family. I talked to my girlfriend about it because I couldn’t just carry this alone.

Now it’s been 4 days, and I think about it constantly, it haunts the heck out of me. Michael has always been a huge part of my life, always looked up to him. He taught me how to fish and all sorts of stuff. Now I feel sick just thinking of him, and I never want to see him again.

My question is, what do I do? I feel like i should do/say something, but I also know that if it gets out to his wife or anyone, it could ruin his life. I mean, I only saw his search history, but who knows what other kind of stuff he might have or even could potentially do? I feel awful that I didn’t do or say anything, but I was paralyzed that night, and I still am now. In my mind I’m trying to come up with a good reason for those searches, probably because I’m in denial. But there’s no denying that what he searched for is dead wrong and illegal.

TL:DR - Got a look at my godfathers search history, it included pedophile searches. My dad saw it too. Neither of us said something, and acted like nothing happened. The experience haunts me, and I don’t know what to do.",21Nov2017,41

177,"
So, I’ve recently moved to a state in the Northeast a little over a year ago. (CT) I was lucky enough to find a job at a small manufacturing company, working assembly for a new product line they were developing. I was told upon hire that I would start slow to learn the product, and they wanted to see me eventually fill the department head role. This was at $15 an hour. Not bad at all, no complaints. As any employee would, I obviously worked my ass off to impress my employers as much as I could. (It’s important to mention here, that I’m in the USAF, and I build explosives for the military. I’m used to assembly procedures, and precise inventory methods.) I cut their assembly rate by more than 1/2, and I completely revamped and reorganized their warehouse structure for this developing line. Eventually, I even revitalized and rebuilt their entire inventory program they use, to actually have accurate real-time inventory counts, and so that when a large order came, we were able to accurately forecast and place purchase orders for the entire order. 

Well, after 4-5 months, I was given a raise, ($3hr) and I was told this was going to be in steps. Every few months, we’d meet, discuss how I’m doing, what they need, and increase my pay as we go. I should’ve gotten this in writing at that moment, and that’s where I fucked up - I admit that completely. But I’ll continue. 

Following this meeting, I then developed a company product tracking method. This way they wouldn’t be caught having to replace things for free that they had nothing to do with in the first place. (User errors, etc) - this was tracked by serial numbers on the units. They were extremely thankful, and I kept pressing forward. By now I’ll mention - I’m the only one in my department. So the managerial admin side of things, and assembly side was all me. The items I built were worth $3,000+ a piece, and they weren’t easy builds. They used to take my employers 7-8 hours to fully build and test a unit, when I came I had it down to ~4. So, by this time the stress began to amount, especially when 30+ unit orders started down the pipeline. (This is in addition to spare part orders, all of which were filled, packaged, and shipped by me.)

I began to ask for another employee, or help, which I never received. I asked for a chance to sit down and meet (as per our verbal agreement) and was basically waved away. 

Fast forward a month or two. Not only do I handle all of that, my employer found out I had been teaching myself programming and web design as well. They then stopped using their outsourced web devs, and I now handle their website design. Again, I asked to sit down, and discuss where I’m at, and I’m told “sure, sure next week.) spoiler alert - never happened. Even after asking two-three more times throughout another two month span. 

We’ll skip to now. I’m currently the dept. head I mentioned before. I also am the *entire* company inventory manager. I also create/generate/place all of the company purchase orders and requisitions for the parts we need for anything. I handle the web design and updates. I do the graphic design for their advertisements. I process the employee labor and payroll, take sales orders, customer support calls, fill part orders and ship them out, but also handle the company marketing advertising as well. Still at $18/hr, four vacation days a year. Not even on salary. I finally got fed up and asked in a more pushful tone to sit down and talk about what I’m responsible for and such - and I was told “we all have to wear multiple hats here. We just can’t afford to pay you to sit in front of a computer all day!”

Not that I need it - but there’s no healthcare here. Actually, there’s no benefits besides a 401k. 



Well, my company’s file system is extremely messy and we have documents on hires, fires, job offers, etc. dated back to 2001 and beyond. So I’ve begun looking through and compiling all the written roles and responsibilities of the previous employees and copied them, and I’ve got a solid two page list of things I’m responsible for, and it’s still growing. I also have all of the responses over a 5 month span of my requests for a meeting, and all the times I was waved away. I plan to drop this package I’m creating when I finally get my chance to sit down again, and push for what I deserve, backed by written documentation. 

Anyone have any advice besides just “walk out”? Maybe a more mature route I can take for this ? Or a different angle? I can’t just leave, I depend on the pay, and on top of it all, I juggle reserve weekends. So it’s difficult to structure my schedule if it’s not for long term. ",21Nov2017,1

204,"Simply put, I am terrified of any opportunities or changes that get made to my life. 

I am stuck in stagnation, and I find myself only mildly happy with my life and how things have turned out for me. Simply put; I find myself always ""okay"" with how things turn out for me.

What is prompting this; well, I have landed an internship with my own company, I actually have done this once before and was less stressed out about it a few years ago, because I didn't anticipate any expectation of commitment, it simply became an opportunity to work somewhere else and do something different for a short duration of time. By the time it was over I was excited to be coming home and going back to my old life. 

Apparently this experience, my work ethic and attention to detail was very noticed, and about a year later a new program emerged, and by the encouragement of my management team I applied again, just for fun.

The program I applied for I got passed on, simply because they were looking for someone different during the next round (seemed silly to bring the same guy back for the same thing). I was stressed by the whole interview process, but relieved after it was over thinking ""welp, I tried."" 

Fast forward a few weeks, and another department seemed to find my resume and was intrigued by it, I received a surprise email and was asked for a short interview. I figured ""why not? I get to learn something new, which is something I always enjoy."" During the interview our conversation felt natural and actually quite casual, they asked some questions about my resume and previous experience during another internship, the whole thing lasted a little under 30 minutes, and I walked away thinking nothing of it. 

A few days go by, my management team sits me down and tells me that I was selected, and I was met with immediate mixed emotions that I am having a severely difficult time decoding. Anxiety levels skyrocketed, but I kept reminding myself ""great opportunity, good resume builder, juice is worth the squeeze, etc..."" My supervisor then informed me that this program is heavily looking for people who want permanent employment, and they are wondering if that is what I am seeking, the catch is; its on the other side of the country. It would mean I would have to sell my home, move my girlfriend (whom is on board with this) and dog to the other side of the country. 

Not only is it a gigantic hill to climb, but I find myself being afraid of leaving what I am already comfortable with, I have a home I like, I have cars I enjoy (and tinker with) and a style of life/finance that I know I can afford, plus all of my friendships and family members live relatively close by. 

So, the fear came back up, I loved the idea of it being a no commitment, half of a year opportunity to learn, and if I felt comfortable or happy with the job/living situation, I could make the decision, pursue a permanent position, and if they liked me, than it would simply happen.

Simply put; I make one argument for comfort, I know my job like the back of my hand, im good at it but im in a dead end position with no real opportunity for growth or movement where I currently live, and I know I am worth more than I currently make (not that I am struggling financially, I get by find and can afford *some* luxuries) 

On the other side of the fence; opportunity always is met with some kind of risk, and I can't ever gain anything without risking something. I struggle with the idea of living on my own for half of a year, away from loved ones and I am afraid that I simply wont be able to do the work that is expected of me once I start this internship. 

Am I thinking too far ahead? Should I not be worrying about what hasn't happened yet? Is it unreasonable for me to be thinking so far into the future when I haven't even started the job? Would it be bullish of me to start the internship knowing full well that I have no intention of taking permanent employment? (as it seems like there is some expectation of interest). To top it all off, I still have thanksgiving and Christmas to be worried about before any of this happens, so I am starting to feel very overwhelmed. Maybe being overwhelmed is simply clouding my best judgement and putting my mind into a survival mode? It seems like all of my other emotions are clouding something I should be excited about.

219,"So I am a 19-year-old Asian-American (ABC) male and I am currently a sophomore in college.
Before college, I was only focused on my career. I didn't really care about what girls think of me, I was focused on my goal of working in a ""cool"" field such as robotics, and was a hardcore Elon Musk fan. I had passions. I had a life.
Now that I am in university, all that has changed. What I am about to put next is cringy as fuck, so please don't judge too harshly.
Although I am doing pretty well in college (currently a 3.8 in Computer Engineering/CS Double), I found out that I lost all my passions to one stupid pursuit: getting a girlfriend/hooking up. I thought that since there are a lot more girls in college than in high school that it was easy to get a girlfriend in college. Right?
Wrong. In a search of desperation, besides my schoolwork, I started browsing depressing reddits such as r/ForeverAlone, r/amiugly, r/rateMe, r/seduction, r/AsianMasculinity, (I was pretty upset about how Asian american males are shunned in American colleges), you get the idea. And I started to get an idea that I may not be as great of a person that I may think. I was not an independent person in high school, so it started hurting me at university when I got a small part-time job and prioritized terribly. Plus, the subreddits that I was on were full of negativity, desperation, and complaining. I still have no idea where my rateMe score goes due to the fact that I received scores ranging from 3/10 to 8/10 (enough talking about that.) I thought I wasn't nearly as attractive enough to hook up with an attractive girlfriend, and although I got around ~50 matches on tinder for the 9 months I had been on there, I got depressed due to the fact that I swiped right on around ~10,000 girls (or 80-85%) and only around 0.5% considered me in my most attractive photos as remotely attractive. I started envying/disliking the really attractive guys in my school.
I started to constantly think about intimacy and even during the lectures I could not focus very well because I just have this topic in my mind and that I browse reddit and as a result brought me into a greater trial of self-hate and depression. I started to constantly take selfies on the camera to validate my insecurities and discovered my ever so deviated nose, and as a result my confidence pummeled even more. My asymmetrical eyes did not help any either. Women from Asia find me attractive, but I can't even imagine why.
I started to lift 5-6 times a week in vanity and started talking to girls (none of them acted playful, so that validated to me that none are interested) to gain a better body in pursuit of hooking up (I know, sounds stupid, right, coming from a typical skinny asian nerd with glasses). Started wasting more time on reddit and taking more time to eat around ~3500 calories a day, to no avail (my metabolism is as high as a furnace). This affected my school.
I started to lose any care for anything in the world besides getting a girlfriend, and spent hours at night browsing what women want and reading rejection stories on r/AskMen. Then, all of a sudden, I lost my hope for the future. The boyish charm that I had when I was younger. My desire to become the next Tesla, the DJ/producer, the inventor, the CS/Math/Physics genius that finds a revelation to a new field of science and technology, or maybe the next Elon Musk. I only ""took"" my class because I needed a job after college, not because I really loved Computer Engineering. My passion for solving math problems that was bred in high school was gone and utterly infested by my infatuation with girls and becoming more attractive and the feeling that I am missing out on everything else life has to take me. I used to want to do math problems but now my lazy ass browses on reddit because it's ""much easier than to actually do things"". My Asperger's didn't help either, I am very socially awkward and girls seem to ignore me or give me a death stare everywhere I go. I rarely ever see a girl smile at me because she was interested anymore.
I want my passions back. I want that desire to make things and solve problems back. I want my creative spark and enthusiasm for coming up with/executing new ideas back. But I don't know how to get them back after being negatively viewed upon.
Can someone give me some advice?
TLDR; Had passions beforehand, then got obsessed on girls and how to attract a girlfriend, failed, drowned into sadness by the internet, became bored with classes I would once find interesting, and obsessed over my physical appearance instead of pursuing a specific goal.

J moved on really well as he's the one who ended the relationship with M. M's whole summer is crying and breakdowns, and never once talks to J. Cut to a few weeks ago, M had a breakdown over the phone with me and told me she got pregnant from J, and got rid of the kid. She did it with some medicine she took for acne, basically caused a miscarriage on purpose. She did it months ago and was why she couldn't move on. Cut to yesterday, I told J on M's request, since he never knew. He said she was lying. He told another friend and M found out. So today I tried to talk to him again with her, but he left and after texted me saying to fuck off. Basically a big fight that I can't imagine would blow over any time soon. I'm confused and really unsure what to do because J is on my hockey team and sits next to me in class, as well M has helped me through a lot of bad things in my own life, it would be safe to say she's the reason I'm alive today. What do I do? She's mad and he's denying it. I don't know what to do

226,"6 weeks ago, I saw a listing on my country's version of craiglist advertising a spare room for rent in an apartment. Got in touch with the person, visited the place and talked to the lady. She had rented an apartment with two rooms and decided to rent out the much smaller room. She was asking for a relatively cheap price and said I wouldn't pay electricity, internet or any other bills except for my own food. I was living alone at the time, was looking to save money and it made sense because the room was very small so I moved in with her a few days later.

It's been 6 weeks and yesterday, she told me I would have to help pay electricity when the first bill arrives in a few weeks. I think wanting me to help pay the bill is fair, but that was not our original arrangement. If paying electricity was involved, it wouldn't have made financial sense to hire a moving van and spend the money I did to leave my other place. I only moved because the arrangement she offered reduced my expenses. With the electricity bill added, it might turn out to be the same amount I spent at my old place. I might (it's a medium if because I will have revamp my finances) be open to helping to pay the electricity bill but only to a certain amount. Especially as her room is 3x the size of mine but the rent (exclusing utilities)is split with me paying almost 43.7%.

There's mutual admiration there but she just is not intelligent at all.

It's a simple procedure, three cavities to have filled, but the dentist told me that since one is close to the root he is going to apply a local anesthetic. 


To most people, the cavities would be the big issue and the needle less so. Problem: I'm a grown ass man that gets squeamish at the sheer mention of needles and faints at the sight or feel of them. I feel nauseous just walking by a tattoo parlour with the open door and hearing the sound.

The last time I had cavities drilled, I was a little kid. I did it without getting the needle because it didn't bother me and the needle did. Given how close this one is to the nerve, my better judgement is impaired. I'm sitting here at work and it's ALL I can think of. I'm strangely not dreading it yet because I'm still rational but in that waiting room it will take every ounce of my strength to not pass out from the sheer anxiety; let alone the actual injection.

I took cutting my hair under strong consideration but all the information I found online indicates that the lab is supposed to cut the sample used to reflect 90 days of screening.

I got my results back as a positive for Marijuana and I had to call the lab to speak directly with the lab tech to confirm the results. I asked the lab tech who performed the test how far he ran the test for. He became pretty vague and I had to read between the lines when he answered that every half inch of hair represents a month of hair growth. Right, so I asked again how long of a sample was tested.

249,"tl;dr: Friend who can't take care of herself lives with me in my minimal apartment, I have no time for myself, I feel like shit, and I don't know if or how I can kick her out.

A few months back, my friend got dumped. She used to live with her boyfriend and was forced to move back to her parents.

Around the same time, I quit my job in order to do volunteering from home. It's my dream for a long time and I'd finally saved up enough money to be able to do it for a year or so.

Now, her parents are abusive. After the break-up, she started calling me every evening since she wanted somebody to talk to. I wanted to help, so we spoke. She usually talked non-stop for two hours as I spaced out and practically stopped listening, but it seems she didn't notice.

After about a month, having listened to her getting worse and worse for staying with her parents, she said she'd commit suicide if she couldn't get away. I tried getting her to talk to her closer friends if she could stay at their places for a while, but she said no to all my suggestions. I said she could sleep at my place for a night, and she was totally fine with that.

Of course, she didn't stay just one night. She's been living with me for one and a half month now. My apartment is really small. It's only one room, so we're never more than a few feet apart. I really want to help, but this is so exhausting. 

She studies at half speed, but I have to help her with all of her assignments. I'm quite good with what she's studying, and she knows this. She simply shuts down if I tell her to try herself first.

She needs emotional support all the time. I can't wear headphones, because she gets anxiety if I'm not available all the time. If I don't do what she wants, she usually gets mad and says she's useless, etc. When I try to be more assertive, then she says she'll commit suicide. I can't go anywhere alone, because of the anxiety thing. I was at a party a while back, and when I came home she had overdosed on her prescription meds.

As I'm writing this, she's watching TV. That's pretty much all she does. I try to focus on my things sometimes, but even when I get to wear my headphones for a while, she interrupts me all the time asking me to play video games with her, giving her a hug, getting her something to drink, etc. It never ends. At best, I get 10 minutes between interrupts.

I really want to help, but my patience is wearing thin. She can't help me paying rent since she has no money. She doesn't clean. She doesn't cook. I can't decide what I want to eat because she is picky. I can't do what I want because I get interrupted all the time.

I'm all out of energy from not getting any time for myself. I usually need a few days to recharge after having hung out with someone. It's been way over a month and I haven't had more than a couple of hours for myself since she came over.

I'm helping her getting her own apartment through social services. She qualifies as she has social anxiety and a lot of mental issues. It's just, I don't know how long it will take until she can move out. Maybe a few weeks, maybe a few months... No idea.

What do I do? Am I unsupportive if I kick her out? I mean, she's having a really tough time. I want to get rid of her now, but I'm afraid she won't try to find anywhere else to crash, and she might even take her life...

251,"I am 36 years old, male, Canadian-American living in the American Midwest.

For many years I have wanted to serve in the military, but I am not eligible due to my health history (asthma). This is the case with both the Canadian Armed Forces and the U.S. Military.

I am interested in getting involved in:

- Something that can impart the discipline, masculinity, meaningful service, and danger that seem to be associated with military service
- Something that is legitimately valuable to other people, something to get inspired and excited about
- Something that will earn me respect from my neighbors

I have an immense amount of pscyhological and physical energy, and I tend to get quite down-in-the-dumps, and have been for years, without something to channel my energy into.

Volunteering at the homeless shelter, for instance, is great (at least, to the extent that it legitimately helps people...), but it lacks the physical and psychological intensity that I seem to crave. Perhaps I should continue to volunteer at institutions like homeless shelters or soup kitchens, but ultimately I don't expect to find this type of volunteer service sufficient to scratch the nagging itch in my mind.

While I have historically tried my hand at various sports (backccountry camping, martial arts, swimming) in order to channel my energy into something structured, I can't help but feel that participation in sports is nothing more than a very intense form of amusement. At this stage in my life, I am interested in something that has that level of intensity, but which involves 'giving back' to other people. Nobody other than me really benefits from my involvement in whatever sport or hobby. Is there anything useful I can do, while also burning off some of my steam??

Some obvious paths would be doing volunteer or part-time work in the rescue professions (EMT, firefighter), however, from what I've researched and heard so far, the demand for these types of volunteers is very low relative to the large number of people who would like to volunteer. I hear stories about aspiring volunteer EMTs who wait years before they can find work, and that the waitlist for volunteer firefighters is often impossibly long. So those may not be the most realistic options. 

Are there any potential options, institutions, or services that I may be overlooking? I do work a full-time job, so I am particularly interested in part-time and volunteer stuff. If anyone can share some ideas, I would really appreciate it. Thank you and be well!

Almost seven years ago I started to study mathematics, but soon enough I drop and changed to humanities.

Yet, I think next year I will go back, for what it seems no reason at all. Considering how bad my grades will be, if I ever finish the degree will mean nothing at all.

Should I skip my tests? Should I go?

I live with 3 other people. 2 of them are a couple and a single dude. We live in a 3 bedroom house. Right now, our rent is $800 a month. As for our other bills, I don't know them because someone else handles them. I'm just told to pay $300 a month. Well, now they want an extra $100 a month for an increase in bills. I'm smelling bullshit so I ask to see the bills so I can do the math myself. Make sure I'm not lining their pockets.

Well, now I'm getting a bunch of flak about how I can either pay or get out. Which is a bluff because there's no way that they can afford to lose 400 a month if they just asked for more money.

It's also come out that the reason rent is going up is because no one cleans. And one of my roommates is losing out on overtime so they can clean.

I stay in my room and don't use dishes. Anything I use, I clean immediately. Any mess is wiped up immediately. But because I don't pick up after 2 slobs, they feel I'm not doing my part. Not to mention that this house doesn't even route heat to my room. No vents at all. So I have to use a heater. And when I see the bills, I'm going to refuse to pay for gas.

In highschool the only times I made it to first period were when I pulled an all nighter.  I ended up quitting the first time I got into uni because we were expected to be in studio class at 9 or 8:30. The second time around in uni i got a little better but I was still consistently late to everything. (I graduated fine, thank God).

Every random job I've had I made sure it was not a morning focused job. I've tried all sorts of crap, but it doesn't matter how much sleep I get, if you wake me up any time before 9, I will feel miserable and sick. I tried to resort to taking melatonin for sleeping but it gave me horrible migraines for a week straight so I'm not touching that shit again. 

I might be getting into a job where I have to be there and cheery at 8AM or even a bit earlier. That means I have to wake up at 6 to not have to rush and account for slow traffic.

I’m moving into a new apartment next month and meeting the current tenant later today to buy some furniture from him. 

He seems polite but I’m worried that if I pay for the furniture before I move in, he might take it with him or cheat and sell it to someone else. 

From his point of view, I can see that he wouldn’t want to move out without the money, because then he wouldn’t know if he was ever going to get paid for it. 

I have a few hours left before the meeting so I need to decide: what’s the best course of action to take?",21Nov2017,1
258,"Hey Reddit, 
I have been living with my roommate for a year. We are both college seniors and we are both very busy. I am very clean. If it were only my kitchen and common space, it would be near spotless all the time. My roommate is not this person. She cooks all the time and doesn't clean afterwards. Several times this semester she has used dishes and not cleaned them for so long that we didn't have any dishes left. All of the dishes except for a few of them are mine, and I cook a lot too. I value having a clean kitchen and being able to cook for myself, and her and I have had a lot of conversations about this. It hasn't gotten much better, and last night after suggesting that she rinse out a pan with globs of cheese sauce in it while the cheese was still wet, rather than waiting for it to dry, she blew up on me. She said that she felt like she couldn't get anything right, and like I was expecting perfection from her and she couldn't get it right. She said that I was going to have to get over it, and that she doesn't have the time to do her dishes. All I have been asking is that she rinse her dishes when she is finished with them, and try to keep them on the right side of the sink because earlier this semester, she got a shot glass stuck in the garbage disposal. She said that me reminding her to do her dishes was stressful for her and she didn't want me to remind her, and that she would get it done on her own time. I don't know how to handle this situation, because if I don't remind her, they don't get done, and if they don't get done, I can't function in the kitchen. What can I do to make us both comfortable and keep my house clean?",21Nov2017,1
262,"I'm looking to move in with my girlfriend and her family. She is 18, and I am 20. I am moving due to recently landing a job there. Where I'll be getting anything from $300-350 starting pay for the first month. My girlfriend has two sisters, one 15 one 21. The 21 YO is in a similar situation, where she lives in a room with her bf (21 yo). Although their room is probably 4 or 5 times larger than the one I'd be moving in to. Her sisters bf currently pays around $80 a week. He makes anything from $400-500ish.
The rent includes most food, toiletries, washing etc. As well as rent they do light chores around the house too.

My girlfriend, who attends college isn't expected to pay rent. I would have no problem at all paying rent, I offered before they asked. But they are asking for $80 as rent also. Now, due to the room size (only a single bed is able to fit inside, with a small closet and desk. That's  all. 

Where as the sister and bf's room has a double bed, and a few exotic animals that they keep as pets (24/7 lights and electricity needed) as well as ample room for anything else. As I said 4 or 5 times bigger than ours.

I don't feel as though it justifies the same rental fee, I'd help around the house as much, if not more (only today i jet washed all their patio, and the neighbours as a good will gesture) seeing that the sister + bf use more electric, eat a hell of a lot more and have a larger salary and room size. 
Should I speak to them about this? Or at least my gf. She isn't very happy about it either
Need some advice
Thanks in advance

Tl;dr : moving in to gfs parents. They want me to pay the same amount as my gf's sister and her bf although we are living in a room 5 times smaller, using less everything and on a lower wage. My girlfriend isn't happy. Should i speak to them about it? Thanks ",21Nov2017,1

I hear her clearing her throat almost all day everyday.  This isn't an exaggeration.  Most of the time it starts after lunch.  Sometimes it starts from the minute I get here.  I get so incredibly angry when I hear it. I feel like she's right across the wall of my cube.  I'm going crazy.  My other co-workers notice it, but they're able to block it out or forget about it.  I, on the other hand, am incredibly distracted when I hear it.  It completely throws me off.  I'd like to listen to music and block it out, but I get anxious listening to music loud enough - I'm constantly checking the phone to see if it's ringing and looking over my shoulder to see if anyone's at my desk.

265,"I [M/23] was the overachieving little shit in grade school who got to college and was overwhelmed and lost all motivation. My grades plummeted, I found it hard to make new friends or build relationships with professors, and my mental health suffered. I ended up changing the major that was my passion throughout life because it kicked my ass and then weaseled my way out of hard classes just to get by to graduation. Even then I struggled and my work ethic and self esteem completely deteriorated and I lost interest in my future.

Through this time I always found it hard to ask for help for fear of revealing my failures. So among a successful friend group and doting parents/family I did everything I could to make it seem like I was successful. I sent fake grade reports to my mother and always made it seem like I was doing better than I was. I am always very eager to find some superficial way to show my ""success"". 

This fake exterior helped me land some great internships before graduation (they never asked for grades). And thanks to this internship, I was able finesse my way into a really prestigious job in a high intensity field. But my fraudulence has caught up with me. I learned shortly after taking the job that I was not ready for the challenge. I've been struggling to keep up with the pace, the demand, and the content of this job and it's been difficult for me and my coworkers. I've developed poor relationships with people in the office and the stress has even taken a physical toll on me and my mental health making it even harder to get on track.  
 
I know I must stay at least a year for this to look decent on my resume, (if I don't get fired first). But it's been 5 months so far but I don't think I can last much longer. Everyone had high hopes for me and it has been so embarrassing to actually be such a let down. I haven't told my family about my struggles because they are so proud of my success and I'm afraid to let them down. My friends are all excelling in their post college paths and I don't want to be the one falling behind. I don't even know what would come next as I have no idea what else I'm interested in and my performance at work and school could certainly hinder me from opportunities in higher education and other work opportunities.  I feel so stuck.. Any advice?

I (male) made the mistake? of dating my best friend (female) shortly before and after graduation. We ended up separating mostly because of me I think. I really enjoyed spending time with her, I just didn't enjoy as much of it? Like I was busy trying to start my career and naturally disenclined to prolonged social events. I dont know.

I didn't think it was a terrible separation but I must have been wrong. It's been close to a year since we last met and I've been trying to catch up, but she was making excuses (I've just realized). This isn't stalker level pestering, this is like 3 emails over the course of a year asking if she'd like lunch. Anyway she suddenly told me she didn't think we should be talking anymore.

He is not close to his brothers and sisters, so in a sense I guess they would have to talk to catch up, but I swear in the end of the conversation he was telling her in a sexual manner she looked nice and made flirty whistling sounds more than once.

274,"Hi all. So I'm introverted. Even typing this story is hard but I need some advice. 

I recently got the courage up to go talk to a chiropractor regarding my long term pain issues in my neck and back. I have insurance and so when I called the office I gave them all my insurance info and made an appointment for a week and a half later. They didn't say anything about my insurance being a problem. I filled out all their forms to have ready on the day of.

I went into the office and asked to receptionist how much my co-pay would be. She said she'd have to look it up. The doctor came out. We went to another room and had our consult.

It was an hour and he made me feel very comfortable. I felt like I would be ok with this person touching me. 

We go out front, say our goodbyes and I turn to the receptionist. She then informs me that she had called my insurance while I was in the consult and that their office was NOT in network. I'm now on the hook for $100 when I thought I'd be paying my co-pay of $25.

I didn't say anything. But in fact I was very angry and could feel my face turning red. I handed over my card but I didn't want to cause a scene because now I'm about to angry cry yell. 

I really feel like this was a bait and switch type of situation. I've emailed the doctor but I'm afraid this receptionist might screen his emails. 

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. I need to form a plan and have the right keywords to say when I confront them.

276," had a serious realization today after receiving a text from a girl that is interested in me.

 

This girl and I work together, and from the moment I saw her, I wanted her. Unfortunately, she had a guy already, but we continued to stare, talk and joke from time to time both at work and over Snapchat. Now, because I know this girl is in a relationship, I sometimes filter how I act around her, because I don't want cross any lines, and I think my crush on her also leaves me nervous to say and joke about certain things with her that I'd do easily with other girls at work. Well, the other day, she came over to me at my station and told me that I'm dry and awkward to talk to.. Ouch.

 

After receiving this criticism, I reached out to the women of my life for advice on what this meant. She said I'm boring, but she still ALWAYS came over to me during work to joke and talk. They all confirmed what I already knew, she liked me, but this confession may have been the end of that interest. I wasn't paying attention to that part though, because fuck it, my crush likes me back! So I saw a post on her social media today and poked fun at it in the form of a question, I get a response an hour later,

 

""idk"".

 

I immediately, felt..hurt? I thought to myself, shit, she's trying to be bland and dry in an effort to kill her interest in me. Which logically, makes perfect sense. If you like someone and they don't return those feelings, which I wasn't, because I wouldn't be as open and talkative towards her as other people, you move on. My issue is, that at that moment, I realized that I've ALWAYS had this issue with women. Any time a women shows me interest, even if I don't have any intention of pursing her, I love the fact that she's into me. It could be as small as constantly making eye contact, or as deep as always chatting with one another. But the moment I see that they are losing interest and moving on, it feels like a break up, which is ridiculous, especially for the ones I don't want to pursue.

 

Now I've realized that her response could mean a million things, but the fact of it all is that it made me realize I have a serious problem with attention and validation from women in my life. Why is it that I feel I need to so much? Why does it hit me and affect me so much whenever I see a girl I know likes me, move on? Why can't I just be a man and understand the simple fact that if someone doesn't like you anymore, they move on, and accept it as that? What are these feelings, and how do I work on removing them?

 

Anyone that has suffered from this and somehow broke out of it, what is your story? How did you learn to stop depending on other's attention and value your own? ",21Nov2017,4
277,"I've been working there for a few months and this one visitor has been getting more and more aggressive towards me each time he comes in. If I don't have the door unlocked the second he shows up then he gets really angry. I've had one time where I was in the middle of pushing the button and he started banging on the door. Last Saturday, I was looking down, writing some things since it was only about 8:15 am. Suddenly, I hear someone smashing their fist against the door as loudly as they can, sure enough, it was the visitor. I had been startled and immediately hit the button to let him in and he yelled at me because ""you hear the buzzer go off!"". Now I've told him several times that it buzzes the nurse's station and not me but he's ignored me every time. He went to the nurse's station and began screaming about how I'm rude and purposely make him wait outside. Luckily,the nursing supervisor wanted my side of the story as well. I constantly apologize to people if they've been waiting at the door and always greet people with a smile. This guy doesn't seem to care and thinks I'm purposely making him wait, sometimes even just for a second or not at all.

281,"Important background info: My family (narcissistic mom, my uncle, and my grandma) occupy separate floors of our triple decker building. My mom and I used to live on the third floor when I was a child, but we moved down to the first floor nearly a decade ago. My mom ended up leaving a good portion of our stuff upstairs, and she filled the downstairs apartment with new things instead of emptying out the third floor. Nearly all seven rooms of the third floor became filled with piles and piles of her junk (clothes she hasn't worn or fit in since the 80s, boxes and boxes of giftware and craft materials from her failed Italian giftware business, ect). The apartment essentially became an empty storage space that was filled to the brim with useless objects that my mom hasn't used in years. It's been uninhabited for nearly a decade and one winter, became overrun with mice. It went from cluttered to absolutely filthy and infested after this. There were mice droppings blackening the floor; urine on windowsills and curtains; boxes and clothes chewed through; dead mice scattered throughout the house. It was basically a real-life episode of ""Hoarders.""

My boyfriend and I recently graduated from college and are trying to get on our feet. We're not financially stable, so my family suggested that we clear out the third floor and live upstairs. It was an entirely unappealing offer, but my boyfriend lives an hour away and we knew that it was the best we could get right now.

Over the summer, my boyfriend and I spent countless hours clearing my mom's junk out of the kitchen, bathroom, and 2 bedrooms. We had to scrub the absolute hell out of everything, dispose of mice shit and bodies, scrape gunk off the floor, ect. The apartment was unlivable and would have been condemned by the city if we actually had a legal lease.

My boyfriend and I started our temporary jobs a few weeks later, so the clearing out and cleaning spree was put on hold. We both work full time. My boyfriend is filling a low-paying long term substitute teacher position and takes his work home with him (unpaid additional hours). The back room, front room, dining room, and living room are still filled to the brim with my mom's junk, along with who knows how many germs and diseases from the mice that had infested the apartment. It would take several people several weeks to make this apartment shine, but we just don't have the time or energy to finish clearing out my mom's mess.

In the meantime, we're paying rent--$250 each, which isn't bad, comparatively. But my boyfriend and I are living in a storage locker. We can't use the oven because mice had filled it with shit. There wasn't a working fridge, so my boyfriend had to haul one over from his dad's house. We don't have a washing machine. My boyfriend and I are literally living out of one room in an apartment that would be deemed uninhabitable by inspectional services, but my family thinks that my boyfriend and I are overreacting when we get frustrated at the situation.

Living in these conditions has been abhorrable, but my family dismisses my frustrations and still acts like they're doing us a huge favor. They keep claiming that they can get $2-3 thousand in rent per month if they had tenants upstairs, but they allowed the third floor to become a storage unit for TEN years. They insist that they could have hired someone to clear it out, but never made the effort to do so. And where would my mom put all of her junk anyway? Now, suddenly, they need rent for upstairs even though my boyfriend and I are paying our own utilities. We're paying for a storage unit that we are stuck clearing out even though it isn't OUR junk. The two most debt-trodden people in the entire house are the ones living in literal shit and paying for it, while my mom's asshole of a boyfriend moved in downstairs rent-free even though he's paying for a condo in New Hampshire and goes on several international vacations a year.

Beyond all this, the close proximity with my family is destroying my mental health along with my boyfriend's. My family is domineering beyond anything. My mother has literally told my boyfriend that she is ""above"" him because she is the elder, and my entire family has this warped mentality that we need to bow down to them and ""respect"" them (respect = authoritative, to them) no matter what. My mom has also told me that she ""doesn't have to respect [me]"" because she's my superior. I'm 23 years old, having my own identity dismissed and shut down. She treats me like a subordinate, barely even like I'm my own person. I'm basically just an extension of her who she tries to warp to her own liking.

My mom is disabled and helps out my grandmother, but she's also incredibly selfish regarding her free time, which is far more substantial than anyone else's. She and her boyfriend are always disappearing on weekend vacations and forcing me to watch my grandmother and the dogs. They're both disabled and can easily do this during the week, when I'm home at night to watch the dogs and my grandmother. I work full-time, and the weekends are the only opportunity that I have to run errands and very rarely go out. 

We butt heads nearly every day over this bullshit. My mom is the classic definition of a narcissist. She constantly invades in my business, tries to tell me and my boyfriend how to look, what to believe, and how to feel. She dismisses my feelings and calls me crazy, stating that I need mental help. She lets her shitty boyfriend of barely a year get involved in our private family affairs and say crude, sometimes sexual, things to me and my boyfriend. She constantly judges, nitpicks, and bases all of her opinions on superficial factors. 

I have never felt so suffocated and trapped in my life, and I find myself breaking down and crying nearly every day. Coming ""home"" is the most daunting task, and living under my family's domain is even causing a rift between me and my boyfriend. He hates my family, and my mom blames him for all of our troubles. Every time I fight back against her narcissistic and domineering bullshit, she claims that I've ""become different since [I] started dating [boyfriend]."" Which is absolutely false. I started arguing with her once I went away to college and realized how good freedom actually felt; how refreshing it was to not have someone breathing down my neck and trying to control every tiny aspect of my life. I've even told her that she makes me want to kill myself because she is such a toxic and stifling force in my life, but she always dismisses my feelings and blames me for everything.

I really don't know what to do. My boyfriend and I are only working temporary jobs that will be ending soon, and we're scrambling to find something else. He's getting increasingly sick of our living situation, and it's causing us to fight quite a bit. We can't afford anything else right now, maybe not even for a while, and even if we could, my boyfriend refuses to live anywhere near the city... but I won't be able to afford a car anytime soon. He's threatening to move back home (an hour away) and we'll barely be able to see each other. I'm scared of being left alone with my family. I'm scared of losing my boyfriend to this bullshit. I have no idea how I can afford to leave, and my boyfriend is being incredibly difficult to work with regarding location.

Can somebody give me advice? Words of comfort? Anything? I honestly don't know what to do and I keep finding myself becoming more and more depressed and suicidal. I feel so incredibly trapped and suffocated right now without a way out.",21Nov2017,2

284,"Hello, Recently I've been going through some troubles with my boyfriend, him and I haven't been in a relationship for too long, maybe around 4/5 months.. but, him and I are really quite serious about the relationship, we have known each other for 3 years beforehand and liked one another, very much for those 3 years, only now we had decided to do something about it, but I may have ruined it, if I do not fix this and figure something out then I will lose him forever, and i cannot deal with that. 

Okay so, to keep it short,  I lied to him multiple times about things that are, to be honest, very silly to be lied about, it was really just to ""save my own ass"" because I was afraid because i felt shame about these things.. , if i told him the truth to begin with he'd be like ""oh cool""   
Every time he would ask me a question about it, i got anxious and made up something just to cover it up,, I didn't do it with bad intentions, But the point is that, i was lying to him even after He begged me not to, even after I said to him ""Oh no im not lying to you""  and he would go and dig and find something to prove that i was lying and it would break his trust more and more.. it has gotten to the point now where he does not trust me at all.. 

I don't want to be a liar, but i am so stuck in this web of lies, now its hard to get out, now he has shaken me and told me to get my head out of my ass,  I don't know how to fix this, I have taken his heart and ripped it into shreds just because I wanted to save myself for stupid egotistical reasons and i don't even know.. just because im ashamed of my past.. just because i didn't want him to know, i am making him feel AWFUL.

285,My professor told me that my generation lacks the ability to forgive others and show mercy. He states that we are always quick to belittle someone. I just wanted to know what others think about this statement and if you guys think this is true or not. Let me know! ,21Nov2017,1
286,"So I haven't worked for a long time. Maybe a year or so. It was one of the reasons my relationship fell apart, I was always depressed about having no money. Anyway, I always attributed it to not wanting to do unskilled labor in which one is too expensive and everyone is miserable so I spent most of my time studying to get a nice job.

Now, my friend calls me up and offers me a job with good pay and a positive atmosphere. Problem is, I don't know anything about this field and it has nothing to do with what I've been studying. I would love to take the job for the sake of having one but when I consider it, I start feeling sick to my stomach and panicked feeling. 

What are some things I can do to get over this and do what needs to be done? I don't want to justify my feelings in a world where people collect trash and wait tables while I have such opportunities handed to me on a silver platter.

287,"This probably isn't very serious compared to the other posts on here, a minor problem at best.

Okay, well, I've got this ""friend"" of mine, and like the title said, we had a bit of a fight. We've had lots of fights before (which have been patched up primarily by me, meaning I take the blame, even though he mainly started it), and to be honest, I've kind of wanted to distance myself from him, but I've never known how to do it in the best way possible.

However, I feel like this is my chance to do it. This fight was kind of major, (He called me a dick/faggot/introvert like 10 times, and I kinda just stood there calmly. There were so many times I could've owned his ass verbally, but I was just so tired of it by that point) about how I don't really want to socialize with him, but I'm not sure if I should patch it up like I've done so many times before, or just let this finally slide out my hands.

He *is* a good guy at times, (I stress the ""at times"" very harshly) but most of the times I feel like the input isn't worth the outcome.

Thanks for your advice.",21Nov2017,1

289,"I live in a shared house with a garage that I keep my car in.  I've been finding evidence that one of my roommates smokes there, while my car sits.

I'm passionate about my car and try my best to keep it clean (hence why I found a garage for it, to keep it clean) but with her smoking the garage up, it upsets me because (1) I don't want the smoke and tar to settle on my car and (2) it makes the hallway smell like ciggs sometimes. 

My roommate is cool and understanding, but I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable about it.  But I want her to know that it upsets me when she lights up in there.  

What can I say to her to possibly get her to stop (or limit) smoking in the garage?

What really hit me is when a girl was complimenting my friend and then she looked at me and said and I quote “and you, you’re just ugly”.
After that I just wanted to run to the bathroom and cry but I didn’t, it just felt like a whole bullet hit my chest but somehow I just pretended like I didn’t hear it. Eight grade was bad to people would just call me ugly in someway at least once a week. I forgot to mention I’m really quiet and shy i was just raised that way. Now I’m in my freshmen year and I still have acne all my doctors medicine haven’t fully taken it away so I still have a lot cause their is no cure for acne. People call me ugly as a joke or something everyday like it’s getting annoying and I always cry when I think about it.

Haven't spoken since a lot. No particular reason. Our class spend a lot of time together, but she is doesn't talk with the rest of the group unless spoken to. She seems to keep to herself and a couple other people who are very quiet (but less so).

300,"Over the summer my best friend (f/15) has become extremely classist based on wealth despite being middle class. She says these things like a joke, but today I don’t think these are jokes to her anymore and that she’s actually believing in what she says. 

Today we were at Starbucks and she messages me to look at the watch of the person next to me cause she thinks it might be fancy and expensive. I look over and it’s a fossil watch that’s about 300$, and message her that. Outside of Starbucks she starts going on about “ONLY 300$ GEEZ, A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER CAN AFFORD THAT IN A WEEK.” In a mocking tone. Mind you, she is far from rich.

She says these things about cars. Every time an suv or something passes us she goes crazy and starts shouting “omg omg omg is it a good car.” But when it’s not anything better than a Mercedes she’ll go on about “oh, that’s a cheap one, and it’s old too. What a peasant ”

She’s the type of person that complains about things you give to them. Everyday she eats lunch at my house because i go home during lunch. She constantly complains about me not having a certain food e.g “how are you out of banana bread?? Go buy some more.” Like my house is a restaurant.

If she was rich,  she’s just an annoying an judgemental asshole like a lot of people are,, but she’s extremely cheap. She owed me money today, and said she’d buy me something of the same worth of 3$. I picked up something that was like 3.03$, and she went on about “no way I’m buying you that, that’s way too expensive including tax that’s over 3.30$ pick something that’s like 2$” when I did, the total was about 2.20, and she went on about “I’m not gonna give you the rest.” But she was complaining about someone else’s watch being “too cheap” 10 minutes ago.

304,"So my issue is kinda stupid but...I'm not poor. My parents will give me money if I need it BUT they have not done so in 2 years, since I started working &amp; driving. So every penny in my bank account is mine, I do have a trust fund which I've invested in the stock market &amp; I don't want to use it until the future. Please don't mistake me for spoiled, yes my parents paid when I needed a ton of new clothes &amp; for my college supplies &amp; helped w down payment on my car but for things like extra clothes, prom, homecoming, high heels &amp; cute sandals/shoes, food with friends, gas money and monthly car payments, that's all my money. And I joined a sorority &amp; I'm paying all of those dues with my money I saved.

I don't want to pretend I'm a broke college student because I'm not. Everything I've spent is mine, and if I run out of money, my parents got me, they won't let me starve or anything.

But okay my friend is not wealthy and she wants to borrow $100 for a sorority event. And she &amp; another friend owe me about $20 each, we each pitched in $20 for a sorority item that I ordered. And I feel like they think I'm cheap bc I keep asking if they can venmo it to me asap, my dad still checks my bank account &amp; I report to him my spending every month just so he can see that I'm responsible!

Yes I can theoretically give her $100 but I'm already paying $100 for my own costs for the sorority and I paid my $20.

Like I feel really bad she's on financial aid and money is tight in her family but at the same time I personally can't be giving money like that out, I just feel like it's not fair to me especially when there's no guarantee I'll be paid back.

312,"I've noticed.. or rather, people have made that clear.. that I have some kind of obsession with solving things immediately as they happen. Let me put this into several real life case studies. 

Firstly, I'm at work and I get a new assignment. I look over it and I realize I will not be able to perform it to its fullest. I get nervous. It overwhelms me, I can't concentrate on anything else but to make my superiors immediately known that there are limitations or whatnot. I want to solve this immediately, otherwise I know I'll think about this for at least two days. It's frustrating, it totally occupies my mind and I feel nervous, anxious, lost. If I don't resolve these issues as soon as possible, I have hard times falling asleep. I just can't. I try not to think about it, but my subconsciousness is working overtime, I can feel my heart beating, I'm sweating.. even though I'm not thinking about it.

Second case study, I have a falling out with a co-worker over a misunderstanding. Afterwards I feel like we should resolve this. And if it's Friday and the co-worker has gone home already, I think about it for at least 2 days and I'm going through what I'll say and what I should say and what I should have done. Again, it occupies me and I feel sooo angry at myself for allowing this. But I can't let go. First thing Monday I'm at their doors, trying to sort it out. When things get sorted out, I drop this immediately, completely forget it and move on. In a split second I go from ""damn, I must solve this!"" into ""so, what a beautiful day, isn't it"".

Third, my relationship... when I argue with my girlfriend, sometimes we just kind of sort it out and she wants to move forward. but I just keep digging and digging and she always says that it's frustrating that I should let it go. But I can't. I must know, I must resolve this. And I know I'm making things worse, but if I won't address it, it'll bug me for days.

So, I have no idea what kind of disorder this is, but I'm pretty sure this isn't normal. And it's affecting my relationship with my girlfriend, my work, my sleep... it's really frustrating but I don't even know what I'm dealing with.

322,"Needing a serious solution to this problem. I guess I'll go ahead and give some backstory to help. Last October (2016) I relocated to a different city and moved in with my cousin. We got a townhouse together and became roomates. She has lived in the city for about 10 years or so, so I thought living with her would probably be a good idea, and the times that we have hung out together, we got along pretty good. 
Fast forward a few months, things are 'OK' but she is a bit controlling and in my opinion, very anal about things that I don't necessarily find a problem. Also, she does not know how to effectively communicate, sometimes yelling, and leaving passive aggressive notes around the house. I've since tried to change the way I do things in the house in order to make her more comfortable. All the while I tend to walk on eggshells and pretty much hate everything about being here. 

More recently (within the past couple of months) things have gotten worse. The house stinks, she makes barely any effort to clean up. She works from home so she is here most of the day, yet when I come home from work or activities, I am usually the one emptying the trash, trying to wash dishes, etc. Also, at this point, I am learning that I generally dislike her as a person. Her personality is one that does not really make others feel comfortable or at ease around her. 

Here's where it gets tricky. I am needing advice on how to get out of here sooner than later. Our lease is not up until October of next year (2018). I don't think I can last that long. I am literally miserable here and being in this house makes me want to cry. The issue is that I have an eviction on my record so I would need to take care of that. More pressing of an issue is although I dislike my cousin and would be absolutely elated to leave here and be in my own place, I know that leaving in the middle of the lease would be very hard on her financially and I don't want to do her like that. I am wanting a solution, how can I leave here, before the lease ends, without putting a financial strain on her, or at least without her being too upset. I don't want any advice about talking things out or trying to make the best of the situation, i want out. I'm ready to go. I feel like my quality of life is suffering by continuing to live here. Sorry if it's long. I just wanted to get everything out before posting this.",21Nov2017,1
323,"I have since I was born been in the constant state of loneliness that simply won't heal. I have a family and friends yet I still feel very lonely, as if I need something more, perhaps a girlfriend. I don't think I need an actual girlfriend since I have had this feeling for the entirety of my life.

It's starting to negatively affect my academic grades. Every time I go to university I find myself constantly trying to get attention from girls, I don't know why. I don't have any good relations with my family, especially my mother since she used to abuse me.

All I think about are girls, as if that is the solution to my problems. I have tried to befriend some girls in my class but it never worked out since they simply lost interest for whatever reason, I would consider myself as being very ugly. Objectively ugly (thin hair, uneven hair loss) but still have a largely positive attitude towards others (helpful, selflessness).

I don't know what to do. I'm starting to enter a new phase of depression because of this, the fact that I feel lonely no matter what and I'm clueless as of what to do. Since whenever I feel lonely I think about girls, perhaps the solution is there. I don't know.

I don't want to drop out of university like last year because of the same problem. I will probably kill myself and some others for revenge if that happens. No exaggeration. I really want to live a stable, good live without meaningless pain.

328,"Hello Reddit.

A few weeks ago I posted a thread asking about fixing my marriage. I got some pretty helpful advice, but some things have changed since then.

The gist of the story is, my wife and I have been married almost 2 years. Everything went really well for a while, but sometimes her mental illnesses would hinder things (depression, PTSD, Bipolar II). That isn't to say I don't understand the illnesses or that I don't want to deal with them, it's just that sometimes they made her say or do things she just didn't mean. Well, around August/September she started to get really badly depressed. She felt suicidal one night, and turned to a friend because she genuinely felt she would harm herself. That night, he sexually assaulted her. This devastated her to say the very least. Ever since that event, it's been a roller coaster. One day she loves me to death, the next it's divorce. This continues all the way until yesterday. Yesterday, she revealed to me that as a teen, she idolized marriage because she saw it as a way out. She saw it as a way to end every problem with her abusive parents and other unfortunate thing that occurred with her. She told me she jumped from relationship to relationship until finally she met the perfect person (me).

Well, after learning this she told me she wants to be on her own. Wants to live, struggle, just do things for herself. So she is moving back in with her parents. Luckily they live real close by, but this is still going to be rough. How do I deal with This? She has assured me many times that this isn't about wanting to freely cheat or go out and party, etc. But about growing and getting to know who she is outside a relationship. She has said many times, and even her friend told me that all she ever says is that she can't ever see herself with anyone but me. And I feel exactly the same. I just couldn't be with anyone else, as my wife is my soul mate. How do I cope with her not being by my side in bed at night? What can I do to prevent our marriage from ending altogether? I don't really have friends or hobbies, but on occasion I like video games.

My wife has never lived on her own and I care for her in pretty much every way. She says even if it backfires on her she'll be happy. Even if it doesn't work out she'll be happy. The ultimate goal for us both is to pick up where we left off. We don't want fights or arguments every day. We want to be together and just live our lives in happiness. We don't expect it to be perfect, but we know it can be better.

330,"So I started a new job at a big retail store in my town. Everything was great with my first interview and then I had to come in and start training with a manager I'll call ""Tony"".

Tony had me watch some videos on a TV and then told me to find him in his office when I was done. When I finished watching all of the videos, he wasn't in his office, and I had to find a random employee to page him and he didn't show up for 15 minutes while I just sat in the back waiting. When I told him I watched all the videos, he seemed suspicious and mockingly asked, ""did you really?"" To which I was I just said ""yes..."", thinking he was joking, but he wasn't.

Now that I've been working there for a few months, I've gotten along with everyone BUT Tony. He goes over the headset (all employees can hear) sometimes and has made fun of customers a few times now. For instance, a 14 year old or so son and mother came into the store and the son asked if his mom could take a picture of him swinging a golf club. Tony, who was nearby, went over the headset and started to laugh and make fun of the kid calling him a ""loser"" for having his mom take the picture and to even be shopping with her in the first place.

He constantly comes up to me while I'm working and tells me that I'm doing my job wrong and/or will have me do tasks that are a lot for one person to do. For instance, I was the only person in apparel cleaning the store one closing night and was busting my butt to get everything clean. He came up to me and asked what I had done and I told him half the store (there's a lot of clothes and different sections). He basically freaked out and told me that I needed to work faster and harder, which I wasn't (according to him).

Yesterday I was given the task of printing and putting up ""on sale"" signs around the store which I never was trained to do. I was trying to figure it out when he came up to me and started asking what I was doing and why I didn't know what I was doing (when he talks to employees, he talks as if you're a baby who doesn't understand anything; like you're an idiot), to which I told him I wasn't trained on how to do it and he showed me how as if he was teaching a toddler.

Today I was told to come to the back office after my shift by another manager. I went to the back and she had me sit down and say that ""someone"" has been complaining that I'm not doing my job right and that I'm just slowing everyone else in my department down. I told her that I do everything at a great pace and that I work to the best of my ability. I treat customers with friendliness and respect, and have even broken records unloading trucks. I know it was Tony complaining to probably try and get me fired.

He's been there since the store opened so this guy acts very entitled even though he's not the GM. What should I do? He gets along with the other managers but even they say he can be a dick and some people have even quit because of him. ",21Nov2017,1
331,"First off I’m an extremely stupid 15 year old, I know.

In regards to my [last post...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7e66zn/can_i_be_pregnant/?st=JAA8OBSX&amp;sh=83cd515ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7e66zn/can_i_be_pregnant/?st=JAA8OBSX&amp;sh=83cd515a)

I talked to my boyfriend and he said that a tiny bit of ejaculate got on his skin fold between the index finger and thumb on his left hand and he wiped it off. He used his right hand to touch me but I’m still not 100% sure if I could be pregnant or not. I really regret doing what i did considering i am doing so well in school and i finally figured out what I want to do when I’m older. If I were pregnant I would have to commit suicide because I can’t go through that. No sexual intercourse happened. I’ve been researching if you can get pregnant from semen being on a finger and then inserted into the vagina but all I can find are people who literally had a LOT on their hand. I don’t think there was a lot, in fact I know it was only a tiny bit because he hadn’t fully climaxed yet. I am pretty sure i was and still am ovulating when this happened because it’s right in the middle of my period cycles. I’ve been asking advice from all my friends including “more experienced” people that are like a year or two older. They all say I’m not going to get pregnant or there is an extremely tiny chance. I’m so scared because if I am pregnant this is ultimately the last few months of my life. I can’t go to my parents about this. If I don’t kill myself, they will.

If anyone needs any further questions about what happened I’ll be happy to answer. Please help",21Nov2017,0
332,"Some background, my sister (lets call her Amy), is 40 years old has been a drug addict/drifter for the last 20+ years. All 3 of her children have been taken away and put in the foster system (later placed with Paternal relatives) and she is VERY unstable. She only comes around when she needs/wants something and then once she gets it is gone again. She currently lives off of disability in a very nice government subsidized housing division. 

My brothers John's situation is similar, mid 20's lots of drug abuse and he has at least 2 kids that he does not have custody of. Lives in a crawl space that someone is letting him use while he tries to get a job and get back on his feet.

A couple months ago my mother suddenly passed away. On the day of her death right after her body was removed from the apartment Amy was searching around her apartment for her car keys, phone, cash, prescriptions and jewelry. I was finally able to get her out of the apartment and lock it up but she and my moms sisters were adamant that I at least give her the car because she is in the process of trying to get one of her kids back and needs transportation to get back and forth to visits, etc.. They also said my Mom had put my sister on the title, which contradicted what she had told me. My aunts mean well but they always fall for the ""I'm doing better and trying to get my life together, I just need X"" sh-peel and they are convinced that she is practically recovered. I got angry and downright refused let anyone leave with anything until after the funeral was over and we could all think more clearly after having some time to grieve. 

After the funeral the dust had settled a bit and I sat down with everyone (2 aunts, grandma, Amy and John) to talk about the next step in the process. I promised that I would do everything in my power to make sure Amy got a car out of this but that it takes time to get death certificates, transfer property, pay debts, etc. While going through her documents I learned that my mother had left me as the sole beneficiary on everything she owned. She didn't have much but there is a car that is paid off and TOD'd to me and and IRA worth around 80k.

Due to the circumstances of her death the death certificate took around 2 months to get, and nothing could really be done until we received that document. In the mean time my grandmother decided that she was going to take the inheritance that she had set aside for my mother and divide it between John and Amy. So she bought them both cars (worth about 10k each) and gave them each some cash. Her stated intention was that this was somehow supposed to compel me to divide up my mothers assets evenly with my siblings. Meh.. whatever its her money she can do with it as she pleases...

My grandmother also sold off all her jewelry to help pay for a lawyer that would help Amy get one of her kids back. However it backfired horribly. Amy never showed up to sign papers for the lawyer who ended up dumping the case because of her flakiness, and the fact that her felon boyfriend is living with her. She then disappears and no could get a hold of her for several weeks.

John decided he wants to start Nursing school got a job at some kind of nursing home for behavioral patients. Apart from his severely rotted teeth and that ""done a lot of hard drugs"" vibe he looks good and I want to believe he is getting his live together.

Fast forward and it turns out as soon as Amy got the title she sold the car my grandmother gave her. Then claims she ""went undercover to find a lawyer that didn't care about her boyfriends criminal record"" but got robbed on her way to pay him so she is again out of money and has no car. *cough*bullshit*cough*(I assume it was sold for drug money). I finally got death certificates and transferred my moms car into my name and got new tags etc. so it could be legally driven. Amy apparently has been driving by my house to check up on it because while I was getting an inspection on the car she called and accused me of selling it, and that it was her car and I had no right etc.. etc... I let her know that I felt the situation had drastically changed and that I had not sold the car but that I was no longer planning on giving it to her since she was just given a car. She seemed surprised to learn that I knew about the car my grandmother gave her and claims that she sold it because I had already promised her a car and she didn't need 2 cars. She went on and on about how I had to give it to her because she was counting on it otherwise she would not have sold the other one, and she had recently been robbed blah blah blah. I finally just hung up and parked the car at a friends house because I didn't want her to trash it. Last time we got in a fight she has showed up to my house with a gun threatening me and my family. I called the police after she ended up pointing the gun at her head and pulled the trigger, luckily it wasn't loaded because her 9 year old daughter was standing less than 10 feet from her. Anyway, later that same night ""someone"" busted the windshield out of our minivan and spray painted our house, so I didn't want to take any chances.

The next day I got a call informing me that John has a warrant out for his arrest for unpaid child support. I called him and he was so high/drunk that he couldn't speak anything other than unrecognizable slurs. 

My mother and I were close and she was diligent about making sure my name was on everything she had. Towards the end she regularly brought up how Amy and John were not to get anything she had. Her reasoning was that she had worked hard for what she had and she didn't want her money wasted on drugs and booze. And that by way of stealing from her had already gotten more than their fair share. 

I also gave them ALL of her personal belongings and I rented a truck and moving crew out of my own pocket to have it moved to thier homes/storage locations. The only thing I kept was her Wedding ring a blender and her personal documents, birth certificates etc. 

So here is where I am struggling, She worked for 40+ years doing data entry despite her disabilities and managed to save enough for a very humble retirement the last few years of her life. She went through the process of making sure my name was on everything she had so it would not be squandered. So legally I don't have to give anyone anything, however despite her wishes the thought of keeping it all seems selfish. I have had some ideas but I am looking for some input from you good people. 

My thoughts so far:

Have them take a drug test, if they pass they get the money immediately, if not put in in a trust fund or roth IRA for their kids. Possibly pay off back due child support for my brother? I'm not sure if that is even possible?

Split it evenly and just let them make their own choices despite my mothers wishes. 

Give them a small amount, maybe a few thousand no strings attached. 

Just keep it, after all thats what My mother wanted and enacted. 

Put it in an joint account for them and require them to provide documented proof of what it will be going toward, car insurance, taxes, etc. (this sounds like more work than I really want to tackle)

Change my number, move and never speak to any of these lunatics again. The down side is that most of my extended family is pretty cool, and worth staying in touch with.

Honestly no matter what I do I feel like im going to be made out to be the bad guy, they have already accused me of hiding other funds that they are sure she must've had. 

TL;DR Mother left me everything when she died so it wouldn't be wasted, should I split it with my drug addict siblings anyway.

333,"Ultra stubborn and brain dead are a horrible horrible vile combination. Our mom has it.

In this family there are 3 brothers. Me, aiden, and ashton,

My brother aiden(7) likes to play minecraft and the little brother steps in but hes such a bully to him and if Aiden tries to defend himself, he gets hit on the head with the controller or scratched(his nails are sharp af).

Ashton, (4) the brother who does this to him is incredibly spoiled. He is rotten to the core and is a bully.  He always treats him horribly and laughs because he is spoiled. 

One day Aiden got fed up and tried to play with me after Ashton repeatedly keeps killing him. Aiden wanted to play with me, so I accepted. Me and my brother love playing together on Minecraft.(ps4 btw). Ashton gave it to him, but then whispered “aiden go kill him”, but Aiden refused. He instantly demands the remote then 20 seconds later starts screaming and he scratches my brother on the eye, and he was crying badly. Ashton knows how to fake cries and started doing it. Aiden came up to my bed(bunk beds, im on top) and we were safe from that evil shit. Ashton went to my parents and said “he didn’t play minecraft at all”. My parents get pissed and say why we weren’t giving it to him. We explained what happened but brain-dead mom said we “have to work together” and be nice to him, and we need to “understand” him. Like what the fuck lady im starting to think women are stupid or something.  Ashton never gets spanked for it, and gets to play minecraft alone, Aiden is sent off to do something else and is grounded. Lady, HOW THE FUCK IS THE BABY GOING TO BE KIND WITHOUT DISCIPLINE . YOU GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE WANTS AND HES SO SPOILED HE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO SHARE OR BE KIND. &amp; I decide to write to you guys. sorry needed to vent more. This happens almost all the time I need to know what to do before I challenge my stubborn mom.

334,"Hello,

So I have been having this problem essentially all semester but it's getting worse as time goes on. I live in an apartment complex on the 2nd floor of a 3 story building, and someone has been leaving their trash bags at my front door. I assume this is because they are too lazy to take out the trash themselves so they just make someone else take care of it. I have a suspicion it's someone living on the 3rd floor due to my apartment being positioned closest to the stairs leading up, but I am not definitively sure. I only want to find out who is doing this so I can report them to my apartment complex.

Here's what I have tried:

Digging through their trash for receipts, mail, or anything to identify them. I have dug through about 4 trash bags worth of their trash and I've only been able to figure out a few things. They ALWAYS pay with cash making the receipts almost worthless. They drink alcohol, which helps a bit since I live in a college apartment complex and not many students are 21 yet. They buy fast food at 1 in the morning. Nothing else. These people are extremely careful when it comes to their trash, whether they mean to or not. There has been nothing identifying enough in their trash that has helped.

Filing a complaint with my apartment complex. So far, they have not been able to help at all. They've only offered to dig in the trash on our behalf to help find out who it is. Not super helpful.

And that's basically all I've tried so far. I've thought about installing a fake camera to deter whoever is doing this, but it has been happening (less often) to my neighbors on my floor; I feel as if it will just start happening to them if I do install a fake camera.

Any advice on this issue will help tremendously.",21Nov2017,1

336,"Two weeks ago my grade 11 physics class was assigned an independent research project concerning different types of energy. 
Each person was randomly assigned a type of energy and had to do research on either the environmental, economic or social impacts of that energy. 

So for every type of energy there are three different topics, and its supposed to be a really easy assignment. 

I was absent on the day the topics were assigned, so one was chosen for me. 

It's important that I mention that physics is my worst subject, but I'm really passionate about it and working really hard to succeed in the class. The day that I was absent from school my friend texted me my topic and I got to work. 

That was two weeks ago and I finished the project yesterday. 

But on Sunday I got a text from someone in the class, saying that they have the same topic as I do. I talked to my teacher and she said that it was because there are too many people and too little topics. Obviously, I wasn't in class on the day the topics were chosen so I didn't know this. 

This person, Michelle, decided to start the project on Sunday night when it's due tonight. 

It's not that I don't like Michelle, but now she just wants to leech off of my work and discredit a project that I've worked really hard on. 

The project is due tonight, but this is only the first part. The next part of the project is for everyone to present their findings in front of the class and answer everyone's questions.  Even if I don't let her copy my numbers, her numbers are going to be completely different and it's going to make me look like a fucking idiot and it will lower both of our grades. I know this because she's been texting me asking me to let her copy my work, and she's been telling me some of the number's she's found. They are all different than mine. 

I'm really upset about this because I'm working really hard to get my physics grade up and I don't know what to do. 

Please, I really need advice on how to proceed.

**TL;DR Classmate and I both have the same topic for a research project. I've been working really hard on it but she just started Sunday and wants to leech off of my work. Now whatever I do, I feel like my grade is going to go down because of it.**

344,"Throwaway account.

Backstory/context: several years back I was at an appointment with my mother and we heard some ladies talking about boyfriend problems in a nearby room. My mom started joking around and saying (to me) ""Leave him! Even if you've been married xx amount of years!"" 
She saw my face and asked what I was thinking, to which I asked how long she had been married, and she responded with the very same xx amount of years. Mind you, I was still in a public place and had about three hours before I went into work, and my mom just dropped that she wanted to leave my dad as carelessly as possible. When I confronted her about this later she apologized but then said ""I know you're sensitive; when would it have been a good time to say it?"" as though that justified it. :/

Days later I'm driving with my father and I make the mistake of asking him to try a little harder to get along with my mom. This ripped the ground as I knew it from underneath me. He starts crying and saying ""It's not all my fault."" I stay silent because I don't know what to say. 

That was the start of a very long downhill journey. I don't regret saying it because if my parents had marital problems long before my saying that (which they would have to have had, otherwise it would never have been brought up in the first place) then it was just a matter of time before it all cracked open anyway.

From then on my father would drive me to and from work as I couldn't drive at the time, and he would cry the entire time both ways about how my mother didn't love him anymore and how he couldn't change it even though he's never hurt her and he loves her so, so, so much. 

I dreaded getting into the car with him because it was always a ticking time bomb of when he would start sniffling and discussing his marriage problems that I, as his child, and as far as I am concerned, had no business knowing about as well as no way to really help him. One evening I gave him some basic advice and he, though tears, asked how I got to be so good at helping others and I joked that I only know about relationships through the Harvest Moon games and that I learned to give significant others eggs to raise their affection. He responded with ""Maybe I should give your mother an egg, so she will love me again,"" and starts sobbing all over.

This goes on for months. My siblings and I hate getting in the car alone with him because it never ceases, and there's nothing we can do. My mom is getting stressed out because she can't discuss this with my father or he does the same thing and then refuses to talk to her for days out of spite.

My birthday comes around the corner and he asks what I'd like as a gift. I know money is tight, and things I like tend to be expensive (consoles, high-end makeups, etc) so I say I don't really need anything, just dinner would be fine, and my father slams his hand on the steering wheel and exclaims he wants my birthday to be SPECIAL, and bursts into tears. I don't get anything for my birthday. 

A few days later I'm woken up by my father hysterically sobbing, knocking on my door and giving me a $100 bill as an early birthday present. My mother tells him to stop doing this, and it's all a blur until he's putting on his jacket and waving bye to me and my siblings, telling us to ""say nice things about him while he's away so she'll love me again,"" all the while still sobbing.

He is taken to a mental health clinic to be evaluated (I don't think he was suicidal but obviously having a kind of emotional breakdown) but was deemed fit enough to be sent back home that night. It was awful, and truly one of the worst days of my life.

For my actual birthday we all went out to dinner and pretended that the last week never happened. I decided from then on I didn't want to spend birthdays around my family anymore. 

When Thanksgiving comes around, he sends me a text, something unusual for him, saying he wants a cross for Christmas, which is extremely unusual because he would never flat-out tell me what he wants as a gift.

Months later, my mother discusses with him that he should move out for our (the kids') benefits. He immediately packs his bags right then and there and I spot him rolling his suitcases, in tears, to the door as I'm walking out and hugs me, telling me he loves me and that he always will. I leave in silence, my shoulders wet with tears and sweat.

My father has left the house. I no longer jump when I hear the door open. I can eat better without him at the table staring at me. I feel healthier. 
With my father out, we decide to move to a smaller place. We can't do it without the addition of my father's income so he has to live with us but separately from my mom. I am told I can have the grand bedroom, because they won't be sharing it. My mom decides to try to repair their relationship but she doesn't tell me. When seeing the house for the first time, I go into the master bedroom to say that it is mine and my dad thinks I'm kidding. He says he and my mother will be in it, of course. Everyone views me as spoiled for getting upset at not having the master bedroom.  I am silent for the ride back to our home, and sob until my head aches alone in my room.

We move into the new, smaller house. We live there for three years with varying degrees of success (my father doesn't wish my mother goodnight, he will still go for days without talking to her, still he cries to the kids) until my parents have a screaming fight and he has to leave. He blames his depression, and that we don't love him because of it. He tells us that he loves her but she doesn't so they are going to separate. He moves out, crying out the door the whole way.

Our house becomes more peaceful. We move out of the city into an apartment. My dad texts us, his kids, every day even when he or we have nothing to say. My siblings never answer his texts so when I do I get all the baggage--how he has no money, no car, no way to get around.

Today after half a year we are going to see him for the first time. I am terrified. After so many years of treating my mother like a caretaker more than a partner, and giving my siblings and I the involuntary roles of therapist, and making us choose sides between the two, I am sick of him. I remembered only recently how aggressive he was with my sibling when we were younger--I blocked out those memories apparently. 

He has never taught me anything. He loves us unconditionally but I feel that he sees us as extensions of himself rather than as our own people. Once he told me that I should become a xxx (career unimportant) as a career choice, and when I asked why he responded with ""Because I want to be a xxx."" Not that he thought that I would enjoy it, or be good at it, but just because he wanted to be one.

I don't think we benefit at all from him being in our lives. I know he was from a very awful family but that doesn't need to carry over into our own. My mother has done her best to shield us from these sides of him growing up. I suspect he has some sort of narcissistic personality disorder but I would never be able to bring this up with him directly. He is on medication and has therapists but in the end I know the only one who can help him, is himself.

Am I just resentful of him? Typing all this out makes me seem hateful towards him for expressing sadness, and like I should have done more to help him, but I also know logically that I can't be my parents' caretaker, especially when I was a minor when this all happened. I don't want him in my life. Am I a bad person?",21Nov2017,1

I’ve gone to counseling but unfortunately my insurance would only cover 2 sessions then the rest I had to pay nearly $200/session out of pocket. I have been diagnosed with depression and went on meds for a while and they didn’t have any affect on me. We tried different brands, dosages, etc for nearly a year and I just gave up because I didn’t want to keep having all these mood swings and bad side affects. 

I’m feeling like a let down because I can’t function like I “should”. I have no reason to be sad or be feeling this way because my life is good. I have a job, roof over my head, food on the table and a great support system yet I still feel so unhappy. 

I’ve been noticing too I’ve been having trouble focusing and being able to communicate. I feel like I’m in a fog sometimes and stumble across all of my sentences which is frustrating me even more. 

I feel like I’m fighting this invisible battle and it’s winning. ",21Nov2017,1
