2,"I hooked up with a guy (let's call him John) to get over my ex boyfriend and intended for it to be a one time thing. Fast forward 8 months later, we have become friends and see each other every week to hang out and hook up. There's some kind of connection there, though I don't think it's worth it to risk ruining our casual relationship and take things further or share my feelings with him. 

Last night, I think I may have upset him because his younger sister caught me sneaking out the backdoor. She isn't dumb and I'm sure she knew I was fooling around with him, though she was pretty nonchalant about it. I informed him about it and apologized.

The next morning, he texted me to have a good day. We originally planned for me to come over in the morning while his sister was out, but when I texted him back and asked if he still wanted me to come over, he told me it was ok and that he had stuff to do that morning and also mentioned that his friend (a girl who he had said he thought might like him) sleptover so it might be awkward. 

I personally didn't believe him because he isn't allowed to have girls over while his parents are on a trip/out of the house. For him to let his friend sleepover while his sister was there and also on the same night his sister caught me sneaking out the back door is kind of strange to me and leads me to believe he was just saying that to get me all worried and worked up out of spite. 

I tried to be casual and asked if he called her over to comfort him after what happened the night before and then I apologized again, but he hasn't responded. 

At this point, I was so riled up, I needed to go to the gym. I was here for about 2 hours and looked up to see two of his friends (haven't met them in person, but he'd frequently send me pics of them and himself hanging out with them). They looked at me and it seemed they may have recognized me as well (I'm assuming that he may have showed his friends pictures of me as well). 

Then I see John walk into the gym and he walks towards his friends. I keep my head down and luckily had a hat to cover the top half of my face and keep working out on the machine I'm using. I catch a glimpse of him approaching the area I'm in and then I see his feet stop and then he turned around and walked back towards his friends. (I think he may have recognized me despite covering my face.)

I don't think he knew I had seen him already and sort of just didn't look in his direction as I left the gym. 

I'm a little saddened by the way things went and am surprised that I happened to catch him at the gym the very next day (he told me he didn't have a gym membership, didn't want to go to the gym because it's always crowded and preferred working out with his friends at their job after hours.) 

It's basically rocky right now and I don't know if I should just end it right here or try to reconcile with him. I don't know whether to text him and ask if everything is ok or be casual and pretend like nothing happened or if I should just wait for him to text me. So far, he hasn't answered my last text. There may be a possibility of him hitting me up after a month or two but if he does I don't know if I should continue this fwb relationship. 

Tl:dr got caught sneaking out by my 8 month long fwb's younger sister which upset my fwb. Next morning, he told me not to come over like we originally planned because his friend (a girl) sleptover and it would be kind of awkward and that he had lots of stuff to do and was going to be busy, though I think he's lying just to get me mad. I went to the gym and ended up seeing him there 2 hours later. He most likely saw me and tried to avoid me seeing him. He still didn't text me back. What I do now? ",19Apr2017,1

9,"How can I find friends in a place where it seems there are none? sparks fly off of the title Alright, here's a bit of my story. I happen to go to an all-boys catholic school.

I realized I was a shithead and changed how I treated people) I am happy everyone seems to like me here, but that's because I don't say anything bad about... anyone really. Everyone here seems seriously offensive. Like actually racist and sexist and all of those adjectives people like to use. I have met 1 single soul that seems to share being polite to all people and overall having good manners. Everyone else seems to be going through that awful phase of ""this is gay, that's gay, I hate everything that is slightly trendy to seem like I am in some way superior!"" The people I consider as ""friends"" are seriously just assholes that are only good friends on some days, and cold and bitter on the others. I have female ex-friends, but considering they go to another school, it's difficult to keep in contact. So, how can I find people to talk to that I like?

Personal setback related to family health issues (thankfully now overcome) put the whole thing on ice and now trying to get back into it, without much success. I am feeling overwhelmed which leads to being easily distracted (especially after longer days at work).

I understand breaking down projects into small, more manageable tasks is key in such situations and has worked well for me in the past, but seems to be difficult for me in this case (possibly due to not being able to properly identify sub-tasks to be handled).

20,"I'm currently close friends with two girls. This isn't a group but they all know one another to some extent. The first girl is one I met over the summer and she goes to our sister high school, I don't interact with her on a daily basis like the other two but recently she asked me to post this picture of us a while ago when our friends made like a meme of us dating, since we were both the shortest people in our class.  The caption read ""they found love in a hopeless place"". So I posted it and the two comments I got were from her saying ""😻😻love"" and just 😻. I'm not sure if she actually likes me or liked me at one point, and I could be sounding like an absolute doofus quoting people who use emojis.

The problem is now people I know are taking that stuff seriously and I'm getting texts from my two other close female friends asking me. To simplify let's call her Jenny.

Jenny asked me if I was dating this girl and o obviously replied, no. Now Jenny is trying to talk to me and stuff all of the sudden and I feel like she's trying to impress me all the sudden by talking to me about computers to I guess relate to me. The thing is, we liked each other for a good chunk of the year, but we never went past that. I thought I was over and I knew she was over. But could this mean that she's still likes me?

I know I sound like an absolute dork going to the internet, Reddit of all places for love advice, but the two people I consult with on this are currently the issues.

To be specific, I have a Sony VGN-FW235J running Vista. I figure I can pirate Windows 10 and do a clean install. It has to be plugged in at all times or else the battery dies, so I know it needs a new battery. The cooling fan is so noisy it makes it sound like a spaceship; I could probably buy some thermal paste and follow a YouTube video to clean the fan myself. I've been thinking about getting a solid state drive. It probably needs a new screen, when I edit photos I have to compensate for the color inaccuracy. 

But that's about it? I'm imagining a few hundred or so for fixes, versus I don't know—a thousand plus for a new laptop? What do you think, is this the more cost effective route? Am I leaving anything out? Is there anything else I should consider?",19Apr2017,2
24,"I'll try to make this as short as possible and include all of the important facts. I'm 26, spent most of my time since 17 either homeless, in jail, or living the life of a drifter. Never worked a job for more than a couple months in a stretch and haven't had employment in 5+ years. I'm a felon (burglary III), and I have misdemeanor warrants in my home state I've decided it's better not to deal with so I can start moving on with my life and end the cycle of perpetual incarceration. I barely graduated high-school with a 1.3 gpa, though it is on my transcript that I was in the gifted program (can't you tell what a darling I was).

My question is, how do you start out from here? I'm interested in college or trade school but my attempts to apply for these things have ended in total frustration dealing with all of the paperwork. Is there a field I can get any kind of respectable employment in? Or any potential options to better my situation? I'm just putting it out there now that if your solution is, ""work at McDonalds until you become a master burger flipper"", it's pointless to even respond.

On the other hand i have a part time job that can very easily become full time and i enjoy a great deal more.

Might be an easy answer here however the work placement that has a job at the end of it has a much greater pay advantage over the job i enjoy and more career progression. (Thats not to say that my current part time job does not have career progression, it does just much smaller amount and the pay is easily survivable on).

I'll spare you guys the horrendous journey but I basically skipped Year One of math, and went straight to Year Two without either my counselors or I knowing.

42,"**I have no where else to turn to and this is my last straw. I really need some advice or I might just do something I will regret soon. Anyone who might respond could really help and any help would be much appriciated.** 

First, I want to start off with a little background and tell you the exact situation I am in before telling you what exactly is going on between me and the bully. I am 19 years old and I leave for Navy bootcamp May 17th. I completed high school in 2016 and during highschool I was homeless with my mom and sister. My uncle thought it would be a good idea to live with him until the time where I choose to either go to college or the Military. I choose to go to the military and I have been living at his house for almost a year. He has a wife and they have a son together in a 4 bedroom house where I have been staying in the guest room. I work nearby and pay for my own food and other things.

Now, we will give some background on my time here with this bully and who they are. This bully is the son of my uncle, we are the same age and birthdays about 2 weeks apart. (I will refer to this bully as ""John."") John has always been bullying me but I never have been around him for such a long period of time until now. He does everything and more like calling me names and making fun of me, to stealing my things. I have never been so depressed in my life and I am always thinking of things I can do to get back at him, but that would just solve nothing. 

John has called me all sorts of things to bring me down and I try not to let those things get to me so I ignore what he has to say. When I ignore him he takes it up a notch by just harassing me. He will come in my room (never ever knocking so I get no type of privacy) flickering the lights, playing loud music, unplugging my tv or xbox, yelling if I am on the phone to cause a ruckus, and more. Then whenever I go to work John would sneak into my room taking my things such as, clothes, shoes, body wash, games, food, and etc. I am a person who doesn't mind sharing or helping someone in need but he doesn't ask he just takes. I feel like he is not only harassing me but invading my privacy and personal space, and this has been happening for almost 75% of the time I have been staying here.

I have tried many tactics i've learned over the internet and school bullies but none have really worked. I have tried plain out just ignoring him and removing myself from any environment he is in. I have tried to reason with him by asking why he does these things but he says, *""I do these things because you are weird and I like to see how you react.""* The thing is, I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN BULLIED! Another thing I dont react to none of his shenanigans, I would rather he just disappeared from my damn life. 

I have had enough of this self centered bastard who has nothing going for himself. He is 19 without plans of going to college like his friends or family, or even a job. He is just here on this earth to bother me and it really pisses me off. I have tried talking to his parents but to be honest I dont want to look like a snitch. I dont know what to do, I might just have to beat his ass if it comes down to it. Please help before I do something I really regret.  

**TL;DR:** Basically I have a family member who wont stop harassing me and I have to live with this person for about a month longer. I dont know what to do and I have tried everything from ignoring, asking him why, and telling his parents. We are cousins that are 19 and I just dont know what to do.

I tried my best to explain the situation if anything needs to be cleared up anymore please let me know.",19Apr2017,1
44,"I'm 20 y/o and near the end of my second year studying Mechanical Engineering at an inexpensive Uni that has a 7.5/10 reputation with the engineering firms around town. Parents divorced year I was born.
 
Contestant 1 - Dad: 60 y/o, white, alcoholic, stoner, successful Cannabis farmer, Northern California. Life Goal: financially stabilize his 3 kids (diff mothers) &amp; have baddass weed farm.

Contestant 2 - Mom: 50 y/o, Mexican immigrant, successful  suburbanite, Southern California. Life Goal: Raise child and keep far away from Dad's lifestyle.


Because of my Dad's self-destructive nature, he's been told by a few medical professionals that he doesn't have much time left before something within, gives out.  He wants me to take over the farm when he goes. This would require me to drop my education and head north to start training asap. If I were to wait until after I graduated, then I'd have to put aside whatever work I'm holding onto (If I can even get a job with average gpa), and potentially lose professional trust and relationships.  His medium-sized farm has supposedly jumped in value up to $2,000,000 due to new federal legalization, acknowledging it as a farm and a business (don't think it had anything to do with Prop64), as well as being due to some major renovations he's being paying for.

Because of my Mother's tightly knit hispanic background, it'd be in her best interest if I stayed in SoCal and became an Engineer like her siblings.  She hates my Dad and everything he's associated with (inclusive of beer &amp; weed, exclusive of myself).  I love my mom and am afraid this would ruin my relationship with her.

46,"I grew up always kind of introverted. I was shy, I was bullied in school, even beat up by family (complicated and resolved situation). I liked to daydream and generally avoid people. I just act nice and avoid confrontation. 

So college I got a fresh slate. My friends were kind and wouldn't do anything without me there. I think they caught on to how shy I was and how bad my social skills were (I apologize way too much) and wanted to help. But despite them never saying anything mean to me ever, and constantly showing me affection and love, I always felt like I didn't deserve them. That lasted about two years, my self esteem improved and I realized I was just being pathetic and had to get over my anxiety. Like three of them dropped out the following year (nice people, shitty students) and part of me was glad I was free of them (Not that I'm happy they dropped out) I was okay with just letting those relationships finding their natural end. Even  I liked being by myself with the knowledge my social life overall was fine. 

 I'm twenty now I felt great about how things went. I focused on class and my job. I'm getting great grades (having a good social life didn't help the first two years) my job is going well. I felt like I was playing life on autopilot. I had everything planned out long in advance, from when I'd eat, when I'd work, and whatever free time I spent either watching movies, trolling on the internet, or day dreaming. It suddenly hit me a few days ago I hadn't had a real conversation in two weeks I felt lonely. And I hadn't been taking care of myself nor spoken to family. Ever since I got over my anxiety I've been in a state of constant neutral emotion, I've never been one to get super excited or super depressed. 

TLDR: I HATE talking to people. I don't even go to the same store more than twice a week to avoid cashiers noticing me. There are people who care about me and are worried I've shut myself off. I don't know if this is bad or just a phase. Does anyone else go through this and have advise?

47,"So this is an odd situation. I moved in with some roommates a little over three years ago. The person I was replacing had the internet in his name and never switched it over to the current tenants. Apparently one of the other roommates who is friends with him agreed that we would just pay him back for the internet until he switches it over. However I was not aware of this agreement and thought that the previous roommate who was paying for the internet was negligent and was paying via autopay accidentally. When I found out several months later that he was still paying I mentioned it to the other roommates and was told that they didnt know and he would talk to him about it. That was three years ago and they still haven't switched it over. 

I am currently moving out of this apartment and was talking with my roommates and the one who had the verbal agreement mentioned that I would have to pay him for my share of the internet over the three years I lived here. I was not aware of that and have not budgeted for this situation. I was under the assumption(dumb maybe?) the previous roommate had made a mistake and I wasn't about to correct it as it wasn't my problem. I haven't seen the dude in three years!

So my question is what should I do in the situation? Currently I feel that I should not pay as I never agreed to paying him back in the first place. The internet is over $100 a month so split between three people over three years is over $1300. I understand that in a normal situation I would have shared the cost of internet with my roommates but I never had the option to choose the internet or the ability to contact the provider for issues. As far as I understood we had no agreement to pay back the previous roommate. However my current roommate is saying that we already discussed paying him back. I don't really know the ethically correct thing to do in this situation. I like my roommates, they are good people and we have never had any issues in the past, but this was sprung on me unexpectedly.

But after I started getting closer to him I would get annoyed he would text me so much. After a while I began to like it a little bit. The summer before my junior year I was hanging out with his friends in the somewhat “popular” group and doing things with them. All we did was hangout and text each other that summer. If I didn’t text him by 10am he would text me. Once a week we would go to the movies or play ball with other friends or ourselves. Towards the end of summer he invited me over his house. I stayed there overnight and into the afternoon of the next day. He seemed to like that I stayed that long. The next weekend I said he should come over my house and do the same thing. He seemed down with it until that night. He backed out. It was very obvious that he lied. I did not say anything but I asked a few more weekends and he lied again. I was crushed and started confronting him about it. He kept blowing it off and using every excuse in the book. I kind of backed away for a while until my other friend (who is a girl) said that he was asking her out on those weekends he told me no. She HATES him and has no interest in him at all. She told me everything. He was saying in groups that he would come over to my house and get drunk. (my mom is a teacher at this school HE COULD HAVE GOT HER FIRED). I don’t drink so that was a lie anyway.  I told him that I wanted nothing to do with him after that. I ignored him and his texts for a few days. He was almost in tears and told me that he couldn’t lose me and that I was like a brother to him. I told him I accepted his apology when I really didn’t. A few months later I asked him to come over after school and he said he couldn’t. But as soon as somebody else was also invited he suddenly could come. I left it go. I asked him what he was doing after prom because my date wanted to go home afterwards. He told me he would let me know. He never told me and I found out from another friend that he was going to an after party that I was also invited to. I did not go and the day after it was obvious he did not want me there. At this point I gave up and just let him do what he wanted. I said I wanted to talk about everything so we would quit fighting and he agreed. We didn’t even make it to that day because he backed out and I gave up. After a few nasty things were said we didn’t talk all summer. I got a great internship that will prepare me for my future and I didn’t think much of it that summer til I went back to school and seen him. He is unbothered by this and did not change at all. I am a senior now and ready to graduate. I lost almost all my friends because of all this. I disowned anybody who even talks to him. I have no self-esteem. And I am afraid to even look for new friends or try to have a girlfriend because of this. He watched me hurt for months and continued to lie worse and worse. I do not trust people again and I fear that will stick though college.  Should I just try to open up and forget about this? Or let people come to me? I am giving myself ulcers and making myself sick thinking about something like this happening again while he is still the cheerful funny person I thought was my friend.",19Apr2017,4

57,"I just moved into my home less than one month ago. A couple of weeks after moving in I noticed yelling and loud music but I couldn't identify where it was coming from. Also, it was in the middle of the day and I didn't bother to go looking further.

Last weekend it became clear that the yelling and loud music was coming from my neighbor. She was outside in her yard yelling to herself at the top of her lungs. I could discern a few words here and there but her voice became so hoarse I couldn't follow. What I did pick up sounded like nonsense. She continued at that until late that night, blowing a whistle at full blast as well from time to time. I went out into my backyard when this was going on and I saw one of my other neighbors outside. He said that the lady yelling had gotten out of an institution not long ago. I looked her up online later and apparently she went to jail a few years back for threatening her neighbors and for assault (I don't know if the latter was against a neighbor or not). 

Today I called the police because I heard from another neighbor that a woman matching her description was throwing rocks at cars up the street after I saw her walking in that direction. They let me know afterward that they took a report but that she seemed ""calmer"" and that she wasn't going into custody today.

For background, I live in suburban area, bordering on rural. Neighbors to most sides but also lots of trees and the area is otherwise pretty quiet.

When I first noticed her yelling I was thinking of going over to ask if she was OK. I have a family member with mental illness and so I am not insensitive to the plight that some have in getting proper help. However, I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I am a stay-at-home parent with a one year old child. I don't want to make my family or myself a target by maybe reporting her and having it get back to her that I had done so. From what I understand she made threats to people in the neighborhood even from the institution. When I called the police today I asked that they leave my identity anonymous. I don't know if that is actually the way it works though.

I did a search on Reddit and I saw somebody mentioning adult protective services. Should I go that route? Or should I just contact the police whenever she does something scary? What should I do? I want to help but I don't want my family to become a target. I also want to do whatever might be most effective in getting her the help she needs so she doesn't hurt herself or others.

TLDR: My neighbor seems to have mental health problems that seem to be escalating. She is going from yelling to now throwing rocks at cars. Years back she apparently threatened neighbors and was institutionalized. I have a family including a little one year old. What should I do?

We've certainly talked to each other before and even say hi to each other but other than that we don't really communicate much.

69,"Graduated with Bioengineering bachelors. Experienced research, didn't really want to do it for the rest of my life.

How am I supposed to decide what to be when I don't know all the options and don't know how each job/career is like. 

I'm afraid if I start one job I won't like it and might end up just staying in it for stability. Or 30 years down the line want to quit but then have to start over in another field. 

I want to act (what I would call my ""dream"" job because it looks the most fun. ie. blooper reels from The Office) but have no experience, know it's really hard to make a living off of it and will have to work a part time job to support it and in the end don't even know if I'll like it.
I want to get Masters in Physics because I think Quantum Mechanics and Astrophysics is very very interesting. Can't even decide between these two.
I want to be in the Air Force, hopefully a pilot but how do I start a family. 
I want to be a flight attendant to travel but sometimes you don't get enough time to travel between flights and the pay is not that great.
I'm good with computer hardware and troubleshooting but that'll seem to get mundane quick. 
I have a real estate license and I can sell houses but I feel that commission based salaries will make me greedy and not think of my clients as people but as prospects and the income can be very unstable.

The list goes on, every job I see I'm interested in then I back out because of all these reasons I see in the future that I think I'll regret it in the end.

The only thing I do know is I don't want an office job. One where you sit at a computer all day (ironically it's what I do as I'm unemployed trying to figure out what interests me)

Sure I'd try them all but there's not enough time.

Just try one? Every time I try one I have to get the qualifications get settled into the job and if I don't like, move on to the next one. But every time I do that I'll have lost time.

So I'm just stuck. I'm just frozen, choosing not to choose. 

Indecision is a decision I know but I need to move forward I just don't know in which direction.

I'm afraid of wasting time on a decision but at the same time wasting time deciding.

 Uncertainty and time is my greatest enemy.

71,"I was 10 years old, and every day I would be physically and emotionally abused by my mom. She would scratch me with her nails, or throw me against the wall, and she would leave me with a lot of bloody scratches on my body. I hid them from a lot of people, because she didn't want anyone at school to find out that I was being abused. She would also force my dad to slap me really hard, and for no reason at all. I did nothing to her. I was coming home from school, and I had my backpack around me, and as I am coming through the door, she takes my backpack off and grabs my arm, and brings me inside, and throws my backpack full of heavy books straight at me. I fell to the ground, and as I was trying to go upstairs, she grabbed my arm and my backpack again and threw me onto the stairs. Then as I was trying to run to my room, she grabs my arm, and takes her nails, and digs them straight into my skin, and I scream in pain. Then this one night when I was coming downstairs to talk to my brother, she goes to the kitchen drawer grabs a kitchen knife, and closes the blinds, and tells my brother not to call my dad or else. She grabs my arm really tightly so I can't escape and holds a knife up to me, and starts waving it in front of me as she's holding on to my arm.

74,"(Not sure if flair for this should be family, personal, school, or finance. On phone.)

A little backstory: so my mom is seriously crazy. I could write a book about her. She totally fucked me up mentally. I would go back and forth between my dad's house and my mom's house as a kid, and it was like night and day. My mom would say shit like my dad doesn't love me, my stepmom would try to poison me, girls who want to do extracurricular activities are sluts, all boys want to rape you and all girls want to use you so don't trust anybody, etc. When I turned 18, I went to live with my dad and stepmom permanently. I didn't want my biological mother in my life anymore. She got pissed and stopped talking to me, but my cousin, who lives with her, updates me.

Apparently when I was going to community college, she somehow was able to check my grades and see what classes I was in. My cousin told me she kept telling her to tell me that I was taking stupid classes and was wasting my time. I don't fucking want her to know what I'm up to. She has no right to tell me what to do with my life. I don't know if she can access anything from the university that I'm attending right now. 

According to my cousin, when I was applying for colleges, my bio mom applied to a college by her place that I didn't even want to go to, under my name. And she keeps applying for financial aid under my name too.

And then, I get [these screenshots](https://imgur.com/gallery/FM73Y) from my cousin. 

How the hell does she keep getting information about me? I don't know how she knows I even own a credit card, I got it after I moved out of her place. How do I get her to stop? I don't want her to tell my cousin to tell me what to do. I don't want her knowing what the hell I'm up to. I don't want her signing up for things under my name.  I just want her out of my life.

76,"Hello, people. I had the worse day at work because of one of my managers who gave me the worst time ever. I need advice on how to deal with the problem tomorrow.  
I work at a store in the liquor department. We have our own set of managers and they both like me and my work around the department. I've been written up twice since I was hired in May of 2016. Once for reading the wrong schedule and ending up late, and the other time a few months ago for being on my phone too much. Both very understandable. I didn't have a problem with either write up.  
Today for my 6 hour shift at work, the first 3 hours were fine. However, my coworker working back there with me told on me to one of the main stores assistant managers that I was using my phone. I wasn't actually on my phone. It was out under the register, but I wasn't using it.  
The assistant manager came back there, asked me why it was out, and threatened to write me up. I put my phone in my purse and he left.  
20 minutes comes to the store because he's been trying to text me and not getting a response. We're getting married this week and it was a pretty time sensitive question.  
My coworker spots him, runs back to tell the manager. My fiance asks his question, asks how my day as been, if I need him to pick up anything while he's out, and then starts to leave.  
This fucking asshole (Sorry) of an assistant manager stops him from leaving, and yells at him and says he can't be back here while I'm working, that it's unprofessional, that unless he's shopping he can't just stop by to see me, demands to know what his business is here, and then tells him to leave. My fiance leaves, and then the assistant manager yells at me, and says, ""I don't normally have a problem with you, but between this and your phone being out, I'm going to have a meeting with your liquor manager and upper management and we have to talk about your behavior here.""  

Sooo maybe nothing will come of it, but now I'm dreading work tomorrow and I'm wondering if upper management actually does come down on me, what do I do or say? Can they actually ban my fiance from coming to the store to ask me a question since I can't have me phone?  

I should mention this is not the first time that coworker has done something similar. She tattled on another worker in another department and got her in trouble. Why? Because that particular worker was pissed that she wasn't told that the checks came in early. She was mad that she wasn't notified and couldn't get her checks early and now the office was closed. So my coworker reported her words to upper management and that employee got in trouble.  
So she has a history of doing this to people, so I guess the advice I need is:  
1. What to do about the coworker, if anything?  
2. Is my fiance really not allowed to come to the store while I'm working? Can they actually do that?  
3. If upper management actually meets with me about my 'behavior' (They've never had a problem with me before, and I know some of them and have chatted with them in the past), what do I do?",19Apr2017,0

80,"This is something we've all experienced at one point or another. Looking back at times past, thinking of how much better things were back then and how it seems almost impossible that things will ever be that good again. There is also the tendency to want to preserve whatever remaining ties to what past have rippled into the present even if those ties prevent personal growth and progress. That could manifest itself into staying in a toxic relationship or staying in a town/city that you don't want to be in (or becoming nostalgic and moving back somewhere you previously lived).

There is an old saying about the past that we always remember the past as better than it was, the present as worse than it is, and the future less resolved than it will be. I can look back on my own life so far and see this at play. Some of the times I now look back on with nostalgia were complicated times that when I really analyze it, I would not want to return to. However, there is still this feeling of nostalgia for them, remembering the good things of that era of life and the overall feeling that those were simpler days. The past, for whatever reason, almost always feels simpler and more carefree regardless if that is how it actually was.

Not all looking back is bad. The past gives us a road map of our life and shows us how we got to the point we are currently at. We can look to it for guidance on what works and also what doesn't. Those who don't remember their past are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. However, there becomes a point where nostalgia impedes the present and future. It can actually cause us to make poor decisions if we make life-altering decisions based on nostalgia and trying to return to a past that never was and never will be. 

I have two prime examples in my own life. In 2012 I moved back to my hometown against my better judgment. There were multiple factors at play but I had other options than to move back home. However, nostalgia ultimately won and somehow I thought if I moved back home, the ""simpler"" days of yesteryear would return. It was an illusion and in fact it was one of the worst decisions I ever made.  Another one is I am having a very difficult time quitting smoking because when I quit, I get nostalgia for it since smoking cigarettes was a huge part of my life during the best years of it in 2009 and 2010. Cigarettes were also new to me at the time so I still got the buzz off them. Of course, smoking now is in no way going to bring those days back, but whenever I stop smoking, I get tempted by just the thought of keeping that tie to those days and I end up relapsing. Cigarettes don't do for me what they once did. Even the morning cigarette no longer packs the punch it used to. There is no reason I should want to keep smoking, yet the nostalgia wins every time I attempt to quit.

So for me, this is a big problem. Has anybody else dealt with this and if so, what did you do to keep nostalgia in its place so it wasn't preventing you from living your current life to its fullest?",19Apr2017,2

83,"So this all started last year around this time. I became friends with this dude because I knew he had a weed hookup and I was down to try. I get pretty deep and end up stealing $2000 from my mom in the span of 3 months. You might think I spent that all on drugs. Nope I spent it all on phone games. I would snag her card info put it into my phone and just buy stupid shit. She also noticed I was acting weird so she wanted to do an at home drug test so I fess up and tell her I've been smoking and the schools been telling her I've been skipping class so she goes and gets me a parol officer. I deal with him for a month but he also makes me do a 6 month drug awareness program. I get through doing only about 3 months and the drug program lets me go because I show no signs of doing drugs and the guy thought that I was a really good kid. When that's all over it's about August. Then December comes and I get my license and my first car. A week after I get it I crash it because I went around a curve to fast and flew off the road. I was completely sober and I had been for about 6 months. Then the end of February comes and I begin to smoke again and this time it was pretty heavily like everyday. My car gets fixed from the first crash about a week later. Then another week goes by, I'm still smoking daily, and I crash my car again this time I was a little to high to be driving and just to be clear the two weeks before I drove high everyday so it wasn't my first time driving high when I crashed. Then for a week more I still smoke daily but after that week I run out of weed and money.

We've talked about this before and I always tell him to turn it down but it doesn't work. I cause some issues too, I won't lie, I used to be big into partying.

I heard him talking to his girlfriend the other day about possibly moving out. I lit up like a Christmas tree when I heard this. I can't move because I'm on probation and $20,000 in debt and just got sued, I'm gonna have a hard time finding a place to accept me. My credit score is also very low. But I make decent money and am currently working on all those problems and could afford to live on my own. 

He seemed hesitant to move out while talking to his gf but I think he's considering it anyways. He said he has some thinking to do.

I stopped cleaning my room. There's a big pile of clothes and hats and shit next to the couch and a corner of the house that just has random shit of mine in it that probably all belongs at goodwill. Think like boxes of old board games, movies, CDs, books about how to play guitar from middle school, old video games, just random junk.

So now I gotta take this further though to encourage him to move out. I left some food out before I left for work tonight, I haven't been taking the garbage out or washing my dishes. He asked if I was going to buy toilet paper today and I said no. I plan on washing my dishes soon and doing it in the bath tub, maybe if I'm feeling really edgy I'll leave some in their and say I'm doing them later so he can't shower. 

Before he went to school today I took a shower after work, and I let the water run for 10 extra minutes and turned all the sinks on in the house to make his water cold. My plan backfired, he skipped class.

I was thinking about building a beer pong table and having it in middle of the living room and inviting people over to play on the weekends. This just seems like something he would absolutely hate. I bought a chair recently and he told me if I didn't put it in my room he was hauling it out to the trash, even though it's a very nice chair, he just said he have too much furniture already. 

Please give me more suggestions on how to make this kid go away. Yes, I'm disgusting, but I promise this entire house will be deep cleaned and kept that way after he moves out. I just hate living here atm even though it's a decent apartment in a very good location that is cheap, this guy has done so much negative shit to me that I am now resorting to extreme measures to get him to leave.

4. Only one person is in charge of administration at the therapy department and she refused to change my therapists

5. Felt depressed and started to withdraw myself away from people I know

6. Former friends and acquaintances seem to be deliberately avoiding me (no idea why - maybe they see me as annoying or very weird) and I am scared that they will spread rumours about me in the working world during internships

The car infront puts his hazards on and a lady jumps out of the passenger side swearing at me and the driver gets out and walks to the rear of his car. I got out of my car to inspect. There is zero damage, no scratches, even on his dirty rear bumper no contact is visible.

My wife and I are currently looking at new job opportunities for myself to take on to bring a little bit more bread to the table for the family. I have a son who's 2 and a baby girl due August 6th.
I currently work 08:30-17:00 Monday - Friday. I have every weekend off. I wake up with my son every day including weekends around 06:00, sort his breakfast get him dressed then go to work. (I live 2 miles from work so I don't have to leave the house until 08:15). I get home 17:15 in time to have dinner as a family, a small bit of play along with being able to take over for bath time &amp; bed time. I'll do all the night work if my boy isn't feeling well or having a rough night.
My wife seems convinced I should go for the following job offer. Working 06:00-18:30 Friday-Sunday every week. The money is marginally better but the job is 14 miles away. I'm not convinced that gaining 4 days during the week off balances to working over the weekend along with the increased costs in travelling to work and occupying our only car for the weekends. My son goes to Nursery once a week with it looking to increase later this year. I understand that being at home more would help with tending to baby girl and handling son.
I was wondering if you could help me out with suggestions or guidance?

I'm a 25 years old male living in London. I've just finished a BA in Advertising and I'm looking for a full-time gig. The only thing I did during my years at university are 3 different internships (one of them paid) and that's it.

London is so expensive and I'm wondering when I'll start to save some serious money. Right now it feel like I'll never will. The contracts I'm looking right now are all in the range of £18-22k per year... which is barely enough to live here.

Basically, I'll spend all of my salary in rent, food, transports, clothes etc. For how long will I've to stay like this? 2-3 years? I'll reach 30 without even noticing and without having any money.

Living without money sucks. I envy people who can spend money without the need of worrying about the fact... that they're spending money. I'm not talking about big expenses, but I'd love to be in a position where I know I can pay rent, food, transports, clothes, book flights, go to restaurants, book holidays etc without being like ""oh fuck, how am I going to eat this month?"".

125,"Greetings, this question is directed to mainly medical professionals who can give me a clear answer as to where the boundaries are set with my medical records.

My partner is a Nurse, and recently I had found he had gotten the medical records of a family member. Keep in mind that this family member was not his patient, in fact, they had never met. He was simply looking up these records for his own interest and curiosity. After learning this, I became extremely upset since I felt this was a violation of patient confidentiality. He was not given permission nor authorised to pull up those records and the whole situation just feels wrong. Once I confronted him, he stated things like:

""You know I can literally look up any person who has been to a public or private hospital and see their history right?""

and ""I can read any patients info I want I literally just need to pick it up and open it. I wont be fired I wont be reprimanded because im a nurse and im Authorised by the NMBA to view medical records.""

and ""Guess what, it happens 1000 times a day. No you dont get fired. No one cares if you're a nurse or doctor looking up medical records.
you may not LIKE it but at the end of the day thats the way it is.
deal with it.""

Those are exact quotes of some of the things he said in response to my confrontation. I would like to know if there is any truth behind those statements and am I really unable to do anything about him accessing this information? As things started to get heated in the argument, he left one more message; ""Do you want me to look yours up tonight? You aren't curious if the nurses/doctors called you a brat or left some snide comment in your progress notes?""

At this current point in time I am just extremely uncomfortable with the whole situation and I feel like there has to be some boundaries. I am NOT okay with my partner accessing my medical records, nor have I given him permission to do so. Is there really nothing I am able to do? I am aware he can obviously view medical records for patients he is treating, but is it still okay if the records he is looking up is purely for his own amusement with malicious intent? ",19Apr2017,1

133,"So right now, I am finishing up my second year of nursing school. I am having some serious doubts that nursing is the right career choice for me. I know many people only go into nursing because it is supposed to have good job security and job outlook. I was not one of those people, I went in with good intentions. Regardless, we have our first year of clinical in second year and I hated it. I felt on top of the world when a clinical was over, and then felt full of dread waiting for next week's clinical to come. I feel like nursing is something that I enjoy in theory, but not in practice. I liked learning about human anatomy, pharmacology, microbiology etc., but how this impacts patients real time on a ward is different. I would also like to say that this has taken a very long time for me to admit to myself. I worked my butt off to get into my program and I feel guilty about even having second doubts considering that my parents are awesome enough to be paying for my education. I just feel like if I were to continue into third year (where the clinicals are longer, harder and you are dealing with even more vulnerable patients) it would really and truly suck the life out of me.

The even harder part is that I have no idea what else I would study. I think that there are many careers I could do, but it would just be a matter of if I enjoyed them. The one thing I am truly passionate about is art. When I think about this, I wish I could go back in time and apply to art school instead of nursing. My temperament is much better suited to it, and I think I would be happier. I work for an art magazine right now out of enjoyment. I can't apply to art school now though, I would have to take a year off. I just feel like I don't have many options, and that by choosing the wrong major right off the bat I've screwed up everything.

Me and her were pretty good friends before I started liking her. I knew I wasn't supposed to like her. Daisy hasn't spoken to me since last Friday.

 When he told me about it yesterday I was pretty angry and in-denial shock laughter. Mike was saying that 'he's doing me a favor' that 'I would understand in a few years what he did' I still don't know what to feel; should I completely cut him out of my life or forgive but never forget? Today I told him that I'm going to distance myself to get my shit straight. I feel like my circle of friends can be biased on my side or his side, so I figured where can I find outside perspectives?

137,"I've stupidly revealed my face on two or three ocassions on nude chats with girls on Omegle. I dont know what I was thinking. These were incredibly hard times in my life and I just said fuck it. 


I'm a 20 year old male. I'm scared that these girls recorded the footage. They were all legit, and not fake cams. I'm also scared that they could be just below the age limit at 17 and I could get in big trouble. (Even though they all looked like adults). Although I dont see a reason why they recorded the footage, and kept it. I'm scared that if I become a recognised public figure (aware this is very unlikely), someone could leak the footage, and that this would be a very bad result. All the girls were interested in private cam chat- there was mutual interest.

Although I can't think of a reason for someone recording footage, I have become increasingly paranoid. I know what I've done is so fucking incredibly retarded, and although I have only myself to blame, In a normal state this would never have happened, and it will never happen again.

152,"I used to think I was going to be something in life and stand out from my other family members but it turns out, I am worse but only because of my own actions.

For starters, I moved out at 20 years old with an 80K inheritance. I thought I could save, go to college, and finish college with as little debt as possible. This did not happen. I dropped out in my first semester because, ""I had money, why do I need to go to college right now?"" and things went downhill fast. Within the next 14-16 months, I was dead broke with nothing to show. 

I then decided drug dealing was what was going to save me. Which it did, for the most part. I sold drugs for the next 9-10 months and it has failed me. Mostly due to such inconstancy.

I am 4 months behind on rent with the landlord in the process of evicting me. I owe $300 to the gas company. I owe $200 to the internet provider. I owe $1100 in child support. My car crapped out on me and is undriveable. I don't have my license(Another $250 to get) or insurance on my vehicle, even if it did drive. 

Here I am. The eviction process is going to be over soon. I have no income. I have no car. I have no way to move my belongings. I have no family willing to take me in. I have no education or work history. I have no skills. I am 23 with...nothing...

Truth to be told, our relationship has been stagnant for a while now. Ever since a death within my family, I've changed, became more distant, and cold. I feel like that death influenced the way I saw him, and kind of killed my desire for a relationship for a while. And while I insist that I love him, I think, deep inside, we both may know the truth.

174,"25 years old, and I feel like I’m affected too easily by any sort of negativity that’s directed my way. I’ve always been a bit of a wimp, p*ssy, spineless individual that puts up a brave front, but actively tries to avoid conflicts and make nice with other people. Any sort of distress or trouble directed towards me is capable of keeping me awake at night, and all it really takes is for someone to throw me a note of dissatisfaction, ideally coupled with a bit of foul language, to send me into a spiral of worry until the conflict is resolved, or enough time has passed.

As an example, the biggest issue as of late that immediately comes to my mind involves my housemate (let’s call him Tim for now). Tim’s a first year college student and genuinely a good guy, but our personality/ life styles don’t exactly mesh, and I’ve had to make a ton of adjustments to my daily life since moving in with him. Whereas I prefer a quiet environment and actively try to be considerate to the people around me, Tim prefers to put himself first, is actively loud and foul mouthed, and has a bit of an ego. Not too long ago, there was one such conflict involving the bathroom garbage can where he was passive aggressively trying to get me to put plastic bags in through the use of texts and post it notes. This issue was solved relatively easily the next day when I manned up and confronted him directly, and afterwards we worked something out/ maturely accepted the proposal. However, I barely slept a wink the night before worrying about what I did wrong, even after I having worked out exactly what I needed to do in my head the next day.

Tim thankfully plans to move out when his lease ends in two month’s time, and I’ll have a say as to who moves in next. But he’s just one example as to the troubles that plague me on a regular basis. Outside of being at home, it’s often difficult for me to propose new ideas during group activities, and I’m terrible when it comes to arguing/ verbally defending myself. As a result, I typically tend to withdraw from social activities/ interactions, even if they are something that I'm genuinely interested in. It frustrates me to no end.

In any case, I really do want to try and better myself, and am open to any sort of advice or comments. Thanks!",19Apr2017,1

179,"Content warning for mental illness and self harm 

I've been having a really rough year, which has brought my depression to an all time high. On really bad days I have episodes when I can't stop thinking about harming myself. Knowing that it's unsafe for me to be alone when this happens, I recently reached out to my roommate and explained what's been going on. She told me to call her anytime it happens and that she would come be with me if she could.

Yesterday, I had one of my worst episodes yet and I texted her to let her know. She came home and ate dinner with me and invited me to go to the library with her to study. I found out a little later, though, that she invited her boyfriend and his friends to come with us. I didn't feel prepared to be around that many people, so I opted to stay home and watch a movie with a different friend. My roommate offered to talk it out with me when she got home, but ended up staying the night at her boyfriend's.

Admittedly, I'm hurt. It would be one thing if she'd been too busy or if she wasn't aware of the severity of the situation, but it feels like she had the time and just wasn't willing to move her plans when I needed her. Even that would be okay, but I can't help but feel disappointed that she offered to be there for me and promised to come home, and then didn't come through. I know, however, that this is a sensitive subject and I wouldn't blame her for not feeling equipped to handle it; it's generous of her to offer to be there in the first place, and I know it's asking a lot of her. Still, I can't shake the feeling that she could have handled the situation better, as I was left alone all night, waiting for her to come home like she promised. Not to mention that feeling abandoned by the person I trust most certainly didn't help when I was already in a very dark place.

My question is this: do I have the right to be upset about this, or was I asking so much in the first place that it's unfair for me to have expected more from her? How can I address the situation with her so she understands that I was hurt without making her feel like I'm blaming her for the original problem of my mental illness? Is it even worth addressing, or should I just not even go to her in the future? ",19Apr2017,1
181,"I have spoken to two people about this and have gotten two different answers so I'm coming here to get a non-biased tie-breaker.

My husband's uncle by marriage died this week. We will call him Bill. Bill's memorial and funeral are Saturday morning/mid-day. Before Bill's passing he was in hospice. Bill had asked for my husband so we dropped everything two weeks ago and drove five hours (10 round trip) to another state to be with him for three days of visiting and helping out his wife and children.

My mother in law was the one to tell us Bill had passed and she told us her and my father in law are going to travel for the memorial and funeral. She only knows the day and time of the memorial. My sister in law only knows the day and time of the memorial. They only know because it was listed in a local newspaper as Bill was the County Major.

Both my husband and I spent days off (no pay), gas, over 1000 miles on my car, to see Bill while he was still alive. We will have to do it again if we go to the memorial and funeral. My husband just put in his resignation this week without another job lined up because his job was costing us money (long story not appropriate here). So we will have a fluctuating income as my husband tries to get going as a handyman/residential contractor on his own.

I was always told that funerals are for the living. My husband and I want to support his aunt and nieces. The memorial is likely to be packed because of Bill's position and popularity and I'm not sure Bill's wife will notice we are there or not. We were also not notified so it makes me more certain that we will be overlooked at the memorial and funeral.

I want to send living flowers to Bill's wife and children in lieu of us going but I feel guilty wanting to do so. My in-laws will be traveling the distance but MIL doesn't work and FIL is beyond financially stable AS WELL as it's his sister's husband so of course he is going. My husband's family is the type to silently judge and I'm just so worried we will be guilted for not going.

Since then it just feels like I wouldn't get hired anyway.

Basically I'm just feeling swamped in so many ways even though I'm not technically on any deadline and have more than enough time for everything I want to do, it's just that I feel it's all a waste of time.

I'm considering therapy but I don't know what my options would be, as my school provides it for free but with the semester ending in a couple weeks it probably wouldn't be covered. Certainly can't pay for it myself.

How can I motivate myself to start trying at life again?",19Apr2017,1
197,"My boss is a perfectionist. He makes it SO HARD for me to do my job because he not picks everything I do, and treats me like I'm stupid. It's so frustrating. I don't know how to handle it. I can't tell if it's me or him, it's my first job out of college and so sometimes I wonder if it's my fault, but then he calls me out on things I didn't even do wrong or expects me to know something there was no way for me to know. It's so incredibly frustrating. What should I do?",19Apr2017,1
199,"This happened like 10 minutes ago, I went out to move my vehicle so someone could get out of the parking lot. Where I work only really has one public entrance/exit and it also happens to be the main office. So I walked in there to see my boss and a couple of higher up employees ( we don't really have a hierarchy at work, there's the boss and then there's employees. But there are a handful of staff that have been there a while and my boss trusts them ) talking about my Co worker and her behavior over the last week. ( she's usually pretty nice and easy to deal with but she seems to only operate at extreme ends of the scale. She's either really happy or really angry and she's been the latter all week ) I only caught part of the conversation because I didn't want to seem like I was eavesdropping but they're considering firing her. I'm pretty sure that I'm the only person ( aside from those in the office ) that knows, and I don't want to tell everyone and make my boss feel that he can't trust me, but I also don't want to deal with the drama that comes with telling my Co worker. 

What's the best course of action here?

201,"My partner (22m) is about to graduate with a degree in mechanical/mechatronic engineering. He worked super hard throughout his degree and had an interview for basically his dream job at an aerospace company. They called him yesterday and they had 2 positions narrowed down to 3 people and that he was being considered. They even talked to him about salary and bonuses and he was pretty confident that he was getting the job. This morning he found out that they had given the positions to the other two candidates and he is completely crushed. It's the middle of final exams for both of us, but what can I do to be supportive and helpful to him right now? I am completely at a loss of how I can be there for him right now, other than just listening to what he has to say.

202,"Parent killed himself on Sunday and was found by my brother (20) who lived at home. He is now staying with my girlfriend and I (25) while we try to get him on his feet, he has no savings and almost nothing to his name. 

I work a full-time job and should be okay supporting him with the basics (essentials like food/clothes and a little cash in his pocket)

My brother never finished his senior year of high school and doesn't have a job. So I know I need to start there. I figured a few things we should focus on once he has had some time to grieve are:


1. GED/ Accredited HS Diploma 
2. Finding a job so he can start saving money
3. Teaching him basic money management
4. Building him some credit

Beyond that I have no idea where to start.  I am currently looking into getting him some sort of health insurance and have looked up a few grief support groups in my area. 

Other concerns I have are:

1.  The strain it will put on my relationship 
2. Making him feel at home (He is moving into our guest room, which is small and has a few pieces of furniture that I cannot move or get rid of) 
3. Helping him though this transition and dealing with the loss

203,"About 2-3 weeks ago I realised I have a crush on a friend with whom I recently got close to (maybe 2 months). I really enjoy talking to her and we have a lot of things in common (we like the same things and such). I've been helping her out with a subject I'm particularly good at and she seems to think that I'm wasting my time helping her but I genuinely enjoy doing so. She thinks I'm really really nice (heard from her best friend). 


For the past 3 weeks we've been texting each other a lot (usually me first) and we talk a lot and its fun chatting. We kind of hang out every day. I didn't think she has ever had a boyfriend before/anyone crushing on her that she knew and I have never experienced the same either.
I've told her best friend another friend of mine with whom she is close to that I have a crush on her and they support me. I know for sure that she trusts me a lot but may feel that she is wasting my time because I've helped a lot already.

The questions/problems I have are

1. I feel like I'm annoying her by being around too much (and chatting a lot) (they tell me thats not true but I dont know)

2. I don't know how to convey my feelings to her. Like I dont know how dating works and such and don't want things to become awkward

3. How do I know if shes interested in a relationship? With me?

4. How do I tell her that I like her?


I have no experience in such matters, this is the first girl I really like that I've gotten to know well so forgive me if my questions are silly

Please advise me.
Thank you!",19Apr2017,5
204,"I'm 20 years old, since I can remember I have never been a very social person, i always had a few true friends and I never really cared about other people.
Despite my age, I maintained the desire to understands everything around me, including the way other people think. 
This desire often leads me to overthinking and analyzing what people did or said to me. 
This continuous thread of recurrent thoughts in my mind, made me question my way of relating with friends and people several times. 
Needless to say I ended up acting weirdly in many situations because of my need of analyzing things or because of some ""improvement"" in my behaviour i previously thought.
So, I'm writing here just to ask: in your opinion is there a way to reduce this overthinking and consequently make me act ""naturally""?",19Apr2017,1
208,My last relationship was 5 months ago and I'm really starting to get over it. I am at the point where I've accepted it but it still plays through my mind. I think I just need to start going on dates and it will fade away. The thing is I don't have time to date. I am at a community college full time during the week. And I work for my family's business doing the night shift on weekends. I get over 40 hours of work each week and making crazy money for someone my age going to school full time. I am saving to transfer to big university over the summer and don't want to give up working all weekend because the money is phenomenal. Does anyone have any insight on how I could date with a schedule like this until I transfer. I feel like there isn't even any reason to try to talk to girls because it will never escalate cause I DONT HAVE TIME. I feel like I should just keep my head down and keep making bank and just go nuts when I transfer to a university. ,19Apr2017,2

210,"So a girlfriend (36 yrs old) borrowed one of my tops, color winter white and washed it with dark clothes. Here are the details- in January this year I lent her the top and today I asked her back for it. She texted back saying ' I wore it once, washed it once and it looks a little dull. Will return the top to you and also buy you a new one'. So I asked her if it had turned off-white or something coz that's not impossible to fix, to which she replied that it was grayish coz she washed it with darker clothes. I exclaimed - what you washed it with darker clothes?! And she replied - I always wash all my clothes in one load, sorry. 
I obviously am so disappointed and sad that the top is ruined but I am also angry that she didn't even apologize, let alone not telling me about it earlier. This happened earlier today and am trying to let it go, but I just can't. I feel like I'm partially at fault for letting her borrow the top when the top was so dear to me.

211,"He's my best friend, but I haven't seen him in person in 13 years.

I moved into his neighborhood in high school. For about eight years we did everything together, with a two year intermission in the midst of it. A few years after high school, we got an apartment together and lived like a couple of bachelors. He had a fiancee and a career and things were going well for him. But in the last year and a half of that eight year span his fiancee dumped him rather unexpectedly, and he went into a downward spiral. He lost his job, and he just kind of stagnated. He never came out of his funk, even with the support of me and our friends, and because he wasn't able to pay his share of the bills we couldn't afford our place, and we found new arrangements separately.

I joined the service some time later and so I left town. The last time I saw him was when he came passing through where I was stationed to go live in the city he grew up in. That was in 2004. Since then, I've spoken with him off and on, but he lives a thousand miles away. He's always been severely depressed and he's always regretted his decision to leave the town where I'm from, but he didn't come back because he's had a stable job for a number of years and he didn't think he could manage the logistics of finding a new stable job with cohabiting living arrangements since his current job didn't pay him enough to live independently.

Last week he lost his job, and a couple of days ago the person he was living with kicked him out. His brother contacted me last night and told me about the situation. He felt that it would be a good idea if I spoke with him, so I was up until about two in the morning. We've both been talking him out of suicide, but his brother and I have also been trying to lift his spirits while offering him short term solutions. He tried to check in to a mental health facility, but they don't seem to believe that he'll hurt himself. The impression for them is that he's just looking for a place to stay since he's homeless, but I know him well enough that suicide is a very realistic possibility. At the moment, he has nowhere to go and he spent the last night out on the street. I've asked him to go looking for a shelter, but in the mean time I have to ask myself some questions.

He doesn't have any parental options. Neither his brother or I have made any promises to him because ever since his fiancee left him, he has been a magnet for issues. We both know that taking him in would result in a significant burden and stress on our families. He hasn't shown much self-improvement over the years, and it seems likely that either of us would just end up kicking him out ourselves someday.

But I also don't want him to end it all, either. The friend in me feels like I should try to help him out in any way I can, and I worry that I would have regrets if he did do something rash; like any excuses I make now would make me feel like a selfish asshole that couldn't do the hard thing for my friend when it counted. On the other hand, I have my own family now with two elementary-aged children and I have to put them first. I don't think having him around in his current state would be good for them. I also don't have enough faith in him that he will right the ship for himself even with my help since all this time has passed and he hasn't managed to improve his life at all. Yet there's that nagging after-school special playing in my head that says things like, ""him being a friend in my time of need was the thing that changed my life, and I'll always be grateful for..."" and so on and so forth. I'm self-aware enough to know that this dialogue sounds naive, but it's there in my head anyway.

Either way, I know that there is a line somewhere marking the distinction between not doing enough and doing enough, and there's also a line between doing enough and doing too much at the detriment of myself and my family. I'm unsure where those lines are, but I'm fairly certain that I'm the only one capable of making that distinction.

That being said, I want to hear about what you would do?

**TL;DR:** Friend is now homeless and suicidal, but I don't think taking him in would be a good idea for my family. What sort of help, other than temporary solutions, could I give him? What could I do that might potentially have a more lasting positive effect on him? He has mental health issues, but I'm unsure of what his options are in coping with that without any money. I know he has a certain level of responsibility he needs to take for himself, but I also recognize that he needs some external help.",19Apr2017,1
212,"Okay, so there is a lot more to this then just me missing my ex girl friend. I feel like she was the one for me and it took me letting her go for me to realize that she's all I've ever wanted. 

About 6 months ago I told her that what we had was slowly fading and that it was noticeable with each passing day. This was mainly my fault with not putting enough effort in to our relationship and partially to do with me not being happy with myself in general. I needed to get my shit together basically if I wanted us to work out in the future. This is where i fucked up. I didn't tell her that and I basically went soul searching on my own as well as got a job and what not. At first she just kinda agreed with me and took it as it is what it is. but then a few weeks later was mad at me and accusing me of using her and what not and that was not true at all but I understand why she was upset. I still didn't tell her the main reason we broke up and just kept trying to get my shit together. 

Come forward to today and I try to get back in touch with her but she says that we are over and she is done with me and what nothing to do with me in her life. Not even to be friends. So I'm still messaging her and telling her I was sorry and spill out my gut's telling her all the feelings I still have for her and what we could be if she just gives me another chance. She doesn't say much at first except for that shes moved on and that I need to as well. But one day shes messaging me back and forth and we are talking like good old times. the next days she says sorry for that it was fun and all and I don't need an explanation as to why I did it but don't talk to me anymore. I know this whole situations falls under it is what it is category But I 100% feel like she is my soul mate and I don't want to be with anyone but her. We have almost everything in common from cats to both loving bikes, video games same type of humor and movies and I could just by my silly self around her and the same for her with me. She understood the depression I was in while in our relationship and I cant thank her enough for how good she was to me while it was happening. Their is just so much about her that I love and want to show her the real love I want to give her back for all the times I never did. She understood me and that's more then enough to ask from anyone really. But I kept messaging her back when she told me to go away, desperately clinging on to what I didn't have. As if the world it self was caving in on me and this was my only escape. 

I even let it get to the point that I kept sending her old photos of us when we were happy till she told me to fuck off and that she would file a report with the cops if I didn't stop. And here I am. Wondering how I let this get so far to this point. This is not the person I am but I let desperation and love get the best of me and I don't know how to deal with it all.",19Apr2017,1
213,"I have two female friends--Friend A is 26 and Friend B is 24--who both have an issue with obsession. By that, I mean that they seem to exist only to be obsessed with something. Friend A is currently in a frenzy over Star Wars and Disneyland, and Friend B is *very* into the NHL. They only talk about their obsessions, wear clothing indicating their vested interests, and only appear to live for those things. They also spend a lot of money on apparel, tickets, and other things--money they don't have. It didn't just start with Star Wars and hockey. These two have a storied history of obsessing over things. Previously, it was One Direction. Before that, the Jonas Brothers. Prior to that, I can't remember, but I think it was Charmed. However, this is the worst it's ever been. 

Some additional background: Both friends lost a parent within the last five years. Friend A lost her dad in February of 2013, and Friend B lost her mom in January of 2016. Both to cancer. I understand that losing a parent is difficult, but having not experienced that myself, I don't really know the toll it can have on a person. However, these varying obsessions pre-date the loss of their parents, and started in about 2002 or 2003, while we were still in junior high school. 

Additionally, Friend B has never had a job, and still doesn't have one, and lives with her father. She stays up all night to watch hockey games, has a very active hockey Tumblr account, and hardly ever leaves her house (our friendship has become text and tweet only). Friend A has a full-time job at a movie theatre, which is great, but always complains that she's broke (she pays half the rent on a two bedroom she shares with her friend). Both friends have dished out thousands of dollars on Disneyland, Star Wars, or hockey merchandise. And both friends' families have always lived paycheck-to-paycheck since we were kids. In 7th grade, when I met them, they couldn't go on class trips or play sports because those activities required a $25 or $50 check that their parents couldn't afford to spare. 

Anyway, to get to the point: At 24 and 26, I would think that they would have matured past that point in their lives. Sure, when we were all in high school, we all loved the Jonas Brothers. It was our favorite thing. It was all we talked about. But after we graduated, obsessions became kind of boring to me. I just thought, over time, it would fade away for them, too. I also would have thought they'd be thinking about the future. I don't want to see my friends unemployed at 30 and still living at home, or still a ticket taker at a movie theatre and stressing about paying the rent. I approached Friend B a couple of years ago about helping her go to college. I offered to help sign her up for classes and guide her though the process of attending CC, even if it's online. (I worked as an adjunct academic counselor at a nearby CC for awhile.) She seemed interested, but I don't know if she was just being nice. I did the same thing with Friend A last year, but she said she'd only go if she could get into the Disney College Program. I know college isn't the path for everyone. I just don't know how to help my friends. I've known them since I was 12 and I just see this obsession spiral getting worse rather than better. 

Any advice? ",19Apr2017,1
214,"I'm in school for technical theatre.  Part of the program is to run shows as part of their run crew.  Normally, this is a non-issue for me.  Two weeks ago, I was a half hour late to my call due to exhaustion from being overworked by my school workload, my full-time day job, and the show I was currently running.  I was asleep when my Stage Manager called me.  In theatre, missing a call is a very big problem. Professionally, it could result in a dock in pay for that day.  After that show, I swore to both my Stage Manager and Technical Director that it would never happen again.

Fast forward to today.  The same exact thing occurred on a different show.  The only difference is my Technical Director doesn't know yet.  But he will find out as it will be in the production report.  How do I apologize for making the exact same mistake twice, when my technical director was extremely pissed off the first time?  Is there anything I can do to mitigate the circumstances?

218,"I (20/M) just moved to this country to play for a team. There is other people in the team like me who also moved from other countries, so our team gave an option, either they will provide housing or we will have to rent our own private home. I and other three guys opted for the first option. I didn't mind them at first, they were just loud and going partying a lot and bringing different girls over, but I kept it to myself.

At the arena we play our games in, I saw a girl (Lily, 19F) working there looking at me all the time, she was extremely cute and shy, everytime our eyes met, I could see her flushing red. For the upcoming weeks, we would just look at each other, until one day she had the enough courage and came up to me trembling and just said ""hey"". We exchanged numbers and since then spent a lot of time. She showed me new places in the city and I took her to amazing restaurants. I later learned that she moved to this country, like me, but to study. She had no one here, not even any friend or family, so day by day, I could see her face lighting up with happiness, which made my days better.

She wanted to take things slow, and we had to anyway, because I had several trainings everyday and was barely available. One evening, I invited her over for netflix and chill when I knew the rest of my team would be out partying, and we had sex for the first time. It was the best I had and it was probably that moment I started loving her, even though I realized this too late.

After the sex, we were hanging out in the living room watching movies and two of my teammates came home, unexpectedly early. Adrién (22M) and Sasha (20M). They asked to join us for the movie and I realized the entire movie, Adrién was watching Lily. I brushed it off as him being drunk, which is the norm for him on a Saturday night. After she slept the night over and left very early in the morning, at breakfast, both Adrién and Sasha asked me ""what the fuck bro"", which I didn't understand. ""Seriously, her??"" and still oblivious, they just told me ""you can do so much better bro"". I didn't care what they thought at the time, but I should have put a stop to those comments. 

For the upcoming weeks, whenever she came up in conversation, they made same comments. One day, after we were going back home with shuttle after a game, Adrién was sitting next to me and saw that I got a message from a really hot model who is attending all of our games and a big ""fan"". He told me to reply to her to which I said ""of course not, I am seeing Lily"" and he straightout told me that; ""Dude, you are just getting started. You are getting more and more popular, and you really wanna be seen with someone so average?"". These words are the ones that stuck to me the most, because he was partly true, I just got a raise in my salary because of my great performance and I was getting lots of attention from the media. Everyday, models and even celebrities in our continent were messaging me, flirting. After this moment, her little imperfections were hard to ignore, his words were in my mind all the time and I was thinking of the possibilities and I got too snobby. She was perfect in every way possible, her freckles, her hair, her amazing smell, but I got too ahead of myself because of the attention.

I decided to break up with her, at the time I wasn't aware of how much I loved her. I invited her over to talk, and one thing led to another and we had sex. (I know I am stupid) After sex, while cuddling, she looked like she wanted to say something but was to shy... you know that look? It was almost like she was going to say she loved me (for the first time). I panicked, I didn't want to hear it, so I told her I want to break up with her. The cute look from her face suddenly disappeared. I felt like having a heart attack, my stomach was twisting. I was cursing myself as I watched her getting dressed while silently crying. That was the moment I realized I loved her, and I apologized and asked her to forgive me, but she just left without even looking into my eyes. Life without her was horrible, I was miserable and depressed. I turned to sleeping with the so called models to feel better, which wasn't working.

I couldn't see her at the arena, I later learned from someone else that she is still working there but changed departments so to say, so I won't be seeing her. I tried going up to her to talk as she blocked me from everywhere the day we broke up, and one day I saw her leaving work and she just ran and took a cab. I wanted to apologize, I wanted her to love me like I loved her, I hated myself everyday for ruining something so great. Adrién and Sasha was trying to support me, and they even hook me up with their model friends. I just wanted Lily.

After some time, I came home early from a party on Saturday to hear sounds coming from Adrién's room. I figured out it was odd that he was still home, but I just went to my room to lay on the bed and browse stuff on my laptop. My room is right next to Adrién's, and my bed is against the wall to his room, so I could hear most of the stuff. It was just him at first but then I heard room door being knocked and then Sasha entered. I also heard a girl laughing. I figured that they were drinking and listening to music, so I went back to my browsing. The laughters soon died down and I could hear... moaning? And I could hear Adrién and Sasha dirty talking to the girl. After a longwhile, I could hear Adrién asking the girl if she had ever been fucked in the ass before. She probably shaked her head, because Adrién replied to her ""Good, because now I will and you will be mine"". So I figured out they were having a threesome and double-penetrating, as well as some sort of BDSM play. It was hot, and I was touching myself to it, until Adrién asked her ""Did meuax fuck you as good?"" and I just froze. I thought at first, maybe, it is one of their ""friends"" but I soon realized it was Lily after Adrién asked her to call herself a slut. Her moans were familiar, but it wasn't until I heard her voice (for the first time that night) that it was her. I literally froze, I couldn't move any muscle in my body and I never felt a pain worse than this before. I just rushed to his room and there it was, both Adrién and Sasha fucking her at the same time as she laid in Sasha's arms. They really did not expect me as I was going to be out all night, and all of them were shocked, Lily more so. Adrién just got off and pushed me out of the room, asking me wtf is wrong me, and I asked him the same. I was so hurt and crying at this point, I couldn't believe what I just witnessed, especially after everything Adrién and Sasha said. I punched him in the face because he had this smirk on his face, and he just kept smirking. I just left the house to stay over at my friend's and I went back home in the morning to talk to him. 

I told him ""you told me to break up with her, you told me she was ugly, average, short, what happened to that?"" and he just told me ""you are the one that broke up with her. and after all, she is cute, and you know, she has that innocent look on her face that I just... love"", with the emphasis on love, and I punched him again. I knew he was using her, but he soon told me that they are actually ""dating"" - sort of... She is actually dating them both, and they ""fuck"" her, as he told me. 

This was a week ago and I am seriously very disturbed over this. It all made sense from the beginning, how he used to look at her, touch her, talk about her when we were together. It was all calculated. My performance is suffering, we fight a lot at the trainings, my boss has me living in a hotel for a week. He doesn't know, and I don't know whether to tell him or not. Our club has suffered enough with dramas over the past few years, and after all, I don't want to put Lily through something bad again. I still love her, which is the worst thing. I miss her more than ever, I miss her holding in my arms, I miss her waking up in my arms. I just want her, after everything that happened. I can't get that image out of my head, or the possibilities. Them hurting her, forcing her to do things, humiliating her. I hate myself every single day. I can not leave the team because my contract is going until 2019 January. I can not eat food anymore, I lost so much weight, I feel so weak. 

I have to live in the same house as them too until summer, which is the worst part. I want to talk to the boss, I want to just leave this team and not even exist. If I leave, it would be the end of my career too. I am just lost, I am disgusted with myself and people I used to call friends.

I need help. I can't even talk to anyone I know about this over how embarrassing it is. I don't own her but I love her more than anything, and seeing her with not one but two people is just so horrible for me.

What do I do about my so called friends? How can I even keep existing in the same place as them? I feel so emasculated. I can't even look at them without hatred, and my performance is suffering... The so called fans are making fun of me because of my performance, but only if they knew. Do I tell my boss? Should I try to seek help from him? Is there any hope left for me with her?

219,"ive had this since yesterday, and it's fairly annoying. they dont seem to stay in one spot, and they tend to cluster - there was a big rash on both of my hands at one point, and they were bright red and horribly bumpy and itchy, but it went away after ignoring it for like half an hour.  

currently its on my wrists and forearms.

i thought at first that maybe it's fleas my dog brought back, but i think flea bites stay for quite a while longer and i'd have seen one of the crawlies by now.  

im not even asking for help, just to identify wtf is it. there doesnt seem to be any specific thing that triggers them, except for scratching - but it only makes them stay longer, not actually appear.

220,"So we have a 7 month year old daughter. most days are fine, we care for here pretty equally. naturally my wife does a bit more work since she's breastfeeding and staying at home. but recently our realtionship is taking a beating. like yesterday for example i work nights. so i come home at 7 am really tired from working 10 hours. my wife have fallen ill during the night so she asks for help with the baby. so i stay up til 10:30 am to help feed,clothe etc.. 
i go to bed and get to sleep to 16:00 pm. my wife wakes me and tells me i have to call in sick since shes feeling ill.

 so i do. i stay home i cook i care for the baby. all while she rests in sofa. and ofc this is what you do when someone is not feeling well. but the thing is just before shes going to bed she asks me ""when are you going to go up tommorow?"" i answer around 1 pm. and she kinda flips screaming that she have to care of the baby from 8 am to 1 pm. i mean am i in the wrong here for asking to sleep for 8 hours right after i've stayed up nearly 24 and only slept 6? sure she's not feeling well but i really felt annoyed. and i dont know what to say to her.",19Apr2017,1

222,"Hi. To put things bluntly, I'm on the Autism spectrum, and it seems one of the many difficulties this has caused is that I'm perhaps the opposite of a ""manly man"". I don't like girly things, but I'm far from gender neutral. Recently, I've considered working with fishermen as part of an observers program. This job isn't about fishing, but rather nothing their catch to use as information.

The pay is well and would be a great way to start in my field, but there's two big issues I'm worried about, more than the working conditions at sea. Firstly, even I know that the men that brave the sea have to be the burliest of men out there. I don't like it personally (I don't know how to talk about masculine hobbies, especially among older men), and I really HATE male aggression. Like, it actually terrifies me in an uncontrollable way. The other issue is that I'm not the best hand-wise, but I suppose I will learn the proper methods during training. But I'm also nervous about screwing up something vital on the boat, and having the entire crew get furious at me.

Does anyone have any good advice? I don't have the job yet, but I may drop it over this issue. Advice from people who have autism and deal with higher-stress jobs would be especially appreciated. Thanks.",19Apr2017,1
224,"Well. So basically I have a lab exam this semester and in my college you must write a lab record and must submit that before your lab internal exam. I gave my record to a friend of mine who wrote it for me. When I went for correction she immediately noticed that it wasn't my writing and asked me ""How many people wrote this record for you?"" I said I wrote it myself. She cross referenced my notes and caught me. Threw the record at my face and told me that she would fail me. And meanwhile I'm having my exams for other subjects so that's keeping me busy. Four days later it is now lab internal day. She sees me and tells me to fuck right off. But I some how convinced her that I had already started to write a new record by myself. I told her I would give her this new record in 2 days. The funny part is when I go to the stationary the record book in which I'm supposed to write is no longer available. It may/may not come soon. I'm fucked. What do I do? Should I save myself the embarrassment and not attend my final? Do I confess to her the truth?",19Apr2017,1
225,"It's becoming stronger. That feeling that I have no-one to talk to. It's coming back everytime I'm sitting alone in my room, doing stuff on my pc, when I remember how good it is to talk to my crush that rejected me. We still talk and I never had such a common ground, she just pulls me like a magnet. It's really hard now to find anyone with at least one common thing. My friends that I party with are from a different world. We both are involved with music but our genres differ. My classmates, they are a whole different story. I just spend time with them becouse I have to and there is no-one I can really be friends with. They're all just... classmates. What matters to me is that I really want to meet someone who would keep me company through my life, that someone would care about my life goals and my interests and that we could share everything. I want to go outside and have time for someone rather than going outside for a pointless lonely walk. I don't know if this feeling is just temporary.

226,"This has only really started recently, within the past few months. Basically, these compulsions, or superstitions(I don't really know what to call them) have been stopping me from doing certain things. For example, lets say I really want to wear a pair of shoes. I start going for that pair of shoes, but for some reason it pops into my head that if I wear that pair of shoes then I will become a failure, and/or certain people will start to dislike me. Obviously that doesn't make any sense, what pair of shoes I wear this one time isn't connected at all to whether or not I achieve my aspirations, etc. But then, for some reason, I can't get that out of my head and I just decide not to wear the shoes. So that same story has been playing out quite a bit lately(usually involving things less trivial than shoes) and it's making me feel like shit. It's always the same thing too, for some reason I think that if I do that thing then I will never achieve my aspirations and I'll become a failure, et cetera, with things that are completely unconnected to whether or not I succeed. And I know that they're unconnected, but I can't get it out of my mind and it basically forces me to not do that thing, a lot of the time because it's not worth the energy and what-if anxiety to do that thing. 

I just want to stop this and I want to stop it before it gets worse. How do I go about doing that?",19Apr2017,1
228,"Okay me and this bloke were in each others lives since we were teens for about 10 years he broke my heart numerous times by breaking up with me and getting with someone else soon after. But be it a few months or a year we end up back in each others lives and we start sleeping together and being close again. The last time he ended things with me I was pregnant neither of us knew till one day I miscarried but he was long gone and wasn't supportive or around for me when it happened he was off with someone else and when I told him he shugged it off and not so much as a im sorry im here if you need me for anything text :(

That time of my life was awful I had lost him and my unborn child I was in pieces. It took him months to realise the way he had treated me and to understand how much he put me through. He wanted to make things right and we met up and talked about everything he said he was gonna change. We got close again after that and I could see he was really trying but I had a fear that he would abandon me again I would start little arguments over stupid things like if he mentioned a girls name id flip and think he was seeing her even though he wasnt and id always bring up the time that I lost the baby and how I needed him and that being with someone else was more important than being there for me just to let him know that it will always hurt me and to let him know he was lucky I was even still talking to him. :mad:
Whenever those arguments would come up he would reassure me that he has changed and that I need to stop putting him back at square one.

I did trust him in my heart but because of our past my mind would wander and id convince myself he was talking to a girl or out with girls id work myself up so much that id snap at him and he would have to reassure me he wasn't then id feel bad for thinking that in the first place. The thing is I love him he has my heart I know I could do so much better I know ive been told by a few but you love who you love. Even though he broke my heart a few times I never stopped caring. Hes the type of bloke that isnt very emotional all his past relationships girls hurt him and can see that pattern in how he was with me putting those insecurities on me. Im much happier when hes in my life but a lot of the time I feel like I mean nothing to him I would like to be hugged and just made feel like I mean something to him. He isn't a hearts and flowers guy he likes his own surroundings likes things his way most of the time he is kinda stoic he doesnt let his emotions control how he thinks. But because he is like this it hurts me and makes me think im nothing to him.

We have been fighting so much and I said some nasty things to him I called him a dirtbag and that I didnt want our baby to be brought up with a father who has multiple girlfriends all the time. Our relationship was always on and off and not see him a lot hes that type of person that never sees his friends much either. I just dont understand why im not enough for him I loved him like no other girl did he was in my life for so long. Things have gotten so bad as he has kidney failure and he says he has too much going on and that he cant be dealing with anymore stress and that us fighting is tearing us apart he advised me to talk to someone and to take a good few months time apart so we can focus on ourselfs. I feel like he has just abandoned me once again while I was vulnerable and im soo angry at him why does this man have to be so complicated? :o",19Apr2017,1
230,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 7 months now. But there is this one guy who hates me because I am dating her. That is the only reason why he hates me. I hate him for multiple reasons: 1. He acts like he's a good person around other people, such as his parents and my girlfriends parents, but is a terrible influence on people and mostly my girlfriend and 2. (The biggest reason) he tries to ruin my relationship. Two months into our relationship he forced her to kiss him. I ended up giving my girlfriend another chance. My girlfriends parents still like him because they don't know what he really does. My girlfriend hates him because he forced her into kissing him and she realized that he's trying to ruin us. She never hangs out with him anymore. Since her parents still like him they decided to arrange plans for going to the beach with the guys family. My girlfriend said that she would never do anything with him or think about doing anything with him and I trust her.

235,"So, I [M,21] am currently junior (rising senior) studying mechanical engineering at college. This week I was offered two different jobs for the summer, but I'm really conflicted as to which offer to take.

The first job is a job as an assistant project engineer (basically an internship) at a mechanical systems design company. It's really relevant to my major field and the pay is pretty good for someone my age. Plus I really need the experience for my resume. 

The second job is for a leadership position as a waterfront lifeguard/swim lessons director at a medium sized summer camp. I've worked this job the last two summers as a regular lifeguard and applied to be the lead this summer and got it. The pay is also pretty good too and I've got a lot of friends that work there.

My conflict here is more or less the social aspect for each job. I've got pretty bad social anxiety at college and really don't get out much or have many friends, but every summer i've worked at this camp it's really brought me out of my shell. I've made great friends with the people there and they helped me cope with a lot of personal things. But if I take the internship, chances are i'm not going to meet many people my own age this summer since i'll likely be the youngest person at the company, and I worry that the friends that work at the camp will leave me behind when i'm not seeing them every day. Additionally, my parents are really pushing me towards the internship job, but i'm not sure if it's what I want.

So, I guess i'm really looking for advice for which one I should lean towards taking?

237,"Alright, so here's a brief rundown of what's happened so far. I got introduced to said girl on a Discord server back in November. For this post, we'll call her Samantha. I instantly liked her based on her personality, but as soon as I saw what she looked like I began to develop a crush on her. The Discord server includes some of my friends from real life, as well as some friends of friends, and Samantha of course. We all play video games together, and she particularly likes Overwatch. In fact, it's about the only game we play together. In about December, most of the other people on the server got really involved with League of Legends, except for Me, Samantha, and a third guy who I'll refer to as Nick. She was noticeably talking to me and Nick more, though probably mostly because we were playing Overwatch together and no one else wanted to play. I don't know exactly what happened, but between December and about March, Samantha and Nick started to develop some sort of relationship. She obviously liked him but at first he didn't like her. In the end, one of her friends was strongly pushing Nick to ask her out, but he apparently got upset and didn't make a move, as he didn't think long distance would work. From what I can tell, this made her upset and according to one of my friends who has more info than me, there is no longer anything going on between them. One thing to note from this is that she's apparently OK with long distance relationships, which is important because I live in the state next to hers.


Before I go on, I need to describe our relationship. We both have similar personalities and senses of humor. She's very shy and anxious in real life, just like me. She also says she's lonely and doesn't really have any friends at college, which is also similar to me. I always jokingly make fun of her and tease her when we play games, and she does the same thing back. It's clear she likes talking and playing with me, as she's asked me in the past to come play Overwatch with her. There was also one day where she was sitting in the server by herself and I joined to see what she was doing. She said she didn't expect anyone to come in and talk with her, but I stayed and we talked for like 7 hours. It wasn't awkward or anything either. It seemed like she was enjoying my company and I was enjoying hers. She also mentioned once when we were talking alone that she thought Valentine's Day was ""gross"" because she had to see all the couples on Snapchat. Could mean nothing but I thought it was worth noting since that's just another way of her saying she's single. On the other hand, I started a Snapchat streak with her back in December, which is great (we're at 76 now) but she rarely sends me a Snapchat first, and if she does, it's usually of her cat. And this may be my fault as I don't send selfies to her, but she rarely sends selfies to me. The point is I'm getting mixed messages. Either she knows I like her and just isn't crazy about me, or she's oblivious because she was so focused on Nick for so long. Or the third option (girls are confusing, so I may just be pulling this out of my ass), she knows I like her but is waiting for me to do something about it.
Anyway, her moving on from Nick more or less opens the door for me to make a move, but I don't know what to do. We're meeting up for a convention in July with all the other people from the server, including Nick, for a week. I thought I would tell her there, but I don't want to put her on the spot like that and risk making things awkward for the rest of the week. On the other hand, I have to wait another two months, and I already can't stop thinking about it. Everything is going by so slowly because she now works two jobs and hardly ever comes online to play games anymore, so I don't get to talk to her much, and when I do it's with a bunch of other people there. Talking to her always makes me instantly feel better, as she makes me feel happy, but only briefly. Not to mention I'm constantly stressing that she's going to meet someone irl in the meantime. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but not getting the chance to tell her how I feel would kill me. I just feel like telling her in person may actually make the difference in her answer, as she may like me more when we see each other in person. If I tell her now, I don't have to worry about it anymore, but she may be less receptive since we've only ever met online. If you think I should tell her in person, what can I do mentally to get me through these two months? School is really grating on me and not getting to talk to her as much as I used to is making things worse. Also, is there any way I can hint more strongly that I like her leading up to when we meet, or at the very least convince her to come online and play with me more often, without it seeming weird and clingy? And if you think I should tell her now and get it over with, why and how? Is asking her out closing the door for any possible future relationships, or do you think I may have another chance down the line if she says no?


TL;DR: Met a girl online through video games back in November. She lives in a different state but I have a huge crush on her based on her personality and appearance. She's more or less given me mixed feelings. Likes talking to me and has mentioned being single (albeit indirectly) but also doesn't initiate contact that often (may just be because she's shy or waiting for me to make a move). We're meeting up at a convention in July for a week. Should I ask her out then where she may be more receptive after seeing me in person, or ask her out now and get it over with?

P.S. If you're going to comment with ""you're delusional"", ""this is creepy"", ""don't even bother, meet someone at your school"", or anything along those lines, please just refrain. I've heard all of that before and that's not why I'm posting this here. All I want is some advice on how and when to ask her out, because you're not going to convince me not to do it.",19Apr2017,1
238,"I met this girl on tinder in October. We hit it off great and have been non-exclusively dating since then. We would hang out 3-4 times a week laugh like crazy and fuck like rabbits - She is a genuinely good soul. One time when we were cuddling she even refereed to me as her best friend, I was speechless at the time because I didn't know if I felt the same way. The past couple weeks we have stopped hanging out as much, and cut it down to maybe once a week.


It looked like things were winding down between us when today I got a call from a mutual friend of ours whose ID she uses to get into bars (she is 19 and her birthday is less than a week away :( ). This friend told me that she went out drinking last night, and ended up getting a DUI. She then showed up at work this morning, collapsed and has been un-responsive ever since. The doctor doesn't think she will make it. Apparently she has overdosed on alcohol + pills, which taking pills is VERY uncharacteristic of her.


I feel terrible, if we continued to hang out at our same pace she would never have gone out drinking last night. Not even that, if I just randomly wanted to hang out and she came over this never would have happened!!!! I have never had someone close to me die, and waiting to hear word back from people at the hospital about her condition is driving me insane. I am not close enough to family to go visit her and they are trying to keep the whole thing secret right now anyway, only a few select people are supposed to know what's up and I am not one of them. I seriously don't know what to do reddit and I am freaking out. I will go from hysterically balling, to feel complete and utter numbness. I feel helpless and scared. Picturing her laying in the hospital bed with tubes and wires all around her, motionless, while her grandparents (she doesn't have parents) sit in their silent is breaking my heart.


EDIT: I even sent her a snapchat this morning while I was at work, She opened it but didn't reply. I sent her another one 30 minutes later and it still remains unopened. I can't help but seem to think her collapse and medical emergency happened in this time frame :(",19Apr2017,1
240,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I am a trans man. Not a confused college kid or anything, I have been living fully as a man for years. I'm married to a wonderful man who I plan to spend the rest of my life with. We both wanted children, but not any time soon. Adoption was almost the guaranteed plan.

Life wouldn't have it that way. I became pregnant by what I consider an honest-to-God miracle (didn't think it was possible). Naturally this set off into motion a lot of mixed feelings. I was absolutely terrified of the changes to my body, but ultimately due to personal beliefs abortion was not an option. Husband was terrified, but supported my decision, and despite being quite depressed at first, he soon warmed up to the idea and was looking forward to fatherhood.

A few things happened. We told those closest to us, those who know about my biology, which include my family and in-laws both. Friends, for the most part, were and currently are unaware. Everyone was supportive, in fact it actually strengthened the bond between myself and my previously-estranged parents. However, it seemed almost everyone (MIL, my parents &amp; grandparents) all decided that this was ""God's way"" of letting me know not to transition. Whatever, due to the fact that my child was now #1 in my life, I let the comments go like water off a duck's ass. Husband was furious, especially at his mother who, despite being lovely was one of the more pushy ones along with my grandmother. Regardless, it didn't dampen the relationship much as I knew they would just have to deal with it after the baby was born.

Cut to now. 10 weeks in we lose the baby. It was pretty shocking and disturbing as she had been decomposing for several weeks. Needless to say, a possibility I had once asked God for (during my husband's depression, I felt guilty for wanting to keep the baby) had come true and neither of us wanted it. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that one night we were searching for cribs and clothes and picking out names, and the next we're planning to bury our daughter.

The only reason I mentioned the transition is so you better understand the emotional toll I've gone through. Being transgendered is not part of my life, nor is it part of my identity. But now, as my hcg levels decrease and my pregnancy symptoms disappear, I have no desire to go back to taking injections, nor any of the ""selfish"" pursuits I once had of fulfilling my manhood. I definitely do not feel remotely like a woman. I feel like miscarriage and baby forums aren't a place for me to go because I don't think those women will truly understand. They understand loss, but there is another layer of agony I'm going through.

I'm so utterly depressed. I've been medicated for depression for years and years and years, but this is another level. She might have been a fetus but she was still my daughter. And now she's gone. My daughter is dead and there is nothing I can do about it.

I don't know where to go from here. I have no desire, nothing. Husband has suggested we ""try again"" for a child (incredibly surprising from him, especially as this certainly wasn't on purpose) if I like, and part of me wants to, as all the ""what ifs"" swim around in my head...but at the same time, I don't want another baby. I want this baby. I named her, I loved her, I had a whole future with her planned. I don't want a replacement baby, I just want this baby back.

I don't know if anyone can offer me any help, but I'm struggling here. I am the homemaker and the state of the house is pretty reflective of what I'm going through. My grandmother came over to help clean a bit (not initially; she was ready to call 911 for mental evaluation), and my brother joined her soon after to read Job, which really wasn't helping and just made me feel shitty for complaining. To add salt to the wound, my grandmother insisted that I was a ""beautiful *woman*"". I know it was intentional, especially as she emphasised it. Needless to say I just want to curl up into a ball and never leave.

Because this situation is so rare, I feel completely isolated. I just need someone to hear me, to know I'm not alone. I just need help.",19Apr2017,2
241,"I was vacationing with my family in Egypt.  I was sitting on the beach by myself for about an hour, then at about 12 am i decided to head back to my room. On my way back I felt the need to use the bathroom and so I went into the public bathroom. I remember hearing footsteps entering. Anyways I finished peeing and As I started opening the door, someone pushed me back in. He looked like he was in his 30s. He pushed me in so that I fell onto the toilet seat, then locked the door. 
He said ""behave and it'll be easier."" 
He held me against the wall with one hand on my throat. His other hand was reaching for my pants. I tried to get away but he quickly pushed me back against the wall. He was way stronger than me and fighting back only made him more mad and resistant. I guess I just didn't get what was going on. He got pissed and pulled out a small knife and put it on my neck. He started telling me to help him with his pants. I reached for his belt, I couldn't look down, I couldn't see what I was doing, I didn't want to do it. But as soon as I pulled the belt through the buckle he pushed me down. Made me do oral. I was choking and crying. 
I was too afraid to even move. It just went on for forever. But that wasn't it. then he pulled me up and pushed me into the wall. And started forcing himself in me. I just stood as motionless as possible as he pushed into me. The pain caused me to make noise so he put his hand on my mouth. he pushed in over and over again. It was awful. I just remember how bad it felt. I didnt feel like a person. Just an object, filth. Then he just finished off and left. Said that He enjoyed ""our fun"" and that he'll see me around. 
I leaned down to pull my pants up, but I couldn't. I just sat on the ground crying.
Eventually I got up, and went back to my room. after that things are blurry for me, But I think both my sisters were sleeping, or not in the room. I just went back to bed and closed my eyes. I realize now that in a way my mind l automatically decided to pretend that nothing happened. So it went fine for the next week or so, but then the nightmares and flashbacks kicked in. and then the self harm kicked in, then the suicidal thoughts, loss of self worth, self hatred. things just got worse and worse. 
Things been terrible on and off ever since. Especially with the nightmares, selfharm and depression. Ever since it happened I just cant feel clean or worth anything. 
I've never actually talked about it or ever written about it before. It feels good to let it out. But I still have all of these shitty issues. I dont know want to do. The only thing that makes me feel better is cutting myself. I need therapy. I know that now. The problem is I dont know how to ask my parents for therapy. They arent really fans of it. And I wont tell them about what happened. Not them or anyone. I already feel like a pathetic loser Because of it.

- I have a very formal relation with her, we're not close, but we've never been mad at each other or anything of the sort. 
- She has some free time, to watch videos or read something. 
- Her family is doing her best to support her, and if i get some good advice, i would probably share it with them too. 
- She is very devout to her family and i think her main reason to be depressed is being unable to be there for everyone the way she's used to physically, emotionally, etc. 
- She's also afraid to die because despite her current prognosis, many of her family members have perished to cancer, other types though. 

I'm no expert, but it looks to me like she's going trough the phases of grieving, if there's any known process or ways to help people get to acceptance faster, that would be a good start.",19Apr2017,1

Don't have any enemies that I know of.  Ive always done my best to stay away from large crowds of people and I don't have many friends, but something happened the other night that is really bothering me that I can't stop thinking about. 
I live in a townhouse apartment and I heard a lot of noise outside at about 2 a.m. in the morning so I decided to go outside and check it out. As soon as I open the door I hear someone take off and see them running down the street. My car is parked directly in front of my door and I noticed that the car looks wet and it's not raining outside. The car was literally doused in rubbing alcohol. Completely covered in it. Even on the bottom, looks like they went underneath the car and put it on everything underneath as well and inside. By the time I realized this this person was long gone. I tried driving to look for them and I could not find them. Not even walking down the street.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? What are your thoughts on this?",19Apr2017,2

253,"My friendship of 25 years appears to have hit a wall. Everything was great until he got into a relationship a few years ago and became a lot more uncommunicative. I've known him so long and seen him go through so many relationships and lived with partners, and it never had an impact on us. 

It seems his current partner felt threatened by our friendship and set some rules for him, i.e. that him talking to me in the evenings was ""rude"" and that he should come home from work and just spend time with him in their apartment - even though we were just talking for like an hour every month. (I've never met his partner, they live in another state and have now been together for 3 years, during which time our communications have really dwindled). 

So, the phone calls stopped coming, since the evenings are when I was available (there's a 3 hour time difference).

I talked to him about it and he said he wasn't available in the evenings, but that I can talk to him during my work hours.
I don't see that as a viable or fair option, I can't risk my work to talk to him, and I'm offended this was even asked or proposed.

Am I justified in being upset about this? What would you say or do if you were in my shoes? 

I feel like if I talk to him during my work hours, that will give some sort of ok on this behavior, and I don't think it's OK coming from either one of them. I already mentioned the importance of making time for the friendship, which he said he would do and then it just fell back into this pattern after a short while.

Depressed about this situation, I really care about this person. Since his partner came around, I have been made to feel like I'm not a priority or worth investing time in, and that's not OK or true. :(",19Apr2017,1

256,"Recently over the last six months or so, seeing an animal die or accidentally causing an animal to die has caused me to have mental breakdowns, to the point where I harm myself. Today, I was painting a house and there was a nest with five eggs in it, I pulled the nest down and painted the spot, after the area dried I went to put the nest back, tripped and four eggs fell out and shattered. It left me to the point where I couldn't function and I ended up burning myself to calm down. (That was a common thing to help when I was younger, but I hadn't been like this in a long time.) I was wanting to know why I get uncontrollably upset over an animal dying, but not a person, and why if I'm the cause or witness it happen in person I have to harm myself to make myself calm down. I'm diagnosed with; PTSD, anxiety, major depression, and ADD. I just need to know what I can do to keep from getting like this, it's continually getting worse and I can't afford medication, nor insurance so I'm lost on how to cope without harming myself.",19Apr2017,1
257,"I don't have anyone to talk to about this or else I wouldn't be posting here. I feel kind of awkward putting these details out there, but I need advice. 

I have a long term boyfriend and a 3 year old child. I've never had thoughts about girls until recently but I want to try it out. Sex with my Bf is good, but I don't get as turned on as when I watch porn. My Bf is super against cheating (obviously) but his brother was cheated on and it messed him up. I don't want to cheat on him because I love him and want to continue the beautiful family/life we've created. I don't know how to bring it up, or if he'll even take me seriously. I've considered a threesome, however, I would want to try it by myself first. ",19Apr2017,5
259,"I'm in a long distance relationship (4 hour drive) with my girlfriend. We started talking 3 months ago and officially started dating 2 months ago. Things were going great until one day I asked about her past. Things took a heavy fall after that day which triggered this anxiety inside of me. She told me that for 3 years she was dating a 9 year older guy who was separated from his wife but living under the same roof. I keep having these thoughts that my gf was his side chick because he got back with his wife after my gf and him broke up, I feel like he just used her. My girlfriend lost her virginity to him. I'm having really bad anxiety because of this. Oh and to make matters worse, he is her coworker. My gf promises me that she never felt that way and so far she has been very honest with me about everything. She keeps saying that if he was using her he wouldn't be with her for 3 years and would instead have used her and dumped after a few months or so which I guess makes sense but I still have the thoughts that she was his side girl. Am I constantly over-thinking and torturing myself for no reason? I need an outside view of this.",19Apr2017,0
260,"Hello everyone.. I really don't know how to phrase this and I really don't like to talk about this but this is a serious issue. Two weeks ago my friend called me and he told me on 4/20 that he will commit suicide. I tried to talk him out of it then but it didn't really seem to help. Today he just texted me reminding me that tomorrow is the day and I really don't know how to respond or react to help him out with his problems. If anyone would be so kind I would love for you to help me out and try to talk him out of doing something that will affect a lot of people... (He's 17)

261,"So my sink leaked down to the unit below me and management says the maintenance guys blame my dishwasher (which makes no sense). He says the damage had been accumulating for 7 months but I only got the dishwasher in January. I got an email saying they would make me pay for the repairs and get rid of my dishwasher. When he came by to check again, I informed him I would not be paying for the damage because my dishwasher didn't do any damage (I know this is true for multiple reasons) and that my lease says nothing about ""non permitted appliances"" as he puts it. He told me it didn't matter, that it was an unapproved appliance and that if it wasn't gone in a week he'll hit me with a ""perform our quit"" notice. I looked it up and that's for when the tenant breaks the lease, but I haven't broken the lease. What do I do? I don't wanna get rid of it, it was expensive and it saves me hours a week not having to do dishes. Am I in the right here? Would it be an illegal eviction? I'm not renewing my lease when it expires in August if that matters.",19Apr2017,1
262,"&lt;TLDR&gt; I'm senior software engineering student and I want to use my last summer before graduation to work on a piece of software that may become a lucrative business or lead to a higher level of employment upon graduation, but my GF loves to spend money and I'll have to work this summer if I am to have the funds to make her happy. &lt;/TLDR&gt;

I am a software engineering student going into my senior year. I've always been a schemer and I have dreams of making the next big software program in the business sector and have many ideas written down and ready to go and a couple of half written applications that are progressing slowly due to my school commitments. Although it may seem unlikely, I am extremely optimistic that one of my current or future ones will be semi-successful affording me a life of self employment. I don't have unrealistic expectations of creating the next Google, Facebook, or Microsoft, but I do believe that I can found a software company where I'll be able to pay myself at least $200k (we're talking non-California so that's actually a lot of money for someone). I've never had a lot of money growing up and am hungry to create something I'm proud of and not be a slave to a company. I am OK (personally) with struggling for a few years to make it to that level of success. If I fail, I can always get a job and make more than decent money while I plan my next move.

With that being said, my girlfriend, I sadly believe, is holding me back. I love her. I love her personality and her beauty. I've even told her when I graduate, I'll take care of her once I land a job (which is pretty much guaranteed since I'm currently doing a year long internship at a highly respected and established software development company). Currently though, I'm completely broke. I pay for my schooling through scholarships, loans, grants and the little bit I make from my internship meaning that I have to budget to the extreme. My gf is a dealer at a casino and makes $80k a year (but CHOOSES to work part-time so more like $50kish). We've been together going on 3 years, long before she got the dealer promotion and was just a cocktail waitress not making much at all. She constantly nags me about how we never do anything, but in reality it's because everything she wants to do costs A LOT of money now. She wants to go on cruises, trips to different countries, fancy $100+ dinners, etc. and it's killing me. I've gotten to the point where I flat out tell her I can't afford it. I've given her the blessing to go and do this stuff with her guy friends (I trust her completely. Trust is not an issue in this relationship). When she is mad, she berates me about being broke, not doing enough, etc., but doesn't understand the insane workload that my major has on me.

My gf is beautiful. We have the same humor, we both drink, we love each other's company. She's not sensitive (but angers easily). She's open to new ideas and we are very sexually compatible. She trusts me and I trust her when it comes to hanging around the opposite sex. She always has my back in a fight. Pretty much besides the issues said, we're great stable, and have definite marriage potential.

In closing, this is the last summer I'll have almost free to be able to polish and go full boar into one of my ideas before I graduate and have to start working full time. She wants to eat up this time with trips and outings. She wants me to move in with her which to me translates into spend money doing expensive things. I don't have to pay rent, but I will pay in other ways if you know what I mean. If I'm to do this stuff, I will have to get a part-time job to afford it. For her, she can work 20 hours a week, pay her bills, and have plenty of money to drop a $1000 on anything she wants, but expects me to be able to do the same. To keep this relationship, I'll have to get that second job in addition to my internship. However, if I leave her (and it does kill me, but I'm terrified that this summer will be the last real bastion of non-responsibility in my youth that I can dedicate to working on something potentially great full time) I can live with my parents (free), not go out (free), work my internship (make only a little bit of money but definitely a net positive), and have hundreds of hours to polish technology that may lead to a business venture or even a better paying job. She's made it very clear to me that she's tired of the situation I'm in and nags me about it, breaks up with me and is right back minutes later. 

This is the girl of my dreams (personality wise) and she's hot as fuck (which might mean something, might not), but if I don't take this perfect opportunity (I wasted last summer working trying to keep up with her lifestyle), I'm afraid I'll regret it the rest of my life.

Given the circumstances, what do you think I should do?

Sorry for any typos. I hope the point got across.",19Apr2017,1
266,"First time posting here, not even sure what a proper post looks like, sorry.

My friend recently told me over text she did something today that she thinks she shouldn't have done and she feels a little bad about it. Now she said it's a normal thing but she still feels like she shouldn't have done it. The reason being that she doesn't want certain guys to know about it. I asked her and she said people aren't going to make fun of her over it and she didn't embarass herself, drugs weren't a part of this either. That's all I got out of it. She also said she probably won't spill the beans to me, which I respect.

I just wish she would tell me, as she texted me hinting she did something she thought she shouldn't have. Can't keep a friend hanging like that, can someone relate?

Any guesses or advice is deeply appreciated, thank you",19Apr2017,1
