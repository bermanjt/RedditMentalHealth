1,"I've tried everything. I've looked at every job I've had even a slight interest in. Everybody who works in the job, every person on a subreddit I taked to for that job, every article I could find says that they all suck. 

This all started because if I don't find some other job then I have to be a doctor. I've never been sure that I want to be a doctor and every thing I've found on being a doctor isn't exactly encouraging. Everybody says it sucks. 

I can't find anything. I don't know what to do anymore. All I knew is that I wanted to work a decently paying job that let's me have time off to do the stuff I want. Some doctor specialties let you do that but some don't and what specialty you go into depends on A SCORE ON A FREAKING TEST! 

I can't think of anything that sounds even remotely interesting to me. I do not have money or time to take time off to decide what I want from my life. I have to decide what I want to do now or it's doctoring time for me!",22Oct2017,1
3,"Hello everyone and welcome to a depressing thread about my terrible life! For everyone wondering, this is a repost from another subreddit written by me that has been done due to the urgent need for advice that wasn't given to me in another subreddit.

It all started with being born in a family that never accept new perspectives of life, I wonder what happened during my previous life that got me so unlucky. Since my very childhood, I have been trying to convince my parents about different things but what the final outcome of everything I try is the vice versa because they don't trust me and the information that I am giving them.

Recently I have been demotivated about continuing to study in college and planning on becoming a college dropout due to being unfortunate enough to lose 2 years of very hard work from my previous education which later turned into null. I have been trying to tell my parents that school education is not necessary for this generation and that everything can be fixed if you are experienced enough in the career you want to work with unless that career requires a medical diploma to prove that the person trying to perform a medical surgery is qualified enough to do so. But in my case I want to become a computer programmer, I have had good experience in programming since I was interested in computers at a very early age which later turned me into a person who can read and understand complicated codes without much effort.

Unfortunately, my parents don't trust me enough with this particular experiment, therefore making me continue my school education while feeling suicidal depressed. I have been trying to do whatever I can to get rid of the suicidal thoughts but it seems like I can't get through it without understanding what is really good for me and what is not. For people wondering whether I've gone to a psychiatrist or not, the answer to your question is that I have and sadly the educated psychiatrists were very bad at their jobs and thanks to that I am a very self-centered person who doesn't like to share anything with anyone else unless I know through observation that he/she knows what they are doing.

What I'd like to ask now is to receive the help I need in order to get over this madness without having to hurt myself or anyone else because of my feelings, I will appreciate whatever answer you will give as long as you do take this seriously. Thank you!",22Oct2017,1
4,"I have this weird, seemingly cyclical or irrational habit of getting ""triggered"" by something, usually small like ""he didn't say hello to me"" or ""I wasn't initially invited to this thing"" and then my brain starts compounding all of that and I get irrationally depressed. I will start hating myself and telling myself that no one loves me and that I am worthless.

The world starts to feel very closed in and small, and even if I know I should be thinking positive, I end up reverting back to negativity. The only time I can seem to reset these moods is if I sleep or get some reassurance, but I'm in a position now where I don't feel like I should even talk to anyone about these issues anymore because its just too much baggage to lay on my friends.

I feel like people pretend to kindness and that really I'm just an unlikable / unrespectable person, or at least not at all what I should be. 

How do I defeat this? Its destroying my entire life.",22Oct2017,1
5,"My father died of a rare form of cancer 4 years ago. I've been with the same man for 7 years now, and I'm lucky enough for my dad to have given his blessing of us getting married right before he died so we would know if we did decide to. We moved out of the house and my mom remarried 2 years ago. She is in love with him, which is so great I'm very happy for her that she's found someone who makes her feel like he does. But I haven't lived with them for 2 years now and I don't really feel very close to him as we only see them every now and again. Well now that the wedding is coming up I think she hoped I would ask him to walk me down the isle and dance with me. But it still hurts not having my father there and I'm going to have a hard enough time as it is keeping myself together with him not being there. I opted for my brother to walk me down the isle and to dance with my mom. Now she says she feels hurt I don't want to include him in the wedding but I'm not sure what I should do??",22Oct2017,1
6,I got in a nasty fight with my roommates about 5 days ago. Tonight they’re all having a party at one of my roommate’s girlfriends house. I wish so badly I could join them. I’m so tired of being alone in life but I’m too much of a pussy to ask because I know they’ll be not happy about me coming even if they say yes. ,22Oct2017,1
7,"Yes, yes, make fun if you will. But I hit it. I have hit a point of pure, unavoidable existential terror the likes of which I have never known.

I haven't eaten anything in four days. Anything at all. My nerves are such that even the blandest, most pointless foods do not sit.

So, to begin, here's where my life is in a paragraph.

I'm 28 years an ancient. My love life is decent, coming up on my fourth anniversary with a girl that I deeply love but worry over constantly due to her emotional state. My professional life is excellent as far as the outside world is concerned - more on that later. My social life is non existent - not due to work or anything, I just don't have any friends within two hundred miles of me. My physical health is decent - could always be better and I know this - and I have been dealing with a lifetime of depression - but otherwise I'm doing alright. I have a passion, one that I am totally enamored with, but I lack any confidence that I will ever succeed in it.  If I missed any categories, feel free to ask.

But I have this sense of DOOM. A terrible pall of meaninglessness hangs over me every moment of the day. I am totally and completely unfulfilled in my life and this morose sense of the pointlessness of everything has become overwhelming.

My mortal sin is envy. I am envious of everything and everyone I perceive to be higher than me, no matter if my judgments are realistic or not. I don't understand how others can succeed. I don't understand how they can live their dreams. I don't understand why they get to be so lucky.

Yet I know it's not luck. I know that they possess an inherent confidence, an ability to act that I do not. They are better at being a fully functional human being than I am.

So I ask you,

How do I get past paralyzing fear? How do I develop the discipline needed to live my dream? How do I banish self doubt to the point that I can effectively change my life and prevent the fear from holding me back? 

I don't have much time left to choose what I will be in life. I don't have much time left for anything.",22Oct2017,3
8,"I was just curious if anyone had any advice for dealing with missing someone who can no longer be apart of your life? 

I've lost some of the most important people in my life for various reasons (only 1 of which was death) within the last year and I've been struggling with how to cope with the pain of daily reminders of them. It doesn't help that I have diagnosed OCD, so keeping these thoughts from occurring is basically impossible.",22Oct2017,1
9,"I really like to draw. I believe that it is a healthy and productive activity to pass time. I would like to get good at drawing. The problem is that I only dabble in things. I'm a jack of many trades, but a master of none. I thought about it for a while and realized that, when it comes to things other than work and studies, I usually just do what I want to do. I don't force myself to complete tasks that don't really have to get done. I fount that recently it feels a lot like I **Can't** force myself to do these things. Of course, I realize that that's not true, and that thinking about this predicament this way will yield no beneficial results. So, other than telling myself ""Just Do It"" I don't really motivate myself. I believe I just lack the tools to entice myself to do the task.

I did try this one website: [10 Ways to do What You Want to do](https://zenhabits.net/unwanted/)

I wrote down some things corresponding to the 10 steps on the website. Reading what I wrote helped me get motivated for a couple days. I put myself in the same mindset as when I wrote it. Sadly, it stopped working. So, how do I motivate myself?

12,"So I'm a 25 year old guy, and all my life I've struggled with ADHD. It used to be much worse, but now it mostly affects me when I'm in a group of people. (I'm assuming this is due to ADHD, but it doesn't really matter if it is or isn't, as I'm not medicated nor interested in medications; been there, done that, no thanks. I'd rather this not turn into a debate about ADHD in general) People tend to think I'm drunk when I'm at a party even when I haven't been drinking. I get really energetic and I think overwhelming. It's like I get overloaded by the social stimulation.

The worst part is that it's started to really get to my wife. She's a wonderful woman who has always supported me, but after a party last night (where I got super out of hand) she sat me down and let me know that I'm a completely different person around that many people. That wouldn't be a huge issue except that it affects her ability to enjoy the party, because people are constantly telling her ""Your husband's doing this or that"" or ""How much has your husband had to drink?"" because they're concerned by my behavior. These comments are from friends who do care about me, so I'm sure they're well-intentioned. I just really want to know how I can calm down and be myself at these things. Has anyone else dealt with this? Where do I even begin to find strategies for being the same calm person I am at home or work?

TL;DR: I get super hyperactive around groups of people and need help calming down.",22Oct2017,3
13,"So a large group of friends decided to rent a house by the beach for the weekend and it's 3-4 hours drive to get there. Some of us have cars and some don't so we are going with a few cars and each car has 4-5 people and everyone in the car is going to share the gas and toll expenses of the trip. 
When the price was given out I understood it was X to go and X to back total of 2X to share by four. 

When I pass it on to those who were going with me they said it was a little expensive but nothing more than that, we had other things to do and agreed on discussing about it later today. Money is not an issue for me and told several times it was X to go and X to come back ( as I had understood). 

Honestly I was even considering paying for the whole damn thing but then suddenly I got this thought that none of them had told me I might be doing the wrong math. 

So to put my mind to ease I called the friend who was organizing all this and asked. He cleared all out for me and I called those friends who were going with to apologise and give the correct amount.

Without even letting me know two of them decided to simply find other rides and not telling.

I was indeed wrong but it was an honest mistake that none of them took time to explain where I was wrong. It was basically I gave them a value and the already were asking around how much others were charging. 

Even if they didn't if we spent only half of what I charged to get there and wasn't all of that of course I would give them back. I seriously don't need it.
When I decided to go I insisted for them to come with me cause I like them but now feels like they betrayed me. 

I don't usually hold a grudge against anyone for too long but this feels different and I'm afraid it's going to be the worst ride of all time of I'm feeling like that and I don't know what to do cause I really want to go. And I'm also afraid even after I apologise and correct my mistake they still leave me to go alone. ",22Oct2017,3
14,"I’m using lip balm, but don’t want to use too much and strip the natural oils. I drink 3-4 litres of water per day. I’m otherwise stumped as to why this is happening. Winter and summer, hot or cold. ",22Oct2017,1
16,"I am suffering from autism and dissociative disorder. I have suffered alot of abuse throughout the years of my life up until now. I have been sexually abused as a kid, i had a family member try to set me on fire when I was a little girl, I've been homeless throughout my childhood, bullied everyday, and all kinds of trauma. So I believe all this abuse and trauma has screwed me up psychologically because I find that I daydream alot and when I am around people I get paranoid with fear and then I can't concentrate. Being around people just makes me nervous. I guess I can call what I have is PTSD or dissociative disorder? I don't know what to call it but I know that my concentration is bad and I'm extremely existentially depressed all the time.

Please don't suggest signing up for social security because it is a long, arduous process to go through and I don't want social security, anyway. Bad enough alot of people call me the R-word (the slur people use to demean ""slow people""), so I don't need to further stigmatize myself by getting on social security. I already feel like a waste of protoplasm, so I will feel even more worthless if I got on social security.

I am about to make 26 on Christmas Eve and I have never really held down a ""real"" job. I can't pass a damn job interview to literally save my worthless life  because I find it hard to come up with answers to the fake scripted questions they ask you, plus I can't speak very well because of my autism. I really cant pass a job interview especially if the interview is for some mediocre minimum wage soul-crushing job, like at Wal-Mart or Target, that I dont want and that I dont have a choice but to get because I lack the skills to get a much better job. It is impossible for me to come up with genuine answers for a company that I really dont care about and I believe that the fact that I don't care shows during the interviews. Plus I have a hard time articulating myself verbally because of my autism. It's hard to type/write, too, but it's much easier than speaking as it gives me time to pause, gather my feelings so I can translate them into words and correct mistakes. When I try to communicate it's like my thoughts and feelings move at the speed of light, faster than I can speak or write/type. It's frustrating and I think I sound like a babbling idiot at these job interviews. 

My family calls me stupid because I can't pass a job interview. I got the job at the Neutrogena distribution center in LAX because I didn't have to do a job interview for them because all they do is recruit people like test monkies, send you to get a drug test and if you pass the test then you just go to work the next day. The Neutrogena factory has a high turnover rate and I used to see a lot of new people working there almost every day. It seems like I was the only idiot there that was stuck there because I'm too stupid to pass a job interview so I can get a real steady permanent job even if it's a job at Target or Walmart until I can go to school to get the skills I need to get my dream career in science and engineering. I just lost the job at Neutrogena for bickering back at a bully coworker who was threatening my life while at the same time calling me the R-word.

If Neutrogena had me do a ""real"" job interview (all they asked me was can I lift 20lbs and can I work fast) then I wouldnt have got that job because I dont know how to come up with answers on the spot to the questions they ask you at minimum wage jobs. I really dont know what to do anymore, I think I am just destined to be stuck at dead end warehouse/general labor jobs. My cousin has changed so many jobs within a month, and she worked at Jamba Juice, Walgreen's, Five Guys, Bath and Body Works and I am just sitting over here wondering what in the fuck am I doing wrong to where these employers at minimum wage jobs don't call me back??? It's frustrating. I mean some of these employers make you feel like you're applying to work at the Central Intelligence Agency with the stuff they ask you. When the employer asks, ""do you have any questions?"" then that's when I ask questions about the company because I know that they want to know if I'm interested in their company; I know they want me to ask, ""What's the ethos here at this company like?""

When the employer asks me ""why do you want to work here?"" I know they want me to give them an answer that shows that I am genuinely interested in their company, but what I really want to say is, ""Oh ever since I was a wee lass I've always aspired to slave over hot greasy burgers in a hot greasy kitchen and get yelled at by asshole customers who treat me like shit because I can't accept their expired coupons"". I feel like job interviews are all a circus act. It feels like auditioning for American Idol at job interviews. They ask you these questions KNOWING you're going to bullshit them. They know no one wants to stock store shelves for a living, they know people just want the job so they can eat and have a roof over their heads. I think they just get off on dicking people around. I'm so depressed and frustrated. I do know how to answer some of the interview questions but overall I still suck at interviews. 

I'm so lost.

17,"Nothing was stolen from my house (as far as I know), but there was evidence that someone had been in my room. I live with my parents but my room was the only place with evidence of a break-in. 
I do have an ex that is obsessed with me and is very mentally unstable. Stalking isn't totally off the table for them, but the person also seemed to go into my attic, which would be strange for my ex to do if they were just interested in getting info on me. They also haven't done anything of this caliber before, so this would be a major escalation.

None of the doors had been forced, but they must have come in rather quickly because there was only a 30 minute window of time when no one was home. This also means they may have been watching me as I left. 

If it was my ex, I would think they would want me to be home instead of showing up to an empty house. 

Anyway, I wanna hear your theories on what the motivation might have been if not theft, and how they managed to get inside without forcing the lock. I also want to know of some things I should look for that someone might not think of after a break in.

20,"**TL;DR I'm trying to figure out why I continued inviting people out that didn't want to hangout w/me, and what I can do to fix this as I move to a new city. I want to always have invites on my phone and figure out how to not be the one pushing fun, but for it to be more 50/50 with people. **

*Sorry this is a long one- please read it if you can. I address a few potential causes, and I'm looking for a self-help book to read or something like this because I want to dive deeper into myself and solve this issue- now writing about it, I've realized my life has almost always been like this: me promoting and doing stuff (which people often enjoy and have lots of fun) 80% of the time, and getting invited out less than 20% of the time. *

Hey all, I lived in the Phoenix area for a year, and met quite a few friends and we had a LOT of fun. I left for two months to travel during the HOT summer, and when I came back for a month I didn't feel like anyone had a whole lot of desire to hangout with me...

I was expecting a lot of hangouts, parties, adventures, etc. but it was... not so exciting. It took a week or two to get invited out. I was ALWAYS the one sending texts out, trying to do things. 

I understand people initially had plans- but I felt like I was being undervalued, or perhaps that the friendships weren't so amazing as I thought they were. In fact, coming back home I hung MORE with NEW people than I did my OLD friends!! It was like a whole new experience of Phoenix... 

I'm leaving again in 3 days. This time I don't feel like coming back. I'm just curious as to what this could potentially mean, and how I can fix this: for example am I being needy, or perhaps were my expectations greater than reality? Assuming that my friends didn't value me as much as I did them, what are some ways to go about preventing this from happening in the future? 

I'll be living in Budapest for 3 months, and just like where I was before (Montreal summer) I want to create an incredible social circle. I want to have people texting me, like I text them. I have the mental capability to remember to text people and keep doing things- I want to improve myself so I cut out people that aren't hanging with me quicker. 

Looking back, I feel like this scenario has happened my whole life. Traveling is probably just now bringing it to light. I've tried to do some research on this, but I can't find anything on my favorite authors and Google pops up BS news blogs with horrible writing/advice. 

I want to read a book or look deep into this- WHY did I keep texting people (I leave PHX in 3 days) that would NEVER hangout? Why didn't I get the hint sooner? How can I adapt so I cut through people that don't value me quicker? I guess the only important thing I need to know is why I'm doing this, and how I can fix this.

I forgot to do this, but I was considering doing a ""no-texting"" week or something just to statistically measure the invites I got. Sometimes negative self-beliefs can cause us to believe things that aren't true, and while I didn't acquire analytical evidence, I'm 99% confident that it is truly me not being invited out, rather than me forgetting all of the times I've been invited out.
  
So- what actionable things can I do or great self-help socializing books can I read that will paint fresh perspectives on WHY I've allowed this to happen, and WHAT can I personally do to create a better social circle that values me? ",22Oct2017,1

I love this cat to death, I'm at college right now and miss my own cat, so Austin is a great addition to my life. Unfortunately, Austin has fleas and it's super annoying to him and to us.

He is often scratching, and today he sneezed a lot as well. The fleas get all over blankets and stuff too and it's kinda gross.

I'm worried because it's been around a week since we last saw any treatment on him, and it doesn't seem to be getting better. His neck is covered with scabs and we have to keep him out of the room.

It's hard to talk to the roommate cause he and my boyfriend don't talk often and he's not always around when we are.

32,"So last night was a late night for me - my friends and I went to an amusement park and then came back to my place to watch movies, and I ended up getting to bed super late.    

Anyway, today I was laying bed bed watching a movie, drinking some coffee to wake myself up, and having a sugary snack. My mom comes in and starts taking my stuff away. I told her not to touch my stuff. She gets mad at me for drinking coffee when I'm ""still sick,"" (I had a sore throat a week ago) but leaves my room in a huff, grumbling at me.  

I leave my room to go do something, come back in. My balcony door is all the way open, the curtains on my windows are all drawn, including the one I always leave closed because the neighbors can see me laying in bed through that window.   

My mom moving things around in my room has always been a sore spot for us. I keep asking her not to touch things, she never listens. I've tried to explain that I feel like I'm old enough to decide whether I'd like the curtains drawn or my windows open, and since I'm going to be spending time in my room it should be up to how warm/cold I am, since it doesn't really affect anyone else in my family. She's acknowledged that, but keeps doing it. I'll wake up in the morning to things moved around in my room, or I'll come home from school and see her phone or wine glass sitting in a corner.  

Well tonight I was making dinner, left the pan on, went downstairs to wait for it to cook. My mom immediately yells at me to come back because my food is apparently done. It's not, but the pasta I was reheating was had smash marks in it from her checking to see if it was finished (after I had just left).  

It really bothered me at that point that she isn't able to back off. I'm 17, I'm applying to college (out of state I might add) and I feel like these things keep building and it's driving me crazy.  

When I saw the pasta, I made an annoyed face, an audible groan, and then walked downstairs. My dad called me back and told me how predictable I am, and that I only act all huffy when I'm tired, kind of implying that he shouldn't have let me out last night. I didn't want to start an argument, so I didn't say anything, and I wouldn't even have known what to say, because at this point they think nothing I say is valid.  

Well I went back downstairs to let my dinner cook more, came back upstairs, and noticed that the stove had been turned off and my pasta was about 80% done. Idk, I still ate it, but that just felt like another jab at me after I already told her I was watching my food and asked her not to touch it.   

But they are kind of right. I am super tired, and although these things bother me, they're bothering me more today than usual. Should I let it pass until tomorrow, since I probably won't care as much, or should I talk to them about it? Am I being too sensitive?

34,"Ok, So i posted my first ever item on Ebay and it sold withing an hour for the buy it now price. The buyer immediately msgs me thru Ebay asking when I'm going to ship. I tell them in the morning, it seemed kinda odd just the way he was talking in his emails. Anyway, I call Ebay they say yea ship it, payment has been sent. Ok, cool so I tell the buy I'll ship in the am. I check my Paypal later that night and the payment still wasnt there. So, I call paypal and tell them what was up and they say no payment has been sent to my acct, and not to ship. They also said after reading the email correspondence that it was a MEFT transfer, manual electronic funds transfer and that this particular type of transaction was coming from Germany and is the only type of transaction that can be stop or cancelled with 3-5 days. So, I send the buyer a message basically telling them I knew they were trying to scam me. Especially after the buyer telling me that I need to verify my acct and in order to do that I need to ship first and wait 3-5 days. I've never used Paypal but was pretty certain that wasn't the case. TO make a long story short, I just got an email from paypal that the payment was recieved. So, I checked paypal and sure enough the payment was there. My question is can the payment be cancelled at this point? If I send the product and give paypal the tracking info will the payment be released? Is the payment frozen essentially until I either ship or don't ship?


TL;DR Posted an item on ebay, it sold withing an hr. In msgs with the buyer I got a little suspicious. So, I called eBay they said ""send it, that the payment was received.""..I wait and check Paypal no payment, so I call Paypal they say ""It's a good chance the buyer is trying to scam and not to ship.""

She's been dating him for four years.  Regardless, she just tole me on the phone tonight that she's been dreading the wedding, is freaking out that she's gotten married too fast, and that she can't talk to him about her fears.  She hasn't told our parents, but some things she said to me struck me as incredible red flags, such as:

* ""I don't feel like we can talk about everything.""
* ""I never got to live on my own.""
* ""I'm not sure who I am, I was twenty yesterday and now I'm twenty-four.""
* ""Sometimes with him it feels like I live with a roommate.""

As her brother, I want her to be happy, but since the wedding is a week away (involving many people flying from across the country), I'm not sure what, if anything I should do for her.

36,"i’ve [20/f] been friends with this girl [21/f] since the 6th grade. we went to same middle school and high school together. we go through times where we don’t talk for months at a time, and then get close for a month, and then don’t talk again. she’s super selfish and absolutely full of herself. (example: she thought her brother had a drug problem and then made it all about her.)

this past saturday, i tried to make plans with her for brunch for tuesday, and she never responded about it until the night before — but by this time, i already made plans with my boyfriend. 

so my birthday was today, and she sends me this shitty, passive ass text message along the lines of, “happy birthday sorry I'm not home to celebrate. you also haven't answered me all week. have a great day.” apparently we talked more about it on saturday when i met up with her at the bar, but i didn’t remember. so then she messages me, “it's fine I've just been competing for your attention when I shouldn't have to I'm your friend to.... unless something's changed and I wasn't informed.”

i’m so sick of childish games with her. she never hits me up first, so idk what the fuck she’s even referencing to when she says she’s competing for my attention. and it’s not like she was only in town for this week. she lives like 10 minutes away and we could easily reschedule it.

39,"Hi all,

So I'm trying to change my habits of being late to everything. I'm usually late places by 1-5 minutes, and more rarely 5-10 minutes, but it's still annoying to my friends and frankly quite stressful for me! Shockingly ^(/s), being late to everything doesn't tend to win you friends or professional recommendations.

Here are things I am currently doing:

1. Laying out things beforehand. Packing my bag, putting my phone/keys/jacket in an easy grab-and-go spot, etc.
2. Rounding up how long it takes to get somewhere. Usually to an even number on a ten. The problem with this is I don't always account for traffic.
3. Getting ready as well as i can a while before I leave and then sitting down until it actually is time to leave. This helps somewhat with the problem I describe below, but not totally.

Now. Part of my problem (the one I describe in point 3) is that i have anxiety, so I sometimes struggle even getting out of bed, especially if I'm going to something I'm nervous about. I've sometimes spent a while standing in front of the mirror feeling overall nervous and then all of a sudden I'm no longer running early. So I'm wondering if anyone has any tips about dealing with that sort of thing. I've been talking to my counsellor too but it always helps to get input from more sources, right? I also hate arriving early to places if I'll be the first one there because I have even more anxiety about being alone in places than getting out the door in the first place, so that doesn't help.

^(My family also has lateness issues (mostly because of my dad, who is late to everything except for work because he's been going for years to the same place at the same times and has an ironclad routine)^(, so I'm hoping other people here know what that's like. &gt;.&lt;; The ""just one more article"" or ""I can do one more small task"" or ""omg I just realized I *need* to do this thing before I leave"" is real! But while my dad is one of those people who has attention, discipline and time management issues and compensates by just being late and stressed about it ~~and/or yelling at whichever family member sat back down 5 minutes after we were supposed to leave but didn't want to stand around waiting and now we're not walking out the door at the exact arbitrary minute he wants, or whoever is driving is not driving fast enough for his liking, or didn't pass that one slow car that sped up every time we tried to pass or etc.~~, I want to be different.)",22Oct2017,1

43,"I should preface this by saying my parents have always been sort of strict on video games. I was not allowed to play on school days at all during much of my childhood.

Now before my first semester of college, they were going to refuse to let me take my Xbox. We reached a deal where they reluctantly let me take it, but insisted we check on grades halfway through semester.

Today was that day, and I have an A, two B’s a C, and an F that I’m working to pull up. Time management in college is still in the learning stage for me.

Today, they said the logical punishment is to forcefully take my Xbox from me.

I also should mention I own my Xbox entirely, paid for entirely by me, but my parents are paying for college. I’m tired of being treated like a child when I’m expected to do adult things and have adult responsibilities. If I’m going to be expected to be an adult, shouldn’t I be able to make my own adult choices? The rub is that they are “invested” in my college, however.

I don’t think taking my Xbox will affect my grades, however. I have a laptop (not gaming) and Netflix, so what stops me from just doing those things? Obviously I would not actively idle any more then I would with my Xbox.

Any advice on how to approach?

47,"For a very long time, I've felt like I've been unable to feel love for people. I love my friends and my family deeply, but only because I always have, it's endured through making new emotional connections. Been through many relationships that ended quickly because I simply didn't love them. Over the span of my early teenage years to now, in my early twenties, I just never felt anything strongly for anyone. Now, however, I met a guy that I clicked with immediately, and I feel like there might be something. Be it a budding close friendship or something else, I like him a lot. The issue is that he has the same kind of problem I do about finding love for people, I think due to a lot of betrayals from partners. I told him about all my breakups that I caused, making me seem very cold, and hence maybe making him think I'd do that to him. At the time, I thought I probably would. I just find myself thinking a lot about other guys, and being completely repulsed by the thought of messing around with them, because my head goes to this new guy and how he would feel. I don't even care to talk to any other guys I'd been talking to. I'm not sure how to process these kind of emotions, and I'm not sure what this guy feels for me, if anything at all. I just know that if it was nothing to him, I would be crushed.

52,"Me and my friends often go to laser tag to hang out at Laser Tag every Saturday as our ""going out"" night, we had played against a group of people who were good sports about playing and we had began talking to this one guy who seemed really nice and was very talkative (for the sake of anonymity let's just refer to him as John). 

We start talking and we exchange contact info and eventually we start meeting for laser tag with him and his cousin (sometimes his brother or friends would also tag along too), and then we'd head over to McDonalds afterwards for something to eat. Over the last couple of months its been limited to laser tag, and attending some social outings together and I think all my friends have enjoyed John's company in our circle of friends.

Flash forward to today, my close friend messages me on Facebook saying we need to talk about John. I say can we just talk about it through messenger and he says no, we need to speak through voice chat on Discord. So I come on and the first thing he says for me to do is look up his name on Google...and the first things that appear are trial hearings and accusations of sexual assault on a couple news sites (it was actually my friends mom who came across those articles not him).

I'm going to be honest when I first saw it I didn't want to believe it was true, but when I saw his photo and his exact face it just confirmed everything. Although it dates back to 2015, the most recent article turned out to be something about his trial date...written in June of this year); and me and his friends had met him and his group of friends in the 2nd last week of August.

One of the article lines talks about how he is not allowed to be in the company of anyone male or female under the age of 17, unless John's in the presence of a surety. Now me and my other friend are okay since we're over 20, but the family friends that tag along are under 17 (one's 16, and his younger brother is 14), and my dad will come along to make sure they get home safe and sound (driving us all). The weird thing though apparently we actually have connections with his parents (turned out his mom was our mail lady and we didn't even know, and a whole bunch of other family connections that go way back).

Now before all this I was wondering why John didn't really talk about his job or whatever, he just said that he had done choir singing so I had just assumed he just sung for a living...that is until I found out that he had previously been a music teacher at a school, at least up until he was charged (allegations of sexual touching, sexual interference and sexual assault). Now John doesn't have his teaching license revoked, but he was ""assigned"" to live with a surety in his hometown...which is actually my hometown, although to my knowledge he isn't living there currently.

Now for me I'm not concerned (quite yet, and I'm not sure if I should or shouldn't be) and I haven't told my parents at all, nor have I even thought to tell my younger family friends because I don't think they need to know as I'm sure it would cause a lot of panic since they are a little bit younger (plus their mother is the type to get extremely defensive if anything were to happen to her kids, hell hearing that he had been charged might set her off). My other friends mother who had originally found the articles had also said to maybe take everything from the articles with a grain of salt...but I'm not sure?

On the other hand there aren't a whole lot of articles written about (only about 4-5 I could find over the past 3 years, one of the articles was really unstructured and it was clearly written with the intent of calling John out, had his real name and everything as clear as day; it was a really badly formatted site so I just omitted that, but the rest we're professional sources.

Me and my friends have talked about doing some more social outings with him and his cousin, but now that I know this I'm really unsure? Should me and my friends be concerned with John's status? I'm really conflicted because John and his friends and cousin are genuinely fun to be around, but knowing what I know know does concern me a little bit... 

Should I be concerned, or cautious? Maybe I'm overthinking this...but I've tried looking up as much as I could about him and so far a lot of it hasn't really been confirmed for sure (simply put it's mostly been accusations).

The Rundown of what we I know from doing some research:
2015
-Arrested following a complaint of sexual assault by a male student
-a judge placed two publication bans on the case (which eventually had his name released this year in a few news outlets)
-The police said he was arrested without incident
-Police believed there were other victims (but unverified)
 
2017
-John was identified with another teacher are dealing with criminal charges 
-John pleaded not guilty to the sexual assault charges back in may, while the other teacher who was charged did in fact plead guilty (voyeurism)
-His teaching certificate is still in good standing at the time of writing this, albeit with a few conditions/limitations (like having a surety).",22Oct2017,1

She has lived here for 17 years, the property has been owned by a few different places since she moved in. The newest landlords are pieces of crap. The house has wear and tear on it and they don't fix anything. She has holes in her floor, she has rotting sub floor because of water underneath the house, there's a hole in the roof, there is plumbing issues, electrical issues and all around it's just falling apart. She does NOT have a lease. They never made her sign one when they bought the properties from the bank. So where does she stand? I don't know anything about this but I was hoping that maybe someone here knew a little about landlord responsibilities. Most recently, he sent a drug addict named Willie to fix her plumbing and from what she told me, he cases her house every time he's there.

I am shy and anxious, just like he is. We share many similarities and interesting things. I couldn't get over what happened in the past, and I got mad at him for calling me out to be a hypocrite in which I was, that I had ""quit "" a game, when I said that person said he did but didn't.

57,"I am 24 years old. I suffer from chronic stress, depression, lack of self-esteem, irritability, anger, and anxiety. I believe my family situation is the root of all of this dysfunction in myself and I am tired of it. I'm tired of living like this. I feel like a fraud when dealing with my family since I do not genuinely enjoy interacting with them. My heart feels empty, my love is barren, and my resentment is high. 

I was emotionally abused by my brother for years between the ages of 17-23. Living with him was a nightmare and I have left home just to escape the situation. He is 30 years old, has never left my parents' home, has no career, and couldn't even finish college in 10 years. He blames my parents for his entire life then continues to live off of them like a leech. When threatened, he threatens my parents with his own suicide. He is seriously paranoid and a massive conspiracy theorist. He is so paranoid that he locks his bedroom when he leaves the house or goes to sleep. 

He is abusive towards my parents, as well, and they are complicit in his abuse. My parents are absolutely clueless on how to be good parents. There are no boundaries, no consequences, no respect, and no family values. I do not believe I have been taught anything of value from my parents. I do not believe them. I do not trust them. I do not respect them. 

A few weeks ago, I had a very strong realization that I had to sever ties between myself and my brother. I made the decision and I informed my family that I was moving out because I could not tolerate my brother any longer. Even my mom told me she thought I was ""making the right decision."" 

Now, I feel as though I need to leave my parents behind, too. My relationship with them is still tethered to my brother. If I go home to visit, I have to consider the fact that he will be there. When I do visit, I have an unshakeable feeling of mistrust, dread, and resentment towards my mom and dad. I have tried many times in the past to speak with them and have them do something about the situation. Each time they tell me they ""understand"" and several times my father has told me he would do something. And every time my father lies to me and doesn't do a thing. They don't listen to me, they don't take my seriously, and they don't respect me. 

I feel like I am constantly drinking poison just by being around them. My life becomes more miserable every time I have to deal with them and I honestly believe that I would rather spend holidays by myself than with them.

Initially people seem to like me and be open to me. Then after we talk for a while they grow colder and colder until they avoid me.

The reasons I can think of: I am shy and therefore very guarded, also many times I speak in a way that I REALIZE was kinda rude but it's just the way it comes out of my mouth and I catch myself after I already said it.

Example:

My roommate went on a tour of the uni for new students (I already know the place) and when she came back she said ""there is no way I can remember everything, this place is huge"" and I said: ""Well you will remember better after going to classes not just going to a stupid tour"" -- I guess this one is not that bad, but I feel like... why did I have to say ""a stupid tour""? I didn't even feel anything negative about it, but the way I speak makes me sound really negative...

Also I don't know how to make good small talk even after 4 years of customer service so there's that...

64,"Ok so I will have to get a job in 9 months and there are two scenarios I have. I just want to hear what other people might think so I know I’m not crazy. 

The two scenarios will play out as listed below, but essentially I am currently applying to Job B and waiting to see if I can get the job. Job A I have yet to apply to, but for reasons I don’t need to go into, is essentially mine if I choose to apply to it. Job C is one that I have interviewed for and I know they like me, but don’t yet know if I have the job. 
Applying/Interviewing for any of these jobs does not affect any of the others.

Scenario 1:
I have to pick between Job A and Job B.
Job A: I make $800,000 to &gt;1,000,000. The job is in a small town of 100,000 where it so happens I have a lot of extended family. I don’t hate my family, but I don’t know if I want to live in a small town with them. It so happens that my parents will want to retire in this city and want me to take this job. Me and my GF will likely end up having kids here (I don’t really want kids) if I move here. My sister and family live about 1 hr flight away and my parents will likely retire to live with me in an in-law suite (I’m ok with this). Since I am under 40, this location being in the middle of nowhere will mean that I will be spending my best years in a shitty town with little to do.
Job B: I make $600,000+. The job is 45minutes outside a major city and I could potentially live on the outskirts of the major city. This would be a less desirable job to my parents but they will still be ok with it. Potentially my GF and I will not have to have kids if we live here (this is a plus to me). I will live 1.5 hours drive from my sister and family. My parents will probably not retire to live with me but I will likely buy them a house close to my sister (I’m ok with this).

Scenario 2:
I have to pick between Job A (as outlined above) and Job C.
Job C: I make $350,000. The job is 45 mins outside a bigger city than Job B, but this place is a 6 hour flight from my sister. My parents will not like me picking this place. Although I won’t get paid as much, there will be a lot more things to do, go out to eat etc here. My pre the will not retire with me here, and although I will probably still buy them a house near my sister, it will obviously take me longer.

I hope that I only have to choose from Scenario 1, but if Job B does not pan out, I may be looking at Scenario 2.",22Oct2017,1

My job is 85% writing emails and dealing with whiney people. It honestly isn't too terrible but I think it's mostly tolerable because it isn't too stressful. 

I had lived in this city once before and had a bad experience, so I was hesitant to move back here. I did so because my SO has family here. Basically I've completely lost contact with all my friends. I had a great social circle where I was living before.

I have one friend who happens to live here who I'd been hanging out with quite a bit. I'd also met some of his friends through him. I realized I was always the one initiating and so I stopped texting him so much and I don't see him much anymore.

For a while I didn't vibe very well with my coworkers - they're all super gregarious, loud and extroverted and so I often felt out of place. I tried my best to find common ground and I'd thought I was doing ok. I'd also been spending a bit of time with some friends who were here over the summer for internships. 

Anyway, the other day at lunch we started talking about dressing up for halloween and one of my coworkers asked what I wanted to be. My other coworker interjected saying ""don't you have to actually go and do something to dress up for Halloween?"". It created this super awkward silence and another coworker said ""well you can dress up for Halloween with your cat.."" Obviously the implication was that I don't have any friends and that I'm a loser. I was kind of hurt by this since I'd thought this coworker as a potential friend and I'd seen him outside of work a few times. Anyway since then I've felt pretty uncomfortable at work and I've kind of resigned caring about this job.

My SO's family wants to see us constantly and it's not good for my mental health, and I'm finding being the ""supporter"" in the the relationship stressful. I don't care for the job and I just feel uncomfortable around my coworkers who I guess see me as a loser. If I quit the job my resume will look terrible and I'll also have to deal with the mess from the lease I'm stuck in. I also have no jobs lined up back home. At the same time, my mental health is really deteriorating here.

He also might be a little old for me which I'm not concerned about, but it does mean that his flirting could just be friendliness.

70,"I suffer from frequent nightmares that leave me feeling scared and on edge for days after, causing me to not sleep well. They are usually all different but have similar themes such as gruesome deaths that I witness but can't prevent, someone trying to torture and kill me, or running away from something but my voice is gone. I don't know of anything aside from sexual assault as a kid that would cause PTSD, and I am not on any medications. I feel like I might go crazy if I keep having these horrible nightmares.

72,"I'm 20 years old, and I'm just now trying to get into digital art. The reason I'm doing it is because I don't really know what else to do. I quit school because I didn't feel that I was smart enough to earn a degree. I hate my job because it doesn't feel meaningful. The only thing that feels real to me anymore is drugs, pain or art, and I'm really bad at art. I seem to have good taste, but everything I make is just garbage. I don't know what to do because I have to care about something. If I'm not doing something I care about I want to take drugs and self harm, or just sleep. I just want to know that it's worth my time to keep trying. I haven't told my friends and family what I'm doing with my time. For all they know I'm spending my free time watching TV and getting high. I don't want to share the things I make until I'm confident that someone will actually like it. I'll share my work anonymously from time to time, and people tend to absolutely hate it. I've actually received suicide threats from people because of how bad it is. I guess I'm just hoping that someone will have lived through what I've lived through and have a good idea of what's best for me. I know my life is great. I know I don't have real problems. I know I have nothing to complain about. I should go fuck myself just for being a straight white male. Maybe the most meaningful thing I'll ever do with my life is end it.

74,"I'm a senior in high school and all my life I've felt like everybody sees me as a ""goody two shoes"". I've never done anything illegal (other than going past curfew a few times), and I'm a nice and socialable person in school. As a result, I've become quite popular as being a ""good guy"" that everybody likes.

However, I've started to resent this image. I sometimes feel like people don't talk to me because they like real me, they just like the image of me and want to be seen with the ""popular dude"". I've become quite annoyed at the attention I receive and how people view me as the nice guy. I feel like it negatively affects my dating game slightly and people don't take me as seriously. I've grown to dislike the image I've created for myself over the past year.

I've often joked with people about me smoking pot, vaping, drinking, or doing any other bad thing because I want a more ""bad boy"" image. I have also considered actually doing these illegal things as well, but I know that I would do them only to ruin my good image, not because I actually want to.

So I have run into this problem a few times in the past few years. 

For example: I am at a baseball game and I am going to get food. My friend asks if I can get him a hot dog. He then hands me his debt card. 

I do not like having other peoples cards on me or trying to use them. It gives me a great deal of anxiety that I will be accused of trying to steal.

How do I explain this to people? It's enough to freak me out and make me just by my friends food myself instead of using their card.

82,"so this weekend  a bunch of friends came into town from college and we had a great time partying on Friday. While at this party I overheard a couple of people talking about a fire they were going to have I asked them what fire and they quickly said ""don't worry about it"". I then kind of forgot about it until the next morning when we were getting breakfast and again I here someone (different than the people who I overheard before) mention a fire and again I ask what fire. And they promptly say ""don't worry about it"". I brush it off until I get home and one of the other guys messages me asking if people were acting strange about this ""fire"". I told him what I heard and after asking the guys who were acting weird about a fire they said that they were ""definitely not having a fire"" so trusting my friends we believe them later on we all decided to get dinner afterwords me and a couple of the guys (one of which was the guy who texted me earlier) decided to actually have a fire but all the people who were acting weird all said they were tired and wanted to go home and sleep. we still decided to have this fire. While there we happen to look at snap maps and all of them were together at someones house(presumably having a fire). So I screenshot and send it in this group chat we have with everyone  in it. There response was that they did not want to have a big get together and that we were assholes for snooping in there business. so my question is am I an asshole? ",22Oct2017,3
83,"This semester I have a new roommate from India. He's a really nice guy and we get along but I just cannot take how the room smells anymore. I have to keep the window open all the time and when I come back from a long day, the last thing I want to smell is what's in my room/closet. I don't know how to approach him about the problem, so what should I do?

Here's the interesting part: he actually seems very clean. He takes 1-2 showers per day (more than me on average most likely). He does laundry way more often than seems necessary, and his clothes are all clean and folded. The really weird thing is it seems that after the shower he actually smells at his worst. I looked at he soap he uses, but it's just a regular body soap that is fine and smells like nice. The same effect is with his clothes. I grabbed one of his left over clothes in the dryer, and it absolutely reeked of the same smell, like so bad the dryer had to be aired out. He asked me for detergent before so I assume he uses regular detergent etc... The smell is pretty much a BO smell but has a bit of a twist to it, I'm not going to go into detail about it. I asked my other suitemates and they all notice it too.

That's the biggest problem, I can't do anything subtle like ask him to shower or do laundry more, because it seems like these actually make the smell way worse than if he just like got dirty lol. I really don't know what the problem could be or how to approach it. Is it diet? He mostly eats fast food/goes out to eat. Is it genetic? Cultural? I can smell it if we're outside walking too. 

Any advice would be appreciated on how to approach this, otherwise it's going to be a long year. Thanks",22Oct2017,30
85,"Some family members do this to me. It's hard to be comfortable around them. When I am comfortable and opening myself up, they always have something subversive, or backhanded to say. Especially when it's around someone new and doesn't know me. They act nice, but I get a sense they have a grudge against me. My sister can hold a grudge for years, and I use to trust her with my issues but it just seems like she tells everyone. 

I've gotten the reputation in the family for ""overreacting"" when I dig into what they are doing and put it out into the open. Now, I'm the complainer or weird one. It has worked a few times with me when I ranted or defended myself. 

How do I deal with all of this, it's like I want revenge. They always try to make me look stupid. It doesn't matter what I do they succeed. Deep down I just want to be with family and enjoy myself, but this is getting to be too much and I began avoiding them. It's hard to reason with them. 

Sad part is, I'm a 32 year old man, and it's getting tiring fighting this and not stooping to their level. I suck at stooping to these peoples level and the game itself. They are just so good at gossip and playing it nice. It's white trash, and fucking creepy.

90,"I'm 19 and I go to a public university.

In high school, I didn't care much about getting a girlfriend. Kinda was just okay with playing video games all day and just hanging out with my friend group.

Kinda felt the same for my first year of college, didn't care much. But it wasn't until I realized that all of my dorm-mates, and pretty much a very large margin of people at my school who are my age have either had a girlfriend or have had sex. 

This realization made me feel really anxious and just desperate to get a girlfriend or have sex. I feel like time is running out, as I am 19 already and have no experience whatsoever. I'm afraid that if I wait any longer, girls won't want to date me because they've all experienced guys already and they probably don't want some guy who's never even held a girl's hand.

I've joined many clubs throughout my time in college so far, and yet I never got a girlfriend or even really became close friends with any. 

One of the clubs is a social club where all we do is hang out and go to do volunteer events. I'm apart of a family in the club, which contains about 20 people. So we're all pretty close, i guess, but all of the girls who I would consider even remotely attractive are already dating someone.

The other clubs are pretty social too, and same deal. All the girls have boyfriends already.

I mean, I know I shouldn't be acting picky at this point, but I also don't want my first girlfriend to be with someone who I just don't see myself being with, you know? 

Gah this is so hard. I just don't know what to do. It really feels like 95% of the girls in college are already taken. I definitely don't want to join a frat. But I've already joined some social clubs and nothing's happening. Idk what to do.

92,"My mom’s family is quite wealthy and is used to getting almost everything she wants handed to her. In reality, she deserves almost nothing she has but since she has so many “accomplishments” she thinks she’s really smart. She has a really simple way of thinking, and just lacks a lot of logic so growing up with her was always difficult since arguing with her went nowhere.

My dad’s family on the other hand is quite intelligent so my siblings and I always joke around about how someone so smart ended up marrying someone so dumb (although my dad insists that my mom wasn’t this incompetent before and that she just got worse over time). However over time, eventually enough was enough and my parents split up a few years ago. Now, my mom has a new boyfriend and I honestly think they’re perfect for each other as the guy is extremely patient and doesn’t mind explaining literally everything to my mom, and he isn’t looking for someone highly intelligent, just someone he can pamper and bring to his events with him (like a pet! joke). My mom, on the other hand enjoys her new lifestyle where she has no responsibilities and can live as a housewife and spend on anything she wants. Not that my dad’s family is struggling financially or anything, but my dad didn’t want to live lavishly and had a lot of expectations for my mom as a housewife e.g. managing our household, making sure my siblings and I are doing well in school, etc. My mom failed miserably at this, as her weak logic skills weren’t able to help her plan anything effectively.

I feel like my life is harder than others because I have to be figure out how to solve my own problems and do things myself. This sounds like a good thing but honestly I would really love to just have a mother because at times I’m her mother and I just feel like it’s a lot of responsibility for me to raise a 40+ year old woman plus finish high school and apply to uni myself.

Key traits about my mom that drives me insane:

* **Extremely forgetful.** She’s only in her late 40’s and she forgets about conversations I’ve had with her less than 5 minutes ago.
* **Extremely bad temperament.** My mother’s really kind to my brother and I but she unconsciously treats anybody else like shit. Screams at drivers and maids, calls them stupid, swears at them, always accuses them of stealing.
* **Believes literally everything anyone tells her.** We don’t live in America but if we did I’m 100% sure my mom would’ve voted for Donald Trump. My mom believes in all the conspiracy theories, including some outrageous ones like how the Rothschilds are reptiles (???) or that we have a limited number of enzymes in our stomach so taking enzyme pills will let us live longer. She genuinely believes that she’s part of a small percentage of the population that knows the secrets of this world others would find outrageous (queue the conspiracy theories) and that she must pass on these things she’s learned to me.
* **Literally so dumb.** My mom pretty much failed school but since she comes from a wealthy family all the jobs she’s ever worked were handed to her. But then again her dad never let her stay in a company for more than a year since every company of his she’s ever managed somehow gets worse. Actually believes chain messages and passes the message on. Oh, and she believes every bit of fake news and makes sure to send it to our entire family group chat.
* **Picks fights with everybody.** My mom’s incredibly rude and pushy so her friends don’t really stay friends with her for long or end up just distancing themselves from her so they don’t have to see her often. Growing up, my mom had a reputation among my friends’ parents at school as a crazy woman, as she’d criticize other parents’ parenting skills and force
* **Never says what she means,** but expects you to understand what she means completely anyway. And then complains when other people aren’t clear with their words.
* **Sees the world in black and white.** To my mom’s simple mind, everyone is either good or bad. She doesn’t understand that almost nothing in this world is completely good or bad.
* **So childish and manipulative.** If she didn’t want me to leave the house, instead of telling me not to leave, she’d send the drivers to literally hide and turn off their cellphones which was the most childish thing ever. Or if she didn’t like someone she’d try to sue them over false accusations, and start a group chat literally to spread false rumors about the person. So many times, when she didn’t like a friend of mine, she’d call up their parents and literally just rant about the kid… to their parents…
* **Lacks basic skills like reading or just hates it (?)** My mom never reads menus and admitted to me that instead of reading the words on the menu, her “trick” is to look at the pictures and choose whatever dish looks the most appetizing. And if the menu has no pictures, she calls a waiter and asks them for whatever dish she’s feeling (e.g. if she’s feeling like eating fish, she’d just ask the waiter for the best-selling fish dish).
* **Lack of comprehension skills.** She never fully reads anything anyone sends her, or listens to what people are saying. She probably just picks up a few words, forms her own ideas about what you probably just said, and then comes up with an argument as to why what you said (from her understanding) is wrong, and most of the times she ends up arguing about something completely irrelevant from what you said.
* **Thinks of life too simply..** I’m applying for college soon and she told me not to worry because she has a friend who works in IT at NYU, and because he works at a college, he can reach out to Stanford admissions and tell them to accept me. (wow i can’t believe i even typed this). Another example is how she thinks the way to solve poverty in my country is through rich people simply giving poor people enough money so that poverty is instantly abolished, so she started asking all her friends to give her money and she started a project to literally give the citizens of a small town money.
* **Always thinks everyone’s out to steal her money.** Sometimes when she loses things, she lines up our drivers and tells them that if they don’t give her missing item back in the next 3 hours, she’s firing all of them. And then she finds her missing item in her purse or something.

*EDIT: Thanks so much if you got this far*

TL; DR: My mom is so dumb that I can’t have a conversation with her without feeling frustrated because she can’t understand anything. Is there any way to solve this or am I just doomed to having just one parent (my dad)? And i obviously want to be close to my mom but it's almost impossible seeing as interacting with her stresses me out so much.

I'm studying in a different kind of school. I'm studying via my computer. This means that even though I failed these courses I will be able to redo them in the future. It just prolongs my time in high school a little bit. I've continuously lied to my parents. I've told them I'm finally going to fix my life (which I haven't) and that I'm doing good in school, which I aren't. As I'm failing these two courses (something I haven't told my parents), two new courses begins tomorrow. I'm ready to do my best in those courses and I will! I'm ready to commit to school and start working out, I've learnt my lesson. Yet, I don't know what to tell my parents.

Throwaway because I’m paranoid haha.

[22/M]
So after trying and failing miserably at online dating a month ago, my confidence hit an all time low. Things got bleak, really bleak. I’ve never been in a relationship or even kissed anyone so that weighs heavier than I would like it to. I decided to join the gym a couple of weeks ago and focus entirely on my self confidence. I’m also going to get surgery for my jaw, which really reaffirms my ugliness. It does help but if something slightly goes wrong old habits hit me, believing that the things I’m working towards are never going to happen.

I asked a girl at a bar for her number for the first time in my life and got a Facebook name. I’ve suffered from severe social anxiety for four years so this is a real achievement. Just as I got a little proud of myself though I saw her being intimate with a guy as I was leaving. It crushed my self esteem again. So here I am, wondering if any risk I take will pay off and thinking I should give up my self improvement mindset. I’m finding my thoughts are leading me towards the incel mindset, which is scary really because I highly dislike that and all similar subreddits.

I suppose what I’m asking is how I stop thinking negatively and self-sabotagingly about my perpetual singleness and focus on making myself happy without any support from other people. I’m mentally strong the majority of the time but I’m worried that the weak moments will spoil everything. How do I cope better on my own? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",22Oct2017,1
110,"Background - I've been going to Community College for about 5 years now (although in Fall 2012 I was only able to get into two classes because my registration date was so late). The first two years out of high school I floundered - I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career and still don't - I didn't take school seriously enough and as a result my grades suffered (I had a little over a 2.0). During this time I worked a series of odd and under the table ""jobs"" such as working for a neighbor's online Amazon/Ebay store pulling, packing and mailing orders out to customers. I also helped a local company with a project where I found phone numbers of people in homeowners associations for money and entered them in an excel sheet pretty much. These helped me pay for recreational things I wanted to do.

The last three years of community college I've taken school much more seriously. I have four certifications pertinent to Computer Networking, and will also have my Associates in Computer Network Administration and Security Management as well as an Associates for Transfer degree in Business Administration. My parents have been generous enough to pay for my schooling which I'm extremely grateful for. I hope to transfer to a calstate by fall of next year (Im applying this semester). My GPA is about a 3.0 now and should be higher when I petition for academic renewal.

Last week my parents expressed their frustrations with the fact that I'm only taking 12 units at a CC and I don't have a part time job, a degree and I have yet to transfer to a better school for my bachelors program. I understand their frustrations. I have problems with motivation and I don't really know what's wrong with me. They also warned me that somewhere between the time span of a few months to 2 years they would be moving out of the state across the country. (CA to utah/colorado/wyoming area). In the next 2 years (maximum) I have to figure out how to: finish my degree at the college I transfer to, get relevant work experience in my field while doing that (information systems/technology), find a part time/full time job with no experience and no degree (yet).

On my resume I shortened my time at the community college to ""2015-Present"" because I don't want employers to see someone who has been going to community college for what would seem like 5 years and has practically nothing to show for it. Over the last week I've spent every waking hour of my day looking for and/or applying to entry level part time jobs, preparing to transfer, my coursework, and going to appointments with career counselors and transfer counselors at my school. I haven't had any time to do anything I enjoy - which I realize is a hilariously childish complaint - I understand that I'm supposed to be an adult now and should chin up - but I'm also afraid that if I start putting all of my time and effort into work and school I'll lose sight of my hobbies, my interests and my current relationship of three 3 years and wither as an individual. Has anyone here had similar feelings of dread? How did you deal with them? Did your sense of responsibility outweigh them?

Right now I'm just fibbing about my employment history and have the two things I talked about earlier extrapolated into the ""previous employment"" section of my otherwise barren resume.
I realize this post is a scatterbrained mess to read, and if you've gotten this far I can't thank you enough. I feel like last Monday was my first day on earth and everything before that is just a haze of me being extremely lazy and accomplishing nothing - so where do I go from here?

I feel like I've royally fucked up - my boyfriend has had his 4 year degree in chemical engineering for a year and has been working for the city for almost a year already and lives in his own place. All I can think about is how much time I've spent doing absolutely nothing and wasting time on stupid bullshit",22Oct2017,11
111,"Hi Reddit
I'm currently 18, and about to finish high school. I completed all my grades for Piano (1-8) at 12, then took a few years off (still practised and played in chamber groups etc but not doing letters or diploma) to focus on flute and later sax. I was halfway through my classical ATCL for piano and jazz sax before I quit both due to time constraints and outside pressure. (Around late 16 early 17) Now I'm 18, and haven't played both properly outside of 15-30 minutes a day so I don't completely lose what I learnt. Since I'm moving abroad to USA to study, I will half half a year off. Basically, I want to know if there's any chance should I pick up either instrument or both at this age that there's still any chance of me playing at a high performance level (I was entering competitions a lot beforehand) and getting picked for amateur groups or Uni band or groups to play in. I've always had a deep passion for music, but sometimes life just gets in the way.
Thanks a lot Reddit!",22Oct2017,1
113,"I have been born into a very privileged setting; white, parents who earn above average wages, nice house, parents still together. I haven't had anyone seriously close to me pass away, nor have I had any traumatic experiences or serious mental illnesses that have greatly impacted my life. 

I was talking to a friend the other day about how one of my closest friends for a while was talking about me behind my back (thrilling, I know). He mentioned that the only sort of valid point she had made was how I would complain to her about my family life, for example, when my parents would pay for my brother's expensive sporting when he wasn't interested and didn't support any of my hobbies, or when my parents had been arguing about whether they were going on a holiday (intense arguments, mind you). Apparently I wasn't considering the fact that her family were struggling greatly financially and she had come from a broken home. I was definitely aware of her situation, and would offer her advice and my sympathy, but I couldn't offer her empathy in a sense, because I truly had not experienced what she had. 

These said complaints were about three years ago when I was 16-17. And it did hurt me a little to know that my close friend agreed that I was sometimes insensitive and inconsiderate of other people's situations, although I do appreciate him being honest with me. 
I am struggling now with how much I can really vent to my friends now that I am aware of their feelings. I'd just like your opinions on where I should draw the line in my venting. I never want to rub anything in anyone's faces at all and that was never my intention. I just now am wondering if any time I feel down about something, whether the way I am feeling is unreasonable, considering the fact that there are billions of people on this earth that have truly suffered and will be suffering almost their entire lives with problems much greater than my own.
Where do I stand in this, and should I just keep my mouth shut? I hate feeling like the person everyone can't stand because I don't have any way of truly understanding what others have experienced.",22Oct2017,1

117,"Repost from r/relationship because this didn't get much attention.


Hello, first time poster here. English is not my first language so please bear with any grammar mistakes.

I live in the US. I am married and have no kids yet. My life is very regular and smooth. I have a very loving family (husband, parents, in-laws, etc). So maybe all of what I am explaining below comes from not having a 'real' problem.

Bear with me while I explain my issue - I work in the IT field which pays pretty well. It's a mid level company and our specific team is pretty small - about 20 developers. Work is not specifically hectic but some days are busier than others. I am in good terms with my manager and upper management. I know they value what I do. Despite all the good things I mentioned, I have this constant 'dull' dread in my mind whenever I think about work. Just normal work stuff, like a meeting with somewhat of a difficult co-worker on a Monday will completely ruin my Friday night and the whole weekend.

I do good work. I go out of my way to complete projects perfectly. I communicate well too. People have expressed that they like to work with me due to how organized and clear I am about things. But unfortunately the few people I have to work with closely are very bad at communication and somewhat of slackers. Please don't get me wrong, not everyone in in the team is like this. Most are a pleasure to work with. But I have the bad luck of working with some people who don't make things easy for others. Some of these people are seniors who have a lot of influence with the upper management. So sometimes these 'seniors' design projects in the most ugly ways where work is very light for them but very difficult for someone like me who have to work on the underlying layers. Not to mention these applications are maintenance nightmares and it is people like us who end up fixing their bugs. I see these disasters coming early in the planning phase and try to warn them. But my voice is not strong yet because I only have few years of experience here.

So due to what I explained above I always have something going on that I don't fully enjoy working on. Usually about 50% work I enjoy and the other half I dread.

I also hate long meetings with these people but due to way the team is designed I spend at least an hour a day with them. Sigh.

To be fair though no one is openly rude or completely unpleasant in their communication. These are just normal people that are trying to do their jobs. It is their way of doing things that I don't like because it creates more work for me but that what I get paid for! Also there are days I only do stuff that I enjoy. I can work for 8 hours and go home and never worry about work because none of this matters. I should be greatful that I have such a comfortable job!

Despite knowing all this I get way upset and mad every time things at work go side ways. Example: I warned team of something that is going to break if person x doesn't change a configuration. Person x completely ignores email. Month later thing breaks. My boss's boss's boss calls me first and asks me to fix this thing as if it's my fault. Nobody blames me BUT just the fact that I warned earlier and no one responded and after the thing broke it is I who have to drop everything and work on this completely drives me nuts. Out of proportion nuts. Of course I don't show how upset I get but inside it kills my happiness. Little things like this travel with me to my home. They are constantly in my mind. I don't like this at all.

How do I ignore the daily annoyances of work and not let them bother me? Of course they create extra work for me but so what, right? Work is work and I get paid to do it. How can I keep my mind calm and not let these things bother me? Only way I could think of is lowering my standard, do half a** work and not at all worry about quality of things. My husband says that will make me a zombie. But I will do anything to be a little bit more happier. Looking at all the horrible things that people go through around me makes me think that I am a very selfish person to complain about my cushy life but my unhappiness is real. I just can't make it go away. It's not just this job because I am pretty sure wherever I go these problems will be there. I have turned to the lovely folks of Reddit to cope with my work blues.

How can I not take work stuff too seriously and not worry about it all freaking time. How do I limit my work related thoughts to only 8 hours? How do I not get pissed off and upset as soon as I see a new request from one of the co-workers I mentioned above? How do I treat all of it as works and just move on without ruining my health? I don't want to come home every single day and complain to my husband (not that it helps much because I find myself going over things later with the same amount of bitterness).

Some additional things about me:

I don't enjoy work (coorporate world) generally. If I can afford to stay at home all my life I would do it but who wouldn't?

I have not had anxiety or depression so far.

Upper management has slowly increased my responsibilities over the years. I am also the freaking employee of the year *face palm*

tl;dr: Minor work related issues ruin my happiness in personal life. Please help me keep work and life separately. I should not be feeling this dread when in reality my work place is not even that bad.",22Oct2017,10

Recently, I was hit by a car which broke my femur in half. I'm basically all but bedridden after the surgery, with the exception of using a walker to get to and from the restroom. And I'm extremely bored.

Last night I went out in town with my friends and decided to meet him later after at our local pub. He was there with our friends and they all came back to ours for more drinks. Most ppl left and there was me, him, a girl that previously came to our house for parties and her male friend. We were all in the kitchen and I was showing this guy out wedding video while I noticed that my husband and this girl (who secretly fancied him) were giggling in a flirty way. I said nothing and just went to bed but couldn't fall asleep. All of a sudden there were no more voices downstairs so I went down. The other guy was in the living room on his phone, the kitchen door was shut and as I opened it I saw them close togheter and she just pushed herself away from it. I am not an aggresive person but in a rage of the moment I slapped him and then I slapped her and her reply was 'what the fuck I tought you were involved in this and he was getting me warmed up for you'. I was shocked! The girl and her friend left and I threw my rings at my husband and said I am done, and called a cab. He started pushing me shouthing is that it you're leaving me for this and went to bed. I went to my friends house. The next morning he didn't remember anything and when I filled him in he sayd I was paranoid and aggresive. I then texted the girl, apologised for slapping her and asked her to please tell me the truth. She said she tought we were the type for a threesome and felt a vibe etc (only because by nature I am a sexual person when dancing etc but never in my life have I made any suggestions etc) and she said when he kissed her it took her by surprise and she liked it and didn't stop it! She send him a text straight after ""what the hell was that I tought she was part of it"" and yet he denied it all. I said how can you deny when you don't remember a thing? I feel disgusted and heartbroken. He was then crying on the phone saying she is a pshyco and orchestrated all of this but I don't believe a word because clearly he is no angel. Then he said he is not even attracted to her but we all know that when we are drunk things change. I really don't know what to do. This is my future here.

124,"So our esport team has been playing for about 8 weeks now and for 7 of those 8, we have had a really good player, good guy, good shot, etc (we'll call him X). The thing is that X gets really into the game and when things go wrong he gets frustrated and starts making negative comments that kind bring us down (imo, but he argues different). He'll say things like ""this is embarrassing"", ""we are playing like shit"", or when we try to cheer him up with ""no worries dude its just one point"" he'll almost always respond with ""well it shouldnt have happened to begin with"".

A few weeks ago we brought it up to him saying that it kinda bumms us out and affects our mentality during the game especially during real matches. Well that didnt pan over well he stated that he was the way he was and that only death was going to change that. That lead to one of our other teammates saying that if X continued he was going to have to mute him. To which X replied with ""well then your gonna have to mute me""

Since then we have found a player who isnt as good as him, but is way more positive and works hard. Last night we broke it to him that he was no longer on the team (huuuuuuuuuge dick move I know) we would have told him sooner and perhaps asked him again but he seemed pretty clear last time and since he is our friend we dreaded that conversation and why we avoided it (also huuge dick move). 

Now he's hurt becuase he says he did try to fix the issue. O: I dunno, I feel really bad. I had no idea he was even acknowledgeing the issue, let alone actively working on it. I know we didnt handle the situation well we should have had a another discussion before making the leap.

I only yell at her never physically abuse her or anything. Any advice on getting her to love me again.? ,22Oct2017,3
159,"Ever since my friend lost her phone, she always ask me to let her log onto her snapchat account. I was fine at first because she ask politely and doesn't take that long. But now, she uses my phone for a long time and she would sometimes take my phone when I'm on it without even asking. The other day, I said hello to her and she responded back by saying ""can I use your phone?"" After she finished using it, I asked her where's my thanks, but she just looked at me without saying anything. She don't listen when I tell her funny things that happened at school anymore because she's focused on her snapchat. I really want to say no to her when the next time she asks for my phone but I know that she's going argue back and I'm afraid that it's going to hurt our friendship. What should I do?",22Oct2017,4
160,"Hey everyone, So last night I smoked about half a G. My first time in about 5 months. I recently just got a job at an aluminum foundry that hasn't really said much regarding a drug test (it's a pretty laid back place, but relatively big). When I went in for orientation my first day (4 months ago), they went over different policies. The guy running orientation briefly mentioned that they are random and that was about it. I never received any pre-employment test, and have not heard a word about drug testing there at all. Like I said, it's a very laid back and unorganized environment.. Just to be sure, I messaged my friend who's dad works there and he said that in his 5 years there he hasn't received a drug test since his pre-employment one, so now I'm kind of confused. Anyone have any thoughts on this? I'm kind of worried, but if his dad said he hasn't got one since he started, so what's up? I know the obvious answer is don't smoke, but my friends were pressuring me and just wanted to release a bit as I'm still battling a mild depression. If it makes any difference, I'm an apprentice through high school (I'm 18 btw) that only works 3 hours a day Mon-Wed. Talking with other apprentices some places do, some don't. 

Thanks in advance

Also, any tips on ridding my body of THC asap?",22Oct2017,1
162,So I’m pretty bad with girls. Never had a girlfriend or anything I’m 21. It causes me a lot of depression. But anyway. I take the train to school everyday and there’s this girl who gets in and off at the same stop as me. We go to the same school. I’ve yet to say anything to her but I really want to. How should I go about that? It’s also 815 in the morning when j usually see her. I just hate the thought of being to much of a wimp to just be able to spark a conversation. ,22Oct2017,3

168,"I have had a school problem for a couple of years
Ever since 7th grade (currently in high school, 10th grade) i always felt sad when going to school, every day i try to get through school as fast as i can, and not think  about it. For example i always try to find ways to skip school, not learning for my classes, day dreaming, ANYTHING as long time passes and i get home faster. The only fun time i have at school is with my classmates. Im an introvert and i find it quite hard to meet new people, took me months to be friends with 4 guys in my class. They arent the best friends ,most of them will make fun of you to impress others, quite asshole-ish behavior, you may say get better friends, or ignore them and mind your own business, yeah, i tried that, but oh boy you are gonna get picked on if you dont hang out with at least a group of people, so i try my best to stay relevant and not get made fun of. Whenever i get home i try to spend my time on my phone or my dog, i dont really do my homework or learn, because that makes me think about school, which makes me sad. Every night i try to fight my sleep, almost everytime i fall asleep with my phone in my hand. I fight the temptation to sleep so it takes more time till i go to school. I very rarely go out with friends, my main time waster is gaming, which i cant during weekdays, so whenever my day ends, while laying in bed, i cant think about what ive done that day, smile, and say ""this was a good day"". 
I even went to a doctor at some point during 8th grade because everyday i was feeling physically ill before going to school. The doctor said that i was stressed becaude of school, but my parents didnt really believe it so i just continued my life as it was. 
Do you feel the same? Have you ever felt like me? What can i do to stop how i feel and be happy? Thought about getting a hobby, but i couldn't find anything that i really liked.
Thanks
P.S: sorry for my bad English.",22Oct2017,5
170,"So I have a friend, let's call him R. R is a very nice and naive guy. He always trys to be a white night when it comes to girls.

He says things like:
""Ohh, I would never leave my woman no matter what""
""I'll always hang on tight even when it gets rough""
""I'm going to find the perfect girl and make her my wife""

I don't think I effectively captured his personality. To put it simply, he is 21 but his outlook toward girls is like a 2008-cringey-emo-twilight 13 year old boy.

So he met a girl named N over Facebook and they have been going on some dates. I'm one of his close fiends so I asked him how it all went.

So his first date was going to the movies. Cool. His second date? Going to the movies. Okay. Third date? Movies again Date four? You guessed it, the new fast and furious movie! I asked him if they have had any interesting conversations during any of the dates. He told me that she mostly stays on her phone the entire time.

I was like wow, what a bummer, but at least you didn't pay right?
""no, I'm a gentleman, the man always pays no matter what""

So flash forward THREE MONTHS. I am thinking that R has snapped out of it and ""broke up"" with her.

I get hit with this. ""I took her for a nice Mexican dinner and I told her that I wanted her to be my girlfriend and she told me that she is a person that develops feelings over a long period of time and that she needs to spend more time with me (read free dinner)""

What do I do to help the situation? I know it's not my business but I think that friends prevent each other from getting punked like that right? He plans on continuing with her. By the way, my friend comes from a lower class background. He isn't dirt poor but I can't see what he is doing to be sustainable. Also, I am a guy so please don't comment saying that I'm somehow jealous.

Tldr; friend is getting hoed into free dinner ever week. Can't get him to snap out of his extreme white knight nonsense. ",22Oct2017,11

Just wondering what the thoughts are on the kid. I have no kids myself but do plan to in the future at some point, as i will essentially be this kids dad and having quite an involvement in his life, Days out generally being around etc. 

How do you deal with this? Would you deal with this?

176,"My aunt died yesterday night. It was completely unexpected, she choked to death shortly after being taken to the hospital for an infection. She lived about 2 minutes away from me and I've been visiting her almost every week for several years. Even if we didn't live together, she's still been an important person in my life for a long time.

Her death seems to have just opened up a floodgate of grief. I haven't done anything but cry about it since last night. I'm sure the fact that I already struggle with depression is contributing at least somewhat, but regardless of why I'm a wreck.

What I'm worried about: I work the night shift at a fast food place, and at least at my location, night shift is very, very busy. Most nights I don't even have time to eat or go to the bathroom, and we aren't given a break at any time during the 8 hours of work. I'm a fairly new employee (been there ~2 months now) and as it is I still feel like I need to prove myself as a new hire. I also know from my managers that this is supposed to be an extra busy week due to an event happening in this area, and as much as possible I need to figure out some strategies to keep it together and perform to the best of my ability. Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm most worried about having trouble concentrating, handling my emotions in the face of angry customers, how not to work too slowly even though I'm very sad, and how to keep up the right kind of smiling customer service attitude.",22Oct2017,2
178,"This is kind of a long and complicated story but I need to get it out and hopefully get some advice on what to do. I understand if you don't want to read the whole thing.

I married my wife at the end of July and by the middle of September, she approached me and said that she needed space and that she didn't want to be married anymore. I agreed to give her space in the hopes that her desire to break up was the result of a medical condition she had. A few days later I stopped by our apartment to get my toothbrush and found evidence of another man living in our home with her; his clothes all over the floor, his stuff in our bathroom, new decorations on the furniture, etc. I confronted her about it and she said she wanted a divorce. 

Well, over the next few weeks, she seemed to have a change of heart and told me that she still cared about me and wanted to try to work something out. The guy that she had been seeing was from her work and she had kicked him out. In the interest of verifying what she was telling me, I drove by the apartment and found his car there multiple nights after she told me she had kicked him out. When I confronted her about THAT, she said that her mom (who was staying with her at the time to help with her medical condition as the surgery approached) had allowed him to stay as they had become good friends but that he was not welcome to be around her at all. He was just being allowed to stay until her operation was complete and she had the energy to do it herself.

A week or so after that, I surprised her by stopping at an event she was at to drop our baby off and saw him sitting there enjoying it with my wife and her mother. Naturally that hurt. 

Later that week, she had her operation and then a few days later really did kick him out, telling me that she did not want that life and that she loved me and wanted to work things out. Her mom even explained that he had manipulated her and that she had done a background check on him and that he had a history of manipulating women into letting him live with them rent free. She also told me that he had warrants out for his arrest.

I kept my distance and guard up, having been fooled before, but I was encouraged by her willingness to communicate. A few nights the week after her surgery while she was still recovering, I stopped by the apartment to drop the baby off and she seemed happy to see me and wanted to chat. We even had a long talk one night last week in which I told her that i was willing to work things out if she did a number of things that I listed for her such as being honest, showing me she could live on her own and be responsible, etc. I also told her that I did not make my vows just to make them and that I wanted to believe that her behavior and the way she treated me was the result of her condition and that now that she had her operation, things would start to improve for her. Even her doctor said that what was happening was liable to cause her to ""live in a fog"" and affect her decision making. 

Things were great for a few days as we started to plan how we could restart our connection and relationship such as by going on dates and how to celebrate our baby's 1st birthday.

Then the tone of her texts suddenly changed to being very terse and short from the long engaged ones she had been sending. She had agreed to let me keep our baby on on her days so that I could celebrate her birthday with my family and then I would switch later in the day so my wife could do the same with her family. The morning it was supposed to happen, she got very aggressive with me and did not allow me to keep the baby for the morning. After I met my wife to drop the baby off, I realized I'd forgotten to include her medicine so I ran it over to the apartment where I found her going down the stairs toward the car with the guy she supposedly hated and had kicked out. 

I'm an emotional wreck. I don't know whether I am coming or going. I want to believe her behavior is a result of her condition, and it's possible that she's still feeling effects of it as it could take months to even out. But on the other hand, a lot of what she has been doing seems to be premeditated and not completely on impulse. 

TLDR- my wife of 6 weeks has a medical condition that can affect judgement and she has lied to me multiple times and cheated on me in the last few months. I want to respect my vows and try to stick with her and work through this and give her the benefit of the doubt, but she is making it very hard.

I love my wife more than anything. I was so sure I was making the right decision that I wasn't even nervous on our wedding day. And then to have it end so quickly after everything we've been through just doesn't make sense to me if its not medically induced. 

What advice does anyone have about my situation? Should I continue to try to ride this out until her hormone levels return to normal, which could take months? Or should I cut my losses and run? What about our baby? ",22Oct2017,21

182,"So, I am an undergraduate student in uni and I feel like I don’t really know anyone here even though its already my second year. I tried to be outgoing and meet different people but I never really enjoyed spending time with anyone. 

I guess its because I’m a bit odd in that I am not in any degree a foodie. I do enjoy the occasional meal but I don’t understand other people’s reaction to it, and when I spend time with people they talk about this food they tried and whats good etc. 

I also have a weird hobby of managing my time. This means that I don’t usually experience those last minute rushes, I have enough sleep and exercise regularly.  Which others usually just gawked at, and this creates a distance somehow. 

Well, the point is i don’t really enjoy/understand and talk about the same thing as others. I tell myself that I’m fine with it but sometimes its just hard to see that I spend most of my time on my own. 

Its not that I cannot make friends, the problem is that when I spend time with others and then think to myself, ‘do I want to spend more time with ___?’, the answer is no so I stop making an effort.

And i know if i went and bought my own food it would disappear in a few days due to my siblings and besides i cant even drive yet. Its also difficult because we struggle with money. 

Currently i do intermittent fasting throughout the weekdays and eat normally during weekends. i train and workout sunday to friday. I dont see much weight loss cause my diet is down the drain. getting bigger is slowly coming along. Im one of those skinny fat guys. ive lost a bit of weight since i started working out about 5 months ago but it so difficult without having the right foods. I cant refuse dinner cause then i would have skipped breakfast lunch and dinner.

185,"*Background*

When we were young (grades 4 through 8), every weekend she would stay at the apartment down the hall from me because her dad was dating a woman who lived there. Whenever she was here, her, the woman's daughter and I would hang out. The entire time, me and this girl had feelings for each other but could never admit them, we were both too afraid. We had so many good memories.

They ended up moving 3 hours away. We lost contact for a couple years, until one day I get a friend request on Facebook. Immediately after talking, it was so clear why we had that friendship for those years. We have so much in common. But anyway.

We started dating long distance. It's been a good 4 years, and this is still a thing. We've easily sent over 150,000 messages between each other in this time. We're convinced that we're going to spend the rest of our lives together. We've had our turmoil, our ups and downs, but any arguments have never been extremely serious. There was a period of around 7 months that we dated other people, because it was just so stressful being so far. Her mom has never let her see me. Not even once. I saw her for the first time in years earlier this year at the woman's daughter's birthday and the magic between us was.. Unbelievable.

*The Problem*

She's been MIA a lot lately. Not replying, rdring my snapchats, pretending like she doesn't see my messages on Facebook, all that stuff. When we do talk sometimes, that old magic and that old hope is still there. But I've become emotionally drained from having her on my mind all the time again and her not taking the time to talk to me. Even a couple messages a day would suffice.

She told me a few weeks ago (paraphrasing), ""I trust you. You and I will end up together forever, one day.""

And I shit on it. I absolutely shit on it. I had some girl come over the other day and we had sex. I guess in my mind, I justified it by telling myself that she hasn't made any effort to be around. She's had more opportunities to see me lately and hasn't taken them. Hasn't been replying. I long for her, every single day. For her to open up her phone, see a message, go ""eh I'll reply to that later"" and not end up doing it for multiple days at a time hurts.

So I had sex with another girl. And I have no idea what to think or what to do. Do I tell her? Maybe a switch will click to tell her to try harder before she loses me. Is that a shitty way to look at this? Fuck. Idk man.

Tl;dr: Long distance girlfriend makes no effort any more but still says she has all these feelings for me. I had sex with another girl. Wat do.",22Oct2017,3

So I wasn't really havin' it, I was like bruh I didn't say shit and I ain't gonna say shit now because you're just being mad at yourself. 

Everyone was on my side, even though I didn't exactly have a side since I wasn't really saying shit, but he left for college and that was it.

So it's been a few months since I kinda just cut him off.

He was occasionally toxic before but I kinda just would ignore that for a bit. He said he took meds for ADD, but then was off em. He was just very, very full of himself and that's why sometimes I would just cut him off temporarily.

But still he had stopped hangin' with our group a year or two back to go lick popular kid ass (Are there even popular kids now? It's fuckin' 2017) so he kinda just left, but he still tried to be part of the group.

So there's the story plus a little background, I'm not really bothered by this, to be honest I like having the connection lost cause he was a bit annoying, but it's crazy how he never admitted that he went crazy bout it, so I kinda wanted to see what people thought.",22Oct2017,1

I have a CAE certificate but I got it too many years ago and so my english is now pretty rusty (specially idiomatic expressions, phrasal verbs and stuff like that, you know, ""use of english"" kind of stuff). How can I practice it? Do you know any good website with plenty of ""use of english"" exams and quick explanations?",22Oct2017,1
200,"So title. 

To give more context we work in a high school library, she's the librarian, I'm the library technician. I was out last week for a day and when I came back on Friday, I opened my bottom personal drawer, and noticed that it was less full. I kept books that I was reading on the bottom, an ipad that I use for work and then on top of all of that, I had a change of clothes (because sometimes I have to crawl around/lift a bunch of dusty stuff) and then snacks like bottles of water, and boxes and granola bars. 

So I noticed a book was missing. They were library books, so yes, school property, but they were at the very bottom of my personal drawer. I went and looked the books up in the system and it looks like a student had maybe asked for them and she thought I might have them and so she looked for it. 

The thing is, okay, I get it, it's school property, but staff members check out books ALL THE TIME. Because the book had just come out and I wasn't finished processing it yet for students to check out, I didn't have it checked out under my name-I still needed to cover it, but I decided I'd read it first quickly and then cover it and put out for circulation. I looked up the book in the systems and it was checked out to a student on the day I was gone, so it's proof she went through my drawer. There have been other instances where maybe I was out on vacation for a few days and I've come back to find things missing or moved...but these were things that were on my desk, not IN my desk. 

The thing is, she didn't even know I had the book. And the book was on the very bottom of a personal drawer. Meaning, she just decided to look through my desk, and dug through a bunch of personal stuff to find it. Yes, maybe her intuition told her to look there because she found it there, but honestly, I wouldn't go through an entire personal drawer to find it. 

I feel SO violated. She herself was out the day that I came back, so I couldn't confront her about it then. It still would have been crappy of her to have done that, but she could have at least sent me an email or left a note saying she took the book and why. I still would have been pissed that she went through my stuff but at least she would have been honest about it. The way she did it just leaves me feeling ultra violated. 

So I'm contemplating confronting her about it and then telling her to not go through my stuff but she's very bi-polar and she and I have had a lot of issues in the past (she takes advantage of me a a lot and at the end of the school year she yelled at me in front of kids). Administration does nothing. I've filed complaints against her, and nothing. She doesn't take confrontation or criticism well. She gets very emotional and it becomes a whole thing. 

I have been trying to leave this job since it's overall been pretty toxic for me and I have a job interview this week coming up...even if I don't get the job, I have been applying to a lot of jobs, so I would hope that I would be leaving this job ANYWAY sometime soon. So would it be worth it to confront her if I'm on my way out anyway? Should I just let it go unless she happens to bring up later on that she took the book? 

The other thing to consider is that because I am applying for jobs, even though I didn't put her down as a reference, my school get could calls and they could direct them to her...and so if thing get ugly over a confrontation, then she might just be vindictive enough to tell them bad things about me-she has done some things in retaliation a lot in the past, so I would not put it past her to ruin my chances at getting another job and leaving her. 

I'm leaning towards just letting it go, even though it's just really NOT okay that she did that...but she's a ticking time bomb and so you never know what's gonna blow her fuse and it might just make life for me that much worse. 


**tl;dr: co-worker went through my desk, want to confront her but she's crazy and she gets emotionally charged with criticism and I'm trying to leave this job as soon as I can anyway...she wasn't listed as a reference but they could call my current employer and they could direct them to her and she could ruin my shot at leaving...**

201,"**Here’s a classical roommate problem story. Brace yourself: there are subwoofers involved. Summary is at the end of the post.**

I’m living with 2 roommates of which one is alright (the guy) and the other one (the girl) really annoying (complains a lot, unreasonable). She would complain about things as; bathroom use after 12 PM, or use of heating when she's home, because her knob in her room is broken and she needs to use a pincer to open/close it. Her solution for this is complaining and telling us to keep the heating off when she's home. We tried to explain to her that she should either fix her heating or stop complaining about heating use of the whole house. Now a days she won't complain but simply just turn the heating off when she has the chance...

Besides of the above there are other problems. We (me and the guy) play music occasionally when we are home. The girl used to complain about this too, but we understood, so whenever she was home we tried to mind her or when she was home without us knowing and she would complain, we lowered the volume. Now one day, her boyfriend was over (as usual) and they were being really loud, screaming, laughing etc. This happened more often and I was always okay with it, but this time I needed to mix some music for work and had the volume low. Their noise was surpassing my sound and concentration so I raised the volume a bit so I could here it better. When this happened she knocked on the wall a few times, so I came over to ask what’s wrong and she asked to keep the music down. Normally that would be okay (I would lower it or work another time), but this time I decided to attend them that they were being loud as well. This was clearly a mistake because the situation immediately became awkward and they decided to ignore me(?). 

So from this point things started to change. A few days later the boyfriend took a subwoofer with him for in her room. I didn’t mind since my installation and the one of my other roommate both have some sub in it, and they should do as they please. But, at this point they use that subwoofer every single day, to loudly listen their music or watch movies (imagine deep rumbles for 1,5 hours, being followed by other deep rumbles for 1,5 hours, etc.). 

Unfortunately, I can’t say a thing (and they know it) about it because I (have to) play my music (for work) as well, although this is often 2-3 hours a day, 1-2 times a week. In their case the subwoofer is fully used from 12.00 PM till 8 PM, c.a. 5 days a week. My other roommate isn’t home that often, but I often study at home and I am starting to get irritated after a few weeks of this. 

At this point I don’t know what to do. We are clearly on bad terms and although I tried to create goodwill between us from the start they both act passive aggressive at times. I also think the boyfriend feels threatened and unwelcome by us because in a few other previous situations we got into a discussion about stupid stuff. Perfect example: He took the key of the garage because his second bike was in it since a few days, so we couldn't get in. Of course we didn't enjoy that, so roommate 1 told him to either take it out or put the key back. This resulted in this fight/misunderstanding were they wanted to divide EVERYTHING in the house perfectly equal (my roommate uses a bit more space than us, about which they later confessed they don't need to use it, it was the principle?). We solved this by stating that boyfriend is almost living here and that we haven't asked them to clean twice as much/buy stuff twice as much. This made things escalate even more whereafter we cooled them down and just agreed that he should put the key back and everything would be fine.

Now, despite of him being here very often and just as unreasonable as our roommate, I still don’t mind. I also told him I don't mind to relax him a little. But, when they’re together (which is always) the subwoofer is permanently on and this is starting to become a problem. I am hoping to move out soon and get an apartment of my own. But for now, can I please have some advice how we/I can survive or change the situation for the following months?

203,"Hey y'all. So, I'm a high-school student from a pretty poor country, and recently I've got an opportunity to emigrate to the country I've desired to live in all my life. It's all good and all, but if I do this, I'll have to leave my family behind (the relationships in the family is one of the reasons why I want to leave). But the problem is that I feel sorry for them, even though most of the times they treated me badly. My mother worked hard all her life and I guess that's why she didn't have enough time for me, but the rest of the family are a bunch of lazy people who always hated me and didn't ever try to change anything.

204,"I've made the biggest mistake of my life. I've never been this upset, and I've never felt this horrible.

My best friend (I'll call him Sam) and I had sex a few months ago, but we both decided that we wouldn't tell anyone, and we decided that we didn't want this to turn into a romantic relationship. Sam and I decided we were just going to remain close friends. We swore each other to secrecy, and promised to never tell a soul.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. I was having a discussion with a different close friend of mine (who I'll call Anna). Anna and I were discussing a bunch of random topics, just catching up, and Anna brought up Sam, and asked about him. I mentioned that he was doing well and all.

Anna commented that I seemed to ""light up"" when she mentioned Sam, and she began kind of pressuring me for details, because she (rightly) assumed that something had happened. Now I am completely responsible for what I did and what I said. There is no excuse for me betraying Sam's trust like that, and I honestly don't know why I did. I just panicked and said that we hooked up.

Anna seemed surprised, and then she began asking for more and more details, about which I was vague. I felt absolutely AWFUL for mentioning the one thing I knew I should never have mentioned.

After that horrifically awkward conversation subsided, I she brought it up with Sam, not knowing that I wasn't supposed to tell her. Again, this is entirely, 100% my fault.

I tried to text Sam, and apologize. He only responded telling me that he will talk to me when he feels like it, and that he doesn't want me contacting him until then. Of course I am going to respect his wishes, but I don't know what I can say when we talk? How can I possibly amend for breaking the trust of my best friend? 

What I've done might be unforgivable. I just want some way to express to Sam how sorry I am, and to possibly even remotely begin to make up for betraying his trust. I just cannot express how regretful and horrible I feel (which I deserve to feel this way). What should I do? What should I say? If someone betrayed your trust, what would you want to hear from them (if anything)?",22Oct2017,3

I love my job and I'd like to be rid of this distraction so I can focus on my projects. Not trying to think of when I'll have an opportunity to take my shoes off.

My job requires me to have very diverse activity levels.  Sometimes I'm at my desk all day.  Most of the time I have to visit offices, pick up orders, crawl behind desks, climb stairs etc.

My employers dress code just requires me to have shoes, not sandals.  I wear slacks and a collared shirt.  That's as exact as the policy is, so I do have some flexibility.

Can someone recommend a shoe or shoe resource where I can find a life-changing solution?  Will some kind of powder help?

We went met up at a bar a week later and pretty much just hopped from bar to bar. She even drank out of my cup once. We ended up parting ways that night. I'm an introvert, so i didn't say much. She mentions about an event going on the next day.

Anyways, I text her about that event the next day. Her replies are very short, so i take it as her not being interested. I see her later that same nigh, but I fuck up. She didn't immediately see me. I just walk past her and go to the rest room (she wasn't looking at me). When i leave the restroom, i did the same. I just walked past without looking. I just took it as she wasn't that interested.

224,"Last time I was on here I was told that I should go to therapy for my little obsession. 
Well I looked at some of the prices, and I really can't afford it, and one of my friends was studying to become a psychiatrist, so he offered to hear me vent and maybe help me.

While we were talking, I didn't know of a good way to answer most of the questions he asked in a way that'd make him understand.

Eventually, I started blocking him out, I became defensive like I always do. But when I was getting all wiled up, I started becoming really scared, I was breathing heavy, it felt like I was going to suffocate.  

Today he told me he's leaving me on messenger.  
Confused, I asked him ""What do you mean?""
and he responded with;
""I'm doing this for the better, it's obvious that you have a difficult time discussing these things.""

I asked what he meant again. 
He replied with; 
""I'm gonna just say this... I'm leaving you alone. Because you're stressed out. So, bye."" 

I said; ""Wait, pardon me, I don't understand?""

He said; ""It'll knock a bit off your shoulders.""
I said. ""This is impossible to understand?"" 
He responded with; ""No, it isn't, It's very simple, I'm just gonna let you know this now: There's only two mes the one that cares and the one that doesn't give two shits."" 

I didn't say anything and he continued with; 
""I'm going to attempt to not give a shit and worry about you so I'm leaving you and your sister alone, Because your sister doesn't want you having a panic attack or a heart attack when you're around me. You're antsy around me. You're shy. You don't even trust me so how do you expect me to help you?""

I was pretty distraught, at this point, and he just left. 


If you don't know what's been going on with me well,
I'm suicidal, I recently had a panic attack and I have this weird obsession with being perfect, I often feel threatened, and I'm not used to letting things go, I bottle things up, and I rarely, rarely, ever talk about my problems.
When other's ask questions or express any concern I often get defensive out of panic. 
I don't take care of myself well, I don't eat or sleep regularly, and I often do repetitive mannerisms, I wash my hands a lot, or sanitize my hands or I apply chap-stick until my lips become red.

I expressed that here, and out of the 2 responses I was told to go see a therapist or a psychiatrist because my behaviors are not normal. 

What should I do? I don't really talk to my sister, my friend (He just left.) and I met through her. 

I know, I should go get help. But, what can I do to fix this?
I'm stressed, and distraught, he was my only friend, we weren't that close like everyone else was but, he was one of the closest people I had a friendship with. 

He left because I pushed him away, and because after a while I wouldn't talk to him about what's happening I'd give him vague responses. 
For example:
""What's wrong, what's gotten into you?""

I'd reply with, ""Stuff is just going on, I'm sorry.""


I've been feeling awful, and I always am really nervous and I can't relax. 
I came here to vent last time because, I knew no one on here knew who I was, it'd be anonymous, and that's the reason why I even talked about anything in the first place. 

Everything is now, really falling apart. 

I can't do anything, I always mess everything up, and I messed this up to.

He used to pay his way just fine when it was all 3 of us (we lived in 3-bedroom apartment), but when the younger cousin moved out he suddenly needed help with his end of the bills after already signing the lease and passing a credit check from the leasing office.

1st time it happened he paid me back immediately and it was okay. But the 2nd time he lied about what he needed the money for and he was delinquent on the electric bill. I covered half of that and he said he would pay me back, never did.

3rd time (I know, i should have learned but this all happened fast): literally a week later and we got an eviction notice because he never paid our rent. He made up excuses for work problems and other expenses. I had to cover half of what he owed.

Now we're up to $600.00 he's in debt to me for and I already reached out to his younger cousin and he said he'll try to talk to him but i guess he gets this way and always borrows money from people. (I didn't know this, or think to assume anything since he paid me back quick the 1st time)

Now I'm going to move out regardless, as  I got a new job and excited to start over. But I'm wondering what the right thing to do is. Should I try and reason with him? let it go? Or find a way to at least get some of the money back?

235,"Hi!

I am engaged to be married and so is my future sister in law. We both decided we were going to be getting married in the same season.  I said that I was looking in a certain month and she said she was looking at dates in the following month.  She ended up booking a date in the month we decided, so my fiance and I had to choose the only available date in our budget which is the week before her wedding.  This left my fiance's family very upset and they are not talking to us anymore.  We explained that everyone knew we both wished to get married during this season. I had a sitdown talk with future SIL a week before we booked our weddings and we talked about how our weddings will probably be close to one another and there were no objections.  She even sent us a text saying a week before or after is fine.  I also didn't anticipate that it would be a problem because only a small amount of guests (under 10 people) would be attending both weddings and if expenses were a concern,  we weren't going to be having a rehearsal dinner which typically is paid for by the groom's side.  


Some side notes,  both weddings are local and on weekends.  Only 1 adult male member of their family would be in our wedding party and we haven't even asked anyone yet. 


I think that's is silly that both couples can't have a wedding on their ideal date and both be happy.  I wouldn't infringe on her right to happiness by making a fuss about her choosing a date in our intended month and I would expect the same courtesy from her regarding our happiness.  

What are your thoughts on this situation? Am I wrong?",22Oct2017,5

239,"I am applying to a program that requires a letter of recommendation.

I have two problems:

1. I recently transferred from a community college to my current university. So, I have not yet had any professors more than, once.

2. I have done well in the majority of my classes, but haven't put in much effort in creating a professional relationship with my professors.

The program deadline I am applying for is early January and the only missing piece is my letter of recommendation. I am currently taking a course with a professor that I want to ask for this LoR. I have made an effort to visit office hours and plan to do so, once or twice more, before asking.

Would you write a letter of recommendation for a student that you've had only once in your course and while the course is still on-going?

241,"Basically, I'm a junior at a college in New Jersey and for about the past year I have been severely distressed about the fact that I lied to my college friends about some details of my life in the past. I greatly regret these lies but I think it may be too late to rectify my mistakes. I am from Toronto but decided to go to college in the US because I wanted new experiences and a new life. In high school, many people loved me, but I was kind of awkward and had no girlfriend. There was a girl I was very interested in, in 12th grade, we texted and hung out and held hands, but never kissed or anything, things didn't work out. She was supposed to be my prom date, but she went with another guy and I went alone. Anyway, when I arrived in college, I felt embarrassed and ashamed of my lack of dating experience. In freshman year, I claimed that I slept with the aforementioned girl and that we went to prom together, and that we dated for a bit. I also claimed to live in a house to some of my friends (which I did, in the past) but I live in a condo. Back then, it seemed to be a good idea, but then I realized that my new friends might meet my Canadian friends one day and that began my anxiety. 

Meanwhile, in college, I have slept with only 1 girl to my great sadnes, but I've made out with a few. My new American friends have asked to come to Toronto, but I have discouraged them many times, out of fear of exposure, and I have discouraged my Canadian, high school friends, as well. But, my Canadian friends want to visit me in a few weeks, and I feel like I can't tell them no.

I have this huge, huge (and reasonable) fear that my lies will come up and my high school friends will reveal the truth and my life will be ruined. This gives me unending anxiety and I wish I never lied. I was a freshman in a new college in a new country and I was insecure and foolish and dumb. I want to introduce my new friends to my old friends, I want to feel free, but I'm so afraid. My old friends even told me that they want to meet my new friends to tell them stories about me, as a joke, but that gave me so much anxiety that I almost contemplated suicide. What should I do? I'm so tired of these secrets and lies, but at the same time, I feel that my new and old friendships will never recover from these lies, if I saw the truth. (Please ignore any bad grammar, I typed this out in an anxious and worried state. Thanks)",22Oct2017,1

243,"Hey everyone, I need some advice. I have this friend that has been getting on my nerves - A LOT, recently. 

To give you some context, we have been friends since our first year of university (now midway through our 3rd year in Uni) when we didn't know anyone else in our program, we became very close friends and would hang out, I would invite her over for dinner, etc, everything was sunshine happiness in terms of friendship! She's has a rough childhood and a strained relationship with her family. However, maybe it is because we've been friends for a while now that I've been realizing some little things about her that really bother me. She likes to complain, a lot, about everything. Little things like people not replying to her emails fast enough, other people not letting her answer the questions or disagreeing with her comments in class, and people not liking her in general. She has admitted to being competitive (both in school and in life) and having low self-esteem, so I kind of ""understand"" where her feelings are coming from, but it hasn't really bothered me until now. 

Storytime (this was a week ago): we had out first small group discussion class together the other day and when my other friend started answering the tutor's questions and getting them right, she snapped ""oh I hear your little comments over there, you're soooooooooo smart"" or ""it's okay don't worry, you're smart TOO"" in a really condescending way. My other friend, feeling quite uncomfortable, just laughs it off. Then, after making the comments, she ducks out of class and when I text her where she is she says ""I feel so awkward around people, I think they don't like me"".  

Things like this have been happening more often, in different contexts, I feel her constant need to be better than everyone else, and when things don't go exactly her way, she puts the blame on another person wronging her. She like to brag about herself and put other people down. 

I have been slowly distancing myself from her (since last year) and I feel terrible - I was one of her closest friends, but I don't know how to help her. I've encouraged her to pick up things she likes outside of school, and not to define her self-worth through academics but it is hard - I want to be there for her but sometimes I know all she wants is the attention and ""pity"" from me. 

I still want to be her friend (in 3 weeks we will be going into different stages of our program of study so I won't be seeing her everyday anymore, which might do the friendship some good and give us some more space) but I don't feel like I can keep being the person she wants me to be anymore. 

Of course this is all very subjective to my point of view haha, was wondering if any of you have had similar experiences or any advice to share. Thank you in advance!",22Oct2017,1

246,"This is a stream of consciousness post.

Most people would look at what I have in terms of a job, money, possessions, and probably kill to attain it. Yet I hate my life.

I am 29 years old. I have a high paying $90k a year job in the CS field, I have good money saved. Yet I have never had a girlfriend, I have never had sex, I barely have any friends. My routine is pretty much to go to work, come home, and sit alone on reddit in my apartment.

I've always been into music and still am. Played guitar for 10+ years, have been into electronic music too. I used to record a lot, and recently bought some new equipment but even that is losing its appeal. I come home from the 9-5 and just don't want to do anything but sleep. 

In the past, my life was pretty much the same. Come home from school, and sit on the computer all night or play video games. I barely ever went out with friends. Never went to prom or anything like that.

In college I commuted, so I would go to classes, then drive back home to do the same old routine.

I didn't move out of my parents house until 6 months ago. Up until then, they pretty much did everything for me. Cooked my food, did my laundry, etc. It screwed with my mind so much that I felt like the only step forward was to get out, which I did.
But nothing really changed. I now just come home to an empty apartment.

I feel like my life is on autopilot and it's the same shit every day and every week. Do the same routine M-F. Go to the same supermarket every sunday to buy the same items with few variations, Make my sandwiches every night for lunch at work so I can sit and eat them alone at my desk.

I can't stand my job even though it pays well. A few months back I got let go at my last job. I spent about 2.5 months unemployed, which to me was great since I didn't have to worry about money.
However, even during that 2.5 months of unemployment I barely did anything. Spent most of the time sitting in my apartment reading and learning about music production, barely any social interaction besides my parents.

Anyways I recently got a job (which is the $90k job I mentioned), but it is a complete bait and switch. I thought I was going to be doing software development but it turns out I do app support and reporting.

My team is unhelpful. I barely know whats going on day to day. During 1 on 1 meetings with my manager I pretend everything is ok, even when its not. It's gotten to the point where I fake sick to get out of work early or take days off, or take work from home days just so that I don't have to go to the office.
All of that further screws with my head and gets me more depressed.

I used to tel myself I was ok with everything. That I preferred being alone but I don't. I am worried that at this point I will be forever alone.

I am way past the age where it's still acceptable to have no experience with women. I've tried online dating but never have any luck. I've tried both free sites, and dating sites. I've sent hundreds of messages. Trying everything from long personalized messages, to short ""hey how's it going?"" messages. No interest from anyone.

It's gotten to the point where whenever I see an attractive woman, I get super depressed. Especially when she is with a guy whom I feel is not that much better looking than I am.
My sister asks me what I like in a woman and I don't even know. I've only dated like 2 times in my life. Experiences that I should have had 10-15 years ago never happened.

Majority of advice I get is to do things outside the house. Join meetups, etc. I've been trying, and I've attended a few meetups but it's at the point where I have so much anger and hopelessness in me that I can't even enjoy myself at these events.  Even when the events are things I enjoy such as electronic music production.  I can't really find people who are as obsessively into it as I am.

My brain is just filled with constant anger now. I had an interview the other day for another job that didn't go very well. Driving back home I just had negative thought after negative thought. ""How the fuck could you get yourself in this situation? You landed yourself in a job not doing what you want to be doing and not learning anything, and now you're stuck in it. You are a peice of shit""

I've thought about going to my boss on monday for a 1 on 1 and just telling him that I don't like the work I am doing. I get no support. I have no connection with my co workers and to either switch me to a new team, or I walk out the door. I'm too afraid of doing that though.

I don't really see a direction for my life. I save a lot of money every month but I don't even know for what. I have no end game. I don't spend money on much anymore because I pretty much have every gadget, music equipment, etc that I want. I realized that just buying new toys doesn't make me happy.
I used to tell myself I wanted to buy a house to have privacy, but for what? A house for a single person? For what?

The only thing that has given me any joy the last few years is that 2.5 months where I didn't have a job. At least I had time back. I can't stand the damn 9-5 grind every damn day. I really don't know how I can continue any of this for the next 40 years.
I get jealous of anyone who is wealthy enough to never have to work again.

I no longer see a purpose for my life. I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing. I don't know why I am working. I don't know where I'm going or what I want out of life.

It's all bullshit.",22Oct2017,136

254,"So a bit of backstory on this: I am an introverted and obedient person who is easily swayed by others or always follows people, just for the sake of satisfying others. I know, it's extremely foolish to be the person who pleases others, but for some reason, I find it very hard to speak up for myself (I'm a passive person who tends to avoid conflicts and thus, I tend to make sure that others are satisfied as a result). I am also one of those sensitive people who can't take jokes, and take things seriously.

Back in elementary school, because of my inept social skills, I'm always regarded as the person that no one cares about. So whenever I do group assignments and stuff like that, I normally take the initiative of being the hard worker that does whatever the leader assigns me to do. Although I am great at doing things, sometimes it leads to people taking advantage of me, since I don't know how to reject or speak up. Again, I try to avoid this by just doing it, because I don't want to stir up any conflict. Even when I hang out with friends or classmates, I was just the dude who stood behind the crowd, looking like I was part of the conversation, but really wasn't.

Eventually, one of the more arrogant and extroverted douchebags would bully me for my shyness in elementary school said: ""All you do is follow others, like a dog and his master. You're a worthless, antisocial person who will never get any friends. You'll never be a leader in life and will always depend on others."" At first I shrugged it off, but those words kept on echoing in my head, even to this day (I had a problem making friends in elementary school, and was bullied for being introverted and ""antisocial"".) This bullying lasted till high school, and although I have made new friends that are either introverted or don't mind my social awkwardness, I still find myself being socially awkward, and never really talking to anyone unless they approach me. I am still quite passive and lack confidence as a result.

I really need some help on this issue, how do I boost my confidence and self-esteem, learn to be less sensitive, and most importantly, learn how to talk with others without being socially awkward and fearing that they will judge me? Any constructive criticism would be appreciated! :)

261,"I've been feeling lonely lately, and I feel as if I don't have people to talk to. I intentionally stopped reaching out to people because I'm always one to initiate things, just to see what would happen.

Nobody seems to care if I'm here or not, so I don't reach out to anyone.

I know this was something I should have asked about but I trusted them and they didn't tell me until after I discovered the bedbugs myself. I immediately moved out taking only my cats, clothes ran through the dryer, and a few unaffected possessions. The majority of my stuff was left behind under the promise that they would treat it. It has been over a year and no effort has been made to do so. Ive been over a few times to collect things from my old room and can confirm that the bed bugs are still there as my boyfriend had one crawling up his leg after less than two minutes of standing there. 

Some things I have already decided to abandon but there are some that I simply can't get rid of whether they are irreplaceable or don't belong to me. Mainly including books, clothes, video game systems, miscellaneous items, and an upholstered chair. Financially I can't afford to get it professionally treated myself even though I know it's the only way to be sure and i know they will not do it on their own as they have admitted to me within the last few weeks that they knew about it months before i moved in (trying not to vent too much here but it's been frustrating for the last year). I'm hoping that some over the counter bed bug killers will work and i would really like to know specifics if anyone has managed to treat it themselves. Another concern is that my former roommates and i all have pets, though they do not currently use this room.
