1,"First of all, in class this teacher is very nice to me. I am in a higher level high school history class and have the teacher that everyone considers ""easier"". He doesn't formally teach us much, he makes us do these ""experiments"" to learn about a country/topic. Every term he has a essay that is worth 95% of the grade for that term. The past two terms I have had both essays graded and have got B- on both. He explained to us in class that HIS trick for grading essays is that he reads the first sentence and the last sentence of a paragraph then skims the rest. Rest assured, I have had this terms essay reread / edited by many people. Still (as stated prior) I earned a B-. I am uncertain what I am to do. He said my topic sentences are wrong, but in my ""harder"" English class I never get marked off for topic sentences. I never get marked off for anything similar to what he marks me off for in my English class... (note, my English teacher is known to be much harder) Also last term he never actually sent me the corrections to my essay unless I went up and asked him. He never hands back tests / corrections for anything. From my perspective he could be grading them all wrong. I don't know what to do? The teacher is grading my 95% of the term essay by ""skimming"" it... what should I do?",11Dec2017,1
2,"I've fucked up. I had a really rough semester at university (my mum passed away, among other things) and I'm very far behind on one of my subjects. I've only watched a handful of lectures out of the 33. The exam is in 2 days. I also have another exam the day before for another subject (not really behind on that, but would like to revise at least a little).

The subject is neuroscience 101. The exam is 50% multiple choice and 50% short answer. There's no revision guide, textbook, or past exams. I've exhausted all extensions, etc. The exam I'm sitting is the supplementary one. There's nothing else the university can do to help.

I'm panicking and the panic is almost paralyzing. It's not possible to watch all the lectures in this time frame (and take in the content), so I'm really unsure where to start and what to do. What would you guys recommend doing? How do I determine what the most important things are? What would be the most efficient way of studying?

Thanks",11Dec2017,1
6,"Me and this other person started a job together. Because we were both new, we sort of hung out with each other until we got to know other people in the office. Well, it’s been 10 months now and... I’ve started becoming more acquainted with other people but she now just follows me around. When I want to have lunch, she goes with me. When I’m making coffee in the morning, she follows me there too. I haven’t said anything (yet), I just sort of smile and greet her. But it’s kinda getting on my nerves :(

 She’s not a bad person. She’s actually very nice. But I can’t be her friend. I just want to cut off completely... does that make me kind of a shitty person? The type of person people on Reddit complain about?",11Dec2017,1
8,"Because of this, I feel very conflicted. Should I leave that beta alone and possibly miss out on something great? Or should play it and get semi depressed when I know I can't get the game afterwards?

The reason I can't get theses game is because my family has been trying to settle in the US for a few years now, and we still have many expenses to pay. I do not want to be buying a bunch of games and hurting my family budget. We're not poor, but we're not in a place for just buying whatever we want. I do still get games, but they're few and far between (not counting free games). What makes this worse is when all my friends start playing whatever new game comes out, and I'm stuck alone playing a game that, while still playable and very fun, is not ""the thing"", so I can't play it with my friends as much.",11Dec2017,2
10,"I was heavily bullied in the beginning of high school, which destroyed my self confidence and paralyzed me socially. The years before, I was always a sociable guy. Now that I'm in college I'm beginning to refind my self-confidence, humour and social skills. But talking to women is still a mystery to me, considering I didnt gain any experience throughout high school, while all of my friends have already gotten laid. Help ?",11Dec2017,3

12,"So, I'll try to make this as short as possible;

This past spring, I had my first girlfriend, let's call her Girl A. A was amazing, sweet, kind and generous and funny. Unfortunately, she broke up with me about 2 months in, citing she needed to take a break. Of course, I let her. I just wanted her happy. I waited and waited all spring and most of summer, but she never came. I buried the emotional pain pretty quickly, almost immediately after we ""went on a break"". This past month or 2, I started seeing her again, although it's still a little awkward (were both in drama club at my school. We had to star on Cinderella, and she was titular character, i was the prince.) 

By this point, I had gotten myself another girlfriend, Girl B. I've dated B for almost 3 times as long as Girl A (our 5 Month was a couple days ago). Now, all these feelings I had buried for Girl A are suddenly coming back up, and I find myself most nights missing Girl A, and wanting to spend time with her. I will absolutely NOT cheat on B with A. Girl B is amazing. She cares so much about people, and about me of course. However recently, I find myself growing apathetic to the relationship, little by little. I don't want to break up with her, because I feel like it'll kill her. I don't even want to aay I need a step back. She's a very emotional person and puts a lot of things on herself, and even if o say ""it's all me"" she'll still interpret it as ""it her fault"". 

So I guess my question is, how do I overcome these feelings?/what do I do with my relationship?

Tl;dr buried my emotions for my ex. They came back and I'm in a relationship pickle",11Dec2017,1
13,"Basically one of my bros, lets call him Chuck, got married and now feels like we single folks leave him out of things. I don't really go out or socialize a lot anyways, but now he's asking to hangout with me more. I only go out with 1 friend, once a week and its not him. Chuck got pretty salty when he heard about this. It did not help that we were making plans in front of Chuck. Chuck asked me about this one day and explained how he felt. Chuck is my bro and I don't want him feeling left out. So I offered him 1 hangout, once a week just on different day. Our very own thing. Only all the days I picked were ""date nights"" with his wife. This is why I hate having married friends.
Frankly, Chuck and his wife are always joined at the hip and rarely do anything alone. They also get a little protective over each other. It's hard to know the boundary, as someone outside the relationship. We had a guy at work do Chuck's wife a favor (took care of some work while she handled an emergency), and he spoke to the gent about it. Chuck felt like as her husband, he should've handled it. I like them as people and I'm happy they're married. But on the friendship front, things have been uncomfortable since they got serious. I never said anything about it being uncomfortable and I didn't think I'd need to. I figured I would just move on with life. I don't want to have to tip toe around Chuck and his wife. I mean her and I are friends too, I don't want to feel like I need to minimize my role as a friend. I also don't want to invite Chuck some where and he bring her along...awkward.
What do you guys think? Have you been through this? Do you have any advice?",11Dec2017,1
14,"I'm in a very toxic job, currently working at a school with kids and teachers who treat me like crap, I wanted to get into a creative field in what I have my degree in, but I applied for another school in a similar position that's close to my home and pays more BEFORE I came to the realization that I don't like working with kids and teachers and I should ""follow my dreams,"" but the other school has now offered me a position but for some reason I feel hesitant because I worry that one of the creative jobs I applied to will contact me after I start the new job. But I also don't want to get greedy and end up stuck in my current job or with NO job at all.


BUT, this is also the only job offer I have gotten since I started my job search in September. Not sure if I should risk getting stuck in my current, miserable job for an indefinite amount of time, and wait for a creative job...or end up taking the new job, only to have a creative job offer AFTER I sign on with the new school.


There's no question I want out of my current job, BUT, the hard thing is this coming week will be the last week before winter break-I work during winter break but no one else is around, really, so I kind of need to put in my resignation this week because I'd like to announce it to everyone so I can properly say goodbye to everyone at my current job that I DO like.


I'm also scared that this new school could be worse than my current...but then again my current is pretty bad. If nothing else, my commute goes to 5 minutes against traffic vs. my current 30 minute, often traffic filled current commute. The new school is also offering more money than my current job.


Ugh, I am an over-thinker and a worrier, so this is hard for me. I know I want out of my current job but I just don't know if this job offer should be the one to get me out of it.

Do I take the new job? Do I stay in my current job indefinitely and hope for a job in my field??? I really want to go the ""follow your dreams"" route but I have no idea how long it will take to find a job that fulfills my dreams. But I'm so scared the job I got an offer for will be worse than my current job. ",11Dec2017,2
15,"Guys I really need help and someone to talk about this to. I know it’s long but please read it and comment anything

My ex is called L and the douche is called R. My ex is known for her self respect. 

L hooked up with R a month before her and I met. They stopped hooking up because he didn’t want more than hooking up and she did.

After her and I met they were still friends. On our first few dates he’d text her telling her to ditch me and hang out with him instead. One time he told her to come hook up in a park’s bathroom. Her reply was always “why would i ditch a guy that cares about me for a guy that wants to use me”.

After a while, her and I broke up because of religion/family issues, neither one of us wanted it. To try and forget about me, she hooked up with someone else. It was R. She called me the next day crying and said she wants me back and she told me what happened with R. We got back together. I told her i’m not comfortable with them being friends, and she said she understands and she’ll limit it to only “hi”. For a few months all she’d say is what a douche he is and how she hates him

When school started again, they became friends again. They’d talk. A lot of our fights from then on were about him and how she said she wouldn’t be friends with him. Almost all our fights were about him. 

After a while i’d hear more and more about him. It was getting annoying. At one point while her and I were in a bad place, I flipped and told her I don’t want them to he friends. She told me I can’t tell her what to do, we had a big fight, they stayed friends. I continued to hear about him. R then goes up to L’s best friend and says he doesn’t want to hook up with L, and says he wants to get with the best friend.

A month ago, while we were happy, she randomly breaks up with me. She says she needs to focus on herself and too much of both our time is invested in eachother, and she says lets go on a break. She says she isn’t going to hook up with anyone during it. She also says she’s 99.9 percent sure we’re getting back together later. 

Her and R start talking a lot more. He flirts with her heavily, and she tells me her replies which were also heavily flirtatious. I tell her “you’re literally flirting with him” and she says she didn’t know she was flirting with him. Then she does it again “accidentally” to the point where he’s comfortable sending her shirtless pictures with the caption “i’m gonna be getting abs soon”

They continue to talk, her and i still talk and facetime everynight. 

At one point she needed pictures of him for an assignment (she’s in charge of the yearbook) and he wouldn’t send them unless she sends him naughty pictures of her. She says omg what a douche and doesn’t do it

A few nights ago, while we were facetiming, he was texting her asking to hang out. She says “i’m not that easy”. He says “thats what i like about you, stay that way. I really want to hook up with you” to which she says “last week you wanted to hook up with my best friend”. They continue talking but we drop the subject of what they’re talking about

On saturday, while we’re facetiming, i see her smile, go on pause, and say she has to go. She says she’ll text me in 10 minutes

She doesn’t end up texting, she calls me later at like 11 at her friends house. I say good night and sleep

This morning, on the phone, she says “hey so are we supposed to tell eachother everything?” I say “yes”. She says “even if you’ll get really mad?” I say “yes. She tells me she got with someone the other night. I say who. She says who do you think. She fucking hooked up with R

I fucking go off on her, telling her that everyone knows her for her self respect but she threw that self respect out the window by hooking up with a guy as douchey as this. I say I can’t fucking believe this, I fell in love with you because of how much self respect you had and now you just throw it out the window, I don’t even know who the fuck you are now

She says “i get it. But i never make mistakes, so its okay that i made this one mistake.”

I continue to say how could you hook up with someone like that, i say “i was hoping you got with (a different guy) instead, but fucking R? Are you serious? R?”

She says i have no right to be mad at her, she says she cant tell me anything because i’ll get mad like this, she says she can’t date someone that says these things to her, and then she says she doesn’t want to talk to me and hangs up

What the fuck. I have no problem with her hooking up with someone while we aren’t together. But the fact that she prides herself on her self respect, the fact that literally the night before she told him “i’m not easy”, she gets with him the next day. What the fuck. 

One of my friends said i didn’t have a right to react because i made her tell me, but she brought it up by asking “am i supposed to tell you everything even if you’ll get really mad?” 

I’m fucking pissed. Not because she hooked up with someone. Because she ruined the idea of her and her self respect by hooking up with a guy like this. She’s honestly so stupid, ik that sounds mean but she told me while they were hanging out they talked about how he was a douche and they resolved it. He was just telling her what she wants to hear so he can hook up with her, that’s the kind of guy he is. And she stupidly fell for it. Ugh i’m so fucking stressed. What do you guys think

My sister and I would like to get her a tablet (windows/android based - I know nothing about Apple), something better than her Kindle that she has now. On top of this we would like to put some type of voice to text program on it, my sister tells me that when she was younger mom used to like writing short stories.

Our hope is that she could maybe talk to text short stories, and then maybe get with a forum or ""writers group"". This would give her mind something to engage in, as well as some social interaction.

I would also like to set up some swivel arm mount thing for her, but that is secondary to the tablet, voice to text set up. Hopefully this won't all be too terribly expensive. I truly appreciate any advice or help that you can offer. Thank you.

So after about a billion back and forths and no follow up to get me in to actually SEE the ear guy I thought I would ask you guys seeing as how the doctor's have proven to be useless at actually getting me in to see them.

It starts off slow as sort of a headache I guess? And then as the song goes on I get really bad pain that lasts for 2-3 days. It's usually only music or the television that causes this reaction.

32,"Me and my mom are from Thailand and we moved to England after my mom married my step father. My mom's brother who is our only Thai family member remaining lives by himself in Thailand and in the same house he and my mom lived in growing up. He took ownership of it after their parents passed away. 

For pretty much the entirety of my mom's adult life, my uncle has depended on my mom for money because he has no skills, qualifications or job opportunities in a rural village. She still sends money every month. 

The problem is, my uncle has been an alcoholic and addicted all his life and that is the only thing he spends my mum's money on. It's gotten to the point where he has sold his mobile phone to buy more alcohol. The only means of communication we have with him. He even tries to get booze on credit knowing he won't ever be able to pay it back. My mom had to contact everyone who owns a shop to stop accepting credit. Everyone in the village also knows him as the failure and village drunk.

More recently, after we visited him and flew back to England. He randomly decided to get married to a girl who is half his age, we've never heard of before and who he had just met in one day. And the best news is, she has 2 kids of her own already. 

I think my mom is finally getting tired of his ways and when she finally was able to contact with him it is always the same lecture but he never listens. The most heartbreaking thing I heard was ""you're my older brother, I shouldn't be taking care of you.""

so I'm a soon-to-be university grad with a major in criminal justice and a minor in business living in Ontario, Canada. I've tried to narrow down what exactly would be the best course of action for me going into my post-grad life. I was originally thinking of pursuing post-post secondary education and doing a 1-year paralegal program and become a certified paralegal, however, I'm not too sure if I want to jump right back into school again after just leaving. My second option would be to jump into the job market and find an internship of sorts - just to help get me some actual relevant experience. However, I am thinking if I'm going to get a job I want to move to Calgary - I frankly hate Ontario and have always wanted to live in Calgary.

35,"I'll give a little background info to better explain my case...

Up until I was 18 (almost 21 now) I was pretty much a lost cause when it came to happiness. The absolute lowest point in my life was when I became depersonalized for roughly 6 months, only contacted 4 people and literally only left the house about six or seven times within a six month time span for doctor visits. 

That being said, I know the feeling of extreme depression, but I also know the feeling of true happiness. When I finally worked through/around/with being depersonalized I did everything in my power to pursue extreme happiness. I can proudly say I succeeded and lived on high almost two years.

Now, I walk a thin line of being both overjoyed and miserable. Some mornings I wake up absolutely wrecked but about midway through the day I feel right as rain. Other days I'll go all day feeling invincible only to wake up in the middle of the night wishing I was someone and somewhere else...

I don't think it's a bipolar disorder or anything like that. The negative feelings are similar to that of a claustrophobic sensation- like I'm stuck in this horrible suit of skin and murky wasteland waters..

For the other 5 days of the week, we're both in camp. Almost always, you'll see us together. There never would be one without the other. Everyone knows this, and we're just the closest of buds.


A couple months ago, he told me about this girl that he liked. Let's call her Zae. Me being his best mate, got super excited for him. I asked for all the details, did all the teasing and stuff, and egged him on to try and make a move and go out with her. Things were a bit shaky for em, but it seemed like it was working.


Last month was his birthday. Zae and I both planned a surprise birthday for him. She planned for the cake, got a couple of his close friends, while I did the gifts and got another 3 of his close friends. We went over to his place, surprised him, and everything went well. It was mostly my idea, but I gave credit to Zae, so that maybe he'll make a move, and it worked.

Just yesterday, I posted something on my insta story, and Zae DM-ed me about it. We talked a bit, and I decided to ask her how things were going with him and her. She said ""yea, we're currently dating. I'm really excited"". I was heartbroken. Why didn't my best friend tell me this? I would have expected that at the very least, he would have told me something. But he didn't. I've told him before, that I was scared that we might break contact, since I've had a bunch of friends that disappeared as soon as they got a girl/boyfriend. I don't want that to happen to him. I treasure this guy loads. He did reassure me that we won't break contact. 

Even yesterday, when I was texting him, he said he was gonna go to bed, so I was like ""Aight, see you man"". And then his girl texts me and says like ""omg he finally replied me."" and she said they were talking for about 2 to 3 hours. Why lie to me tho? I want the best for you, and if you just told me that you were gonna talk to her, I'd been completely fine. But instead, you still haven't told me that you're in a relationship with her, and you even lied to me. I don't wanna lose you man. You're the closest friend I have.

Am I just overthinking? I really wanna be happy for him, but it just feels like it sucks that he's in a relationship, and I just feel like I'm gonna be thrown away. Help me. Why does everyone just forget me?

47,"I work for a small company (there’s 6 of us in the office). My boss recently hired her daughter (late 20s) after she quit her job. She doesn’t have experience in the area that she was hired for, and she’s also working from home a couple states away.  

She has a ton of ideas, but does not contribute anything to the process of achieving those ideas. Being a small company, many of us wear many different hats, and have multiple projects that we must divide our attention between.

She does not acknowledge our prioritization of these various projects, and we get frequently yelled at by her mother (my boss) for not doing the tasks her daughter assigns us. However, my boss also says that we are all of the same status (no ones higher than the other) and that we should tell her when we can’t work on something she’s asked us to (but then we get yelled at for not helping her later). 

It’s incredibly uncomfortable to talk to my boss about our frustrations, as it is her own flesh and blood we’re talking to her about. 

I realize this is just a difficult situation. But it’s a huge bummer because, prior to her hire, I loved my job and I love the mission of the company. But the last month and a half have been miserable for me, and I’m constantly stressed out and dreading going to work every day (when I used to look forward to it). I know my coworkers feel similarly.

50,"So I'm pretty excited as a not 20 something anymore man-child of getting my first place I've mostly looked for and am moving to entirely on my own volition, and am prepared to sign the lease for it tomorrow but a couple things are setting off some alarm bells.  I've already viewed the place twice and it looks very nice but these have me concerned:

-The 2 bedroom apartment was about 95% spotless clean *except* there was some dust/dirt covering the top shelf in the closet of the master bedroom.  Otherwise baring a small crack in the ceiling going to living room and some fix up things it's pristine, but I'm concerned it's evidence of pests.  But may be nothing.

-The property manager has brought up a few times how bikes are pretty regularly stolen and also mentioned not keeping valuables in the cars.  Walked it once at night and (at least that night, weekday) it was very quiet and seemed calm/pleasant.  Supposedly kids run around the place so it can't be that bad?  I'm probably overly paranoid but still a little concerned.   Trulia said lowest crime in the area, fwiw.

-What may be the clincher is that he put in the last email sent to me that the apartment will have been sprayed for pests along baseboards, cabinets and behind fridge/stove.  I read in another renting advice thread that if they're advertising heavily how on top of pest control they are, that may indicate a problem and it should be expected that it's pest free and not be something announced.  He only brought it up this email, so it may just be making sure it's a point covered and I have nothing to worry about.  But there was also that dust/dirt on the shelf.  Can get a pic if desired.

-Or the clincher may be that there are very few outlets with grounds, and in the master bedroom which I intended to take it there are zero.  Reading about this it may not be a concern, and one of my friends says they're living without grounded outlets and are fine.  I assume an adapter and beefy surge protector may be adequate?  The outlets don't look damaged, I will try to get a tester before tomorrow's final walk-through.

-It's about $2200/mo 780 sq ft, $800 off first month but we have to pay gas/sewer/water/CAM, $40 extra  for 2 cats and $100 approx renters insurance for a year.  $700 deposit.  Does this sound like a bad deal for south bay area?


This sucks as I'm second guessing this pretty late in the game and before this I was so stoked for it, though anything other than my current living situation will be an improvement.  I so desperately want to get out of my current situation, having been in it for a while but finally getting fed up with it (just a really run down place, don't really want to get into details on it) that I probably really rushed into this.  The property manager seems nice, if a little stern and in your face and a bit condescending, but also on top of things which I can understand.  The place looks clean, quiet, nothing crazy going on as far as I can tell.  It's a clean place with a very nice kitchen and bathroom and a lot of windows/light which I also kind of appreciate.  And (from my knowledge) the price can't really be beat in the bay area.  Maybe too good to be true though, and if you really think I should run screaming from this I should probably know now.  Then again, any place is going to have its issues, I suppose.  And it doesn't seem like regular burglaries/shootings/stabbings/drug deals occur round here.   I feel like I have to move out sooner the better and don't have much free time working as much as I do.  I'll be sure to have everything documented and I've tried to be very thorough in questioning them, at least.

tl,dr: nice 2br apartment for $2200/mo in bay area, possible issues with lack of 3 prong outlets, spraying for pests mentioned offhand in last email from manager, possible theft issues.

Appreciate the time taken and any responses, go easy on me, etc.

52,"[Here](https://imgur.com/a/B0IQu) is a link to the Imgur set related to this post. It is very important, and I highly suggest you look at it while reading this.

Yesterday, snow stuck to the ground in my area for the first time in Winter 2017. It was nice to sit in and watch TV indoors for the day. Today, though, I had to go back to work. My work started at about 2:00, so I slept in a little. At about 12:00, I was having coffee and admiring the snow when I noticed something. Foot prints, starting from my pathway, stopping at my door, and continuing into the backyard. I am positive I hadn't come out in the snow at that point, so I was really weirded out. That was when I decided to grab my phone and start taking pictures, which is what the linked collection consists of. I started where it started out: The secondary front door. Then, I made my way around the front yard and into the back, snapping pictures as I went along (though only one is shown in the album). The footprints stopped again near the sliding glass door to the basement. Then, whoever  it was snooping around climbed up the stairs of the back porch and stopped again near the glass door to the Piano Room. After that, the foot prints went into the driveway, and then disappeared. 

It was only after I took the photos of the foot prints did I notice: This guy was looking *into* my house. As you can see from the photos, my driveway and walkway were both shoveled shortly before. As you can also see from the set, the walkway leads into the front porch and, by extension, primary front-door. That would explain how the footprints started and ended.

Obviously, my first instinct was too call the police, and they said they'd be on their way. Afterwards, I called work and explained that I might be a little late. Thankfully, my boss was understanding, and said I wouldn't get penalized. When the police arrived, they asked me what exactly I had done in the snow. I told them all I did in the snow was ride my quad and went back in (Hence why you can see tire tracks in the snow). They even checked the size of my boots to identify that, no, I was not kidding them. Afterwards, they said that the neighbors would be questioned, and offered me to join a protection program against things like this. I declined, as no one who's close to me is in my area, and the police station doesn't sound like a very comfortable place. Some people might call that dumb, but I'm gonna try my hardest to keep this freak away from me. I've already started by putting masking tape on all windows visible on the first floor. Is there anything else I can do to help me in this situation?",11Dec2017,0
53,"It’s a long story, bear with me. But, I was never close to my dad. Almost every single memory I have of him as a child is of him  whooping me or yelling at me ever since I was little. And he would always be at work except for when he’d pick me up at school, so we never got time to actually connect. I would always be scared of him as a child, whenever I heard him come home I was scared that he would find something to yell about or whoop me for something. I’m sure he didn’t mean bad, he loves me and he has a shitty way of expressing himself because it’s probably how he was raised too. But I just never developed that connection with him, and him not coming home until 10:00 every night doesn’t help.          


And my mom, it started when I was in 7th grade. I wrote a dirty rap song on a sheet of paper as a joke and she found it and talked to me for about 2 hours about it. And she kept asking me if I watched porn, (she looked through my laptop history), and kept taking the joke song serious as if I was really a delinquent, and it really just felt like an interrogation—and her tone of voice didn’t help. After that day, I didn’t feel like I could trust my mom anymore, I also didn’t have any friends at my school so I felt like everyone hated me and her doing what she did kind of set me off and just made me uncomfortable around her. I also felt slighted because she made an issue out of something I didn’t see as bad, and I just started distancing myself after that, subconsciously. I just lost my desire to talk, I felt like I had to hide my emotions, I don’t know why, but I never smiled around her anymore and I would grow silent when she came around. From 7th grade to Freshman year of high school, I don’t think I had many conversations with her. I was always depressed/anxious because I had no friends and I had a 1.6 gpa. And whenever she talked to me she always sounded nervous, as if she was talking to a stranger, but the only things she would mention was my schoolwork which just turned into an interrogation everytime as I only gave one word answers and she would always try to nervous/annoyedly/angrily pry answers out of me. It didn’t make me feel welcome, I would always be monotone and not say much because I didn’t want to. 

I got myself together eventually and pulled my gpa up sophomore year but I still didn’t talk to her much. I just didn’t feel like it. I wanted to but I just felt awkward about it, and didn’t have the motivation. Whenever I think about initiating conversation I just don’t, I don’t know why I just really don’t feel like talking much around her. Sometimes we have long conversations but she keeps bugging me about talking to her and my dad more. She keeps asking why I give one word responses to one word response questions, and keeps acting like I purposely try to offend her. She literally just screamed my name, (were in two different sections of the house) and I hollered back “yes mommy” and she says “why do you have to answer me like that”...  and I said “so you can hear me.” Am I supposed to sound all enthusiastic and happy go lucky when she screams my name to tell me to do something? It makes no sense at all. It’s one of the things that makes me not want to talk to her. She complains a lot, and whenever she talks to me she doesnt talk normally. It’s like she’s holding me to some kind of standard and it makes me uncomfortable. I act different around my parents than I do everyone else, and I’m actually more comfortable and open around me dad now than I am with my mom. My dad has toned down over the years, and sometimes I’ll sit and watch YouTube videos or just talk to him and enjoy it. But with my mom it’s a different story. It’s like she’s suffocating me  and I have to force myself to talk. Her always nagging me to talk more believe it or not doesn’t make me want to talk more. She’s almost always serious and it’s annoying, I don’t know.

I want to get closer to my parents, but idk what to do. ",11Dec2017,1

I think because of that, I myself have never been in a relationship. I tend to be emotionally guarded and don't trust people so easily. I also have been struggling with what I assume is undiagnosed depression and anxiety that I've been dealing with since about 6th grade. Which doesn't benefit me obviously.

He is constantly at a bar and most the time he has been drinking. He has missed out on work, will drink at work (we work at a bar/restaurant) and I'm tired of him disappointing me and not feeling like I'm emotionally being satisfied. His drinking will occasionally send him to a dark place, a suicidal place. He has recently tried to gang himself while under the influence. This was a bit of a last straw for me and we broke up... I am trying to figure out if I should try to mend our relationship and save it because he does say he wants to get help..I don't think he will go inpatient though. Also when asked today If he would see a therapist with me, together so that I could know how to help him he said he didn't know if he was ready for that. I'm exhausted of this behavior.

61,"I was working in a field that is known to not be the most professional and took on a new position that was a bit higher than my skill level at a somewhat disorganized new business.

When I didn't quite fit, I felt the pressure from my superiors and coworkers about little things that weren't really a part of the job; picking on my personality, things I wear or my haircut. All in all a toxic environment. Whenever I'd mention something little that would bother me, one or more coworkers would try to do those things more often to get under my skin. I eventually quit when I realized this wasn't the best environment for me to be in.

My family, which involves my mother's boyfriend who had a career as a social worker, heard about my recounting of events and made me feel as if a lot of it either didn't occur, or that I was being oversensitive. They would emulate the behaviors I noticed at the job that were done to annoy me, and then claim that I was imagining that anything like that was going on. It made me feel pretty insane for a while..

So flash forward and I am still not doing well emotionally, go figure, and I had talked to my mother about some of the events of the previous months, and she tries to show me symptoms of delusional/paranoid disorders asking if they fit. I was pretty upset.

On top of that, around the same time she had admitted that she along with the family had been challenging me on the events at work and events between me and my family; and testing me on things she thought were triggers. My mother claimed it was a normal and healthy thing to do. Some of it had originated from her boyfriend the social worker, who had diagnosed me with other disorders before. My sister who is working towards being a social worker herself had apparently approached my father telling him that there were a couple of diagnosis's floating around about everything I had been dealing with. It was either OCD, Delusional, Borderline, or Aspbergers (lol)

Somehow my reaction to all of this was unhealthy according to my mother, sister and the boyfriend but I point out that it's kind of insane to put someone through the wringer like that psychologically. To me they made me feel like I was imagining so many things that were actually going on, that they had admitted had been going on. Yet they still seem to take the time to try and trigger me to see how I react.

Someone, anyone, give me some sort of advice. As it stands it seems like they expect me to put up with them pushing my buttons because it's ""toughening me up"" or something when I'm just reliving trauma at this point. On top of this particular issue, there is a lot of deep seeded family dysfunction that's been going on my whole life. Alcoholic, Inappropriate, anger issues with my father; Anxiety laden, controlling mother; Belittling controlling sister; and this boyfriend who sits on his pedestal diagnosing everyone around him with all sorts of disorders.

I feel like I've lived through Munchhausen by proxy. Everyone's getting a psychological need met by me being sick with some insane disorder both from the anxiety standpoint of my mother, to my mom's boyfriend having his need to be self fulfilled about his credentials as a social worker. It's all ego, control and anxiety all the way down.

I don't know what to do. I haven't been working because I've felt like shit, and It's hard to get a job when you left the last one because your superiors made fun of you and you weren't up to par. And I'm stuck in this situation of being pushed around psychologically to the point where I do not want to be a part of family gatherings, or even spend time with the people that I feel should lift me up, not challenge me constantly.

I guess I don't know what advice I'm specifically asking for.. I just need someone to make me feel like this isn't all my fault.",11Dec2017,2

We're 2 females in our mid 20s, she has a young child. I've lived here for 8-9 months now, she acts like she owns me. Literally.

At first I offered to help her out every now and then, she's a single mother and i felt sorry for her. But then I find out she does absolutely nothing, she's on welfare, is home almost all the time and considers her child a full time job. Which sure i guess kids can be a handful, though she's at fault here for having one so young and unprepared.

She owns animals and doesn't take care of them properly, she's neglectful towards her son, has actually physically harmed the animals, i personally think she's mentally ill.

and call me a slut. When I came out to her as trans, she cried for an hour, then made the ""smart"" decision a month later to ban me from researching anything about anything to do with LGBTQ+ topics,  installing a Google Circle and blocking both reddit and tumblr on my phone. She's done worse, but that's the important thing. How do I live with her, a person who thinks they're helping but isn't?

79,I'm a 17 year old female.  I don't know how to flirt to save my life.  help?,11Dec2017,5
80,"My grandparents are in their late 80’s and instructed me a few months ago to point out anything in their house that I would like to have inherited. We are close enough that I’ve already expressed what items have sentimental value to me and some items I’ve been sent home with already. The problem is, I love their actual house and I’d be willing to buy it from them but I’m unsure how to go about the conversation since obviously I wouldn’t be needing it until they had both passed. Their home is probably one if not their biggest asset and it’s so expensive, that I’m honestly unsure how to bring the topic up with them. 

A few things to know upfront:

-I work in the mortgage industry so we have been working on saving up for a home and working on getting our credit up in the mid 700’s. I am certain we could afford it. 

-If I had to guess what they were planning on doing with the house, I would say that they would sell it and split the money between family members. There’s only me, my 2 brothers, 2 cousins, aunt, and mother. I know they probably wouldn’t give the home outright to anyone. My parents have amazing income but the worst debt/credit. They’re horrible with money and they don’t take care of their possessions (letting 6 animals poop in house and they both smoke inside an 800 sqft house, etc). My aunt lives out of state and barely visits. My mother feels entitled to the majority of my grandparents’ possessions because she lives in the same town as them and occasionally helps them out. If any one person was to be given the entire house, they would definitely be harassed by my mother.  

-The reason I want to buy the home is because I have always admired their style of living. My grandmother was a lot like me. She was a working mom and had a great social life. Even with all the stress of work she was still such an amazing home maker. She loved having guests over and serving others. Her home has always felt like my home and I really have built so many amazing memories in their house. It would also be nice to think during Christmas (our favorite holiday) to decorate the house with her decorations in memory of her every year, etc. Anyway, other than that, it's not really any type of historical family home.

-Another added benefit to me buying the home after they pass, is that I am neutral between my mother and my aunt’s rivalry. By me owning the home, I would be able to keep them from storming in and just taking whatever they want out of spite for the other and hopefully I could continue my grandmothers dying wish which was to keep the peace between them. I've also been the one to help them organize their house periodically and really enjoy doing those things. They have accumulated so much stuff and I know in the end I will also have to be the one to clean it all up. It just makes sense for us to live there for that and again, I'm more than willing to pay for the property. I love everything about the home and buying a home is something we have wanted to do for quite some time. 

How should I ask my grandparents about their intentions with the home and the possibility of us buying it from them? Has anyone been in a similar situation? I have no idea how to enter a business negotiation with my grandparents’ which the date of purchase would be surrounding their death. I love them both dearly and don’t want to hurt or offend them in any way but I’m afraid if I don’t say something I will regret it forever. ",11Dec2017,1
81,"I’m 20 M, have a gf of 4 1/2 years, apartment, nice car, steady secure job, and nice stuff. I decided to learn a trade skill instead of going to college. I felt like that was a good idea at the time, but now I can tell it’s taking a toll.

I have no social life, only one ‘friend’, coworkers are just coworkers (don’t hang out outside of work,) etc.. I feel like by not continuing my education at any college I stopped my social life. 

My day consist of waking up, going to work, coming home and sleeping. I have maybe 2-3 hours before I go to bed once I get home. My gf is usually at work so there’s no real communication with her besides the casual text throughout the day.

I had many friends in high school. We talked about going to college, what we’d do, where we wanted to go, what we wanted to see, etc. but I didn’t do anything I talked about doing. I feel like I’m missing out on life by wanting to work as much as I am at such a ‘young’ age. 

Also with being with one person for so long, I feel trapped. I love them, but I want to branch out. I missed out on the, I guess, experimental stage of growing up. Not really with the same gender, just with different girls. 

Did I fuck up by not going to college and staying with one person or is the feelings I’m having null and i just need to suck it up?",11Dec2017,2

84,"Background: This is not about depression, because I don't think I am. I grew up in a third world country and followed the path society or people around me thought would be optimal. That is, studying hard, going to an Ivy League school, and getting a decent job after. I've done all of that.

After spending 2 years at a bulge bracket investment bank on Wall Street, I moved to a smaller investment bank with better hours, thinking the extra time would afford me some time to think about what to do next in my life. 

Nothing has changed. 

I guess because I've always followed what others have told me, I'm a bit lost in life right now. Wall Street is not for me. I'm only there for the money and while I enjoy some of the people I work with, the culture just isn't for me. I'm a fairly introverted person and I don't think I'm very good at embellishing facts. Not even sure what I can do afterwards, but definitely not private equity or hedge funds.

Using my work (and busy schedule) as an excuse, I've not really met anyone new outside of work for the past 2-3 years since I got a job - and while this doesn't particularly disturb me on a daily basis, I do think a large portion of society would think it is abnormal (I feel the same).

Instead, I've been distracting myself with video games (something that I genuinely enjoy doing) for the longest time because its an easy escape (off topic: I just beat Xenoblade Chronicles 2 today), but I think it's about time I confront this issue.

88,"Alright so, 
for the past three years or so I’ve been seriously concerned for my own mental health. I’ve always been sure that something has been kind of... wrong? since I have spent all of my life avoiding people out of extreme fear of embarrassment to the point of never asking anyone for any help even when it would lead to screwing a lot up for myself. But then I started to see things and believe in some really out-there ideas about two years ago. I won’t go into detail, but it’s very irrational. Things got better after a month, but it’s coming back again. 

Here’s the real issue though. My mom refuses to take me seriously. I’ve gotten three psych refs from the same doctor over the past two years and my mother has shot down every single one. Now that these thoughts are creeping back up I’m actually very afraid, especially since I’m in an even worse mindset than I was the first time. I don’t think I can handle this by myself. 

I tried telling her I hallucinated and she joked about it. I tried telling her about the anxiety and she yelled at me for pretending there was something wrong. Although that’s probably my fault that she believes that because I don’t tell her a lot about my life and was saving a lot of details so she didn’t ridicule me for those too. 

I just want her to take me seriously so I can get some help

93,"So.. I've been working at my job for over 16 years.. It's a part time job but I work enough additional hours for it to practically be full time..  The past couple years our union has been negotiating for real full time positions.. 

Everyone I talked to about the position thought I was for sure getting it.. I go above the norm on a daily basis, a lot of the people I work with treat me as though I'm another manager, constantly coming to me with questions about obscure specific things that most people wouldn't know.. I've helped avert minor workplace disasters multiple times this past year and have 5-10+ years of experience over everyone else..

I got sick the weekend before my interview, I showed up the day of my interview having just started to recover and did it without any prior preparation.. I did okay, it could've been a lot better.. but I figured that the interviewers knew me and my work and that would matter more.. Apparently not, as they give it to someone with 10 years less experience than me.. I know I do much better work than them and prioritize a lot better and I was just so dumbfounded..

I've always been willing to go out of my way to accommodate my job while the person who was hired quit for a while and came back at reduced hours in a lower position..

Now every day I go to work, all I can think about is quitting.. My soul always feels like it's burning.. Sometimes my arms suddenly go limp, or my scalp gets abnormally warm and really itchy.. I've been getting a lot of chest pains while I'm at work which is highly unusual for me, I take good care of my body..

I'm not sure what to do, I don't think I can keep working like this.. When I get home, I'm depressed, but I'm not getting chest pains and calm down a lot more..

I wouldn't be able to get a job that pays as well as this one, and I struggle with rent and bills as it is.. I lost my extra hours for a couple weeks and it took me several months to recover financially from that..

96,"Hi Reddit. Hoping you guys can give me some advice through viewing my situation in an objective perspective. My life is pretty much a wreck right now and although I'm trying desperately to make it better, the progress is very small and I'm getting very discouraged. 

So I'm homeless and living in my car with my dogs and SO. We are both working, but currently only temp jobs, the reason for this being the pay periods (daily pay) that are more ideal for our situation. Our car is old and has alot of problems and has broken down twice already. We are trying to build a buffer fund for if something goes wrong but between gas ($20 a day usually), food, expenses, phone bill, storage bill, etc it's been very difficult to get over the $300 mark. We are trying to get enough together to either buy a small camper or get one on payments and put it in an rv park but that's a steep hill to climb too. It's freezing now and we're terrified of making a misstep or just having something go wrong and putting us in a homeless shelter or on the street. Oh yeah as for homeless shelters in our area, they're having a large outbreak of Hepatitis A so we are extra worried about winding up in there. 

Help from family is not really available. Most of my family have essentially disowned me as they don't like my SO and due to them being severe narcissists and very abusive, I have chosen my SO over them. (They say they'll help me but only if I permanently leave my SO). My grandma is very caring and sympathetic but is unable to do anything financial and she lives several states away. She says if we can find a way to get to her we of course have a place to stay but with our car needing repairs coupled with the large gas fund needed to get there it's not an option. We've considered bussing out there but they won't accept dogs larger than 25 pounds and these dogs of ours are both rescues, we can't put them through abandonment again when they think they'll be with us till the end. My SO has very little family to speak of and is somewhat estranged so any help from them isn't really an option.

Anyway, that's kind of the jist of it. I know there's probably more elaboration needed but there's so much to cover that I thought it would be easier to just answer questions as they're asked, so ask anything. I'm just hoping for some advice or insight to get ahead faster. Basically right now we're working where we can and saving what we can. Thanks in advance :)",11Dec2017,1

103,"A little background, I'm a senior in college on track to go to Physical Therapy school. The problem is I realized around the end of my sophomore year that I do not want to be a PT, like at all. Really, I don't even want to work in healthcare anymore. I got here by originally planning on going to medical school, but became a pretty severe hypochondriac and figured being a doctor was not a good idea. So some people suggested I stay in health care but stay away from disease related professions, so here we are at PT. I knew this past spring that I wasn't going to go through with going to PT school and that I should probably get my head straight by taking some time off of school. 

But obviously I did not listen to my instincts and took some classes this fall semester and it has been a complete disaster. My grades have been exceptional through fall of junior year and then dipped in the spring a bit and have now as you can see by the title gone off the deep end.  The entire semester I've felt overwhelming anxiety, a feeling of being completely lost, regret that I didn't go into engineering, and symptoms of depression. I've gotten to the point where I just stopped caring about my classes. I'd look at lectures the night before tests, rarely ever go to class, and constantly forget about homework and sometimes even just not do it. 

Only thing I know for sure is that I am taking next semester off, even though I'm sure there's a good chance I get academic probation anyway. 

I figure my options for right now are:

1 Military, which I think would be good at easing my anxiety by erasing the debt I've built up, something that sort of pressured me into staying in health care so I can graduate on time in order to start paying off my loans.

2 Take the civil service test and become a fireman, something that has been a backup plan of mine since high school. 

3 Just take the time off, switch to full time at my job for a bit and go back in the fall studying something I'm actually interested in. My problem with this route is my gpa is royally fucked and I do not know how I would get into an engineering program. 

I will be getting my advisors take on the situation within the next few days. Any input at all would be helpful, it feels good just to get it off my chest.

115,"This is my first post ever on reddit. I am looking for some help on what my next career choice/decision should be; I will give a little background and just need advice from people who understand the financial industry or software developer world to give some input. 

Here is a quick rundown of my current situation: 
• I am 29 years old, married, and we have a 18 month old, we live in the Salt Lake City, UT area. 
• I have been working for a small national financial advisor firm as an associate to an advisor for a little over 1 year. 
• I have my health and life insurance licenses, and my Series 7 and 63.
• I have been in the investments field for 2.5 years, and commercial banking for 5 years before that.
• I graduated from college 3 years ago with a worthless degree (interdisciplinary studies) and barely graduated with a 2.5 GPA, mostly from lack of discipline and suffering from depression (things are better on both of these, and feel very confident I could pass any schooling needed nowadays, thanks to a very supportive and patient wife).
• Current income is $50k, and we have $37k in combined student loan debt, and an additional $10k in an auto loan, and a CC with a $2000 balance. We are currently renting a small 2 bedroom apt for now. 

My current job is a decent job and I like who I work with, but it has extremely limited upward mobility to becoming an advisor, and it would require me to put in 10+ years in my current position before getting a chance to move up. We are looking to better our financial and personal situation. (ie: by paying off debt, and eventually moving forward with life with purchasing a home,and hopefully having another 2 kids.) 

My two options that we need advice on deciding between are these: 

1. There is a coding bootcamp at the University of Utah, it would cost about $10k with no tuition financing, so we would be forced to borrow from family or put it on a CC. It is a 24 week course and they say I will graduate as a full stack developer. My biggest worry is, that upon graduating would I be able to obtain a good job that would at least pay more or the same as my current job, since at the moment we barely make ends meet as is, and I will need to put in at least 3-5 years before obtaining these great tech jobs that pay well (75k+). 

2. I continue working in my current field and try and sit for my CFP, or try getting a FP&amp;A job or other job in the finance field. I just do not have finance or business degree, and do not know what certification or experience would be required to do other jobs in the financial industry. I do not want to go back and spend another 3-4 years doing a second bachelors unless its absolutely necessary. I know there are good paying jobs out there in this field and feel like I at least have somewhat relevant experience and would not have to start over into an entry level job. Plus my company will do up to $5k yearly in tuition reimbursement.

We feel torn on what path to take. On one hand, I do not want to take on another $10k in debt and potentially have to take either a lower paying job or not get any job as a result of the boot camp. I do know after sticking it out for 3-5 years the better paying jobs will come. On the other hand, I do not want to be in the same job/position in 5 years and stuck in the same position making the same income. I think I could do well at a different area in the finance industry as long as there isn’t a heavy emphasis of cold calling sales. I definitely am not a type A personality and have a hard time being an aggressive salesperson. I do not mind staying at my current job for the next 1-2 years if I have a feasible plan of how I am going to be move forward in my career and am actively working on some sort of schooling or licensing to get me there.

We would appreciate any advice or insight with the coding bootcamps and the realities of long term job and career prospects in the tech industry, and/ or what options are there in the financial industry that I could potentially pursue without necessarily going back and redoing an entire bachelors degree. We also will welcome any general advice on other options perhaps we have overlooked.

116,"So, there's this guy from my hometown that I'm sort of talking to. Our parents are very good friends, and I'm good friends with his sister. We've all known each other for years and we grew up houses away from one another.

But let's back up.

I was in a relationship with someone, but it ended at the end of the summer. This guy, let's call him Bobby, and I started to hang out. We instantly connected. We've always known of each other and our families talked, but we really never knew one another. Anyways, we hung out a lot the week before I left for school in August, and still do, four months later.

We stay out until about 3 or 4am, we make-out, he brings me along to hang with his friends (who I get along with SO well), people ask if we're together. I went to his other sibling's wedding with him. We hang out on weekends when I'm home from college. He came to a concert with me and stayed at my place. He apparently has talked about me with his friends a little. People apparently know he likes me. This has been going on for four months now.

BUT, we never text, and never have talked about what this is. I usually have to initiate hanging out, but I've heard from his family and others that he's really personal and doesn't share much in terms of emotions, so if I wanted to find out, I'd have to be the one to initiate it. We hardly really talk when we're not together, besides random, pointless snapchats, but when we are together it's SO good.

I know he likes me and it's clear I like him. But out of these four months and multiple hang outs and stuff, we have not once addressed this elephant in the room of ""what are we?"" I really don't know what to do. My friends and family (and his) just say to bring it up and ask, but I don't want to freak him out. And plus, I'm nervous that because he hasn't brought it up, he's not as into it or serious about it. But, also, there's literally no way he doesn't like me. I'm just confused. I need some advice or input please? This is just the bare bones of it, but any advice would be lovely :)

My wife (30F) and I (30M) are both working professionals. We married in the summer of 2014 and purchased our first home in the summer of 2016. We've both worked most of our lives, went to college and managed our money (mostly) responsibly.

I come from a mostly broken home and she came from a great family. My parents hated each other, emotionally abused each other, and spent their money (and my bar mitzvah/inheritance money) frivolously. My mother was and is a raging alcoholic/kleptomaniac with multiple arrests and a revoked license from too many DWIs. My father always had more ambition to party than succeed and has been financially bailed out by his mother (my grandmother) his entire adult life. 

Because of my family's situation. I've been working since I was 13 and haven't stopped. I paid for my first car, my degree, and my family's portion of my wedding. I was the first in my family to graduate from college and, with the exception of my paternal grandparents, the first and only to buy a house.

Fast forward to October 2016 and my 58-year-old father, now divorced from my mother but kept the dog, was let go by his employer of 18 years and was provided a decent severance. However, because he's been bailed out so often, he's the kind of person that never seems to be phased no matter how urgent or dire a situation is. That trait is probably why he thought it would be a good idea to treat his layoff like a vacation instead of looking for work right away.

Well, he blew through that money and in February 2017, he tells me and my wife that he is still out of work and could only afford one more month's rent. To this point, his mother had covered his utilities since his layoff but refused to pay his rent.

With no notice, and because the alternative was him and the dog living out of his car, we offered to let him move into our basement under the condition that he finds work immediately. He promised he would and he'd be moved out within three months. 

Unsurprisingly, he didn't find work right away. He rejoined the workforce full-time in May 2017 and I imagine that he's now making enough to survive on his own. He's been living with us for 10 months and has shown no significant interest in moving out. We don't charge him rent and cover the added utility costs. While I know this might make him comfortable, I've taken the stance that every dollar we accept from him is a dollar further away from getting him out.

We haven't had much of an issue in terms of invasion of privacy or crossing boundaries. However, my wife now seems to be festering with some kind of animosity. She was open to this in the beginning but is becoming more frustrated by his presence. She now remarks about him sitting in our backyard, having to work out the laundry schedule around his work schedule, and if there are noises and smells emanating from the basement. 

Seeing as how I am doing my best to form a ""normal life"" for me and my wife, I'd obviously prefer that this situation not impact our marriage. However, my dad and I are also pretty close despite his flaws and I don't want to put him and the dog out on the street. 

I would like to ask him to move out soon but I'm not sure how to go about it. Would a timeline be appropriate? Should it be 3 months? 6 months?Should I wait until after the holidays? Any other suggestions for how to approach this situation?

Tl;dr wife and I have been married for 3+ years, have owned our home for 17 months. My father has been living in our basement for 10 months and is back to work but hasn't shown any interest in moving out. My wife is getting frustrated by his presence and I think I have to ask him to move out before my marriage starts to suffer.

Thanks in advance for the advice, redditors!",11Dec2017,2

126,"Dear /r/Advice,

About 10 years ago I was in a relationship. Although we had a lot of fun together, it was very toxic.  We both really didn’t knew what we were doing, but yeah. There was more hate than love but it was good.

After a while we broke up with a massive fallout, we were in the same high school and that didn’t really help either. It escalated to the point that her new boyfriend came up to my place and threatened me with a dozen or so people. 

We ended up not talking anymore and that was the end of it. Still I have the feeling that I need to check om her, just to know if she’s happy.

127,"Backstory: I moved in with my sister as a last resort thing. She wanted me to come live with her to get my life together and get my GED and such. My sister is a very attached person and tends to be very emotional, and especially takes things the wrong way often. 

I live with her and her fiance (they get married in May). I've gotten back on my feet, got my GED, I have money saved up and a place I can go. The problem is: I have extremely bad anxiety and the thought of sitting my sister down to say ""hey, i want to go somewhere else"" is terrifying.

Currently, her and her fiance don't pay rent (fiance's dad took care of it). My sister has a part time, barely over minimum wage job and her fiance isn't currently working. They plan on moving wherever they have work once they get married/graduate college, but they have no idea where. I really don't want to have to suddenly change my life to their plans when I get no say in anything, and I'm afraid of how things are going to be when we do all move.

I have a safe place I can move in, with someone I love dearly that helps me with my anxiety and my copious amounts of other problems, the job market is pretty good in the area, and I know I'd be okay if I move there.

136,"This week, I saw a text on my Mum's phone that referred to my Dad having a ""meeting with you-know-who"". Obviously this confused me and I became curious and I ended up reading their texts over the last year. I found out that earlier this year, my Dad had an affair with someone at his work. I totally, totally understand that this was an invasion of their privacy but I think you can understand why I did it. 

Now, I know from reading those texts that the affair has ended and my parent's seem to have moved on from it as much as they can. This is not a should-i-tell my parents etc. thread that is common on this sub.

The thing to know is that, all through my life, I have been lucky enough to be close with my parents, especially my Dad. He has always been someone who I seek to emulate and follow, an important source of moral guidance as wanky as that might sound. Knowing that he had an affair has placed a strain on my ability to view him in that light. Internally, it's causing me to evaluate a lot of what I know about him.

I can forgive him, because if my mother is able to, then its only fair I do as well. However I don't know where to go from here. I don't want to bring it up with my parents, because that might bring up painful memories and mess up the healing process for them. Equally, I don't want to bring it up with my Grandparents, who I am incredibly close to because I don't know what they might know and I don't want to upset them. It does not feel like the kind of scenario I can bring up with a friend either. I guess I'm looking for some advice on how to repair my relationship with my Dad in a suitable way.

138,"Hey everyone, I'm wondering if anyone with a similar experience could help me out.  
  
My first relationship ended over a year ago, but I'm still struggling to deal with the aftermath. The relationship didn't last all that long, about six months, but somehow without real closure the whole thing hasn't been easy to process. Throughout the relationship, I was extremely happy as my S.O. and I were both very compatible. However, soon after she told me she would have to move out of state temporarily, she decided to abruptly end the relationship.  
Anyways, it's been long enough that I do alright on a day-to-day basis, but every so often it hits me again and I start to remember things about the time I spent with her. More importantly though, is that I still find it hard to sleep. I'm not sure what other people do to get to sleep after going through something emotionally distressing, but what I've been doing seems to have a negative impact on my daily life, especially school. I tend to stay up as late as possible, distracting myself with reddit, youtube, Netflix, or whatever else I can read or watch online so that I become exhausted enough to fall asleep as soon as I put down my phone. Whenever I try to go to bed early and avoid this behavior, I'm flooded with thoughts about my past relationship, my ex, and anything I ever said or did with her. It's awful. So instead I choose to stay up late so I don't have to deal with these recurring thoughts, but that means it's really hard to get up in the morning and I'm half-asleep for most of the day.  
  
Does anyone who's gone through something like this and survived have advice for coping with the endless stream of thoughts that like to deprive you of your precious sleep? I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this since I don't like to share this kind of stuff with my family and my friends wouldn't really be interested in my personal troubles. Thanks to anyone who read through this whole thing!

142,"Classic, right? But something I’m not sure how to feel about.

Backstory is we’ve been on and off “friends” for about 4 years. We started out dating, but I was hesitant and pulled back. Later she slept with my friend (not out of spite apparently) but we worked through it and have been on and off make-out pals for a while. 

Usually it was her chasing me, but recently I got back from a long trip away and I felt myself being drawn to her even more. But now I was getting mixed signals. One day she’s sending me drunk texts, the next she isn’t even replying. She told her parents I was boyfriend, but was more formal than ever with me. It was as if our power dynamic shifted completely (side note: she gained a lot more confidence over the years and was getting more attention than ever from guys).

I gave in last week and told her how I felt. I didn’t make it a big deal and figured she’d appreciate the honesty, but her response was strange. After that she started taking longer and longer to reply to my messages, blocked me from seeing her Snapchat stories and when I messaged her asking to meet up and work through this she didn’t even reply.

It’s become apparent a relationship is out of the question now, but I don’t want to become enemies. Everyone brushes her off to me as “a bitch” but I struggle to buy it. She may have reacted badly, but I had a lot of good times with her and know she isn’t an inherently bad person. I just can’t figure out what her perspective is on this, why is she so angry?

My mother and her father got married and we lived together for a few years until i moved out. But we aren't blood related in any way.

When we were around 15 and 10ish my blood sister told me that our step sister had a huge crush on me. She was really close to her so im sure they shared secrets like this. I could always tell she liked me and was really flirty with me on every occasion growing up.

Well fast forward to present. I just recently moved back in after getting into legal trouble and even ended up working at the same job as her. 

Here are some present subtle hints ive gotten. She showed me a scrap book she had of pictures of just me that she had in her room saying the occasional ""how cute"" and ""awes"". 
Evidentally she has also talked about me to everyone at work and they seem to know about everything about me without me even hardly knowing their names yet. 

Now heres where it gets strange. She has recently became very attractive. Like a solid 10/10. She also has a boyfriend who is out of town all week and only home on weekends. Ive never even spoken to him once lmao. 
But today i heard her and my mom whispering and when they parted my mom came to me and said, ""i know a girl who really likes you."" 
I replied ,""what, really""? ( as i dont go out at all and been single for 5 years now with no girls ive even encountered with) my mom then replies, ""and shes very very pretty and you know her."" I just laughed it off and carried on about my day.

I know she was talking about my step sister but what i find odd is why would my step sister tell our mom? And plus she has a boyfriend? I find that a little strange but i do believe it is her for sure. Thing is im really attracted to her and being single this long id bang her brains out in a heart beat. 

My question is what do you all think about my situation and what would you all do? 
Tbh i wouldnt mind having a secret engagement of activities while her bf is away but it seems if she has already told my mom and told my sister years ago about her feelings toward me it doesnt seem she cares to keep it secret lol.

157,"Hello! I'm (22 yo) visiting my parents who live a few hours away from me, and I've really noticed that they're losing their minds over my brother (19 yo) who lives with them. 

My brother has had behavioural developmental issues which have largely gone unrecognised and untreated. The adult manifestation of this is that he is impulsive, careless, inconsiderate, and highly emotionally labile. He expressed a lot of opposition to authority and never really assesses the consequences of his actions.

It's like in his head, nothing can ever be his fault. He was basically offered a job, but didn't apply in time, and he blames my parents for not booking him in for the first aid course. If he's late for work, it's because someone else didn't wake him up. If he's driving like shit, it's because the car's brakes don't work. He seems to really lack even the most basic insight into how to navigate the world. 

That may not seem so bad, but when you couple it with a personality which is so confrontational that any mention that he might have done something wrong or could do something better is met with threats of violence (and occasionally actual violence).

My parents are really struggling to cope because if they don't acquiesce to his nonsense things get very angry. It's really hard to convey what the problem is here and why it's so stressful but it's like he's psychologically a deranged 13 year old. I thought it would get better with age but it isn't.

160,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now, just like any relationship we have our ups and downs. We were at an outing with friends last weekend, the next day she mentioned (not the first time) that I looked unhappy. I am used to hearing these comments, however I always assure her that it was fun and I had a great time. 

Socially speaking, I came to accept that I am not a social butterfly nor am I someone who shies away, but I am by definition a neutral person. 

My hobbies revolve around staying at home, playing and listening to music, cooking - I don't mind spending time on my own at all. I can be moody sometimes and not say much at an outing, but this is normal, right? or is it maybe mean something? 

During that particular outing, we bumped into friends I knew from high school. I introduced them to my girlfriend and we caught up quickly before returning back to our table. The rest of the night I was just lounging by our table and watching the concert without interacting much with people. 

After that weekend I became interested in understanding why I act the way I do. I do have a few secrets that I never told anyone in my life, nothing dark or scary, just secrets and my guess is everyone else does too.

Close friends and family mention that I am nice and friendly, but sometimes keep to myself and don't engage much, my girlfriend says at home I am always cracking jokes and making her laugh, but at social gatherings I am too quiet, act weird and seem unhappy or bored. 

The idea that I might have social anxiety does not bother me strangely, it's as if I already know that I am socially awkward as a person and I'm alright with it.  

I would love to hear what your thoughts are on this.

162,"I want to make it short and simple. I've got a long-distance relationship with this girl for 5 months now. Sometimes she visits me, sometimes I am the one who visits. We meet monthly. This was one of them. I have just arrived at home. I miss her crazily. Sadness, sorrow, pain, longing are so strong that I can't overcome them. I am like a leaf wandering around with the wind. Purposelessly. Aimlessly. I find myself remembering the good times I spent with her and can't prevent myself from crying constantly. I miss her so bad. I don't know what to do. This is what's always happening to me after our goodbyes. I feel powerless. I feel half without her. Now that she is far away and everything is black and white again... She is my sun and I can't live without it. She brings colours into my life. All I see when I look around is black and white. Nothing feels good. It's like everything is gonna turn normal again if I could hold her in my arms once again. I want to feel her warmth again. Right now. I don't want it one month later. Help me, please.

163,"Hi all! Maybe at the end of this I won't need advice but you'll tell me I do or not, hopefully. But I believe I do. \

I'm an 18m who recently graduated from HS in Australia. I've been a bit stuck in limbo, since I have been waiting for my VCE results which determines my ATAR (ranking in my state). I believe I did pretty well this year but nothing special, majority of my marks for my 35-40 SACs (tests for non-Australians) were As and Bs (which is 70%-90%) and I think I did okay on the exams (I think mostly Bs and maybe a C lol). I've kept in touch with most friends but mostly I have been watching Netflix, playing League of Legends, hanging out with friends playing Basketball and gone out twice. 

Recently just got accepted through an early entry scheme into a top 10 Australian university to do a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Science, so I am pretty happy about that, and have a good idea on what I will major in. I've also organised a schedule for myself to keep myself busy, containing reading books (such as economics/programming books) and doing online courses on coursera, so I do not stop learning (as it is an important asset to be educated imo). Also going to start exercising again, running and so on. 

However, the dilemma is I do not have any work experience and I am currently unemployed. I did a bit of volunteer work in High School but that was 3 years ago, I have 5 school awards (two improvement award, two general awards and one astounding performance award for highest achiever in subject or some shit) in Linguistics (improvement), Accounting (general achievement and astounding performance) and Aus Politics (improvement and encouragement), and that is about it. I'm not sure what else I can put on my resume to help myself get a job as I really need to start to save money in my gap year so I can go to Sydney. As even though our government does provide school funded loans, it'll be very expensive. 

So I guess to ask concisely: 

- Should I take my time to decide what to major in or decide right now and sort of get interested in it? 

- What steps should I take to ensure that I have a good social life (I don't really care about being in relationships, but just having friends)?

164,"Background on myself, I’m a single mom, I work full time, I’ve returned to college for a year now (it so happens to I am avoiding studying for my last final at this moment), I have anxiety disorder, and tend to be socially awkward.  

Context on the situation: My daughter’s father cheated on me through our relationship, I left him about 2 years ago though we have had our on &amp; offs. Since him I’ve seriously pursued two people, the first one rejected me because my situation was too complicated for them, the second was a friend I reconnected with while unfortunately going through post-partum (working at home while watching a baby 24/7) which at the time I was still living with my ex who found out about the situation and made me feel guilty for them pursuing while we were still in the same household. The individual passed away shortly after I moved into my own home and the weekend I got a new job.

Now that time has passed I’m happy with who I am and honestly ready to find someone who I can be happy with. There is a friend at work I’ve been interested in from the start. He was originally unavailable but the past few months has become open. I mentioned how I am socially awkward, well I’ve been pushing the envelope with him and I’m not sure if we’re both just shy or maybe I’m not being forward enough, but nothing has progress and it’s been over a month since I’ve been ‘actively’ trying to garner his attention aside from being a friend. 

I am normally open when it comes to expressing my willingness to be with/pursue someone... but it hasn’t been the same since being rejected (as a mom, I’ve dealt with let downs before), and losing someone I thought may be the one. I don’t think I could handle someone outwardly saying ‘no’ without avoiding  them for months which wouldn’t be great considering he’s someone I talk to daily and truly enjoy his company. We’ve spent time hanging out with friends and generally he’s in a hurry to get home afterwards, but the times we’ve been alone we don’t stop talking... 

I’m tired of him not making a move, but am as much to blame because I won’t either. I don’t want to misread friendship for something else then make a move only to have him tell me he doesn’t feel the same way. TBH I’m too old to be thinking about this kind of junk, but I’m also lonely and just want a consistent cuddle buddy/someone to adventure with.

TLDR; Crushing on someone at work, afraid to express my feelings because we’re good friends &amp; past heart aches are holding me back. I’d be awkward forever if things went wrong. ",11Dec2017,2
165,"I'm 16 years old and about 6 months ago I have started thinking about my life. I realised that I was always talking about how I want to be successful, but never really did anything about it. I decided to change that and I've started studying more, reading books etc. I'm an introvert and I don't have many friends. Friends that I have are the ones who I've known since I was 7 years old. I don't feel comfortable in their company anymore. I feel like they don't want to do anything with their lives. I feel like they will eventually drag me down with them and I don't want that to happen. I want to find more ambitious and supportive friends, but I don't know where and how. ",11Dec2017,2
166,"These thoughts fill my mind honestly over the course of 8 months. 

8 months ago, I through a close real life friend of mine met a group of friends online using a program called Discord. This group of people I've met, I believe I've built quite a strong relationship with. 

I treat them as a friend and in return they treat me as a friend. This all is good and positive until a few months back in September. I had bought myself a ticket to visit China. And it was only after buying this ticket and telling these group of friends that I realize one thing I don't realize. It was the feeling of being left out.

In the past 3 or so months, I've played a lot of games online and it was only with that group of people, I've gotten comfortable and that in my heart, I've grown attached. So attached that I've felt like I didn't want to go to China anymore.

I've talked about this feeling with one of my best friends and he told me it was just a feeling that I've gotten used to and he even wished that if he had the time to take a break from life. To travel like I'm doing.

All is fine and I come back from China, feeling positive and fulfilled. That's when the problem got worst.

I used to play games a lot by myself during my free time. I didn't need a constant reliance on another person being there on discord. I didn't need to feel like I'm talking to someone, I was completely fine playing any game by myself and having fun. Needless to say, if I was invited to a game, it would be even more fun, but there was never a reliance on socializing for me.

I got to a point where I over think about everything. I think about how they might be on a different discord server than me, one which I don't know about since I'm annoying. Or they are playing a game secretly without me.

I admit, these few weeks, I would get home from school or work and hop on steam and discord and ask if anyone wants to play games. That might get on peoples nerves after awhile (3 weeks).

But I feel so left out, so depressed over the situation. 

During high school I didn't really try to make friends, of the 4 years I've spent in high school, I can count the number of true friends I have on one hand.

Friends that till this day, I still keep up with, friends that I trust with talking about my insecurities, but at the same time, it is these same  group of friends that are involve in this that is pushing my away. Scaring me of asking them about things. Am I too annoying? Am I too nosy?

I'm at a point where the only thing I thought about is how to ask them (group of friends) if we are still good. Are we still friends? Can this be called a friendship?

I'm at a point where if I don't get help, I honestly might tip back into depression which i tried so hard to escape from and I don't doubt that I'm already depressed over the matter.

Please help, why has this descended upon me? How can I go back to my self 8 months prior to this situation? How do I stop over thinking about negativity?",11Dec2017,2

I'd like the climate to at least be pleasant. I don't mind a winter but I don't want it to be longer than it is in the Northeast US (3ish months)

High speed internet is a must, and I'd like it to be somewhat first world in terms of plumbing and heating etc.

174,"I met this guy once, it was a really stupid decision, and it was not enjoyable. He lived hours away I talked to him online for weeks, it was after I went through a horrible break up and I was lonely pretty much, so the idea of meeting this guy seemed cool, he never once brought up sex or anything like that, and I was excited to meet him and go sight seeing for the day, that was the whole idea to have fun for the day and see things for the first time. Anyway it slowly got stranger and stranger when he kept making excuses and not paying for anything and just kept drinking more and more etc...he ended up going back and I texted him to be polite, and he kept asking me to go visit him so he could show me around his city, I kept putting it off because I didn't have a good time with him, all he did was complain about his life, people who were his ""friends"" that he had to drop etc...told me stories of him stealing stuff, and kept reminding me of this a few times with these weird stories and then going remember when I told you that I was like a scorpion and if someone hurt me that I was relentless and made sure they got stung really badly back that they would regret ever hurting me, that freaked me out really badly and I stayed in polite contact texts here and there just so he wouldn't feel hurt cause I was scared after what he said. He kept saying weird stuff like we had this deep connection and it would be a pity to lose it etc...which we didn't anyway I haven't used whatsapp on my phone for about a month now, until I kept getting notifications of missed calls from him.

fuck sake why are you not answering. 2 missed calls.

By the way after I met him I told him I didn't want to be anything more than friends.

There were even more calls he made on facebook to me. I ended up blocking him on both whatsapp and facebook.

I am getting freaked out now again.I just got a new friend request that says his name I am going to say it cause I don't care anymore. The new request says: Emile Newfbook. He made a new blank facebook to add me? what on earth?

Some people told me to unblock him so I can see if he threatens to come to my city or road, it was so stupid of me but he owed me about 50 euro from food that day when he kept making excuses not to pay I gave him my account info to transfer to my account, he kept making it so difficult sending me snapshots saying now his bank is asking for my address, I didn't like him or trust him but didn't think he was a stalker, so gave the name of the road but not the house number, now I regret that very much. If I knew he would harass me and scare me later on I would have forgotten the money, at the time I was determined to be paid back. 

 I was having trouble sleeping lastnight imagining him standing outside on my street or harming a family member or breaking in to my house. I was thinking of telling him this story just in case he has any plan of trying to find me or come to my road, what do you think?

I am going to unblock him and act like there is something wrong with me type of thing and say the last month I haven't talked to anyone that my parents divorce went through, the house was forced to be sold and I'm living in a cramp apartment with my sister and her boyfriend it's really cramped something like that. Then I am going to say for the past month I knew I needed a drastic change planned what I am about to do that I am going to go to Peru on a volunteering trip that lasts 2 or 3 months and might travel around there for longer if I can earn some type of money and will be leaving in a few days and that it will be tough cause I will just have my camera and a few clothes but am excited?

175,"Long story short, I went to a small private non-profit university which specialized in IT degrees at the behest of my parents instead of my own wishes (they told me that its a sure-fire way to finish my education and get a job). Started college at the start of being 19 (I was born late and parents forgot to enroll me in school for a year), and got out by my mid to late 20 with an Associates in Software Development (finished fast because I took more classes and never failed once). Learned a lot more in that University then I probably would in other Universities that would force you to take General Ed classes. The Problem? MY FUCKING SCHOOL HAD DIFFERENT ACCREDITATION (and the accredited institution is shutting down). And I can't afford to pay for the Bachelors (its ridiculously expensive and without accredidation I can't get a federal loan). Worse still, I am already 10k in debt. The only benefit I see is that I indeed learn quite alot about Software Development and have a good prospect of job offerings (Uni has connections with companies). Yet, now none of my credits will transfer to any other public school of my choosing and now I have to start from scratch. Now I am going to Community at age 21 and won't probably finish until I am 25 (that is if I manage to not repeat ANY classes). I feel so miserable right now that most people are one or two years ahead of me, even those that are younger than me! Some have even finished their bachelors and are only a year older then me!! I am totally lost, unmotivated and really downtrodden....I've always been careful about every choice of made in my life. I never did anything that would jeopardize my future (drinking, drug addiction, police arrest) but this one was perhaps the greatest blow to me personally as i felt I was doing everything right but instead wasted almost two years of my already accelerating young adult life...Whats perhaps worse is that I perhaps missed out on the most exciting part of College life (dorms, state college, school events, friends) because of me not being assertive enough to choose the college of my choosing. Anyone here have advice for me? I truly feel like I am totally alone in this as even my parents realized the mistake and decided that I should figure this out myself....If I were your child, what would you say to me?",11Dec2017,1
177,"I didn't know where else to post this.
Tthere's this guy in my dorm who hates my guts—we'll call him Kyle. I have a significant twitter following (11,000 followers) and I made a joke that COULD be interpreted as targeting one of Kyle's friends—but not intentionally. I poked fun at people who read this manga called ""Gokudo,"" which I didn't even know was a real thing. Turns out it IS a real thing and Kyle's friend loves it and talks about it a lot.

A couple people including Kyle saw the tweet and started telling people that I was ""cyberbullying"" Kyle's friend online. About 20 people on campus (mainly in my dorm) found out, and I cleared it up with a number of them telling them I had no idea that people thought I was targeting this guy. After all Kyle's friend is a real nice guy and there's no reason to hate him.

However this wasn't enough for Kyle apparently. Keep in mind this all happened a MONTH ago. TODAY Kyle walks by me and says ""Can't wait for your next tweet about &lt;Kyle's friend&gt;, buddy!""
And then word starts to get around that he's been trying to ""get back at &lt;my name&gt; for bullying &lt;Kyle's friend&gt; 'cause he can only talk shit and not take it.""

Here's the problem. Everyone likes this kid. He's not cool and he's not funny, but he's earned a reputation for being a charitable hero. And even after I deleted the tweet weeks ago, he is still spreading this. Even my FRIENDS are telling me that while it's not okay that he's spreading this he's still a ""such a cool guy""—basically the end result is I am losing my reputation while this guy isn't. And there isn't really anything I can do about it. I can still clear it up to people who ask me about it, but I'm starting to lose potential friendships—and we're only just finishing up the first semester of Freshman year.

Do I wait for it to die down, or do I act in some way? I just really hate sitting here while this kid racks up the goodie points for sticking up for his friend and I just look like the asshole Twitter guy who used his following to bully another kid who is equally regarded as nice.

Like a week ago we almost did it. We made out and we took his hoodie and shirt off and we got on the bed and he got on top of me.

I got scared about having sex and I pushed him off of me and told him that I'm not ready. He seemed upset but said he understood.



Last night he came over and we watched a movie and talked. We ended up making out and I straddled him. Then after a while he laid me down on the couch and got on top and we kissed some more. He started kissing my neck and moved down to my lower stomach. I once again told him that I just don't think I'm ready for sex.



I really do want to have sex but I'm too scared. I guess I'm just scared of having sex and then being dumped or getting pregnant.

It wasn’t a big party, maybe 15-20 people but my sister has told me stories about older groups turning up to other parties and trashing the place. Around 9:30, I went back just to check everything was going smoothly etc and as I’m talking to my sister she keeps touching her nose and sniffing. 

I pulled her outside straight away and said “what have you been sniffing? “ and with no hesitation she said “Ket”, which makes me think this was not the first time she’s done it.

I tried to explain that it’s bad and even told her a story of one of my old football teammates who died of a Ketamine overdose at a festival to try and put her off it. She said “we don’t take much at all, all of my friends do it, it’s fine”. I started trying to explain to her why it’s not fine but she switched off and I could tell she wasn’t really taking it on board.

I don’t want to tell my parents as my sister and I have a really good relationship and I don’t want to break the trust.

181,"Real life scenario I am in. My dad died. Me and my siblings grew up quite poor. Dad slowly amassed small amount of savings throughout lifetime. Out of the three of us, only one of my siblings has kids.

The sibling that has kids is extremely well off. As in, the kids go on 3+ international vacations per year (when I was growing up we could never afford vacations). These kids are so well off, my sibling has already saved (in advance) enough money to give each of them a full ride to college! The girls have diamond jewelry and pearls! The boys have boats and toys! Everyone takes music lessons and sports lessons. They do photography and plan vacations! The one who is in high school does not work. 

These kids have silver spoons. So different to my experience. I've been working multiple jobs since the age of 12.

Even so, my dad left a trust for his grandkids, even though the estate is not that large. Their parent claims he asked my dad not to do so but he ""insisted."" 

I think my dad was allowed to leave whatever to whomever. Even so, I can't help but feel very annoyed and upset.

The estate isn't very large. There will be taxes. I put up with a lot my whole life in my family, but this, this is insulting. The rich kids are given a nest egg that technically comes out of a pool of money that otherwise would be divided so that 1/3 goes to me. I'm disgusted. They have been handed everything in life and will have to want for nothing.

If you consider that anything that goes to my nieces and nephews also benefits their parents, then it means that one of my siblings gets a larger share of the estate. This also feels so unfair.

I am so mad!!! I don't mean to feel entitled, but if you knew the treatment I put up with in my life and also my challenges in childhood, and the fact that I've been working practically my whole life.

183,"First year in university. Stay in a hostel. Meets new hostel-mate who is also a first year student in hostel. He is an international student from Tanzania, black person more or less my age in a university full of mostly Asian students (the country is Malaysia anyways). So we talk, we hang out together, eat stuff together and such. But sometimes, the stuff that he does is really wtf material. 

First of, he is impulsive as fuuuck. I reckon he doesn't think before acting. If he wants something, he just does it. This goes from binging fests to touching other female students inappropriately despite complaints and objections by the people who are uncomfortable. You tell him no, and he thinks it is a joke and we are all playing. The head of department even talked with him over this. I talked with him over this. But he still doesn't seem to make any effort to fix himself. He trivializes it and make it seem like it's not a big deal and say that it is 'part of him'.

And about the binge fests, he raids the communal fridge of the hostel. Even shit that isn't his he also takes. Once, I brought back a box of Maltesers (chocolate) that my ma gave me from a trip to Australia and he fucking ate it all. Without asking for permission. And the box was fucking full. All in less than a fucking day. The box is like the size of a laptop and he finished it all when I was out for one of my classes. That day, I came back from my lecture at uni and checked my fridge and the box was emptied and thrown into the trashcan. I asked around and he admitted he ate it. Like wtf. He then bought me some cheap shitty chocolate to make up for it. Also, despite him constantly complaining he doesn't have enough money, he keeps on ordering unhealthy, sugar laden drinks that are unnecessary and expensive all the fucking time and he complains not that his parents don't give him enough. 

On his money spending issues, he has like twice the amount of allowance that I have and he constantly complains about not having enough money. Fuck, he even borrows money from me and asks for handouts like ramen, biscuits, bread etc. He just said this to me an hour ago in response to me criticizing him buying ANOTHER pair of headphones when he is asking me for more money when he just borrowed and have not returned RM 30 a couple days ago. ""music you can listen for life while food you shit it out the next day"". Like wtf. Why you do shit like this. And then he bought a FUCKING VIOLIN some months ago this semester for a couple hundred even though he does not play musical instruments at all. When I asked him about this, he said ""I just had to have it"".

Moving on, which ties up to what I mentioned above, he has little self consciousness. I say that because he keeps on doing shit that makes people uncomfortable and like doesn't notice or understand other people's perception of him and the shit that he does. He constantly keeps on trying to pick up and talk to random girls. Once, this girl already has a boyfriend who is actually right next to her and he keeps on joking and hitting on her. I swear. WTF is he doing. I cringe so much that I can't even fucking comprehend why would you do that. He once also karate kicked the gate to out hostel as we were leaving cause he probably thought it would be cool but it really wasn't fucking cool at all and with that racist stereotypical Chinese kungfu ""hiyaaa!!!"". PEOPLE WERE FUCKING STARING AT US. I wanted to go back into my hostel and lock myself in the room. I literally have to tell him off like a child just with more profanity.

I received a lot of praise for my work and even my bosses boss put my name forward for this move despite my lack of service.

187,"So I made a new account for this. I feel afraid to share my sexual desires with anyone because I would be judged. I was hoping someone could tell me any possible cause of this.

So basically i'm attracted to women, but not in a sexual way. I am very turned off by nudity, and would never have sex. I am attracted to clothed women to the point where (this is a bit vulgar) I am unable to maintain an erection with normal nude porn.

I have a fetish for criminals, hystobrilophilia I think is the right term. Stuff like knowing a woman is a murderer is a big turn on for me. Being held at gun or knife point is often part of my fantasies. This is messed up, but being stabbed or strangled as well. This extends to Nazis as well in a big way. The black SS uniform and the idea of Aryan women (blue eyes blond hair) being aggressive and racist

I am also very attracted to mental illness. Whether this is schizophrenic girls talking to themselves, bi polar or psychopath personalities. Straight jackets and padded cells all that stuff. Self harm scars. Suicidal women and doing it with someone like in a pact

-My language level isn't improving that much because of my lack of friends (and admitted lack of effort studying the language every night).

**Cons for leaving...**
-This could be a once-in-a-lifetime experience to travel and see world.

-It's good to be outside of my ""comfort zone.""

-Forces me to try to make friends, be social.

-Independence.

-I will lose my chance at language immersion.

-Might lose some money, though not a ton.

-Shame of coming home early.

The problem is that my experience isn't guaranteed to improve. If I knew my second semester for a fact would be a lot better, I would probably stay. But if it's the same... then I'd want to go home.

193,"I recently started living with three other people. Two of these people are really good friends that I've known for years and the third person is a woman who was basically a mother to me while I was having a hard time in highschool and middle school. I love them all dearly... but...

I'm the type of person who really values alone time. Before I moved in, I was living a much more secluded life. Now I find myself getting extremely irritated by constant knocks on my door and other things they do.

For example: tonight one of my roommates decided to spray paint her art project in the house and it filled the house with paint fumes for hours giving me a massive headache. I damn near snapped in to a rage over it.

I don't want to be that asshole roommate complaining and asking for my space. But I'm afraid if I bury it for too long I'll lose my shit. Again, I love these people so I don't want to offend anyone or lose a friend over it.

Is there a nice way to discuss this with them? Or is this just a lose lose situation for me?",11Dec2017,0

I used to feel sad at school but I’m starting to feel gloomy all the time and it’s preventing me from sleeping.

Don't get me wrong. I love 'em. I love hanging out with them. It's not like they're actively or even subconsciously advocating or encouraging me to be depressed with them, but I just notice that my mindset gets bad when I hang out with them when they're in a bad place. They're going through some tough times and as their friend, I want to be there for them but I've been in a good place for a while and I don't really want that to change. But at the same time, I haven't hung out with them for a while due to certain circumstances and I want to be there for them and also to hear from them on how they've been. But based on their Twitter posts and the few times they said something on the group chat (I'm shit at communicating through social media or texts. I prefer face-to-face.), they're going through a TERRIBLE time.

So, we've set a meet-up soon but I'm worried that my precarious mental and emotional stability might be endangered if I meet with them. But I've also never been a fair-weather friend, in fact, due to my poor social skills online and offline, I'd say it's quite the opposite. I'm the one that's there the most when shit's bad to compensate for the times I can't be there for the good.

I don't really know what to ask in this case but what do I do? I don't want to hurt them by saying they depress me cause I actually wanna hang but I also don't want to throw myself under the bus just to hang with them, y'know? I don't hang out enough with them as it is. Plus, they're like the only friends I have cause I'm unapproachable af. Any advice on what to do, y'all?",11Dec2017,1
202,"Hi, so.. 

I didn't want to post this on a relationship sub because it's not really about the event itself, it's more about an on going pattern that I can't seem to break, and this that I need advice on. Also, this is the first time I have ever asked for advice online, so thanks in advance for reading if you have, and all comments are welcome. I need to fix this. 

So recently I was seeing a guy. We even more recently stopped seeing each other. The reason for this was probably many fold, starting with how blinded I was my his charm that I didn't realise he is a classic narcissist. The end happened in a blur of blame placing, insults, accusations, belittling and rejection, and I feel TERRIBLE. Almost instantly afterwards I realised that it wasn't my fault, but I was gaslighted into admission, and left feeling devastated. It wasn't a long or even important relationship, but the end being so brutal has left me in a state of decay. 

Now, I know that certain personality types are more prone to things like submission and guilt when it comes to forms of abuse. I have been in longer, more damaging relationships with probable narcissists in the past and this time, I am still as devastated and jilted as the first time. What I am struggling with is the me part of this event, how do I become more self aware of these patterns of behavior, as a sensitive empath myself? How do I raise my self esteem and self worth to the point that I recognise I am worth more? It's something that people tell you you are, but how do you believe it? 

I am not a believer that you can or should change 
your personality, unless you're a piece of shit. And I 
don't think I am that, I have a good support system, a 
good job, I'm wellliked, I have hobbies, and I'm even 
attractive, depending on what you're into. I think I have 
a lot to offer to the people around me. I just can't seem 
to maintain that at all, and it makes my life miserable.

207,"So, a few months ago, my best friend (pretty much the only person I'm close to) asked me out. I've liked her for ages so that was awesome, made me so happy, absolutely stoked.

Maybe a few days later she said it was a ""bad move"", she didn't say I did anything wrong, she just said she ""didn't understand the implications of what she said."" Ok, sure, disappointing but I'm ok with that if we remained, as she said ""friends"". But that so far, hasn't happened.

Ever since we've barely spoken a word to each other, barely even looked at each other and we see each other pretty much every day (go to the same school). Anyway, as you might've guessed, since she's the only person I've ever really felt actually close to at this point in my life, it's been pretty hard without her being there to talk to anymore, at all. 

I would try talking to her but she was always the person to initiate conversation (I get really anxious and paranoid easily) so I just can't. If I even think about it all that goes through my head is ""She'll hate you if you do."", ""She'll think you're a nuisance."", ""She probably already does hate you for whatever reason."" That sort of crap. 

Anyway, a week or so ago she messaged me about if I had sent her a message on a school site we have about a month ago. The 'message' didn't actually contain anything important, literally just faces made with text that I wrote over a YEAR and a month ago, so I thought it was odd for her to suddenly message me about this considering we hadn't talked for a good 3 months by now. 

She said sorry once I told her it was over a year ago and that she didn't realise so I jokingly replied with ""Don't have to be sorry if you get me a red dragon."" I know, stupid. 

But she did it. 
She got a little red duck, taped wings to it and came up to me and said ""I got you your red dragon."" 
I'm probably overthinking it, but keep in mind we hadn't said anything to each other for months, even though we used to be really close. I don't know, I just thought maybe she's trying to close the gap between us again?

Another thing, after our very last day of school for the year (at a sort of compulsory after school event for concluding the year), she walked past me with her Mum when I was talking to somebody else I know, whom she isn't exactly close with. We made eye contact for a second, I averted my eyes straight away, I didn't want to seem desperate and annoying, or creepy, so that's sort of how it had been those 3 months. She walked off...

But she came back around, by herself, literally the whole school would've been there so she could've talked to anyone she knew, who knows though, maybe she couldn't find anyone, but I just felt like after 3 months of basically avoiding each other, it was again, weird for her to come up anywhere near me, even if someone else was around (especially since that person is, like I said, not exactly close with her). Thought me being my awkward and paranoid self, I didn't really say anything to her.

Anyway, those are the important bits. She's really important to me and it's been so weird and lonely without being able to interact with her and I'm just not sure if it's ok for me to try and close the gap again. This year's coming to a really bitter end for me because of this and I just want for things to be normal again. 

I've just been debating whether or not I should try talking to her at this point or if that would cause her to start actively avoiding me, if you need extra details to go off, then ask for stuff below and I'll see if I can provide more insight into the issue.",11Dec2017,3
208,"Hello, im 23 year old male who needs the advice of others on how they got over there anxiety. If this helps im from australia.

It all started when i was around 16 when i had a condition which made me feel nauseated which usually lead to vomiting . Every second or third day this would happen. Took around 2 years to figure out the problem but it has caused a lot of psychological problems for myself. I used to live in fear of being sick in public and it still haunts me to this day. Ive never had a job because of this which is really annoying as id love to earn an income and have some money. The worst time for me to do things would be in the morning as its when i normally was sick.

Now for some questions. Ive seen doctors about this and they offer pills etc but it doesnt seem to work. So do you guys have any opinions or advice you can offer me on a way of income? Anyone had a similar situation that could offer advice? Im pretty desperate as id love to be a normal living guy.

I’m very, very shy around him and he knows I get nervous around people pretty quickly, but I think me asking him to sleep with me may have made it seem I’m more experienced? I’ve never even kissed/made out with a guy and I’m scared to disappoint. 

I’m interested in being FWB or something along those lines but I’m scared if the sex isn’t good for him the first time he’s going to not pursue anything further with me. I know I’m probably overthinking it a little.

My boyfriend of 10+ years has left his son and I. I’ve been a stay at home mom to my son for the past 5 years so I have no money to my name. My now ex put everything in my name. Our apartment which is $790 a month. Comcast which is already shut off because he let the bill get to $700. Electric which is $92 a month since he wasn’t paying and they put us on the shut off protection plan. He also opened a credit card in my name without asking me like a year ago and there’s $500 charged on it. 
I receive about $230 in child support from him a month if I’m lucky. The only reason I get that is because my son and I receive EBT for food and the government makes him pay child support. I guess I should have mentioned that my now ex has never lived with us. He lives 3 hours away in a different state. He would visit his son when convenient for him but that’s it. He says it’s to finish school, but I’ve learned over the years that he’s a compulsive liar so have no idea if that’s true.

I moved out of state for this position and settled in a new city that I am really liking. The job unfortunately has not been great for the first two months. I’m consistently bored with rarely anything to do, I find myself taking the few tasks I have and stretching them out as long as I can to fill the day. On top of that, I don’t believe I have received adequate training considering this is my first job out of college and have relatively zero experience in this field. My boss is the plant manager and not a safety expert so I feel like I do not learn as much as I would if I were to report to someone with experience in my field. On top of all this, I am the only one in the safety department and am the head of safety for over 100 employees in two different facilities. I feel a tremendous weight on my shoulders as the one responsible for the safety of all employees despite being 22 and having no experience in the field.

Since this schedule started in early November, I now have chronic Shin-splints from constant running (our school is very strict with athletics, I’m a thrower on track not a runner!) I also have had multiple gushing nose-bleeds (my nose never bleeds, it never happened before in my life). I cannot bend my right wrist all the way back so I cannot do push-ups correctly (people joke it’s from jacking off but I’m a lefty, just saying). And to top it off, I just recently got an ear infection in my right ear. 

I have so much work that the only free time I have during the week is one study hall which I have to use to do work (I’m using about 10 minutes to write this), and I don’t have a lunch. Other than that I have about 15 minutes when eating breakfast and dinner, my post workout protein shake is a substitute for a 3rd meal. Overall I eat about 15-1700 calories a day. 

I dropped 7 lbs last week, and another 5 this past week. I’m a bigger dude but I’m told it’s “mostly muscle bro” as I weighed 205 originally and am the fastest running thrower by a long-shot (not trying to brag but rather give context based on injuries). 

My parents constantly say they see me working hard, and then nag me when I want to relax saying that I’m not taking enough initiative. For context my grades aren’t bad either- my GPA right now is in the low 90s. One would think I have a “tiger mom” but she’s white, lol. 

Anyway, what would you guys suggest to help alleviate some of these problems? Please do basic answers like “sleep more” because if I had the time to, I would. If anyone has any suggestions regarding better time management or possibly ways to fall asleep faster, or workout tips, anything is appreciated. Thanks!",11Dec2017,2
243,"A month ago we broke up for like a couple of days, we got back together and it was all pretty good. I got her a pet rabbit for our anniversary, and it all seemed like it was going great. 

Yesterday however she said she does not feel happy with me. The reason for that is because I rarely smile and seem happy, and she does not want to feel like she is the only thing making me happy, because it's taking a toll on her. 

I really just want her back, I have been crying like a bitch throughout the whole day and I've been breaking down every other hour. 

What should I do, I don't want to go back to the single life as tempting as it is. I just want to be with her and I'm not sure how to make it happen.",11Dec2017,1

246,"I'm going back to my home state to visit my family for the holidays. And am considering meeting up with my old friends.

Backstory- Basically they were my best friends from highschool and for about 2 years after. My life started moving really fast. I started dating this guy, got pregnant, got married, moved to his state a few hours away. 

But our falling out happened when I got pregnant. I went to visit the man who is now my husband. I was gone for a month visit. And we had a few arguments because we were stressed. We just found out I was pregnant ,but we hadn't been together super long and were unmarried. I was venting to my friends and they kept telling me to leave him and to raise the baby in my home state with them and they'd help me(they didn't like him to begin with). Of course I wasn't gonna do that and I kinda brushed that off.

Fast forward a month and I'm in my home state. They stopped inviting me out. They invite me here and there but not like they used to. I called them out. They made excuses and one of them says ""well it would have happened eventually anyway"" I was pregnant and decided I didn't need that drama, so I cut contact. And it's been a little over a year and a half. 


I don't know why but I asked if they wanted to meet for dinner when I come home. They said of course. I don't expect a strong friendship like before. Just a casual one. Especially since I only come home 2-4 times a year. 

Thoughts? Advice?",11Dec2017,2

253,"My ex and I dated for 9 months starting February of 2016. We were friends before but both developed feelings and decided to start dating. It was great, I was so happy with him and we were both involved with each others' families, I never felt so secure and happy in a relationship.

Then fall of 2016 rolls around and we both go into second year of college. We go to the same college but as time passed, we started seeing each other less and less. He said he was busy with his workload. We texted a couple times a day, only saw each other on weekends. He didn't ever offer to drive me home, or initiate a hangout, anything. I felt like the only one trying to make it work...I let him know this and we talked it out and he said he'd work on it...but nothing changed. I decided to end it at the start of November and we both said we would miss each other, and that it was for the best.

Fast forward 4 months, after no contact. He suddenly messages me late March of this year &amp; starts up casual conversation: ""hey, it's been a while, how are you?"". It starts off friendly and at this point I had lost feelings for him so it was easy to chat. Before I knew it, we started talking daily and eventually one night when he was drunk, after about 1 month of talking, he confessed he had feelings. We met up in person the day after &amp; talked it out.

He wanted to get back together, he was convinced we would make it work/that it was worth another shot. He said he doesn't know any other 2 people who get along as well as we do (I don't beg to differ, we get along amazingly). But i said no, as I was still troubled by our last breakup and I lost trust in him.

We agreed we both were fine with being friends though. And that's where the rollercoaster started: we've been talking daily since April and snapchatting, texting, and eventually hanging out. He'd take me to get food, hang out, drive around, just whatever. It was great, easygoing and fun. One time we were alone in his car and one thing led to another and he just kissed me there, I didn't stop though...and we ended up hooking up. We both kind of started a FWB from that...just pure fun, we had great chemistry, no one had to know (except a few of my close friends), it was great. We continued this FWB for 5 months up until yesterday.

For the past month he's been extra attentive....like he never was before. I started to get feelings and it scared me, so I started backing away a bit. He noticed, and immediately would try calling me if I seemed off or upset, would offer to come pick me up so we could talk about things, etc. He said he didn't want me to go/didn't want to lose me, that he loves being with me and all the things we do together. I viewed all this as him trying to prove to me how he's willing to put effort in, and that we could work out.

So...yesterday we hung out and i decided to ask him ""what are we, like where do you see this going? Where do you want this to go?"" and to make it short and sweet...he said ""i don't know""....not exactly the answer I was expecting. I asked outright if he's interested in dating and again...""I don't know"" and shut down. His only explanation to being on the fence was that ""When you turned me down in March when i wanted to date, I pushed my feelings to the side and let go of the idea of dating again, because I thought you didn't want to""..total bull. I said ""but here I am now, finally on the same page as you were...why aren't you happy?"" and he just said "" I don't know"".

I took that as a no that he didn't want to date, and he didn't try to change my opinion. I asked him to drive me home and before I got out of his car, he said two things: 1) I don't know whether or not to say No right now, or to just kiss you and tell you to stay. 2) I don't want to regret this 2 weeks down the road, I don't want to be out with friends or out and drinking and having this all hit me at once, and regret what I said to you tonight""

I'm honestly truly lost, I had such a slap in the face last night. I truly thought he'd want to date, just like he did months ago. Someone please offer advice or an opinion, would be appreciated!

- My job was advertised as a higher starting salary than what I am on. I took the job on with the agreement that the salary would be reviewed at my three-month review. It was not.

260,"I’m a senior guy in highschool, who of course wants to make games to. I want to learn the art side and learn 3d modeling, but I don’t know if college is the best way to do it. Currently I’m making an io game with my brothers and trying to market it like hell, but as of now my mom is really wanting me to go college, but I know the financial risks and I’m not sure if it would be worth it for me, my dad is on my side with this. (This may get personal for me, but here me out) So my family is sort of twisted when it comes to college since we are not great at all financially (my dad lost his job in the stock market). My parents told me I would have to pay all of my college debt as most kids do, and since I want to get into 3d design I don’t think college is worth it, when i can learn on my own. I want to create games, not be apart of some company doing only what they want. So I’m thinking that it’s not worth a shit load of money just for 4 years of partying and for not being guaranteed anything. The only thing that makes me consider college is that if my indie games with my brothers don’t work I may have to fall in the societal route which ends a lot of future game dev options since I’d be spending more time paying off the debt. Another thing that makes me consider college is that the “social life” I keep hearing about, and coming from high school really makes me want to meet people since I was apart of a sports team. So it’s really tough because I don’t want to get into debt for just 4 years a fun/education, but I do want to meet more people (which I think I would) and take my chances learning on my own and saving money. My dad is fine with me trying to learn/make money from home, since he knows how shitty the debt crisis is. So I’m really stuck, I am leaning more towards taking a gap year/or 2, to test game dev and if nothing comes as I said, I probably would consider college.

261,"I applied for my dream job at my dream company a few weeks ago and was psyched to get a response from the HR recruiter for an interview. I did my first round interview and was immediately green lit for a second. I had my second, but didn't hear anything for about two weeks, so I checked in with the HR recruiter and she said I should've already heard back from the HR assistant (CC'd) about scheduling my third interview. I guess the girl just forgot about it until I reached out to the recruiter?

Well, HR assistant responds and we plan an interview, then a few days later, ""sorry"" we need to reschedule since the VP is out. Once again, this date gets canned a few days later. Over the phone call we plan a Wednesday interview for this week. We ended the conversation with her saying she'd send out the invite to everyone for confirmation. It's now been five days (granted two were the weekend) and I haven't gotten a single confirmation email from her and it really scares me given her track record. I emailed her Friday afternoon a simple hello and request for re-confirmation on the time/date, but have not heard anything as of today (Monday).

263,"So, this event happened a few years ago, and it's been weighing on my mind and giving me a bit of anxiety about the upcoming Christmas holiday.

A few years ago, my husband and I went to his parents' house for Christmas dinner (we usually spend Christmas eve with my family). I have a mild shellfish allergy. It's not life-threatening, but consuming lobster, clams, etc, makes me sick. My in-laws know about this allergy and are usually very considerate. 

Well, a few years ago, my in-laws invited a family friend (Chet) over for Christmas dinner. Chet is an amateur chef and he brought along homemade lobster bisque. When Chet arrived with the lobster bisque, my mother-in-law (MIL) pulled me aside and hurriedly explained to me that Chet had called her in advance and asked if it was OK to bring lobster bisque. She had told him yes because it sounded so delicious. She half-heartedly apologized for serving something that she knew I was allergic to.

It didn't bother me until it was time to eat. When the lobster bisque was ladled out, there was no alternative for me. I sat in front of an empty bowl, smiling politely while everyone else had two helpings of lobster bisque and raved about how delicious it was and about how I was missing out on it. The whole situation was extremely awkward, as my brother-in-law (BIL) continually pointed out how awful it must be to be allergic to shellfish and how he'd be devastated if he couldn't eat shellfish. By the time the main course was served, I was starving and very angry.

We've spent several Christmases with my in-laws since then. Chet has not made an appearance at any of these gatherings, and shellfish has not been served. I still find myself getting apprehensive about going over to my in-laws' for Christmas, though. I don't know whether or not Chet will be there and I don't know what will be on the menu. 

I'm trying to get over my nerves and figure out how to handle this situation if it should happen again. The other weird thing about this is that I get along really well with my MIL. I'm pretty sure that this is just an isolated incident, but I can't seem to shake it, and it's just been bugging me. How can I get over this?",11Dec2017,2

I told him I'm free until the summer - didn't even mention the studies.

267,"Hello all. 

My current employer recently switched to a new health insurance policy that took effect December 1st. Comparing our old policy to our new one, what’s clear is our deductible is higher and things aren’t covered nearly as well, or not at all, especially for prescription medications and any non-preventative procedures. Also we no longer have vision coverage and can’t get it. With this came the addition of an HSA which we can elect to put money into for our benefit. The thing that remained the same was that we as employees don’t have to pay for the coverage. My question is wether I should be concerned or upset that the company is saving $6k a year per employee for this change and I now have to front more money, due to less coverage and higher deductible plus HSA contributions. In my head that means my total compensation is less than before which, again to me, makes me feel like I am not as “valuable” to the company.

281,"I’m 18 and just started my winter break from college in the States and I will be in the States for break. Both of my parents are living in another country. 

Some background: I came to America around 10. Mom is with me the whole time until this past February. Dad works in another country and visits about twice a year, each time about 2 weeks. I have not been to where Mom and Dad currently are since middle school. 


Mom and Dad’s marriage have had their ups and downs, but nothing extremely major. 


Long story short, Mom found out that Dad had an affair (for about 3 years) in August, but didn’t tell me because the school I am in is extremely stressful academically. They broke the news to me (together) on the phone yesterday. Mom was crying and screaming at Dad the whole time and made Dad confess to me himself on the phone. 


And then I talked to them separately.


Mom told me that Dad sold some of their (our) properties to that woman for at a cheaper price than the market, and now she is doing everything she can to take it back. She told me that it’s not the money that she cares, but the fact that the bitch (excuse my language for this one time) and her family is living in a house which my parents co-owned (Dad faked her signature). Mom is seeking legal advice on both the house (she wants it back) and divorce (she is unsure). I know Mom loves Dad even after all this disappointment which is why she is still hesitant.


I know Mom well and she is not the greedy type. The house is a symbol of their marriage and there are emotional attachments to it, which is why she wants it back desperately. And honestly she does have the legal advantage if she were to take it to court.


Mom had always been skinny and had trouble sleeping. Now she is down to 80 pounds from 110, and rarely sleeps. I am heartbroken.


Now my dad’s side.


He denied his affair initially until Mom found out enough evidence, then he admits everything. He is seeking forgiveness from Mom and I. He told me that Mom hasn’t been sleeping and would physically beat him about once to twice a day. He has bruises and bite marks all over his body, even on his face. He agrees that this is his punishment. Part of me feels bad but part of me also know that he caused all of this. Mom also confiscates dad’s phone as soon as he comes home and starts texting people (usually dad’s family but also dad’s friends sometimes) on behalf of my dad to “create chaos” (dad’s words here). By which he means that she would pretend to be him and tells people of his affair to people (usually his family and occasionally his friends). Dad doesn’t fight back on that because he is in the wrong. 


Things gets extremely complicated because I know my mom’s temper since I lived with her all my life. What Dad is saying sounds totally like something she would do.


Meanwhile, it is clear that Dad is taking a toll. Since Mom can’t sleep sometimes she would start hitting him in the middle of the night, which wakes him up. Dad says he is ready for anything even if it means a divorce. But Mom would not move on until she gets the house back (there is emotional attachment). 


Honestly Dad sounds genuine. He has been my role model ever since I was a kid, and he is extremely well-respected in his line of work. But because he essentially did not live with me throughout most of my childhood I don’t have a strong emotional attachment to him. And the fact that he had an affair and lied about it makes me doubt if I can trust him as a human. 


What’s worse is that I think ultimately I caused all of this. If they didn’t want me to get a better education they wouldn’t have separated for about 7 years and Dad wouldn’t have cheated. 


For the first time in my life I did not sleep the entire night. And I feel so lost I don’t even know if there can be any more joy in my life.

284,"I got caught with a little bit of weed in Virginia a few months ago and I have my courtdate in 2 days. According to my attorney, I have two options. One I take the Virginia first offenders program (the possession charge stays on my record, but it shows that it got dismissed after 6 months i.e. no conviction). The first offenders program means that I may or may not get my license suspended for 6 months and I have to get drug tested regularly and sometimes randomly. I also may have to attend classes/community service during that time. I have completed 33 hours of comm service already since I was charged per my attorney’s advice, because he thought he could get it dropped before trial that way but now he thinks otherwise. Then the second option, the prosecutor has offered me a plea deal in which they reduce the charge to a paraphernalia charge instead. This would show up on my record as a conviction of the paraphernalia charge and also 30 days in jail, which shows up as dismissed because I won’t actually have to serve that, it just goes on my record. This also requires me to not get in trouble for the next 3 years, which I don’t think I will but you never know. Also with this route, if I were to get another possession charge I could do the first offenders program then, unlike the first route which I would’ve already used it. My attorney says that both of these options are pretty much equal, and that an employer or a judge would look at my record the same way whichever option I decide. I’m not completely sure if he’s correct though. Is there anyone with legal experience who can give me advice?",11Dec2017,3

EU citizens can attend universities in the EU at a much lower cost than international students can however, as far as I am aware, you must have been an EU citizen for at least 3 years and that's where it gets tricky.

302,"Hey. My wife works in a retirement home as a cook. At first she loved it but then ""Tammy"" started working there and the problems started, not just for my wife but the other workers. My wife has had enough of her and is ready to find a different job. 

So far Tammy has:

- Yelled at my wife, my brother in law who also works there, and pretty much every other worker. 

- Tried to get my wife fired by lying to management and saying my wife was laughing at the residents, which is false. The witness brought in said my wife has never done anything like that. 

- Shoved an underage employee (she's 50 something years old) with multiple witnesses around, including my wife. She didn't receive any punishment and the kid quit the next day. 

What should she do? She doesn't want to quit but feels like it's the only option. Management knows how shitty Tammy is but they haven't done anything even after multiple documented reports against her. And she's only been there for 6 months. If I were in my wife's position I would tell Tammy to fuck off and leave me alone while I work, but my wife is rather timid. ",11Dec2017,4
305,"My husband and I have a 19mo kid, and we do want at least one more in the future. One interesting wrench in the cogs is that currently, I am under my parents' insurance for another year starting later this month (i.e. I'll be turning 25, and legally they can keep me until 26. They graciously volunteered this service because they have a pretty good health plan, and I'm very grateful to them).

We have been insurance shopping for me, but to add myself onto my husband's work plan (he and our son are on there), is certainly a shocker price when we haven't been paying for me at all. I definitely understand that it's part of being an adult, but we live in an area that has a higher cost of living, and we're already trimming the budget pretty trim.

308,"So I [M21] recently entered a FWB relationship with a senior girl at my college [F22?] after getting close to her on a retreat.  Two weeks so we spent a very intense weekend together, had incredible conversations that lasted hours, the best sex I've (and according to her, she's) ever had, and felt real sense of genuine interest in each other.  We had a followup conversation a few days later about the nature of what was happening and we both agreed to explicit FWB for sake of her being a senior (I'm an old Sophomore), and not wanting to get caught up in anything exclusive/serious.  I agreed and was totally okay and understanding, as I'm in a time in my life where I'm also trying to explore a more relaxed approach to women, and frankly I really liked the connection I had with her and didn't wanna give it up.

Now, here's my obligatory (/s) statement on how great this girl really is.  The best way I can describe her and our connection, as I have to my friends, is that the conversations we have about philosophy and our lives before and after sex are genuinely my favorite parts of our time together.  This is why I really consider her an awesome friend to have, sex or not.

Cutting out the details, what eventually happened yesterday was that she texted me (in response to me texting her about the lunch she invited me to) that she decided that she wanted to enter a closed relationship with this other guy, and that we could continue being friends but without the sex and such.

I was hurt, and even though this caught me off guard (she was the one who specifically asked for non-exclusivity for the previously mentioned reasons), I feel like I can understand her.  I talked to her today before a review session for a final we're taking, and when the conversation turned to the elephant in the room - I told her that I felt hurt but that was just the nature of the situation and that I don't blame her.  I genuinely don't think I should, as the guy she chose she's known longer and all that.  I agreed to something that risked being subject to change.

At the same time, internally, I'm a little aghast at having lost what was my best connection with a woman to a guy whom a lot of my mutual friends with her say is real shitty.  (I should mention that they told me how bad he was in very different unrelated context long before I even knew about our similar taste in women.)  Thus, I'm struggling to rationalize how to best move forward being friends with this very lovely girl, not be (too) resentful towards the guy, and move on.  I know that focusing on the chance of their separation is a waste of my mental energy, but it's hard to not dwell on it.

Anyways, I could just use some help with rationalizing it and not letting it bother my finals week at college.  Thanks!

TL;DR:  Amazing FWB just decided to choose an (apparently) very shitty guy over me, even though she originally stated that she didn't want to be in a closed relationship at all because she's an undergrad senior.",11Dec2017,2

313,"So my roommate (25F) and myself (23F) have known each other for about four years. We moved to an apartment together two and a half years ago because her living situation was terrible and I wanted to move out of my parents house. I was single, as was she. Then I started dating a girl (24F) long distance. Fast forward to now, I’ve been going to see my long distance (now fiancée) once a month, and I don’t think my roommate likes it. We work opposite schedules, so we hardly see each other anyway. We have had issues where I am a person that takes initiative and will clean when something is dirty, and she is not. She never does her chores. I do mine and some of hers if they just don’t get done. When I got back from seeing my fiancée last Monday, I was terribly sick, and slept when I wasn’t working. On Thursday, I got up to have some food, and my roommate was home. So I sat down with her to eat my food rather than going back to my room. She turned on B99 and we sat in silence until I was done eating, then I went back to my room to sleep. Lately, she has been hanging out with her old high school friends, which doesn’t bother me, but when I try to socialize with her at home, where we both live, she doesn’t reciprocate. She knows I don’t plan to renew the lease with her in August because I plan to move to my fiancées city where I’ve gotten into nursing school. I feel like I’m limited to being in my room or being in our kitchen when she isn’t around. 

This is the advice part: Friday is my 24th birthday. This will be the first birthday my fiancée and I get to spend together as a couple, and I invited my roommate to come have a very casual dinner with us. I also invited her out to the club with us (she doesn’t like clubs, not as a malicious thing, just politely wanted to include her). I made it very clear that she is welcome to come but if she doesn’t it isn’t going to bother me. She hasn’t given me an answer. How do I bring it up without sounding rude? Do I ask why she has been giving me the cold shoulder? Do I ask if she is really truly okay? Do I sit her down and say “okay man what’s going on”?

We booked airbnb with a guy we previously stayed with last time which was the cheapest, and best option available then and now. There were other places and she was not happy with any of them because they were too expensive. So now we got the cheap place which is pretty good, and the guy gives me a headsup that a friend of his is staying to help with a project they are developing. I said it's really no big deal for me as we would be pretty mush sleeping and showering only and then out the rest of the day, and I THOUGHT it wouldn't be an issue for my girlfriend. 

Welp, she got pissed because she was not okay with the dude having someone else over, even though we have our own room and our own bathroom, and won't even spend as much time at his house anyway. She wants to cancel, but knows that there is no refund within 24 hours of the scheduled stay, but wants to save money, and still be comfortable even if this is literally the -ONLY- place that was available at what she felt comfortable spending for. 

I really don't want this trip ruined, but I feel she is just looking for stuff to complain about and criticize. She does this every time we go on a trip, and also tends to downtalk me because I always want to make sure trips are 100% problem free and says I ''never want to take a risk'' which I find ironic considering I've been working super hard to have everything ready for us.

328,"Hello people of Reddit!

I am posting this to both r/advice and r/discipline communities as I’m unsure where I will benefit most from these two supporting communities!

This is going to be a hell of a long post and I’m basically just going to unload a load of my chest onto this post. Thank you if you take the time to read this and thank you even more if you respond with solid advice, which to be completely honest is something that I crave so much and the main reason I am spending precious minutes of my life writing this. I don’t really know any more and I am feeling very hopeless and alone. I was going to submit this on a throwaway but have sine decided not to, as I hope for this account to be the throwaway after I make the drastic changes to my life that I so badly want.

Starting with the good, as I reflect on my life – I love it! I have it much better than other people who suffer each and every day in this world. I am a 20 yo Uni student, studying Psychology which is an area I have absolutely fallen in love with &lt;3. I am financially sound, I am healthy, I have sound friends, family who love me visa-versa, lived many great experiences, live in peace, and… I could go on. So, with that said, what is the problem?

The problem is one I well and truly struggle with. One I can’t share with anyone personal who knows me, and has resulted in me coming to you guys 😊. I am at “that age”. I grew out of my faith about a year ago and have been going through what feels like and existential crisis. There is no meaning to life and this is a truth no matter how I repress and distract myself from, is on my mind more than I would like to admit. Currently, I feel lost and no matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want to change, I just can’t. 

I understand how important it is to embrace the current experience whether it be dark or bright, but I can’t seem to shake of the thought of a better future if I was to change. And change is good. It’s what I want. I think of the future that is potential for me and I want it more than anything this world can offer. But what’s the point? I’m going to die anyway. Nothing really matters at all. I just want to enjoy life and be happy. Know who I am and where I belong in this world. But I have no idea who I am, I have a past I wouldn’t want to share and if it be the past that defines us, far be it from any of you ever meeting me!
This may sound selfish. What are the chances that you or I would even be here to spend time here? I have this amazing life before me and I am too busy worrying, thinking of a better tomorrow to experience the now. I have an overwhelming fear of wasting my life and not living it to the full. Of course, this doesn’t have to be but I just don’t know how to change the direction I am going. I am young and have still my whole life ahead of me and so I ask what do I do with my time here. 

I am a virgin who wants to get laid. I am addicted to porn and sugar and can’t seem to use either of these with moderation. I have multiple hobbies I wish to do but just don’t. I have so many books I don’t get round to reading but would love to. I hit the snooze button, am unemployed, I’m not happy with my image, I don’t sleep well, I have a long history of OCD, anxiety and depression. I would love to become a clinical psychologist but this would still take another 6 years and I currently don’t have the work ethic one would need. Not only this but here where I live, there is a 6% success rate of applicants. As much as I would love this career path, it is so competitive. I want to travel the world, be happy with who I am and enjoy this existence without the worry I currently have expressed here.

So, what do I do from here? I mentioned earlier that I am going through what seems to be an existential crisis, which looking into it, is extremely common in people my age.

329,"My older sister (24F) has been doing a lot of drugs for the past three/four years, she's convinced they're not bad but I'm  (21F) 100% sure she's wrong. I've been letting this situation go on for a while but it keeps getting worse. Her personality has changed very noticeably. 
Tbh she's been through very rough times since we were kids, she used to get super depressed and somehow these drugs help her cope with it but at the same time I feel like she can only be happy when she's in these drugs. 
She has a very addictive and depressive personality, And I know she has become addicted to feeling that good.
I really want my parents to do something about it because I know doing drugs is very common now days but these type of drugs (MDMA, acid, weed, shrooms,etc.) isn't healthy at all and she's trying different stuff all the time. 
But at the same time I'm scared that if I tell them she'll hate me and I'll loose her, she has a very strong personality and I can't even explain how betrayed she will feel, mainly because I'm the only one in my family who knows what's going on; I don't expect her to even look at me for a while and it's killing me, she will also stop telling me these things and how will I or anyone  know if she's doing ok. 
I really don't know what to do, I don't want to loose her because it'll kill me but I would never forgive myself if something happened to her and I knew what she was going through all along. 

TL;DR: older sister is doing hardcore drugs all the time, She needs help and I'm afraid she'll never forgive me if I tell my parents, this will fuck our relationship. ",11Dec2017,2

For pretty much the entirety of this school year he’s been very obviously depressed, very sluggish and sad. In private he says stuff like “nothing’s going right for me”, joking about how lonely he is so much to the point where I can’t tell if it’s a joke or not.

336,"My question here is dense &amp; nuanced. In the interest of brevity I’ll cut some pieces out &amp; share them as needed.

I’m a 28 year-old extrovert (I know this intro-extro thing is a spectrum) &amp; I have about 10 very deep, fulfilling relationships with friends that each started 8-15 years ago. My fiancé is a wonderful introverted human being who is loved by the people around me (at least those who she lets in). However - she’s not had any relationships this long, or deep, she is not assertive in conversation, she has low self-confidence in groups, and generally feels insecure in situations where there are unknowns, and all this is sort of leading to her having a hard time feeling welcomed into my friendships.

We have left 60%+ of our time with my friends only to get into a fight where she starts by cold-shouldering me, and then berates me for a myriad of things saying things like:
- I didn’t give her a space to talk
- I edited a question of hers
- I talked about things she didn’t know about - so she felt left out
- we stayed too long and now she’s tired and angry
- etc.

I’m really cognizant of the whole male privilege thing &amp; the pitfalls of my personality, so I’m really careful about dominating conversations with my words, length of comment, intensity, etc. I also am a recovering ENTJ. We are going to premarital counseling (I’m a big proponent of having a third party call me out on my shit, because I know I have blindspots that can really hurt those I’m close to).

A lot of the things my fiancé has told me are my fault, or parts of me I need to work on. However - some of this is her, and so my question here is this:

What can I read, where can I go, to find out ways to empower a self-conscious introvert to feel safe, heard, and relaxed?

Counseling is helping a bit, but we need more &amp; I am completely at a loss on where to go or who to talk with about this. I have a vision of where she will be in a few years - it’s the sane vision as her own - but besides working on not thwarting her growth, what can I do to aid her growth?

339,"I am looking for a second opinion. 

I think a lot. I am thoughtful and very self aware. I am quiet and nice to others. I try not to judge others or assume the worst. I am funny and curious about everything. I love to talk and act. I like to sing and create art. 

I am also insecure and anxious. I hate being with my friends or being at school. I'm scared of being judged. I'm scared of being judged by my family and even myself. 

I wasn't like this last year, but now I'm a senior. At a small all girls private high school, I feel like it should be easy to be yourself. Why is it so hard for me? I used to get up in front of hundreds of people and sing or act. I used to be competitive with school and ace almost every test. 

I'm not like that anymore and I'm struggling to know what changed. I used to be confident, but now I can barely speak to a partner in class. Presenting in class is the worst. I get up in front of everyone and lose every thought. 

I tell myself to pull it together and that everything is ok. I don't need to panic. I tell myself to not care what people think. This is my last year so what does it matter? I love my body and my personality. I hate not being able to be myself in front of others. I hate that I don't know what to do. 

I used to think it was because ""I don't know who I am yet"". I thought it was because I had depressive tendencies or that I was just self absorbed. I know being insecure isn't a big deal because everyone possesses insecurities. However, I struggle with coping with these insecurities and finding peace with my mistakes. I constantly try to overcome them by moving on and not caring. But lately, I don't know what to do. I have become so awkward and laughably cringy. I find myself trapped in social situations and become an ""observer"".  I am not part of the conversation because I can't allow myself to.

340,"Hey so Im just a 14 year old high school freshman living in Canada but I'm very insecure. I have a great friend group, I have many passions in which I excel and I get good grades except I have a great big insecurity, of which only a few people know of. 

Im insecure about my personality and appearance, so well everything. Im average popularity in school I guess and well I get jealous of all the popular girls, they're all rich and pretty. Im not rich, I don't have designer clothing, live in a mansion or travel around the world. These girls have long silky golden hair, tan skin, thin eyebrows, full lips, soft facial features, eyes so blue it seems they have captured the sea themselves and voluptuous womanly bodies. I on the other hand, not much of a treasure to look at, I have longish curly brown hair though it has several shades of brown in it naturally, full eyebrows (they're groomed but my parents won't let me make them thin), full lips (finally something good), hazel eyes, sharp facial features cutting through my happiness and a slender body (I have slight curves like a small waist, b cup boobs perky butt but its nothing compared to the thicc girls in my school :/). 

2nd of all, my personality. I don't drink, do drugs or hookup all the time. These girls always get drunk and go to parties an hookup. Im more innocent and I never get invited to these parties, I feel like people and guys respect me less cuz I'm not as wild. Im also more shy though once you know me Im very, talkative, kind and have a great humor (come to me for the banterr), however guys prefer outgoing sweet girls who have a bubble loud personally and are confident. Im also ""smart"", I personally do not believe I am but everyone tells me I am just because I get good grades. Getting good grades is seen as less attractive as well.

So anyways, how can i overcome my insecurity? Be more popular and pretty? ",11Dec2017,2

346,"Hi everyone, 

I need some fashion advice. Next spring, I'll be meeting someone special that I've known for almost a year, who I met online.

Because of finances and distance, we haven't been able to meet before in person. I want to leave a good first impression, but I don't know where to start to construct my look for the weekend.

I'm a BIG planner, which is why I'm thinking about this so far in advance.

Here's some info about the environment:

*The weather in spring where we're meeting is usually between 32-38 degrees F/0-4 degrees C.
*I'll be doing both indoor and outdoor activities in an urban environment
*I'll be taking a plane between cities, so an airport outfit is needed. *I'll be meeting him in the airport, so that's the first impression.*

Now, here's some information about me!

**Personal Style**

I'm 24, and my wardrobe is a mixed bag. My body type is short (5'1""), plus sized, and busty. I enjoy classic silouettes and cute, vintage-inspired, unique pieces (I usually find them in thrift stores or online). I'm black, and I look best in colors that set off my skin tone (black, white, pastels, and bold colors - no muddy or washed out tones or browns)

I need ideas for something to wear while hanging out indoors, going out on the town, and (just in case) something for the bedroom. I really want our time together to be memorable.

He's earned my trust, has done nothing but treat me well and has been a constant source of emotional support and friendship through an incredibly difficult year. He's so excited to meet me; I want to show him how important he is to me by looking my best.

He seems to like when I show the more feminine side of my personality, and he's a classic romantic. I like anything that sets off my natural assets, and doesn't take long to put together.

I'd appreciate any advice on this, thank you so much for your help. :) ",11Dec2017,2

352,"32/M. My girlfriend of a year and a half broke it off with me, now 1 month later, her world is in shambles. Biological father found her, his family is bombarding her with messages, and trying to set up visits, etc. which is overwhelming and scary (I’m sure). She’s reached out to me, and I want to be there for her, because that’s in my nature. I found out the other day, she’d met some guy a week before we broke up, and has been hanging out with him the last month. She said he likes her more than she likes him, and they’ve kissed, nothing more. Again, for some reason I believe her. This woman, I would’ve spent the rest of my life with. Towards the end of our relationship all we did was fight, I felt unappreciated so I tried solving things, she felt overwhelmed and withdrew. Now, we’ve met up once, starting to talk again, and realizing how much we did wrong in that relationship. I don’t know if anything will rekindle a relationship, but I feel like something may happen where we try dating again. I’ve forgiven her for everything from the relationship, but now that I know about this guy she sought out for emotional support (basically cheating), I don’t know if I can bring myself to dating her again, or if I should. She does something to me, she makes me value what I love about myself. My ex-wife however, left for some other guy, so naturally I’m conflicted. To me, the ex betrayed me, lied to me, sought something I was capable of giving her in someone else, and I believe used that knowledge she’d have that support after she left me. My biggest issue though, spurs from inside me. I forgive people, I always have, and I constantly look for the good. I adore this woman, but don’t know how to not trust somebody that I love. I guess I feel people inherently are good and would treat me with the respect they know I treat them with. 

The question is, at what point do you guys say “hey, I’ve forgiven you, but I’m not putting myself in a spot I’ll ever need to forgive you again”?

353,"Hello. Me and my boyfriend have been together for a while and he wants to watch porn and hentai. It hurts my feelings very much that he wants to look at other girls and masturbate to them. I am very torn up about the situation because I want to be a good girlfriend and make him happy but I can't stop crying when I see or think about how he is doing that. I feel betrayed. In my opinion, I think porn and hentai shouldn't be watched if you are in a committed relationship, especially if the person doesn't want you to. I think they are simulations of the real thing and that you should only experience sexual intimacy with your partner. I also don't want my boyfriend to become addicted either. 

I am conflicted because I also feel like if I tell him not to, he will do it anyways, since he's done that before. If he does keep his promise, I feel like it would make him less attracted to me since I'm basically forcing him to look at only me. But I also feel that if he started watching porn, he would find me less attractive as well and potentially become addicted or reliant. I am so torn about this issue. Help?",11Dec2017,2

363,"Hi there! So I'm a freshman in college this year and a lot has happened. The third week of school me, my roommate, and our two friends went out to a party. My roommate and one of our friends got absolutely wasted but I stayed pretty much sober. Long story short, when we got back to our dorm room, my roommate started throwing up, falling unconscious, eyes rolling back, tons of scary stuff happening... me and my sober friend had never seen anything like this before and knew she had alcohol poisoning, and did not want her to die, so we got our RA. 

Roommate went to hospital and ended up being totally okay! But things were really rocky after that. She is in a position where if she was to get caught drinking again this year, ResLife would evict her from the dorms. She blamed me greatly for all of this happening. (I know I did the right thing, so I dont need advice on that part!) I ended up talking to her a month ago and cried my heart out and told her that I legitimately thought she was going to die and that if she hated me for it, that it was ok, but that I would have to move out next semester because it was killing me. She cried too and we hugged it out and now it's all happy times.

Anyways, now to the reason I need advice. I'm seriously considering applying to becoming an RA next year. My RA told me yesterday that she thinks I would be really good and that she would recommend me to our ResLife department. The problem is, that RA's live in their own rooms, and me and my roommate are planning on living together next year too. She isn't allowed to apply to become an RA this year because of her standing with the ResLife department. I don't want her to be a) super frustrated, b) betrayed because we are friends, and c) feel hopeless and not know where to even look for a new roommate. She knows I am considering applying but I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her pissed off if I manage to get through the competitive process, leaving her with no roommate. :( 

Any advice would be so helpful!!

365,"I'm posting here on behalf of my entire extended family because we think this situation is stupid af. And my post got removed from relationships because of course it did.

So my cousin has been dating this girl for about three or four years, but this is the third time she's done the holidays with him. We'll call my cousin Steve and his gf Stacy.

So Stacy spent Thanksgiving with our family, and is upset that we took a family photo and ""excluded"" her from when it was just cousins, their spouses, and kids. Steve says he's upset, but we all know it's really Stacy. They're saying it's unfair that two of three members of their family wasn't in the photo (her/their four year old was in the pictures), so they're going to be seeing Stacy's family this year.

She has this thing about being really sensitive and kind of a hypocrite. Last Christmas, the four year old - was three then - didn't get a gift in the gift exchange with the other kids, but her mom, Stacy, had asked my cousin if my other cousin had gotten out of jail for Christmas.

The other cousin was up for parole but didn't get it, but nobody in the family knew if he was getting it or not. She wasn't going to go to Christmas if he was going to be there, and my aunt, cousin's mom, find out. She's the one who organizes the gift exchange so ofc the daughter didn't get anything last year. We were all sort of pissed at her.

Stacy just doesn't fit into our family. We're all loud and fun and we drink. She's way too quiet - especially after three years of knowing us - won't drink with us because she says she gets ""sick"" (I saw her have a cup of booze and she didn't get sick) and just is kind of ""off"" when she's around.

At this point, I think that maybe my cousin should let Stacy go to her family this Christmas and come to our celebration as usual. It won't be any different without Stacy because all she does is wander around quietly anyway.

TL;DR - My cousin's GF doesn't want to come to our holiday celebration, which is just fine. How to tell my cousin that he should still come?",11Dec2017,1

So he went to a lunch with his entire family, parents...3 sisters..and two of them have husbands with 3 kids. 1 of them is a super smart genius with like 3 Phds and is nice....but kinda condescending/controlling on a lot of things, we will call him Todd. The other, lets call him Rob, isn't as condescending but kinda likes to pretend he knows everything and is the outgoing smooth talker type where you kind of think he's always full of shit-I honestly don't know a PC way describing that so there it is. They are always really nice to my face and have never given me a reason to think bad but these are the vibes I always got from them even before yesterday.

SO My fiance texts me upset while I'm trying on bridesmaid dresses for my sister, saying how at lunch his brother in laws lectured him about how we aren't ready for kids ( apparently he told them we were going to try after we are married depending where we are financially). They went on to say things like ""kids will test you and you two haven't been tested yet"" and just long lectures on when and how we should live our lives basically and how we have to ""live out our relationship first"" and that we havent lived together yet so it's bad news. I got SUPER pissed but kind of held it in because I don't want to cause a rift but honestly I think they can go piss off. My fiance and I have been through a lot together in our 2 years-including a miscarriage at 10 weeks (his family doesnt know), work and money issues, death of friends and family so they have no right to go and assume how much we have or haven't been tested. Also we aren't idiots...we're 27 and we know to have kids when we are ready emotionally and financially.
My now issue is how to cope if something else like that is said when I am there-should I remark? Let it slide? I feel like sometimes you have to teach people how to treat you sometimes and if I keep letting them be condescending then that's how it'll always be. I don't want to cause a rift though either...anyone been in this situation before?
