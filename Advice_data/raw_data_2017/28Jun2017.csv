2,"Need some major help, so please bare with me. 

First, I have to explain my current situation. I've never traveled, so therefore I've never bought a plane ticket. I don't even have a passport yet. I'm a US citizen, and I'm planning on traveling to somewhere in Europe (1 or 2 weeks). I don't have any close relatives that actually travel outside the country, so I can't ask them for advice. To be completely honest I haven't even done any research, it's quite overwhelming, and I don't know where to start. The only things I have done is save about a months' worth of money. I'm a college student, and work about 30hrs a week. So far i've managed to put away about $500. I plan on doing this for the following months until I finally take the trip. I want to take the trip early next year, but postponing it until the summer of 2018 is also fine. Time isn't really a problem, I know I have plenty. I want  this trip to run smooth, and be enjoyable. I don't want to run into any major road blocks that'll spoil the trip. I just need to know where to get started, and what I should watch out for. Any information will help, seriously. 

Some specific questions i'd like to get advice on are: 
Which part of Europe do you recommend a first time traveler to visit?
When is the best time of the year to travel to Europe?
What is the ideal amount of money needed for a 1 or 2 week vacation?
Which airline should I fly with? 
Money conversion? (once I get there) lol
Thanks so much! 

tldr: First time traveler, barrage me with useful info. ",28Jun2017,3
3,"So for a few years now whenever I'm in certrain situations like standing on a cliff I get a really strong urge to just throw myself off the edge and I don't know why. Or like when I'm holding a sharp knife I get a really strong urge to stab myself. I think maybe the fear just gets too much for me and I want to take it away by doing what I'm scared of? I'm not sure though. And once the idea is in my head I just can't get rid of it. I'm not sure if this counts as an intrusive thought because I've read a little bit about them and they never seem to concern the self.


I do also have them about other people but they're never violent. Like, I'm a straight guy, and sometimes I'll be talking to another guy and I'll just want to say something really really weird like ""I love you"" just to see what happens. I don't why I get the urge to do this. It's funny but it scares me.


Any tips for avoiding this sort of thing? I struggle with it on a near daily basis and it's getting tiring and it makes me scared.",28Jun2017,10

6,"So I got dropped by my ""friend"" this morning officially because of one lie I told her. I was trying to protect another friend by denying that the person she named sent me something. It wasn't even a lie with bad intentions; I didn't want to start anything. She finds out that I lied to her when someone else confirmed for her that the person had sent me something. So, she dropped me. For one lie. She's lied about many things to me but I still tried my best to keep her happy even during tough times. It was a whole deal where she lost a lot of friends because someone ratted her out on something. I knew she was lying and I still know she's lying about it but the tables just got turned against me. Now I feel hurt and betrayed. I even told her I didn't want to start anything but nope, she just dropped me. Now I feel pretty dead inside. What do you guys think I should do?",28Jun2017,1
9,"Hey all,

I'm 23 years old and a recent grad. I'm 3 weeks into working to which the first 2 was just training. The place I work at is very laid back but at the same time, everyone is ridiculously smart and driven. Some of these people have come from very prestigious firms in their past life to join a smaller one.  I'm beginning to think I fell through the cracks and just got lucky with this hiring. I fear for my job because there are just so many better people that deserve it. Everyone around me is constantly on their A game. This is a mid-sized firm so people notice a lot. I'm not overtly extroverted but I'm not introverted either. I've seen people get ahead because of connections or the people they know. I'm beginning to think I'm not cut out for the corporate life...

10,"I worked at a grocery market for about 7 months. I am a part time college student, and the original intention was to find a good first job that was flexible and not super soul draining or stressful. Well , throughout my enti√®re time there, i always had issues with them and their scheduling. Since it's a large grocery market, there are so many floor managers and department managers to talk to. I'd talk to one person about my issues and they'd direct me to another person, and then that person would direct me back to the same person, with nothing ever getting solved. This has been going on my whole time there. Now when I decided to just ghost them while on my unpaid vacation,  (immature I know ) they're texting me saying they can work with me schedule and blah blah bla. Honestly , there's a lot more to working here that makes me absolutely miserable thinking of working there any longer , but most of it I'd say is all the built up emotional baggage from hating it for so long. 

I don't want to sound whiney, sorry internet people. I just want to know, if it isreally that hard for me to find another job that pays as good or  better (I was making roughly 114  a week with 20 -23 hours I believe, union cut a lot out) and one that is flexible with scheduling college kids part time. One part of me really feels like sad leaving but I also feel it's necessary to grow but my dad is making me feel like it's the end of the world. I live in New Jersey by the way if that helps.

13,"Hi all! I graduated college a year ago and managed to land a job in my field only a month after graduation. However, it's only part time, and in order to pay my bills, pay for my own health insurance out of pocket, and chip away at my student loan a little faster, I have elected to keep a few shifts a week at the restaurant I worked at during college. Luckily I don't work both places in the same day, but I still work 6-7 days a week and when I do get a day off, it's usually spent running errands, grocery shopping, and doing chores/housework.

Now this isn't terribly new to me- I've been working since high school and continued to work to live on my own and pay my own way through college, and my last year of college I even went to school full time, worked part time, and held an unpaid internship. I've always been used to the go, go, go, but lately I've been finding myself increasingly exhausted. It's to the point where when I do have a day off I don't want to do anything but lay on the couch all day, even though I know I have a mountain of stuff to do. And should I give in and take a lazy day to myself, I only end up feeling guilty about all the stuff I didn't do because I know it might be a full week or two before I have another day off to take care of stuff.

I'm also finding myself not wanting to hang out with friends or go out and do anything after work because I just want to spend what little ""spare,"" time I have laying around and doing nothing. And when I say nothing, I mean nothing. I don't enjoy reading, I can't get interested in any shows or movies, I don't want to go outside. I just want to lay on the couch and click through the internet or nap.

Any one out there have any tips or advice on how to balance everything? How to cope? How to recharge when you have so little time? How to take care of your responsibilities and still have down time? Most importantly, how do I not beat myself up when I opt to relax instead of keep pushing? Thanks!",28Jun2017,1

15,"I have recently been suspended from college and the only way to get back in is if I earn a 2.75 or better GPA. However that isn't my problem (but if anyone knows any online schools where summer term is still open, comment). My main problem is that, due to my executive dysfunction as well as a lot of extenuating circumstances, I spent most of said ""semester off"" pursuing opportunities (for jobs, school etc.) that didn't pan out and now my parents are (metaphorically) beating me up about it and I'm kinda beating myself up about it because I feel like an absolute failure and wish I could just go back in time and change it all (except my parents say that's impossible because it would have already been the case). I'm kind of in such a state where I don't want (other than me earning my way back) anything positive to come of this because that would mean that A. this whole thing was a good thing in the long run and B. if I write any scripts (I want to be a scriptwriter) during this time, I might have to mention it in answering how I got the idea. I even feel guilty posting this because I know for sure I'm going to be famous and successful but I want to keep this down so biographers of mine don't know it but I don't want it to be TIL-level obscure.

18,"One of the main tasks my team at work performs is validating documentation provided by customers, making sure we can actually solve their requests. There are additional steps where these documents travel between teams from my company, suppliers and even competitors (depending on each request and whatever is needed).

There are, inevitably, mistakes once in a while. When we have a validation error it means the document goes back to the requestor or to another team (only very, very rarely to the customer), but it means we as a whole take longer to serve the customer. Internally my team considers it a natural part of our job and we are constantly improving and reducing both the number of errors and the times it takes to correct them, having being renowned by the management as one of the teams which has improved the most in the year.

However it is not rare to receive comments, specially from members of other teams from my company (which surprises me a bit, I am no longer sure why tho), that are frankly rude, like we are not making our jobs or are barely able to read. Today's comment started along the lines of ""please bother reading..."" Of course I understand the feeling but I cannot see how that would help.

Anyway, I am searching for a response that is univocal and professional, conveying that we take errors seriously but in no way accept that attitude. Is there such a thing?

20,"Hi Reddit! 

So my boyfriend had an incident where a canister of gasoline tipped over and got on various things. One of those items was a bite suit which he stupidly thought he could wash in the washing machine. Mind you the thing weighs a ton and it obviously didn't work. 

Anyway, I was not a fan of this idea and brought the thing outside. I am not concerned with saving the bite suit as that's not an issue. I did a few cycles with just water afterwards. However, I have been hesitant to wash clothes since. Is there a way to ensure that the most gas possible gets removed from the machine? I have the usual products such as bleach, vinegar, baking soda, liquid laundry detergent, and dish soap. I don't want to just go pouring anything in there because I'd rather not burn my face off. Haha. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or insight into how I can safely remove as much as possible if I run an empty load? I'd also like to know the best water temperature to use.

21,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I've been sleeping around with this girl for a while (about a year), we've always used condom (a bit of teasing without but no full pen. And didn't even do this the most recent time) and never had a scare. A month or two ago she told me she was getting on birth control just for extra safety, we still opted to use a condom after that.  
  
I'm moving soon and we won't be able to see each other anymore, just today she told me she thinks she's pregnant (shows all the signs and symptoms but says she can't get a pregnancy test just yet). So we talked about when her last period was, and I tried to work this out.  
  
We last saw each other May 31st, we used a condom and she was on birth control (according to her), plus due to an abrupt interruption we had to stop mid-sex and I wasn't even able to finish. She said that she had a period in early June (5-6th).  
  
I'm almost certain (although weird shit can happen) that she's not pregnant or it couldn't be me if she is. I'd just like some advice on it, I'm moving very far very soon and don't want to have to mess up all those plans because of this.  
  
TL;DR: A month ago had sex, with a condom, with birth control, without finishing. A week later she said she had a period. But now says she's pregnant and I'm the only one she's been with. ",28Jun2017,1
22,"I don't really want to write a long-winded post but I'm feeling pretty down about my whole situation and don't really know what I am interested in anymore. I feel like I've lost all motivation for school and bettering myself. I am sorry if I offend anyone in the field of psychology with this post. It is not my intention. 

It took me five years to get a bachelors degree in psychology and I graduated last year. I got really good grades and was in 3 different research labs- although I logged a lot of hours and helped out as much as I could, I felt like I was kissing ass and that professors and graduate students did not really notice me, or if they did, noticed the mistakes I made and that was it... I also wrote an honors thesis and didn't have the best adviser. She emailed me back in February asking if I wanted to do a poster and publish my results since they were significant, I responded several times telling her 'yes' but never received a response back. I stayed after hours and on weekends to run participants, clean data, do data entry and coding as well as visiting homes for study materials, etc. and worked my ass off. Never screwed around but never really felt like I 'fit in'. I remember asking a grad student and a prof if I could do a poster thru them and they told me no, that I would have to be a secondary author on a poster first. Grad student put me on one of her posters and threatened me telling me ""if I didn't put in enough work she'd take my name off and never let me do a poster."" I had never even done a poster before and it hurt my feelings like she had implied laziness, even though I'd forgo weekends and stay until the evenings for free to work in the lab...I worked on this poster and put in my work...I asked her and the professor again if I could do a poster and they still said no. If I made a fixable mistake (due to stress, not carelessness or laziness like they would tell me) I would get berated for it to no end. Everyone else would be praised and praised and would get into graduate school and would present posters and get publications. I was treated like I was stupid and would be talked to in a condescending voice. I am shy and very soft-spoken and its hard for me to explain things sometimes. I would be very quiet during lab meetings or discussing papers. A couple months after graduating I realized this wasn't for me. Whenever I'd make a mistake or something I would beat myself up for it, ""I'm never going to get a letter of recommendation now. I'll never get into grad school."" I would lose fucking sleep over this. I just feel like I don't fit in. Anywhere. 

When I started college I wanted to become a psychiatrist, then get a PhD in clinical psych, then psychiatry again. I immersed myself in research and psych-related extracurriculars. I studied and got good grades. I kissed everyones ass and basically was a ball of stress and miserable for 5 years of my life. After graduation I got a job as a behavior technician doing therapy with autistic children. This turned into a 7 day a week job making a meager $450 a week and basically being a human punching bag with very little support, crazy families and absent but rude supervisors who don't help you. I stopped doing research because all I did was work. In the midst of it I lost a lot of passion and interest for the field of psychology and school altogether. My parents are telling me to get another bachelors degree in biology or something else. I feel like college was the worst 5 years of my life because I worked very hard and cut ties and burned bridges with all of my potential references and past colleagues and professors I have worked with. I'm not even interested in the field anymore. I don't trust most therapists (based on my own poor experiences in therapy), as well as most psychiatrists. I don't find research fulfilling or rewarding for me anymore. I used to tutor for intro to biology and my parents have told me to get a second bachelors degree in this and to do research in that field. I am going to be 24 soon- everyone I know is in or has finished graduate school. I feel like I am seriously wasting my time and that getting another bachelors will be a huge waste of time and money. It'll be like repeating my experience again. I really do not know what to do anymore. I don't know what I'm interested in and I feel life passing me by, and I am really ashamed at the same time. I don't know what to do. I honestly do not see potential in myself anymore. I don't know why my self-esteem has gotten this low. ",28Jun2017,1

25,"For the past 5 or 6 years I've had a fear of car accidents; not that I myself will be in one, but that everyone I know will be in one. I enjoy being in the car and will be learning to drive very soon (I've just finished uni and think now's a good a time as any to get behind the wheel). But every time anyone I know, even if they're a distant family member or an estranged friend I no longer speak to, gets into a car I spend the next hour or so freaking out that they'll die. 


It's so much worse if it's someone close to me, which it often is. There used to be a website - BBC travel news - I'd check regularly for accidents, but it's been offline now since February. By often I mean I couldn't go more then 15 minutes without checking for a collision, it was pretty obsessive. 


Now the site's been taken down things have become a mixture of better and worse. I now check wider news sources, such as local papers or the BBC, for info on traffic incidents, but not nearly as regularly as I used to. Maybe once every few hours at most. But now I have no way of really knowing if my loved ones are safe, and it drives me mad (sorry for the pun) every time they get into a car.


I'm not even sure where this irrational way of thinking stemmed from; it's especially weird as I have never been in an accident and do not fear ever getting into one myself. And no one I've ever known has been in a car accident either. But it's making my life so difficult, I can't go about simple daily tasks without being distracted by the thought of car crashes and worrying all the time. Every day that goes by and is accident free is a success to me, but then the stress will start up again the following day and the cycle begins again. 


I keep telling myself that I'm obsessing over something which is out of my control and I need to stop worrying, but nothing I tell myself works. I really need some help. 


Edit: and now less then a minute from posting this I'm freaking out I've somehow jinxed myself by asking for help and my loved ones will be much more likely to be involved in an accident. ",28Jun2017,1
26,"Sorry if this might be a little bit long, it's very confusing.

I started working at this office about almost 10 months ago. It's small (about 15 people) so it's like a ""family."" My coworkers are snakes that can't be trusted and gossip 24/7. One of the owners (there are 2), Pete, has anger issues. Some coworkers have even mildly sexually harassed me and others. I decided to quit eventually and focus more on school for the upcoming fall semester, but after today I want to quit ASAP. To add a probably important detail I am dating my boss's (the other owner, John) son, and have been dating him for 3+ months now. John doesn't come back from vacation until Thursday, and so I was planning on resigning Friday (so that the 2 weeks would be even steven.) My idiot self told one of my coworkers that I was planning to put in my 2 weeks on Friday. Not so much as an hour later, I overheard him telling the office supervisor that I was going to quit. She said, ""You made my day with that news."" I knew she didn't like me very much, but this really hurt my feelings and upset me. My parents want me to wait until around the time school starts before I quit so that I don't look desperate to get out of there to John (my boyfriend's dad/my boss). The problem is, I really am desperate to get out. I can hardly stand another two weeks of this, and I don't think I can go any longer than that. My mom told me not to leave too early because then I can't use them as a reference, which I explained to her that the office manager hated me anyway and I don't think it would make much of a difference.

I feel like bringing the items and the receipt in to the store to show a cashier to rightfully pay to correct the error. Would they think I stole it though, and the cashier may get in trouble. (Although it is a brand new store with likely newbie employees)

I realize the cashier may get in trouble for this error. Because it isn't a lot in regards to the money($10 or so), should I just not bring them back to pay for them and not inform them of the error for the sake of the cashier?  But perhaps they should know of this error so they can try to not let it happen again considering it's a new store?

Or should I perhaps bring them back to the store and pay for them without mentioning the error. This fixes the error so the store gets the money possibly without the cashier getting into any trouble.  Maybe this would look like I stole them though if I don't mention the error/reasoning and bring in items and pay for those same items I brought in?(Items still new with the prices on them)

32,"I should start out by warning you guys that this might get a little lengthy. I'm just looking for some unbiased advice and decided to turn to you guys. 

So like the title says, I currently have two job offers and each one comes with their own pros and cons. I'm currently in my early 20s and work at a financial institution that is open literally every day of the year but 3 holidays. I currently make 12.50 an hour and work roughly 46 hours a week. My current company provides decent health coverage, matches 6% of my 401k, gives two weeks paid vacation, 6 sick days in a rotating 12 month period, and a decent bonus when the branch meets certain quotas. I've been with the company for a little over two years and just recently decided to see what other options I have. 

I applied to a different financial institution a few months ago and was offered a job about a week ago. I applied to work there because I felt their hours would be a nice change. It's Monday-Friday, 8:00 to 5:00, paid holidays off office job. The structured schedule really appealed to me and they also match 6% in 401K, cost of their health insurance is roughly the same, and I would still get 10 vacation days a year. Those vacation days can be used as personal or sick days. I don't call in sick often, so less PTO shouldn't be a huge issue. They're offering me the same hourly rate, but it would end up being a pay cut in the long run as I wouldn't be allowed to make overtime and I wouldn't make any bonuses. It is also in my current city, so I would only have around a 10 minute drive to and from work. If I took this job, I would have to transfer my 401K over, wait 3 months to qualify for their health insurance, and have to adjust to paychecks without bonuses or overtime. It is also very sedentary, so I would need to get a gym membership which is something I've been meaning to do and would finally have time for. 

The second job offer is with my current company. There's an open assistant branch management position that my district manager has offered me. It's approximately 40 miles from my city, but the pay would be around 17 dollars an hour with a 300 dollar bonus each time my branch hits their monthly quota. This branch is currently very understaffed and I would most likely be working with only 1 day off a week for the first few months. This would also keep me from seeing my husband, who I already seldomly see because of conflicting work schedules. I would most likely need to purchase a new vehicle as my current one is unfit for icy weather. But I wouldn't have to go without health insurance, my 401K wouldn't have to be switched over, and I would have experience in management which would look good on a resume. I'm just not sure that I want the added responsibility, long hours, and pressure that would come with this position. But I also think that now would be the best time for this as I do not have any children.


I have tried to talk to my husband and he has told me he will support whatever decision I make. I have friends who used to work for my current company telling me that no amount of money could ever make them come back and I also have people telling me I should take the position in management because it is such a big step for my career and comes with more pay. As soon as I think I've made a decision, I find myself questioning it and leaning more towards the other. 

I know this is ultimately my choice, but I was wondering if any of you have ever been faced with the same delimma and if so, how did it work out? Are you happy with your decision or do you wish you would have chosen something else?

36,"My professor doesn't seem to respond to emails as I expect, he does not seem to confirm appointments. 

Example (by email)

Professor: I can meet Thursday or Friday at 5

Me: That sounds great, shall we meet Friday at 5?

I email him the next day to check in 

Me: Hi Dr_, are you available to meet Friday?  Thank you.

Professor: Yes, we are meeting Friday at my office...

I mean from my perspective, I simply feel like he has not read my email at all since he hasn't replied. A simple ""yes"" would confirm that yes, we are meeting that day. I really feel like shit and rude for making him think we have a meeting and I think we don't.

Now dating sucks, and we all have down moments. One of mine includes getting low and googling exes, as one does. I found her Instagram page.  Her most recent post was that she and her ex-husband (whom she had divorced shortly beforehand, and with whom she already had two kids with) announced that they were expecting another baby... due in November... which is nine months after February.

As far as I know, she wasn't seeing anyone else and wasn't seeing her husband.  Could have been bullshit, but who knows. 

My question, to the women in particular... Should I ask her if it's mine? My current plan is to be honest about how I found out.

58,"Ever since five years ago, My sister and parents constantly get into arguments and fights. It's gotten so bad that today, my mother has left, and it may be permanent. My sister and parents have gone to therapy, but they only went less than five times, and it seems like it didn't help. I believe the arguments stem from my parents arguing when we were children, and how they act when they argued. My sister believes that she is always correct and never believes that it's her fault. She can't accept another persons criticism about her, and believes that they are stupid or that their point is stupid. It's gotten so bad that one day, we decided to hold a family meeting (which we rarely do) to discuss and fix the mistakes made during an arguement. To learn what mistakes were made and what to do to fix them.  Except, my sister refused to attend the family meeting as she believed that nothing good will come of it, that it was useless to do it as my parents don't understand what they did wrong, and my parents lost all their chances to make up. My parents weren't the greatest either. Early in life, when my sister showed signs of disrespect, they met those signs with retaliation and arguing. My family all had so much pride, that they kept on butting heads, making my sister more disrespectful and rude. I believe/hope my parents have changed since then. They try to avoid arguing and fights with my sister as much as possible, so that everyone can have a happy life. From what I've seen, they are willing to admit their mistakes if they know that they made a mistake. Most of the time, they don't understand the mistake they made to make my sister upset, which infuriates my sister more, as she excepts them to know what they did wrong. Because of their constant arguing, I've become emotionless and a shut-in. I rarely ever start up conversations or talk, and it's become difficult to talk to people without looking away every few seconds. During arguments, unless it involves me (which happens rarely), I would go up to my room and put in headphones to drown them out. I don't know what to do. There has been times where I addressed them, but nothing good comes out of that, and it only leaves me feeling more helpless and angry.

This is something that has been bothering me lately, as I have recently gotten a new job that (in my state here in the U.S.) requires me to join the local Union for that workplace. First off, I really don't know too awful much about Unions, and initially didn't really think anything of them, besides another thing coming out of my paycheck. 
However, as work has gone on, people offhandedly mention things that the Union does or doesn't do for them within the workforce and that has got me curious about something, how are they getting all that information and knowledge about what the Union does? 

When I got the job, I was also given a phone number and a name for my Union...er, representative? Not sure of the exact title, but it just got me wondering, should I call and... I dunno, introduce myself? Or is that number only for major issues?

**My past**
So when I was younger, my first best friend for 2-3 years moved away in 1st grade. I didn't take this too deep and quickly made a new friend the next year.  Well, that friend too moved away after being friends with me for ~5-6 years. We still were somewhat friends but he soon became a asshole who I felt used me to go on vacations with my family, but I've moved on from that. I soon made new friends in middle school but sadly high school broke that friendship up as we progressively pushed each other out of our lives. Anyway, in my first 2 years high school I was the quiet kid (been shy all my life except the last 2 yrs) so I didn't make many friends, but I played soccer and gradually bonded with some of the others. Even though I had friends, on weekends and during our breaks all I did was sit at home because where I live its separated in two areas, and to get to my area you have to drive about 30-60 mins (kind of hard to explain without stating where it is but whatever). This continued till this year as I've somewhat tried to fix this and have been out a lot more lately with me being able to drive. Anyways, I met a new friend in high school that became one of my closest friends. Sadly this friendship ended like the others, he had to move away. At this point I felt as if I was cursed and felt forming new friendships was worthless as I feared a new friendship would end like the others.

**My Dating Life**
As I stated before, I haven't had a girlfriend before. This is partially because I tried for ~7 years to get with this one girl and ultimately failed. I asked her out multiple times and she eventually said yes, but she was an acrobat and was constantly practicing every weekend or traveling to tournaments. There was 1 day that haunts me still, she finally had some time off and wanted me and some others to go to one of those parkour-esque places (with all the trampolines and foam pits) then after we would go to a movie. For some reason I panicked and decided to bullshit a excuse to get out of it. We gradually stopped talking after this, except for my random texts to see if she wanted to do something and her telling me she was busy. I gave up for like 3 months and remembered her one day and talked too her again asking to try again with me. She told me she found someone else and I was thrown into a depression. I posted a bunch of dumb shit on twitter and made a fool of myself to her and my friends who follow me. I got out of this depression after I realized how stupid it is to dwell on the past, but it was a long process. I eventually tried to talk to her again on New Years 2016-2017 in a drunken state and was let down again. I haven't talked to her since then but sometimes wonder what would happen if it worked out. Other than her, I don't talk to any other girls. I mainly don't know where to find other girls as I'm never invited to parties and barely go out as is. 

**My Insecurities**

I've been skinny all my life. Not anorexic or anything severe, but I'm less than normal weight. I'm pretty weak, and can't get any motivation to lift weights as I feel like its a pointless waste of time despite me spending countless hours playing Dota as its sadly one of my few passions after I quit soccer ( FeelsBadMan ) I know that I can find a girl that likes me for me, but I still get thoughts that why would they like me when there are other guys who are buff, play football and other shit. 

**Closing**
Anyways, I'm just lost in life. I can't find passions that are worthwhile, making true friends is very complicated for me as I have no experience (I don't know where to start), and I don't know where to begin with my dating life. Thanks to anyone who reads or comments. :)",28Jun2017,1

This girl I have a crush on has been there for me from the start. When my mental illness started to play up after 3 continuous breakups with this girl she never once stopped caring and always comforted me and nurtured me.

83,"We have been planning on moving to another state to be closer to family. My husband found a job and left first, kids and I planning on following next month. We have been together since we were young. We have definitely had some rough times in the past but have gotten through them. We have always been faithful to each other. When he left, we had happy conversations, we talked about normal day to day stuff. Then I felt like something was bothering him so I asked and his response blew me away. He said that I have never helped enough around the house and that I am mean to him and he doesn't like the way I treat our kids. He thinks I sleep all the time. He says that I can still live with him for the sake of the kids but he will never be able to trust me because I haven't grown up and he has. He doesn't say I love you and the end of our conversations but when I straight up asked him does he hate me he says he doesn't. My first response was just pure anger because I have been (what I feel like) working my ass off and taking most of the financial burden. I make more money and have managed the finances the best I can. But I do have a very demanding job and I work long and strange hours. As the anger started to melt away I realized that I have developed a horrible routine of putting my work before my family and I can understand what he is trying to tell me. So I fessed up and made a commitment to change myself and my behavior, regardless of how this ends. Then I just got silence. I tried to be patient for a couple days but today I called him and said I really need to hear from you. So he talked to me but didn't really have very much to say. He says that he is completely done but that the kids and I can still move in. I asked would that just be as friends? Are you willing to try and fix it? He says it is too late for that. I have been with the same guy from teenage years until now and I don't know how to read this. Why is he suggesting that I live with him if he is done? Is this anger on his part?

84,"I've been in an apprenticeship for almost a year now and I realized, I don't want to do this job for a long period of time. Just when I decided for myself at least not to quit the apprenticeship, I got an offer for another job. Although it's different, the tasks I would have to do seem to be similar, more specifically, both are pure office works. 
The new offer is overall much more attractive, with a better wage, less travel time and so on.
Furthermore, the boss of the new job is a friend of my family, so I'd feel more pressured there than now.

Now I don't know what I should do, I don't want to switch because if the jobs really are similar, then I would've wasted a year just to accept a new job, that I basically don't like either.

89,"The man I unfortunately have to call my father has been emotionally, verbally, &amp; mentally abusing my mother for awhile. 

Last month my mom, who is the only one who works out of the two, was laid off from her teaching job due to the school consolidating. Ever since my mom has been applying left &amp; right to schools, with a few interviews happening. No job offers yet, but she's only been searching for a few weeks. However, my father who is entitled &amp; believes he carried the family for 25 years (even though my mom worked too) has been getting frustrated. He has been screaming at my mother, as bad as tonight currently at 2am. 

&gt; You're an absolute f***ing disgraceful, pathetic, special ed, lazy, c***. What are you doing you lazy bitch. You should be carrying the family now &amp; you stole money from me. You're a liar &amp; a thief. You have absolutely no remorse. I wish you would get in a car accident so I could collect your life insurance. Why don't you apply to Walmart &amp; be a greeter since that's all you're slow mind can handle. 

The money he claims is his is from their business. THEIR business. My mom used $500 to pay for bills, however my father wanted that money. He uses my moms money on booze (he's an actual alcoholic), drugs, and fast food. He is perfectly capable of working, however he believes everything should be handed to him. Even though he has a Masters degree in Finance &amp; thinks he shouldn't have to work.

He was on an antidepressant until he took himself off of it since he thinks he didn't need it. He believes bourbon &amp; tequila is better for him. He sits in our house saying ""I'm not going to be around much longer"" &amp; lists ways he wants to kill himself. 

I have absolutely no clue what to do. I'm 20 years old, but I can't call the cops on him since we live in a small town &amp; they're terribly corrupt. He doesn't want to go to a doctor to get medication for his anger &amp; likely bipolar disorder. He just sits at home all day coming up with new reasons to hate humanity.

Yesterday, the manager had to do some online testing from the headquarters and attend a meeting, so he told me to do the test instead, and I failed it.

I know their revenue is in millions, but they are not making profit ATM. So I was beating myself in the head, then the guy who said that 10k thing saw me, and told me to go get everyone coffee (and take a walk) and not to worry about it.

105,"So, yesterday I was with my friend B. B and I were hanging out and then we decided to go look for our friend. His name will be A. We looked for A and we saw on Snapchat that this other kid (who is the thief) was hanging out with him at the library. I didn't want to hang out with the other kid too because he stole $50.00 from me, a laser-pointer from me, and he stole other people's credit cards and debit cards. B and I decide to go to the library anyways. We go to the library and we go to the section where we all hang out usually. We see that both A and the thief kid are there. I decide to leave because I'm not allowed to hang out with the thief kid anymore. I'm gonna see him more and I don't want to hang out with him but I want to hang out with my other friends so what should I do?

Also, Person A, B and I were all planning to have a sleepover the day before but person A's parents (who were the hosts) didn't let me come over because I used to be loud at sleepovers and they still think I am loud at sleepovers but I'm not. I know that if I were talking to them in person, they would allow it. I basically couldn't have a sleepover because of the asshole kid. Oh and they invited this other kid instead of me so self esteem point -1. Oh and his Mom said that all 3 of us (A, B and me) could have a sleepover the day before but she said no the next day behind my back.

(TL:DR: My friends hung out with a kid that I wasn't allowed to hang out with at the library (because he stole from me) and right when I saw that he was there, I left. I missed out on a sleepover from this because the other kid who was hosting the sleepover had a Mom who didn't like me but she wouldn't say that to me in person so she would've actually allowed the sleepover, had I gone in person, which would have happened if the thief kid was gone when I came to the library.)

I'm going to see the thief kid more so what should I do when I see him? I still want to hang out with my other friends. Should I leave or stay? Should I stop hanging out with all of them all together? Something else?

113,"Hi everyone.

I've been in a relationship with this girl for three months. Sounds like a short amount of time, but frankly in those three months we've connected in a way neither of us have ever connected to another person before in our lives. I'm talking truly deep, meaningful, opening up about pretty much everything in a way that is scary and beautiful at the same time and really only made possible by the fact that we share so many opinions and experiences etc. She's an incredible person, highly intelligent and wise. We're a fantastic match. We love each other to bits.

However, almost from the beginning, there have been certain issues. We have both been through therapy in the past. Hers lasted three years and she still meets with her therapist every once in a while. One of her major issues is that throughout her life, a lot of the people she loved abandoned her. This began in her childhood with her father AND step-father and continued through various friends and boyfriends over the years. I realised the true depth of the emotional devastation this has caused her the other day when she said she found it hard or even impossible to believe I wouldn't leave her too. I cried when she told me that because I really saw her pain for the first time and felt so incredibly sorry for her.

Her abandonment issues are also becoming an enormous problem for our relationship though, because whenever she feels she should be having a certain emotional reaction to a situation we're in (when I'm down, for example, and she feels like she should be loving and comfort me), she puts herself under enormous pressure and consequently becomes unable to act that way or feel any emotions at all. I've come to realise that she does this because she is so afraid that I will want to leave her if she is unable to give me what I need in a relationship (in that example, love and consolation), and it becomes a vicious circle. The pressure she exerts upon herself pushes her into a state in which she is almost unrecognisable as a person. She loses her (usually keen) sense of empathy and becomes cold and uncaring, lashes out at me repeatedly and usually takes 2-3 days to calm down and go back to ""normal"". Once she is out of that state, she is very much aware that she was in it before, but while in it, she finds it impossible to believe that she is anything other than completely normal.

This terrifies me. It's very painful for me when the person I love so much goes all kamikaze on me, but the worst thing is that I feel so helpless, like there is nothing I can do to help her love me again. Everything I say seems to make it worse, and I don't want to withdraw completely in those situations because it becomes so unbearable for me to feel that disconnection. Right now, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to open up and trust her, because I'm constantly afraid something I say will trigger this kind of reaction from her again.

I love this woman so much, but I feel like these issues (I don't want to call them HER issues, after all we're in this together) are slowly tearing us apart. I don't want to lose the incredible connection we have. Any advice? Anyone experienced anything like this before?",28Jun2017,3

116,"Hi, I am 29 yo engaged male living in India. The dilemma that has been eating me alive for about 2 years now is whether to continue running my dad's business or grow my freelancing business.

So I am a guy who is low on self-confidence and self-respect but who has all of his demands fulfilled. My dad owns a small business, which provides enough money to live nicely in a great city. I feel financially secure.
However, the problem comes when I am underestimated by people around, even myself on certain occasions. Being the owner's son makes me look like a weak personality as everyone thinks that I achieved everything because of my father. The lack of self-confidence appears and can be seen in my behavior. Slowly my self-confidence is depleting as I can't find any other business which is as lucrative as my fathers and so I am tempted to keep working ""for"" him as other options requires me to step out of my comfort zone.
Now I know the old talk about getting out of your comfort zone but I(or maybe my mind) don't think I find that a practical option. So the self respect keeps on declining as I always think that I have achieved nothing in life as I had huge ambitions when I was younger.

So as a hobby I started doing freelancing as my interest was in computer programming. I did web applications, android applications and desktop applications for clients and made certain amount of money, which were peanuts compared to what I would have earned under my father. However I felt financial freedom and gained my self respect as well as others'. Growing this freelancing business is actually going out of my comfort zone which I guess I do try to avoid.

Currently, I am doing both of these works with bulk of my attention towards the family business. So as a result freelancing is suffering and self-respect is at an all time low. With my marriage looming in 4-5 months, I feel trapped in this comfort zone as it is becoming very difficult to break through. 

I thought about writing since 1 year asking for advice but couldn't as I know no one cares.
So reddit, here I am waiting for any simple piece of advice that I can work on OR any truth about me that I need to hear in order to help me regain my self-respect.

Even if you don't have any advice for me I am thankful that you guys found time to read my dilemma.

So, a few weeks ago, I left my mobile number in a phone box in the city I live in.

To cut a long story short (but I'm happy to elaborate if needed), the reason I did that was because I met someone on my way to work who was vulnerable and needed help. We spoke a while and I agreed to meet her after work at that same phone box but she never turned up so I left my phone number there in the hope that she'd find it and call me back.

She never did. But, predictably, I got a fair few prank calls off the back of it - which is fine, whatever. Then, this morning, I woke up to a text that just said 'hi'. I asked who it was and where they got my number. It was from the phone box and they said:

&gt;My names [redacted] im from [redacted] im isolated and lonely i need a friend

My instinctive reaction was to respond as though this were a genuine request for help (even though there's a good chance it isn't). My girlfriend said I should ignore it or just tell them to call Samaritans. That's probably a sensible reaction but there's a big part of me that feels bad just being like ""not my problem, tell someone else"" (obviously I wouldn't phrase it like that) when someone has reached out for someone to talk to. Like, I'd be more than happy to just engage in conversation with someone who is lonely rather than just assume it's something dodgy without even giving them a chance.

I guess it just doesn't sit right with me for the default response to be 'do not trust them, walk away now' - but then there's a part of me that think maybe I'm being naive and just asking for trouble by even replying.

So yeah, but of an odd situation and I know I've got myself into it - but I'm interested to know what you would do (aside from not leaving your phone number in lying around in the first place).

Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for your thoughts, everyone. I've texted him suggesting he talk to Samaritans and pointed him in the direction of a local branch.",28Jun2017,1

Figured I would just ask this here. I currently am two years out of college with a degree in environmental science and biology with minors in coastal management. I currently work for a state environmental agency as an environmental specialist. The pay is good.. I started at about 45k. I have the ability to max out at about 88k, in my position. That is atleast 15 years down the road. I can also apply for promotions that can get me up to 95-100k.  I enjoy the job... the people are very nice but the location is not a good place and since it is a state agency, it doesn't actually feel like I am doing anything to help the environment. I'm basically just allowing development to happen and trying to regulate and save as much as I can but if someone has enough money; they can buy themselves out of it.  It's kinda depressing and I'm losing that spark I had in undergrad to develop methods to help the environment.. I can't see doing this forever at all. Everyone at my job seems so aged by it.

I recently was offered an interview for a fully funded masters of science at a school in New England to do research under a professor. No saying I am going to get it but it would mean leaving my job. I would love to further my knowledge and do research. I can't afford grad school after undergrad so fully funded is the only way to go. The cool thing about my current job is that I will stay on a rehire list for three years, so I can come back easily if there is an opening, just maybe not to the same department.

This grad school does not guarantee any income increase for me. Just the ability to have more research experience, connections and a better resume builder. I really want to learn more but I don't know if it's dumb to leave a stable job.. I have a decent chunk of money in student debt but can defer my loans.

I still have technically been living with my parents, but almost every night I end up staying with my girlfriend at her parents' house with her (she lives close to where we went to undergrad, so she commutes). This has been going on for over a year and a half now, so her house has become almost a second home to me (We are planning to probably be engaged within the next year, which her parents expect and do approve of). Her parents have been absolutely amazing to me, which is why this situation is a little weird to me.

At the beginning of the year, I accepted and started a new job that was more in line with my career goals and career path. Previously, I worked quite close to home, in a neighboring town next to my girlfriend and I (about ten minutes from her parents house and ten minutes from my parents house). My new job is about 45 minutes from my girlfriend's house and an hour from my parents' house. While it has been nice and a privilege to live at home, the commute and basically (for a lack of a better phrase) ""living out of my car"" have taken a toll on both my car and myself in general. Just to give you an idea of my daily routine: Leave for work in the morning from my girlfriend's house, leave work in the afternoon and drive to my house, get clothes for the next day and eat dinner at home, then drive to my girlfriend's house later that night to stay with her. Trust me, I know the situation could be much worse, and I am VERY appreciative of the hospitality both her parents and my parents show.

Like I said though, the commute is starting to take its toll and I have been actively looking for apartments to get me a little closer to work, but also still keep myself close with my girlfriend. So, I recently found a nice place that is about 10 miles from my girlfriend's house, but would also cut the mileage of my commute to work by over half. The location is easy and fast to get to her house and also will be easy for her to get to her student teaching as well this fall (about 15 miles away, making two turns the whole commute). While I fully didn't expect for her to move in with me until after she graduates and starts working full time, her mom is being really protective about the situation, which surprises me. Her mom said she can only occasionally stay at the apartment, and wouldn't appreciate her using her mom and dad like that. While I understand some logistics they brought up (her dad will sometimes drive my girlfriend's car due to his own long commute to keep the miles on his car down, her work schedule, etc), some of it seems hypocritical. My girlfriend's mom seems more hesitant of just letting her stay in general more than anything. My view on it though, is that I spend almost every night at her house as it is now, so what's the difference? They obviously like me, and know that we are quite serious and have serious plans in the future (which they are accepting of) but this seems to be a hurdle for them (95% her mom)? I just don't want something that was supposed to only help our relationship by bringing us closer, end up making us take a step back.

Like I said, I don't know if this was just a venting session or what, but I'm just confused on what to do. I don't want to get the apartment if I am going to see her less than I do now, but I really like the place and it would help with my vehicle's longevity. Is it better to wait until we can move out together (which I have no problem doing and saving more money), but at the same time, who knows when that will be, if her mom is being this difficult in this situation? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",28Jun2017,3
144,"Im 21M for reference. 

So basically for the past year or so I have been focusing solely on getting girls. This has a lot to do with me not being able to talk to the opposite sex for a verrryy long time growing up, but that's another story. Now that I can, its all i think about. And when I don't have the opportunity (like if I'm sitting at home one a Tuesday night watching tv instead of going to a bar and trying to hook up) then it starts to make me miserable.

It is so far and away the most important thing in my life, but I really don't want it to be. I used to try very hard in school, and I used to have goals for what I wanted to do after, but now I hardly even think of those things. Its just ""how can I go out and meet some girls today?"" I used to be able to chill with my guy friends indefinitely and have a great time doing it, but now its like if there aren't any girls there I'm not having a good time.

I feel like the solution is to get a long term gf (or actually work on myself so that I can be happy without female approval, but who has time for that) but i am so picky when it comes to actual relationships (as opposed to hookups) that I can't seem to find a girl I would want to actually date. 

Also it should be noted that I'm not unbelievably good at getting girls, I've hooked up with 4 in the last 6 months to put a number on it, partially because I'm not a huge drinker so I don't get those opportunities as much.

I don't really know what I want from this thread, but if anyone's got some life advice for me id love to hear it.",28Jun2017,1
145,"Bought a couple of games online, including Animal Crossing: Let's go to the City (City Folk). I forgot I bought it as it didn't come until today. A couple of days ago I bought the same AC game on GameStop. There are differnces between the two games though. The one I bought online comes in a big box and has a Wii Speak in the package. It's used, so the box is damaged, but I assume it contains everything. The one I bought on GameStop is just the disc and case, and I assume a guide as well.

Which one do I sell? I don't have too much room, so a huge box isn't ideal. Chances are I'll never use it, but it's nice to have a Wii Speak. I didn't have one before, and now I can buy games that use it.

155,"I've been working at my current job for about seven months. This is the first time I've had a full-time office job, before that i was stuck in retail, so needless to say i'm happy to have gotten out of that.

Things have been going ok so far. This is not what I want to do long-term and the pay is just ok (I'm salaried, 30k a year, which is for me a huge step up but i recognize that is not a huge salary to many people), but overall i have few complaints about my job.

The problem is this: my boss has asked me and several other people to start coming in on weekends. Put on the spot, i said of course i could come in on weekends, because i was taught by my parents that you don't want to say no to that sort of thing.

Now, this is for a specific project and is seemingly only a temporary thing. But frankly, I don't want to do it. I work hard during the week and i value my weekend time, and i don't believe that the project really requires any more time investment from me specifically. Obviously I already agreed to it, and I've resigned myself to losing a couple weekends to this job. 

Hey reddit, i'm just gonna come right out and say it, i don't want to work weekends here or anywhere. I value my time off, and I have hobbies and creative pursuits that i'm much more interested in than this job. What do i say at this job or any job in the future to make sure i'm not in this situation again?

Little extra info:
While i have no real complains about this particular job, I don't want to stay here forever. I want to keep my job until february next year, when my lease is up. I'm going to move after that to be closer to my partners (i live in the suburbs, they live in the city) and have been expecting to have to find a new job so i don't have to commute 1.5 hours + every day. So while i need to keep this job for the time being, I don't see myself being here for long. My boss also doesn't like excuses. When another co-worker said she could not work weekends because she is needed to care for her own children, my boss expressed mild (seemingly joking, but i believe it was passive agressive) disapproval.",28Jun2017,21

160,"I'm 27 and live on a ground floor appartment, in a block of four appartments. There are four yards behind the block, in a row. My yard is directly behind my place, with the guy above me's (let's call him Dave) yard being round the side of the building. Dave's yard is only accessible through mine, but he never really goes there and keeps to himself. On the other side of the block, they have a yard divided in to two between the upstairs and downstairs appartments. 

The people who live above the appartment opposite me smoke a LOT of weed (and also have kids). But they ALWAYS go to Dave's garden (and sometimes even my own!) to smoke so it's out the way of their children. However, every time they do (at least 8 times a day) they are either walking straight past my bedroom and living room, or hanging around in my garden smoking.

I don't want to sound like a grumpy neighbor, but it's a serious invasion of privacy. However, they're quite rough people. I feel like if I take this up with them, there will be serious tension in the future. Me and my girlfriend could be watching a movie in the living room with the window open as it's nice weather, then suddenly the whole house is now smelling of weed and they can see straight in and look at us (which they do a lot). 

It's like they have no fucking social awareness at all, they are just morons tbh. I smoke ciggarettes (in my own yard), and they know this, so sometime they'll come banging on my window for a lighter if they forget their own. It's just getting crazy. I'm terrified of inviting new people to my house because it's incredibly embarassing for my home to smell of weed 24/7 and the knowledge that they might come banging on my windows or look in at any point. I don't even give them a light anymore, but yet they still give it a shot and bang on my window. 

I just can't relax without either them looking in my windows and smoking weed in my yard. I don't understand how people can be so narcissistic and not realise (or not care) about other people's privacy. I'm a friendly guy, and more than willing to chat with my neighbors.

163,"So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for seven months, and I'm madly in love with him. But this particular incident happened about 3 weeks after we'd met on tinder, and before we'd ever had sex or became official. I was 20 at the time, and a virgin, and I felt super embarrassed and ashamed about it and way to embarrassed to tell anyone (like, at this point, even my closest friends thought I'd had sex). So, I was just starting to become seriously interested in him, but I was so scared to have sex with him, in case I was terrible and he'd lose interest. I was also scared to explain that I was virgin, in case it would scare him off. I mean, I was an extreme virgin- I'd never seen a guy naked, or even been on a date with anyone before him. Every time he invited me over, I'd make some excuse and go home, and it was starting to stress me out. Then, one night, I was at a party with my friends, and I went back to the room of one of my close male friends (who had no idea I was a virgin) and we had terrible, clumsy, sex. The dude was an american exchange student, so after a week of having sex and avoiding my now-boyfriend, he went back to the US and I haven't seen him since, and probably never will. 
I then went back home for the holidays for three weeks, and when I came back, had sex with the guy I was dating, and we made it official. 
But this has been eating at me. I know we weren't official so I didn't technically do anything wrong, and I had no way of knowing that we'd become so serious (we're planning to move in together), but still, I feel like I made a big mistake. I know now that I should have waited for someone who actually loves me, and he never would have judged me for my inexperience. Is telling him important for our relationship? or should I just get over it? if your girlfriend did something like this before you made it official, would you want to know?

165,"-I've worked for the same company for six years now. For the past 2 years I've been able to work from home about 90 % of the year. I live at home and am very close to my family but sometimes it does get distracting. I have been diagnosed with adhd and mild depression and have been managing that with yoga and on and off medications ( My family and friends are unaware of this diagnosis)

I know that my depression and lack of fulfillment in life comes from feeling like I have no purpose, this is smething ive been trying to work on for years now.

I typically work 6-230pm so after work there is this lull time before I run to yoga that I either eat in my car, go on long walks, or run my errands for the week. After yoga each day I come home and do the same thing again.

On paper my job sounds great but the reality is its an office job technically that I do sit majority of the day. I have no interest in the actual work I am doing. I dont see the point of any of it and some days but I realize it is my source of income. I just cant focus and I dont know if thats my adhd or other causes of unfulfillment in life.

I have always been interested in health and the well being of others.

I am contemplating changing careers completely the only thing is Im realizing I do need training in another field since all the jobs I am qualified for would bring me right back to this feeling I have now.

My idea is to apply for a Yoga teacher training in the Fall17 so after work eachday I might be able to plan and focus on yoga and poissibly teaching some days in the future. I have been practicing a year now and really enjoy it. I honestly dont think im ready to teach yoga, but I know myself and I need structure in my life. I need a set plan and im hoping yoga would even help me with my depression and planning meals since thats a major issue in my life as well.

My second idea was to qui my job and begin an LPN program at my local college, or a physical therapy assistant program. I've had this idea on and off for the past three years now. I know I need a job I am fulfilled and feel like I have purpose. I am interested in the health field and do a lot of research on my own regarding health and medicine. I would need to quit my job now if I decide to go that route.

I have been unhappy and looking for guidance, or a sign for many years now. I know the logical thing to do is to keep my current job- I just dont like taking medication and I know that my job is a major trigger for that.

Any advice would be helpful.

169,"I'm 20M and a rising junior at a large State University. 

Looking back before college, I was fairly popular in high school and had many friends, but started out on the wrong foot as a freshman (acted fake ""cool"", which attracted girls but wasn't the real me) and ended up becoming very unconfident until senior year. By senior year I had tunnel vision to college. Overall, my remembrance of high school is pretty negative to be honest, mainly due to my lack of experience with girls.

As college started, I wanted to prove myself. I was always smart, but in high school I didn't try my hardest academically. Anyways, freshman year I ended with a high GPA, and still partied a fair amount, but didn't gain too much experience with women. Virtually none besides a few makeup sessions. Sophomore year I met a girl and we dated for a while, and my grades remained high.

So, now I am a rising junior -- I have a very high GPA studying a highly-regarded business major for my University. I've dated a girl, and have increased my confidence greatly. At this point, it looks like I've done well...

Still though, I have regrets from not being as experimental as a freshman. All my classmates share stories of multiple girls and things that happened, while I barely did anything like it. I spent more time getting a high GPA, but that doesn't seem to matter to me.

185,"Hello, I'm Runic!

I have been doing Youtube for about 6 years now. I started doing youtube after I saw a lets play of Minecraft by SeaNanners.

I have focused on Minecraft for a very long time and uploaded over 1500 videos in total (2 channels). I sort of quit Youtube for about 2-3 months ago.

But I miss it. I miss making videos, but the main reason I quit was because I got bored of Minecraft. I kind of feel that playing and recording Minecraft has damaged my gaming life in a way. I rarely play games now. I don't know what I want to play.

I want to start up my channel again, but my problem is not knowing what I want to record, and a safe way for me to go. I don't want to play one game only and whenever I get bored of that game, I quit again.

It would be easier to record with a group of people. However, I'm not very good at finding people. I've always kind of waited for someone to reach out to me. It looks more fun being in a group.
That being said though, of course I'll record by myself too.

My favorite kind of games are Sandbox, MMORPG, RPG, Adventure games. Here is a list of the games I think I've had the best times playing throughout my life;
- Runescape
- World of Warcraft
- Minecraft
- Cube World (Updates stopped very quickly)
- Overwatch
- Rocket League

Other games I've had fun recording other than minecraft is Garrys Mod, Golf With Your Friends, Rocket League, GTA V.

So basically my question here is this; What games do you think I'd enjoy and at the same time would do decent/good on youtube?

There are some games you really can't get anywhere with on youtube. I highly doubt anyone would become popular (or get a decent amount of views) by playing certain games.

I know the best way of growing on youtube is by playing games that are ""hot"". Games that other big youtubers are playing.",28Jun2017,3

187,"As of late, my dad has been creeping me out. My parents have been going through a rough patch and a lot of other things have changed, but there are a few things that have been happening that have been making me feel really unsafe around my dad. My dad has always been an open person with me and it never made me feel off until recently when my dad started telling me about other women he found attractive that are co-workers and about emails that he gets from women who are trying to get him to cheat on my mom with them. He has exclusively told me to never tell my mother about this, but i don't know why he feels open enough to tell me about it. I'm 14. I'm his daughter. Why is he telling me these things? Even weirder, he tries to get me to tell him very personal things about my own sexual life (like about how i masturbate and if i've ever orgasmed), and it makes me feel very weird and it's always in situations where no one else is around. He also touches me randomly on my waist and lower back, which he never even does with my mom, and he always lingers and it makes me feel this horrible gut wrenching feeling like i want to just run away. I think the final straw was when i caught him watching me while i slept. I was getting ready to go to bed and there he was looking at me all the way down the hallway. When i turned to look, he just sped away. I don't know if some of these things are normal. It feels like i should tell someone but i don't know who. Should i confront him, or tell my mom? I feel like if i told my mom it'd make their marriage problems worse and if i told my dad he would just explode on me. What do i do?

A few months ago after I got out of a relationship, she gave me her opinion that I didn't try hard enough, I probably wouldn't find another relationship, and that her current relationship is perfect. Mind you, three days after a serious breakup, it was hurtful. She apologized but I set ground rules-my dating life won't be a topic of discussion. A few months later, I'm still single. 

Apparently she had dinner with my best friend the other day, and asked if I was dating anyone yet. I am furious and hurt because I feel like she's judging my worth by my relationship status-which is odd, we are 22-and I feel like she's talking about me behind my back.

196,"I got offered a position as an assistant. Mailing payments, doing paperwork, managing quickbooks, doing shopping, etc. I've only ever been a retail or call center worker before, so I'm nervous to accept a position like this without knowing what the training will be like. The email this woman sent me mentions that instructions will be sent via text and email until she's back from travelling.

It seems too good to be true, as well. She's offering me 45$ an hour, and I have no idea if that's a reasonable wage for an assistant. Almost seems like too much to me. I have a pretty strong reaction to high pay like that, thinking that if it's too high it's not a job I'm qualified for with my GED and minimal experience. She's also super flexible with how many hours I work, and I'll likely take part time hours if the pay is that good. I did the math, and working her part time hours would be me more than working a full time minimum wage job. Once again, I'm suspicious at the legitimacy AND my ability to do such a job.

Edit: I would like to mention that the grammar in her emails hasn't been excellent, which is another red flag toward the illigitmacy of the offer. I'll do more research on the company she says she works for, and go from there.

Edit 2: I'm 99% convinced this is a phishing attempt. It's unlike any that I've seen before, which surprised me. I was excited to have a job offer at all, so I didn't even notice until I slowed down to really read the email. I guess that's what they're hoping for.

Now I understand taking criticism from time to time but when it is every single day on every single tiny thing and even situations that I could in no way be responsible I am made responsible and criticized for it.

He also claims that I'm some lazy employee that procrastinates on everything. Yet I put in extra hours from time to time to catch up on things that get backed up, cut my own Aunt's funeral short, and never take vacations because I don't ever want to fall behind. My co-workers don't think I'm lazy so why does my boss?

I don't expect praise, compliments, or pats on the back. I understand a person has to work for them. But I feel like I've been backed into a  corner and I can't do anything right. 

Its to the point my co-workers are even noticing that he treats me far differently than them and have almost said something on multiple occasions. I feel like I'm in a hostile working environment and am getting to the point that it doesn't matter how badly I love this job I want to walk away.

I like to save money and I have around $3.7k saved up now and I have a hs diploma (I also help my parents pay the bills).

I'm also thinking about doing a course for Economics then going to college to pursue a degree in Finance or Accounting.

The problem is that I still suck at driving (exam is in Sept) and I still live with my parents.

I think girls/women see these 2 drawbacks as a major turn off.

And I also have a friend (he's 27) who's obese, didn't finish hs, he also lives with his parents, he isn't even taking driving lessons, barely talks to people and spends his afternoon watching tv or playing video games every single day and yet he actually has a girlfriend.

His cousin showed me a picture of him and his girlfriend, I did my best to stay cool, but deep down I felt jealous and angry.

Since I have moved, my step mom developed stage 4 cancer, dad was in and out of rehabilitation, but has been sober for a year or so. I have had family members die, my anxiety and depression have been barely tolerable, and I have been recently diagnosed with cervicitis, which is polyps around my cervix, and there is a possibility this could be cancerous. If I didn't have enough on my shoulders, I constantly worry about home, how my brother is doing in school, his behavior, my step mom, how is she doing with her chemo, and my dad driving from CA to AZ just to keep the health insurance that pays for the chemo. I love my brother to death and was terrified he wouldn't remember me when I moved, glad I was wrong.

Just an overview. Driving on the Interstate, in the left lane when some guy comes flying up behind me (on my right side), loses control and starts to come into my lane. I hear the screeching of his breaks and try to avoid him hitting me, so I slam on the brakes, and the cut the wheel to the left (because there was a grassy medium). I lose control, hit the medium, and start to roll as I hit the up-slope and get launched in the air into oncoming traffic, finally resting upside down. I came too, am asked if I'm ok, take off my seatbelt, drop to the roof, and shimmy out the window. I was in the middle lane of oncoming traffic. The guy who hit me had pulled over and was in shock I was alive. Witnesses had stop to tell the police that this guy was flying and weaving in and out of traffic and that it was completely his fault. He got a ticket for wreck-less driving and I walked away with my life.

Anyway, I am going to go get an X-Ray and everything today to make sure I don't have any long term damage and do have some residual pain and soreness, but I am far from dead.

Hi,
I'm 17 years old, male. 
So in the beginning of this year I became friends with this girl. We became really really close, we're talking a lot, as well as texting.


Lately I introduced her to my group of friends and she hangs out with us from time to time.
 The thing is that in every time we meet in a social event, she always hugs my friends and pays them a lot of attention, and sort of ignores me. 


That's kind of confuses me, because I know that I have much closer relationship with her than any of my friends, and seeing her ignores me in a party after a whole day of texting with her kinda frustrates me.


I don't know why she acts like that, and I really don't know what to do in this situation. (Am I just jealous?)

I feel like I've lost all motivation for school and bettering myself. I am sorry if I offend anyone in the field of psychology with this post. It is not my intention. It took me five years to get a bachelors degree in psychology and I graduated last year. I got really good grades and was in 3 different research labs- although I logged a lot of hours and helped out as much as I could, I felt like I was kissing ass and that professors and graduate students did not really notice me, or if they did, noticed the mistakes I made and that was it... I also wrote an honors thesis and didn't have the best adviser. She emailed me back in February asking if I wanted to do a poster and publish my results since they were significant, I responded several times telling her 'yes' but never received a response back. I stayed after hours and on weekends to run participants, clean data, do data entry and coding as well as visiting homes for study materials, etc. and worked my ass off. Never screwed around but never really felt like I 'fit in'. I remember asking a grad student and a prof if I could do a poster thru them and they told me no, that I would have to be a secondary author on a poster first. Grad student put me on one of her posters and threatened me telling me ""if I didn't put in enough work she'd take my name off and never let me do a poster."" I had never even done a poster before and it hurt my feelings like she had implied laziness, even though I'd forgo weekends and stay until the evenings for free to work in the lab...I worked on this poster and put in my work...I asked her and the professor again if I could do a poster and they still said no. If I made a fixable mistake (due to stress, not carelessness or laziness like they would tell me) I would get berated for it to no end. Everyone else would be praised and praised and would get into graduate school and would present posters and get publications. I was treated like I was stupid and would be talked to in a condescending voice. I am shy and very soft-spoken and its hard for me to explain things sometimes. I would be very quiet during lab meetings or discussing papers. A couple months after graduating I realized this wasn't for me. Whenever I'd make a mistake or something I would beat myself up for it, ""I'm never going to get a letter of recommendation now. I'll never get into grad school."" I would lose fucking sleep over this. I just feel like I don't fit in. Anywhere. When I started college I wanted to become a psychiatrist, then get a PhD in clinical psych, then psychiatry again. I immersed myself in research and psych-related extracurriculars. I studied and got good grades. I kissed everyones ass and basically was a ball of stress and miserable for 5 years of my life. After graduation I got a job as a behavior technician doing therapy with autistic children. This turned into a 7 day a week job making a meager $450 a week and basically being a human punching bag with very little support, crazy families and absent but rude supervisors who don't help you. I stopped doing research because all I did was work. In the midst of it I lost a lot of passion and interest for the field of psychology and school altogether. My parents are telling me to get another bachelors degree in biology or something else. I feel like college was the worst 5 years of my life because I worked very hard and cut ties and burned bridges with all of my potential references and past colleagues and professors I have worked with. I'm not even interested in the field anymore. I don't trust most therapists (based on my own poor experiences in therapy), as well as most psychiatrists. I don't find research fulfilling or rewarding for me anymore. I used to tutor for intro to biology and my parents have told me to get a second bachelors degree in this and to do research in that field. I am going to be 24 soon- everyone I know is in or has finished graduate school. I feel like I am seriously wasting my time and that getting another bachelors will be a huge waste of time and money. It'll be like repeating my experience again. I really do not know what to do anymore. I don't know what I'm interested in and I feel life passing me by, and I am really ashamed at the same time.

For example, I almost never have anything to say, small talk is my worst fear. Awkward silence makes me freeze. I have no life, no hobbies ect, what am I supposed to bring up? What do people even talk about? 

Anyway, I have a big problem with responses. Say someone is explaining a hard time their going through, I automatically try to relate to it by telling them about something similar in my life.

I don't want to waste my life away and not pursue my goals to my fullest extent. And I've realized that the issue is the people I surround myself with. Although my friends have similar interests to me, they are concerned with making money and having good jobs, which there is nothing wrong with, but that's just not me.

Though I have no trouble talking to and meeting new people, I do have trouble making new friends; especially one with such niche interests and goals.

Any recommendations? ",28Jun2017,1

Basically, was told I would be contacted within a week with details of hours etc but never heard back.

228,"Hi, I am a guy living in Texas. Living with my parents right now. I'll try to sum this up as best as I can.

Things got really stressful from this relationship I was in where she was really abusive to me and I just accepted how she was acting as normal and repressed any reaction to it . This stress along with the stress of breaking up with her took a serious toll on me and this year has been a series of nervous breakdowns.. Drugs tobacco and alcohol were not helpful for me at this point, except for smoking cannabis (all i do now.)

posture is difficult for me and i look kinda empty in my eyes now it freaks me out :/ gonna pursue art and getting better every day

231,"Over the past week my family and I moved a few states over due to my father's work.  I just graduated high school and I'm planning to go to college.  I know I want to major in something computer science related ( either literally computer science or Software engineering /design) but I have no clue to where I will attend college.  I'm thinking of somewhere in California ( we have family there ) right now we are close to the middle of the country. near Wisconsin.  The town I lived in was a decent size ( a population of 100,000) and I didn't mind it there.  
This town is much smaller, only around 22,000 people.  There's nothing wrong with a small town I just don't like being in  a small town.  Another issue I have is the people.  I'm not trying to stereotype but most of them just like to do outdoor activities.   Don't get me wrong but from talking to people my age it seems the only activities here revolve around outdoors  etc.  I love photography , taking pictures of nature but I don't like participating in it that much.  I'm sure if I loved outdoor activities allot I would be very happy here.  My idea of outdoor activities is (was) going to the beach with friends or just messing around town at night.  
I feel I really don't share common interests with people here besides photography.  It makes sense, if you grow up in a place like this your activities would revolve around being outside.  I also don't like how the town is pretty much dead at night. 

 In regards to my career interest I don't think there's much of a market for computer here.  I just get this feeling of there's not much up here at all .  I've been up here before so I had a decent idea, honestly I've been dreading it.  Losing all my friends didn't help matters either , I really miss them.      ",28Jun2017,1

I relate so much to the way Karl has to visualize the pictures to be able to guess how old he was at the time...The number of times I've had to visualize someone saying something or a picture of the incident... As embarrassing as it is to say, even after going over it a million times, I never remember that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. I have to say them both in my head and realize that west to east just auditorily doesn't sound right. I hate that I have to do this all the time. It should be a fact by now. Same thing with remembering Odd highway numbers usually run East to West and Even numbers North to South.. Every time I've encountered the situation, I've had to go back to my little trick I made for myself. I've established a link between East and Even. The letter E. I think: E and E don't go together. So Even, then its the opposite of East. So its North and South. Even is North To South. So then Odd is East to West... I have to think this way EVERYTIME!! What is wrong with me?? Am I just stupid??? Im almost 25 now.. This is so embarrassing.

Edit- Just realized i mixed up the Even and Odd thing...this is what i mean though!! Its so embarrassing! Its never concrete no matter how many times i look it up and try to remember it!",28Jun2017,1

Now here at the airport they tell me that I can not take more than my 2 free bags ( Traveling first class ), and they have no idea why, they also tried calling customer service and they were not helpful at all; so here I am stranded in the aiport with no home ( as I ended my contract and everything else, thinking I was going home today )...Making things worst here at the desk for some reason they refunded all my miles without telling me and now I have no ticket, and nothing at all.

242,"(Sorry for format I'm on my phone) I'm asking this for a family member who is this age and doesn't know what to do and I want to help but have run out of ideas of advice so was wondering if you could give another outside perspective? It's harder because of their ages it seems very intense. This is what she said to me:

""My [F14] friend [F14] is in a relationship [M14] and he is very controlling. Everyone thinks he's really nice but he keeps pressuring her to do sexual things and she has given in a couple of times so she feels trapped as rumours fly at our age. I'm worried because we are so young and this could affect her because she has a past of mental issues. He tells her things like ""if you loved me you would do this"". I don't want to talk to her family behind her back because I'm scared it will make things worse. He's very manipulative so one wrong move from me could ensure that she carries on being controlled.""

What can I do to help my family member out here? Everything I suggested she seemed to rebuttal. As I have been in a controlling relationship before no one helped me at the time and it took me a long time to realise I was even being controlled, however I was a lot older (17/18) which is why I worry a lot about the people at this age. Seems very intense for 14 year olds as I was a very innocent one.",28Jun2017,2
243,"I'm having difficulties planning the best course of action that would leave everyone happy but I seem to be unable to come up with a solution.

I live in a bachelor suite (one bedroom, kitchen, living room, bathroom) with another roommate. We met through a good friend of mine over a year ago and have been roommates since. 

We never made any written contract or form of agreement as we are both pretty lenient when it comes to house rules, guests, cleaning, etc.

This worked up until he's been seeing his girlfriend for the past half a year as she is now permanently living here since she decided to pick up a job near our apartment even though she lives about an hour+ drive away.


Here are the problems:

* I have been home-bound for a few years now, diagnosed with mdd, anxiety, etc... but it is mainly the undiagnosable chronic pain that keeps me from walking normally, standing or even sleeping with any sort of comfort/relief. As someone who is fond of privacy, it has essentially been cut in half with zero upsides.

* My roommate gave/gives her his pair of keys while he goes to work so that she can come in and out of the apartment (didn't tell me). What bothers me the most is that I am obsessive about the way I clean in the kitchen, I do not care much about an extra couple hundred dollars for rent, her possessions (make-up bag, body sponge, etc) managed to slip into the bathroom without even confirming with me. It's like, ""hey I live here now!"".

* Did I mention that we live in a bachelor suite? Two people were manageable for 450 sq. feet. Three seems overwhelming.

* Sex noises. Oh dear lord this is a huge problem. I thought the honeymoon phase was suppose to last a couple months. Nope, it's almost every god damn day or night (6+ months). And I just don't understand why she moans loud enough for me to hear through the wall (do women do this on purpose? Is it that difficult to suppress moans?). It's ridiculously frustrating when it happens at 5-6am before my roommate leaves for work. The funny/irritating thing is when I turn on some music, she gets louder. Like how does that make any sense? Wouldn't she want to be quiet so her boyfriend's roommate doesn't hear?

* She's here very often, and my roommate isn't. A typical schedule when he's working = he leaves anywhere from 5am-10am and comes back anywhere from 5pm-10pm. She's typically in and out of the bedroom (I gave my roommate the bedroom when he moved in) quite a few times in the morning to use the kitchen-- which wakes me up and bothers the shit out of me because I'm in light-sleep mode while dealing with chronic pains that prevent me from sleeping/resting remotely adequately. She may or may not leave sometime before 3pm and usually comes back before my roommate does.

* But then, I am also not the greatest roommate either. My flaws = I am not working. I often have a few dishes sitting out for a few days before I get to them. There's been a few times that I have let alcoholism get the better of me and have drank some of my roommates liquor in the past (nothing crazy, just captain morgans-- which I have replaced, but I still didn't ask right away). Though I am the only one who cleans the bathroom, fridge and counter-tops.

* TL;DR we have gone with the flow and made things work out by evening out our tasks/flaws... but now I am getting stressed with her presence here as it is contributing to the exacerbation of my chronic pain. 


I don't dislike her as a person, but I definitely do feel like she's leeching off of my kindness and understanding. She has bought toilet paper/paper towels once... but she's not the type of person to charm someone she's getting favours from.",28Jun2017,3

 The problem is that when I leave, my mom will be the only one home to take care of my dog. But my mom has a disease that makes her VERY vulnerable to the cold, and we live in a city that starts snowing and is consistently under 10 degrees (C) even by September. This means that she will have trouble walking the dog for even longer than 5 minutes daily. Taking care of the dog when I'm not home is very draining for her so she is insisting that we just give him away.

248,"Warning long post, Maybe this is because I'm coming of age almost 23 but sometimes I have this looming feeling that one day I'm going to be an old man and wish I enjoyed my life more.

I have a 3 day weekend every weekend.  But I have a constant feeling of dissatisfaction eating at me that I'm not using this time to get the max enjoyment I could.  I Really enjoy what I do in my freetime but it's like this feeling that I might be having slightly more fun doing X activity instead right now.  The grass is always greener I suppose.

And just to head this off no I don't mean I wish I was doing something productive, 

But right now I have so many things going through my head to do I eventually give up and just browse reddit/youtube for hours on end.  Which I guess is a hobby but I don't think it's very satisfying.

These are my Main Hobbys

1. Fishing
2. Watching Anime
3. Playing Video games
4. Reading Manga

Fishing I pretty much have it down, watching Anime I think because there is so many different shows out there I'm in a constant state of this is good but what else is out there.  I also tend to rewatch ""Berserk"" over and over which seems like a waste of time It's great but I've already experienced it.  

As far as Games go I have almost 300 games on steam, have been playing games since the n64 but in general I play a game until close to the end and go man I don't want to finish this it's too fun, so then I just drop it which really makes no sense.  I'm considering going back and replaying some games I got close on but never finished (psychonauts comes to mind) but then I think you've pretty much beat it may as well start something new.  

I'm doing a little better on Video games I recently completed KOTOR and started KOTOR 2.  However I started the witcher 3 and just was not engaged.

But like a squirrel I catch a little peice of something and try to move on, for example someone mentioned the sims lately and it makes me want to jump in and replay the sims 3 that I had a lot of enjoyment in.  However I have already experienced it, same with most pokemon games but in my head I have the conflict to replay/rewatch things that I know are good when really I should just move on to new experiences.

Manga I don't really jump around in so bad, I actually am only reading berserk.

I'm honestly considering making myself a schedule or at least a guideline of do this for x amount of hours or something like that.

The thing is that this is one my biggest insecurity. I'm legit afraid of someone telling me to 'write this down' or how to you spell this? ect. Keep in mind that my skills aren't the worst but in no way they are the best. I feel like if I ever decide to go to college or take a job that requires to be good at those skills then frankly I will probably do a shitty job. Nobody wants to do a shitty job or feel useless Because you can't do it right. It f***s you up if it keeps happening. Sad isn't it? So I feel like if I do improve in those area then it would have a major impact in my life. I have always struggle in school and sadly I never got the help I needed nor did I  ask for it. I was most likely to embarrassed to ask.So The older I got the more I kick myself for never asking, but hey i cant be moping at the past, right? so that's why I came here.

Fast forward to the end of May. She and I are still a thing and I honestly thought we were about to get back together. WRONG.

I generally work at a house or once a week if needed. The aforementioned family initially hired me to clear off a steep hill that was overgrown on their property and they made it seem like that was all that I was going to do for them. The lady who hired me (let's call her Cindy), said that she would pay me $10 an hour (more than I make at other places) After clearing off said hill (took about six hours as it was dry overgrown and hard to clear off as it was very steep) Cindy said that they would see me at the same time the next morning (9AM because it gets hot fast here...) with more work. So I go and do more work which takes about four hours. They said to be back on Monday (as it was Friday) and be ready for more work. 

This was two weeks ago and it has been the same cycle. They want me there so much that I'm falling behind on the other places I work for. What do I do?

The problem is that I go to Purdue, which is focused on churning out STEM majors, especially Engineers, so your right-brained artist is a rarity, to say the least. There are art and drawing clubs out there, but my own art skill is crap, and I'm more interested in talking to artists than becoming one, so I've been apprehensive about that.

There's also the problem that a large portion of the female artists I have met that interest me are LGBTQ, which is fine, but clearly not in my favor in the dating department.

I know the general advice for dating, getting out there and being social, joining clubs, attending parties, improving social skills and such, but I was wondering if there was any specific advice that could help me find the type of girl I'm looking for.",28Jun2017,1

273,"(Disclaimer: English is not my first language)

I got a letter today from the posting office telling me there is a package there waiting for collection, and as stated on the title, i didn't order anything and am not expecting anything. Problems are:

* The package has my address and my name on it, so it seems really unlikely that it was sent by mistake
* I live in Brazil, and when checking online, the package was mailed from the Netherlands (and i don't even know anyone in Europe, let alone someone that has my name and address)
* Normally i would get it just to see what it is, but there is a R$200 fee (~60USD) in taxes. 

So now i'm left here wondering what the hell is going on. Any chance this is some kind of scam? It all seems so random. I'm not gonna pay if i don't even know what it is, obviously. And the worst part is that it has my full name and my current address on it. 

Does Reddit have any advice for me?",28Jun2017,2

277,"Hello guys from Reddit!
I just moved in Madrid (Spain) for a new job and I got myself a room in a flat I share with other people.
Problem is, the room has no window.
During the visit and the first weeks, I could deal with it but now it's starting to be annoying. I used to live in a student residence with windows open all day, fresh air and light. Now, I have to leave my door half open to have a bit of air, but if I close it (because I want to sleep or just be alone), quickly I feel like there's not enough oxygen in the air, like I'm suffocating. I got a bit of light by a transparent block between me and the next room (20cm x 20cm) but no air from there.

I've read that in Spain, the owner of the flat (here it's an agency) must make sure that there's a flow of fresh air in a dormitorio without window by drilling holes in the walls.
What should I do? I don't want to waste my time arguing with the agency. Do you think a fan would be enough?",28Jun2017,2
279,"Let me start with this: I have never really looked up to my dad except for in his honesty with other people and I used to think he never lied.  In the past year or two I have become more conscious to little white lies he'll tell or little things he'll accuse me of.  I am not a sensitive person whatsoever and I can be kind of sarcastic sometimes, which can be a problem to him obviously.  I'm a female, straight-A student, I don't have any siblings, I don't do anything too questionable (guilty conscious) and I'll be leaving for college in 2 months, if this info means anything.


Okay, now I'll give a scenario of what happened today to show an example of all his yelling.


He can be fine one second and the littlest thing can set him off. Basically, he always thinks I'm lazy and tells me it.  I admit I can be kind of lazy and can procrastinate sometimes, but lately I have been getting things done in prep for college (esp on the computer) and I have been sending applications in for a job. Today, I made a bunch of food (healthy, btw, because I'm on a diet) and I left 2 bowls in the sink, when I should have put it in the dishwasher.  I almost never put things in the dishwasher bc my parents tend to do it for me (I've been changing this lately tho).  I was actually going to put it in the dishwasher but I put it in the sink so that I could eat and not wait for my food to get cold, then I'd put it in later.  The first problem is that he addresses things indirectly.  He'll say ""so who didn't put this in the dishwasher"", when I'm literally the only other one in the house at the time (I find this rude tbh).  Then he starts screaming at me and he'll ask me questions in this scream, but when I try to answer he'll yell over me and he won't let me answer him.  I am always very calm when he tries yelling at me and I think this makes him even more mad and he starts attacking me for things.  The top of the stove was dirty and he blamed me for it even though it wasn't dirty (even my mom said it wasn't and she's a neat freak).  He then started saying that ""my dorm is going to be a mess and my roommates won't like me because of it"".  After this, he accuses me of putting dirty dishes into the dishwasher in the past (even tho I never used to put things in the dishwasher so this is obviously false).


I also can't recall the last time he said that he loved me in the past 5 years or so.  He never says it and sometimes he definitely doesn't show it.  


I even remember this event that occurred about 6 years ago, when I was in 7th grade.  I hadn't gotten along with a friend anymore (her mom was also a snake) and my parents didn't like her or her mom (reasonably so, though).  She accused me of saying something about her horse trainer, which I hadn't, but I had known that I had said other things about her. I took it upon myself to call her and apologize and clear the air because I was trying to be mature.  Both of my parents were not happy (there was probably a reason but I didn't really see a problem at the time).  All I remember from this situation is that my dad said ""this is why you lose all of your friends every time you make one"".  I think this has made me overall pretty insecure about my personality.


He also always has a problem with my music taste.  I listen to rap/hip-hop primarily and he HATES it, and he'll always make comments and degrade it.  He will get really angry when I try to defend it and yell at me for it.  He says I'll regret it when I'm older but I don't understand why he can't let me live.


He'll always come into my room wanting to talk and stand at the door trying to make pointless conversation with me.  If I don't give him a ""good enough"" answer or don't answer him back sufficiently he'll yell at me.  If I tell him that I don't want to talk he'll yell at me for that, too.


My mom says that this behavior is just due to him getting old and ""becoming crotchety"" about the world (he's only like 50-something).  I know he was abused as a kid by his alcoholic mother when he was younger (she used to yell and hit him and his sisters with a belt when she was drunk), and my mom just tells me to ignore it and not to fight with him, even when I try to stand up for myself.


I normally wouldn't be concerned about this but lately it has gotten worse.  He used to coach my softball team and yell at me for dumb things, too, but it was never this bad.  I can't think of a single day where he didn't go off on me about something.  Like I said, I'm not sensitive at all but he always makes me feel like I'm dumb or useless and I think there's something wrong with that.  What can I or should I do?  I really think he needs anger management but I don't think he'd ever do that.  I don't want to end up like this when I'm older, either.

287,"It's *really* annoying seeing her changing the entire house just because her Feng sui books tells what should go into some room, she's now into Family Constellations: a support therapy on biodecodification, she believes that pharmas are just a business and they don't care about health (she even believes that they want us to be chronic patients). I can't have a real conversation with her because her argumentation is based in a conspiracy she cannot prove and anecdotes. 

Last thing was that looks like there's some magic plant (Kalanchoe) that can cure cancer (yes, in general, not some specific kind of cancer, just cancer) and I think this is going too far. I can even think in the day that she'd deny some medical treatment based in real science just because she believes it's poison and I couldn't do anything about it. 

She probably would just accept reiki, [Hamer's ""medicine""](http://assets.krebsliga.ch/downloads/01_02_hamer_e_neu.pdf) and who knows what's next.

She has few friends and family members (one of my aunts, two of my cousins (from another aunt)) who also believe these things and one of them is a charlatan who lives as a biodecodification therapist. 

The only thing I see it can help is showing her wrong one by one on all her pseudoscientific believes. But I can't prove things like how pharmas work, for example. Any idea? Are you or have you lived a similar situation?
