2,"So I’ve (24M) been having pretty major relationship problems with my girlfriend (21F) of 4 years. We currently live together and have an 11 month old daughter but we are just always on each other’s nerves and I feel like anything i say or do is wrong.  This has been going on for a while and even before our daughter came along. Trying to keep this short without going into too much detail, after reading on Reddit I’m probably in a bit of an emotionally abusive relationship.

I’m Personally a very non-confrontational person and tend to joke about things to avoid confrontation/feelings with people I know, even family and friends.  

For the past week I’ve actually lost my appetite for any food and can’t stop thinking about everything. It’s pretty much driving me crazy and I’m not sure what to do with myself.  I have no one to talk to and I don’t know what to do about it.  Usually I’m well put together but I’ve never felt helpless like this before. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated !",29Nov2017,3
3,"So far I just had one orientation/training day. This was supposed to be a quick month of work to have a little money before going back to college.

The problem is that the job requires me to shop for a whole new ""professional"" wardrobe to work there. This job is paying very little an hour, so I feel like I will be getting this job to spend most of the money I'll make, on buying clothes that I will probably not use again after I leave. 

Would it be a good idea to leave? I also felt like I didn't fit in too well with the department. 

What would be a good way to leave this job? I feel horrible about all the work hr did for me, and the fact that I pushed to get noticed by the managers. I feel like a big dumb idiot for not realizing the dress requirements as well. ",29Nov2017,3
4,"I think theres something wrong with me. Somewhere when I developed as teen, I didn't do what most guys did. I didn't chase girls, ask them out, flirt etc.

In fact, I have never once in my life expressed interest in a girl (aside from in my own head - I've had crushes)

I seem to have this mental block - I find the idea of anyone knowing I like them to be extremely embarrassing. 

I like this girl at uni, I know people will tell me to just ask her out. But I won't do it. I know I won't do it. I will think about/fantasise but i know deep down that I would not do it.

So ofc I've never been in a relationship. 

I just think maybe there's something a bit wrong with me?

I think it's got something to do with my parents. For example, I still - at nearly 20 years old - would find it so embarrassing to tell my parents I like girls. I have never mentioned anything about girls to them.

I'm not sure its related, but I'm embarrassed about my parents knowing so much about me. Its almost like I still want them to see me as a kid. I have quite alternative music taste, but I haven't told them, because I find it embarrassing that they know I listen to music (yeah, i know)

I always from a young age was uncomfortable with the idea of growing up (I cried when I turned 7 because I wanted to be a child forever). Its almost like I don't want people to know I have adult thoughts, like maybe I still want to be a kid : /

I was a late developer definitely, but im nearly 20 now. I love my parents so much, but I feel there is a part of me they don't know, and might never see

7,"I am recently married to my gf of 6 years. I'm 28 M, shes 28 F. I have never been inside my in-laws house, and the one time I came to their door and looked in caused them to refuse to speak to me for 2 years. We have since started talking again, and had a great family wedding and do holidays... at our house. But I've never been invited over to their house. I mean, even if it is messy, who cares? I'm part of the family now, and I know their condition, and I'm not going anywhere honestly. I take it very personal, but I realize this is unheathly for myself. I've wanted to talk to them about it, and reassure them, but honestly from all the things I've read about hoarders this seems to be a bad idea. How can I have a relationship with these people if I only see half of their existence? To add more insult, my wife's sister lives with them and my wife is allowed into the house.

I don't even know if it's worth my time to help them. My main issue is that around the holidays I just feel very vindictive towards them, and while they are always invited into our house for dinner and holidays I feel like any slip up they make can make me go ballistic on them. It hasn't happened yet, but I can feel it. My wife understands how I feel, but there is little she can do to help. From all I've read, this hoarding seems to be something that never leaves you.

8,"I've had a crush on my best friend for a few years now but I never thought anything would come of it bc I assumed he was straight and I was fine with that. But a couple months back we were super fucked up and ended up making out.
So this would be really fucking awesome if i was out or something but bc life is shit I got stuck with a crazy religious mom who's already looking for a reason to kick me out.

Plus most of my friends are total dicks about shit like that.
Basically though, my dumb ass has started hooking up with him really regularly. Like last fucking night he stayed at my house (my family don't give a fuck if he stays over  cause they assume he sleeps on the floor) and it's not even like we're just fucking around or something like I actually really like him. He's fucking adorable and hes honestly really cool and I'm so fucking into him but I'm not sure what I should do bc my brother almost caught us a couple days ago and I really don't want to fuck up my life more than I already have.

I answered him by telling him that I can't really remember a specific time when I thought he was self centered. I asked him why he asked me that and he told me that he talked to his psychiatrist today and he told him that while he's not a narcissist he has the traits of one. We didn't really talk very much after that but I don't want him to think I'm being apathetic because really I've never dealt with something like this before and I don't really no what to say. I also asked him if he knew why his psychiatrist would say that to him. He said he thinks he knows but it's complicated (I think he knows but he might not want to tell me which is ok). I'm just really worried about him because I know he already has to deal with OCD and depression and I can't imagine this narcissism thing is going to make it any better. I just want him to be ok and my mind is playing the worst outcomes for him in my head. I just want to know some ways I can help him.

18,"I’m currently in my senior year of high school, which means next year I’ll be going to college. Since sophomore year, my dad has had the plan for me to get my general credits done at a community college for two years and then transfer to a four year university to finish my Bachelors degree, because it’s so much cheaper than just a four year school. He also said he’d refurbish my room and buy me a new car if I commuted every day (which he won’t, because he really doesn’t have that kind of money to throw at me). Back then when I had no clue what I’d even go to college for, I was okay with this plan. But now, I know exactly what I wanna do and have such a passion for it that I want 4 full years of it.
A couple of weeks ago, I toured the 4 year college that my dad and a lot of my other relatives went to, which is relatively cheap compared to every other university in my state. I immediately fell in love with the thought of going there and got accepted last week. I also feel like I should learn to live on my own sooner rather than later. Because of my GPA and declared STEM major, I can get $6,000 in scholarships from the school each year, and I’ve been applying to so many other scholarships over the year. The total cost is about $23,000 each year, with about $11,000 of that being room and board. Community college is about $12,000 per year if I were to commute half an hour every day. 
This is what I need advice on: community college or university? Either way, I’m going to need to take out student loans. Are they really THAT bad? I literally have no idea what to do, and every time I bring up this university to my dad, he brings up the community college. Please give me advice!

23,"Hello everyone and thank you so much in advance for any help you may be able to give me. I apologize for the length of this post:

I'm the second eldest in a family of four children. I just moved back to my home state of Pennsylvania and my fiancee and I are temporarily living with my parents while we look for our own house closer to work. Also living with my parents are my sister (17) and my brother (21). My family is blended, my brother is my mom's biological son and my sister is our step sister. With that out of the way, here's what's been going on:

My brother has grown from a seriously troubled youth to an abusive adult in my absence. My mom has enabled and made excuses for his horrid behavior his entire life. When he was young, he would hit us with his toys, throw things at us, steal money from neighbors, you name it. When he would hit me I wasn't allowed to hit back, when he would month off to someone it was always the other person ""picking on him"", etc. Even when we caught him taking perscription pills my mom disregaurded ALL evidence even though multiple people told her about it. Now, he's a young dad with a 2 year old and his moods have escalated horribly. Just today my dad was confronting him about not doing his chores around the house (feeding our barn animals outside) and it evolved into a shoving match where he tried to antagonise my dad into hitting him so he had an excuse to hit back. My father is a fairly ill man who has had 7 surgeries in the past 5 years to correct some abdominal abnormalities and currently has two bloodclots in his lungs that could dislodge at any time. My dad told him to get out and my brother threw some explatives at him. My dad passed out quickly after that from over exerting himself, cracked his head off our tile floor, and laid there for 20 minutes until my sister got home off the bus. She had passed my brother coming out of the driveway so we all know that he knew my dad passed out and did nothing to help. My mother was at work and when I told her about the whole thing she was trying to say things like ""HE TAKES CARE OF THE ANIMALS EVERY DAY"" (I've been here for a month and he's done it twice) ""YOUR SISTER NEVER DOES ANYTHING"" (she does, but that's not even the point of the conversation??) And my personal favorite, ""WELL YOUR DAD PROBABLY PUSHED HIM TO HIS LIMIT"" (he is always nice to him but still has to be a dad when my brother refuses to do anything and is getting free room and board for him and his baby?)

No one in my family can take the enabling anymore. It's going to ruin my parents marriage or my dad is going to hurt himself from the stress. Not to mention my brother isn't getting any consistency in his parenting because my mom will NEVER go against him and it's hurting both of their relationships with everyone in the house. She will even back him up when he gets fired from jobs and say crap like ""his bosses discriminate!"" (he's a straight white male working in PA suburbs? Wtf?)

Anyyyyyyyyyyy advice is so appreciated. We're all at the end of our ropes here. We've tried talking to both of them and my mom is so blindly defensive of him that it's impossible to talk to her about it.",29Nov2017,3

30,"I've had a best friend in my life since grade 7 (I am now 21).  However, I recently went through the hardest thing in my life 10 months ago, witnessing my father die. 

Basically my fathers death was unexpected, I flew to see him in the hospital on a Friday and by Sunday he died. My friend and I had a short Vegas vacation previously planned for that coming Thursday. Of course after seeing that happen I was not in the mood to go partying in Vegas 4 days after. Is this unreasonable? To her it was. She immediately spent hours trying to convince me to still go and said things that I consider quite insensitive like ""Why do you want to just stay at home and be depressed when you can go party""  and ""I hope you realize that you are in school to be a nurse, you're going to see people die all the time and you'll need to learn how to deal with it"" These are exact quotes of what she said to me minutes after i witnessed my father die. Am i being oversensitive that this is a completely uncalled thing to say to someone? It is my father, not some random person and even if it was i would still be in complete shock and pain. Keep in mind that by canceling the trip I made sure she got a 100% refund and I covered all fees. 

3 days after she simply texted me asking to buy her something from my work so she could get a discount. No ""how are you doing"" or anything. Infact she got mad at me because I was unable to go into work for 1 month after this. To this day she still has never asked me how I've been doing.

Maybe it is a awkward subject for her to bring up. Understandable. But we are very close friends and have known each other for years... I just expected a lot more support from someone I considered my best friend. What do you think? Maybe I am being oversensitive.

31,"So me and my ex boyfriend (relationship lasted 2.5 years, ended for various reasons shortly after I went to study abroad about 4 years ago) have been having phone sex. Like a lot of it for the last 4 years. I would say about twice a month on average and 3-4hours each time, super intense. This year we started talking more and more frequently, more like once or twice a week. And then in Sept-Early November it was more of 3-4 times a week. 
Now i've always been in love with him and although it was phone sex, we had still had regular conversations before it came to that per phone call/facetime. So I naturally felt such a bond with him because I don't have these kind of convos with any other person. It became a regular thing for us.
Soooo, 2 weeks ago he called me 28 times over a period of 48 hours. I obviously couldn't pick up all of those cuz, you know, a girls gotta shower sometimes.
And when we connected on a Tuesday, we had like a super intense facetime and it was amazing as always. Saturday comes along and I see on his cousins Snapchat that they are at some indian event. Then I see him dancing in the middle of the circle with some breezy.
Then the next snaps showed him thanking everyone who came and that it meant a lot for the both of them (him and that girl).
I literally threw up. And I was like ""wait what- didnt we just talk like 4 days ago"".
So this guy who ive been in love with for almost 7 years, talked to for over 1000hours with, NEVER mentioned ONCE that he was seeing someone let alone getting engaged (getting married next year). I was so shocked. So crushed. Like, shouldn't that have been common courtesy to let me know after all this time?!
Then I finally got him to call me back the next week, and he just kept saying that he was sorry and that he didnt know why he didnt tell me. And i'm just sitting there crying like an idiot. We've spoken 3 other times since. 

See at this point, I know the conversations are going to stop. I'm pretttty suuuure he's not going to be on the phone with me while sleeping next to his fiance (even though somehow he's been doing that kind of thing for 4 years). So pretty much we are over. Last night we spoke for over 3 hours, and I was telling him how much this hurts ect. ect. and I told him that basically it's as if he died, because this is going to end and he'll disappear from my life. Then I was like ""fuck this, why should I be the one hurt? Why do you have no consequences your actions."" I told him that I felt that I should hurt him back because at this point there's no consequences for me--I've already lost him, we're done. Petty af but fuck it.
Now the question is:
Do I tell his fiance what has been going on for the last several years? (supposedly they've been going out for the last 3ish years)
I feel like I should because:
1) girl is gonna marry this guy who's shady af
2) he shouldn't have hurt me and get off scot-free cuz fuck that. 
3) I really believed that we were in a semi-relationship this whole time, and I feel like she should know that he was stringing me along next to her.

You see how in the bible there is god and the devil, and every meaning comes from there feud giving not necessarily a clear meaning to why life exists but to why life is somewhat of a struggle (and even with that im oversimplifying it immensly). or in a movie you have a point to it, some sort of plot. basically, i been having a hard time finding a GOOD enough reason for me to feel genuinely right about doing anything and that encompasses living life and thats doing something. im not depressed, but more like exhausted at trying to ""find"" my purpose for being alive. its not the finding part thats the problem as lebron james became a basketball player and bill gates a billionaire...i beleive that anybody can buckle down and achieve the great thing they create in their minds becasue i beleive we all have limitless potential. but what is the point of that limitless potential? i would like to believe that the point is to win some grand epic timeless battle against some sort of foe, and there have been many of foes over time to pick from ""The devil, ourselves, machines, men, women, animals, nature, society etc..."" but its all too confusing. personally i feel like there is a good and evil and obviously MANY others agree and there is a consensus that general good and evil, or even more basicly positive and negative forces exist. i just feel like if i were in the bible i could direct my life to be more true and satisfactory and fulfilling given the choice to either commit to god or to the devil. to be in the midst of that and going through all the floods and and plagues and demons and joys and blessing would be worth while, to me. but what if life is just to be lived because it can be and thats it and there is really no reason other than what you convince yourself is the reason that matters most to you... in that case, i felt ive lived a pretty good life and i doubt it will get any better or worse than what i have already and am currently experiencing. its just all becoming a chore becasue i dont have any thing to look forward to in life. maybe if tomorrow i woke up and had the ability to manipulate water or fire with my mind maybe that would be something new enough for me to care. not that i dont care, but i just feel like people have been doing the smae things forever but since we dont live forever nobody remember we been through all of this already. its just getting old for me its not exciting, and everything is just starting to look and feel the same.",29Nov2017,2

Money is tight and I felt bad for saying no all the time to his invites. How can I reach out to him (still have his #) and let him know, or imply, that money is an issue with me. I'm not broke down poor, just need to pay bills and I need the left over money to help out with stuff in the house.

41,"Hi r/advice , im in a bit of a 1/8 life crisis. In about 6 months I will be departing for college and I don't know which college to choose. I have been accepted to both but college #1 is offering me a full four year ride. College #2 is offering me some scholarships but nothing close to a full ride. I really like the area college #1 is in, but it comes with the downside that its a little bit lesser of an education. College #2 is a better education than college #1 but is in the most uncomfortable environment for me. I also currently have around 30k in an education investment fund. If I went to college #1 I could use that 30K for a down payment on an apartment, If I went to college #2 I would be using that money for my education. In your opinion what should I do?

42,"Chalk and cheese, could absolutely use help! Usually I can overlook the odd flaw, as this man has no serious faults (most people would find him most agreeable, which he is, and I used to like him) however over the years he has been increasingly disapproving of me (not aggressive, I must point out).  I suffer from severe anxiety, which he seems to have no patience/understanding for, I am bisexual (I've heard him insult male-male marriages several times which I am ashamed to have not confronted him with, again, anxiety), his son (My partner, I'm female BTW) is more of a feminist than I am, bless him, but his father makes every point to exclude me from any manual labor I volunteer to help them with although I've beaten them both at an arm wrestles consistently. 
I realize this all may seem like trivial fluff, but we've recently been forced to live with my partners family, what was tolerable before is a constant barrage of passive aggressive behavior.

Now Fatty's started her daily drama again. Why? Who knows?

It seems she does not want to actually follow rules on the lease she signed on and nor does she care.

She had already picked like 2 fights before and I'm sick of her shit. I've literally said zero things to her. I wonder why someone would act like this unprovoked? Something wrong with her perhaps? You cant really deal with crazy, can you?

Edit:

It's smack dab in the middle of finals week and she thinks it's suitable to have loud slumber parties like she's 13. I don't even know how to reason with someone like this. I played her game, like she said, that I ""had to come out and tell her that she was loud or else she wont stop being so"" (even though she does this on purpose, we already had a conversation about this before). I did that. It was okay for like 5 minutes, then they just mocked me and kept going. What is this stupidity. Crazy idiot. Not even her friends stop her.

45,"I know, I know. I’m a big dummy. Let me explain.
So I’ve been crushing on this guy who’s ten years older than me for a couple weeks now. Nothing serious, we went out once and hit it off. We hung out on Sunday at his house and we ended up having sex... twice. Unprotected.

I immediately regretted it after. I’m on camrese birth control, I only get my period four times a year. It is extremely reliable birth control and I take it religiously, so I’m not ~extremely~ worried about being pregnant. He never finished inside of me, though I think once he finished and went back inside of me, so I’m worried some semen did end up in me. 

I’m moreso worried about stds. He used to be really heavy into drugs. He isn’t anymore, but he used to be. And I guess I’m worried that he caught something that way? I asked him if he was clean, and he said as far as he knew, he had no issues or diseases and that his sex life “isn’t that exciting.”

I know I made a mistake and I feel like shit over it, 1. Because I know I had unprotected sex with someone I’m not too familiar with and 2. Because now I feel like he’s being incredibly distant and hasn’t really talked to me.

I made an appointment for planned parenthood for std screening, but in the mean time, how do I ease my mind? I have severe anxiety and when I’m not busy, I let my mind wander and things like this eat me away until it’s 3am and I’m sobbing, thinking of every worst possible outcome.

Apparently when you get a ticket (in the state where she attends school at least), you can go to court and ask the judge if you can serve jail time in lieu of paying the ticket. This is what my daughter intends to do.

I offered to loan her the money, but she declined. She says taking care of this ticket is her responsibility and that she'll only be in for a few days. 

While I admire her desire to stand on her own two feet and handle this herself, I can't help but worry. Her court date isn't for another couple weeks, so she'll be done with finals by the time she reports to jail. She's also assured me this won't pose a problem with future employment.

70,"I am not sure how I should go about in doing this, I guess I should start with the beginning... My Highschool career was that of just screwing around and being a mediocre student with C's, D's and sometimes B's.  I graduated but I was the meh student that could do better if they tried but I never did because I found school boring like the rest of us, I wish many times that I could go back and fix what I did.  I did, however, have a few classes I excelled at like Electronics, Automotive, C++ programming, Visual Basic, and Weightlifting.  I really had lots of fun doing C++ and Electronics class.

My college career was a joke, lots of W's and F's, I have 3 credited hours to my name... I would beat the hell out of myself about it but I can't change what I did, I spent my time playing Everquest (aka Evercrack) when it first came out.  Again I would love to kick the shit out of me but it won't do anything now.  So I ended up doing service jobs for a good long while, then I had a good long talk with my mother and she suggested that I get into computers and I did, I got my A+ and started working as a computer repair person and doing custom builds for a living.  All was great and fun but I had more fun doing component level stuff like resoldering Nvidia chips back onto laptop mainboards, pulling out busted USB's and putting new ones in things like that.

I finally start to get on with my life and I was about to move out and I was hit with a whammy, my mom told me she had breast cancer... Now keep in mind the closest family we have is about 8 hours away driving (if the roads are clear) and they don't make that much money to where they can just drop everything and help out.  So I stayed home and took care of her, grocery shopping, taking her to appointments and surgeries.  I basically lost track of time and before you know it she hit her 5-year milestone beating her cancer!  

Time goes on and I move on from doing computer repair and custom builds to working as a contractor in the VA, DC, MD area doing deployments for Government agencies over the course of 5 years and getting complacent, I end up working for another Government agency for a good 3 years before I am given an option to by my mom to move down the SC and be closer to family.  I figure a fresh start would be a great idea and I would love to actually not drive 8 hours down then 15 hours back.

The day of the move comes and we are tired but we are in the new house and I am looking for a new job because the one I thought I would get fell through, I spend a good 3 months jobless which is not bad in my opinion.  So I start my new job at a local community college but only part-time, I end up getting a second part-time job to keep up with my bills, I am working M-F 8am-12pm and Tue-F 2pm-7pm sometimes Sat and Sun.  One day I was called to make sure the projector system is working for a presentation that was going to happen in the building I was in charge of and I run into the A/V Tech that also got the same ticket.  We make sure all is well and leave, while in the lobby of the building he starts to talk to me about what I want to do in life, we talk about things he tells me his story and it gets me thinking... What do I want to do???  I can't figure an answer out but I keep it in mind.  One day I remember high school and the C++ class and electronics class,  I find it strange that I remember that but keep on going with my life.  I get a ticket to install some software on a teachers laptop and he starts talking about Arduino with me, I have no idea what that is so I brush it off.  A few weeks later I get the urge to look up Arduino and I instantly love what I see!!  Electronics and programming all in one!  I am highly interested and start talking about it as I read about it, out of nowhere it hits me I want to get a degree in Electrical Engineering!  I would love to talk to someone who is in my same position but has started or someone who has been in my position, I could really use some advice in getting started with this but I have no idea how.  I don't have the money, my family doesn't have the money, I could ask my mom but I really hate to ask and with my previous track record, it would be easier to pull out my own teeth then to convince her to loan me.  I have in the past before I moved to SC apply for Pell Grants and always got denied, maybe now that I don't make as much I might get it?  How does one work two jobs and go to school?  I don't think something like Electrical Engineering could be done online.

It's like everybody on the planet took the ""dating, romance, and intimacy"" class, and I completely missed it somehow. I don't understand how to express affection at all, I never learned how. Physical contact and intimacy actually scare me, and I just freeze up if I somehow end up in a situation that's even remotely romantic or intimate.

78,"Hello,

I am a senior in high school and the past couple of months have been absolute shit.  I blame no one but myself. 

I have struggled with depression since I was 10 years old, but I had it under control for a while now until I ran out of my medication recently.  That's when problems started to arise.  I am stupid and didn't know that you can't suddenly stop taking medication cold turkey, my depression came back full force and I missed 2 weeks of school.  I know that depression influenced my decision, but it was ultimately me that chose not to go to school.  And I accept responsibility. 

I went back to my doctor and he readjusted my medication, but I have had no success.  I am part of the most rigorous program (International Baccalaureate LUL biggest regret) offered at my school, and I missed tons of content.  I haven't gone to school the past 5 days, and part of it is because I don't want to face my teachers.  They are incredibly amazing but I am letting them down.  I also don't want to see all of my smart friends that are in the program, because it would be embarassing.  I let everyone down.  

So tonight I decided to drop the program that I am in.  I missed too much content and I am not healthy enough.  I am going to have a reduced schedule which means that my 0 and 6 hour will be cut from my schedule.  I will also have the option to drop to easier courses.  That's the thing, if I can barely make it through high school how am I supposed to make it in a university or the real world?  I was accepted to my state university and I was planning to go there because they have a great pre medical program.  However, I am gravely worried about my future and health.  The pre medical track is incredibly stressful and I am not sure that I would be able to handle it **next year**.

That's why I am wondering if it would be best to take a gap year or go to a community college my first year of school.  I contacted the university and they told me that I can defer my admission for a year.  But then I would be going to school late and I feel like my extended family members will be judgemental about my ""alternative"" path.  Should I even attend a university?  

I know that the following will sound cliché...but I really am bright.  I had a 4.0 with all honors courses my freshman and sophomore year.  When my depression was under control of course.  I don't want depression to take over my life and dictate how successful that I will be....

80,"I guess this is as good a place as any to start. Sorry if I break any rules I'm new here.

Some back story: I have a Bachelor's degree from a major university. I started college intending to pursue elementary education because I love kids and I love teaching, but I was dating a really awful sociopath who convinced me that I didn't need to pursue a real career because I was going to marry him and drop out of college anyway. Well, that didn't happen. What did happen is I changed my degree to a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies, which is a fancy title for ""barely in school,"" and ended up in a healthcare administration career. Hated that, got a job in banking.

Now four years later, I love being a banker but it doesn't really fulfill me. I'm heavily invested in my 401k - which of course I could roll over - and have earned nearly 5 weeks of paid time off each year in addition to 12 paid holidays and accrued sick time. Every time I consider my career in banking, I don't really know what I want to do and I always end up back at ""maybe I should be a teacher"".

I live in Arizona and we have a desperate need for teachers in this state, so I wouldn't need to go back for a second bachelor's degree, or a master's. I can get a teaching certificate from one of the community colleges and get cleared to teach in one of the school districts here fairly easily.

Based on some numbers I've run, I expect that to cost anywhere between $15-20k for the whole program plus all the testing and registration I need to actually be a teacher. I would have to take out student loans because my husband and I make too much money to qualify for much in the way of financial aid.

89,"First of all, a long story made short:

Ive been fairly healthy most of my life, but this spring I had a heart attack. But even after months of testing, no cause could be determined, and my doctor said in his opinion it was likely just a freak occurance.

Now, the current situation:

After that testing I fully recovered. I feel as fine as I ever did now, and the last time they did actual tests they said everything was great. So my cardiologist scheduled me for a 6 month followup to make sure everything was still good, that was today.


Heres my problem. The cardiologist walked into the room today, did absolutely no tests (literally did not touch me once) gave me a prescription for a blood pressure medicine that he really didnt even explain (not to mention the nurse had literally just taken my blood pressure and it was good- no I dont remember what it was now, Im at work.)

Then, he immediatly schedules 2 more ""followups"" for 2 months and 4 months down the road, with absolutely no explanation. Keep in mind, we waited 6 months just to have this 3 minute visit, where the entirety of what he said was ""How are you feeling?"" (Great) ""Ok, well Im gonna put you on this new medication and we will see you in 2 months, and again in 4 months."" And then started to leave.

I asked him what was going on and he gave me a quick explanation that at the 2 month appointment, we would see how that new medication was working (Even though my blood pressure was already fine.)


Does this sound suspect to anyone else? Is it normal to see a doctor and them not actually check anything but still bill your insurance?


Another thing that stuck out to me is ive started dieting and excersizing and lost some weight and I attempted to bring that up when he brought up this new medication and he just ignored it.

98,"So some back story:

I went to Disneyland with one of my buddies out of the blue, and we were just hanging out, enjoying the day, when all of a sudden this random girl hugs my friend and shouts his name. We were both confused until he realized it was his old friend from high school. I was in awe of her... So he and I remained with her and her friend for the remainder of our day there and had an awesome time!


Fast forward 2 weeks...


I'm hanging out with my buddy again and we get to talking about setting me up with someone, so naturally I bring his friend up to sort of nudge it in that direction. Nothing really comes of it, he said he'd mention it next time he saw her, and that was that.


Skip to yesterday...


I was with my buddy and a mutual friend and the subject of me finding someone is brought up. I mention her again and confirm that my friend isn't interested so as not to over-step anyone. He assures me he isn't interested, and I decided to shoot my shot then and there, so I DM her on instagram...

SWISH!

She's in college so she's understandably busy as of this month, so she requested we do it after the holidays. I agree and I give her my number to text me when she is available.


Here's my pickle: I'm just waiting for her to text me, but that could be long from now, and while that isn't an issue, I'd love to get a feel for how she likes to communicate and get some inside jokes going to save for the date. So am I stuck or can I somehow spark conversation in her DMs without coming off as needy or clingy?


Patience is lovely until you need it...

100,"This is kinda going to be a vent in a way, any advice is greatly welcome, especially if you've been where i am.
So my entire life the only thing that has ever mattered to me, more then grades, sports, or friends has always been gaming. Im a freshmen in college now and I'm coming to a horrific realization that gaming has brought me no joy for a while now, maybe almost a year. I noticed it in a league match, it had always been my main game, for years i played it daily whenever i played anything else it was just a break for league, and today i realized that i hate it, every match makes me bored and angry. I'm afraid that gaming wont bring me joy in the future, my whole life has been pretty much dedicated to it, and its haunting what i will do if it no longer interests me, i have nothing else, no other hobbies interest me the way gaming did, plus i tend to develop bad habits when I'm bored. I don't even enjoy single player games anymore, i couldn't finish Pyre, Metro 2033, and Hyperlight Drifter among many other, all halfway completed. I used to play games with my friends all the time but as years went on i see them less and less, i barely play with people i know now and i haven't made an internet friend in years, everyone i meet fades away and i end up removing them. Its not that i don't have friends in real life but no online friends anymore. Besides that i'm a freshmen in college and have no life direction whatsoever, no major or interests. Im kind just lost because i feel like gaming isn't gripping me like it once did and i cling to old memories of it, and without anywhere to head i'm worried of where ill end up, i used to come home from school and go right to my PC but now i just sleep and maybe play for a bit, but it has always taken up so much of my time what will i do without it? Its like losing a huge chunk of my personality, ive never enjoyed anything more then gaming. So i have no life direction and if the current trend continues ill have no hobbies either. I had hoped to follow my interests to a career but alas everything is becoming more distant.
Thanks for reading this, sorry for the rambling i just don't know where else to turn to, i don't trust my family or IRL friends to be of help, my few online friends who ive went to about that were completely callous and blew it off as a joke, even school counselors haven't been able to do anything.

102,"So I feel so lame for even saying this, but I really need to get it off my chest. 

I'm turning 18 in May, and I'm kind of scared of being an adult. I have plans to move out not too long after (I have a good amount of money saved up, don't worry) but I can't help but feel scared shitless. Everyone else I see seems to be happy to finally be an adult and move out and stuff, and don't get me wrong, I am sort of excited to move out and be own my own, but at the same time, I feel so scared. I think it's because I still, deep down, kind of feel like a kid. Also, I HATE change. The thought of being in an entirely new place (I plan on moving out of state) and not living with my parents shakes me up a little (god, I feel so lame saying this lmao) because I've lived with them all my life. 

I have nothing figured out. I mean, I'm not stupid. But at the same time, I'm a dumb ass. I feel like I don't know anything. I've been in college since I was 16, and I still don't have a concrete idea of what I really want to do. I just feel like I'm winging life entirely and I'm always afraid that I'll make a big mistake and fuck everything up. 

I've never told anybody any of this. I'm embarrassed that I feel this way. When I turned 17 I thought by 18 I wouldn't feel like this anymore, but I still do. Any advice? :/",29Nov2017,2
103,"So I've made this account solely for this post, on Friday night i matched on tinder with an amazing young woman. We clicked instantly and talked for hours until early in the morning, She was telling me about herself. it turns out that she had/has been through ALOT, this girl moved across states to be with her boyfriend. He had initially been good to her but after a while of being together he became extremely manipulative and abusive. At the time i was talking to her he had left her for another woman, she lives with him ( and his family ) but has no where to go. He had made it so that she didn't have any friends and no support, shes all alone with a serial bully. his family knows what hes like but there isn't much they can do, he has autism as well as other mental conditions. I should also mention he makes a lot of money and has connections to bad people, or so I've been told. Anyway shes in such a bad environment that shes tried to  commit suicide, he rubs it in whenever he sleeps with another woman and physically takes advantage of her. Its just a fucking horrible time for her and it breaks my heart, The other night she came over to escape. I promised i'd take her mind off the pain even if it was just for one night. This night may have been the best night of my life, she is a gorgeous girl who i got a long with very well. We cuddled in bed and i was trying to comfort her, this very quickly turned into sex. My god it was amazing, so passionate and intense. I could feel and see her physical reactions and she seemed to love every second of it, her legs were shaking from the intensity, she was complimenting me like crazy which i love as i really struggle with insecurities. After the first round she looked at me in the eyes and said that was probably the best sex shes ever had, she was saying that my curve made a big difference and i was hitting deep spots ( my go too ). We had sex twice more that night eventually stopping because it was getting too sore for her. She seemed absolutely infatuated with me that whole night, i remember when she was giving me head she would just stare at my member like as if she was in love with it. for the first time in a long time i actually felt confident and desirable. I couldn't believe i had a girl this incredible naked in my bed, cuddled up to me and telling me her deepest darkest secrets. She would tell me everything she had been through, fast forward to about 5 am i had to get her an uber home as i still live with my family. She got home safely and we continued to talk all day, she was telling me how great i am in bed and that she wanted to have a friends with benefits thing with me. She was keen to hang again this weekend and continue to get closer. From what i understand her ex didn't know what had happened, i know she was with him and his family the majority of the day, he had even said that he wanted her back which she had told me she said no to, at around 8 pm Monday night the last thing she said to me was that i'm amazing. Stupid Stupid fucking me forgot to respond to her snap until 2 hours later when i went on snap chat she had completely blocked me, that was one of the most heartbreaking moments I've ever had. I'm just so confused about what has happened, it could have been her jealous ex, it could've been her trying to delete it to cover both of our asses or maybe she just didn't want me, maybe i wasn't good enough. I tried to message her Facebook ( which i didn't have ) but decided for both of our safety it would be best to quickly block/delete the account so he Couldn't find me or what had happened between her and i. I know he has the capability to really fuck me up via doxxing or sending someone to get me. I have my brother and parents here that i need to think about. I am just broken, i need some advice on how to handle the situation, I'm starting to doubt all of the amazing things she said about me, maybe i was just a quick escape, maybe i meant nothing to her.

104,"Hello reddit friends !

I’m looking for some advice and wondering how I can stick up for myself -

I got a part time job as a hostess at a restaurant where I knew the assistant manager and we were considered *friends* 

It was awesome to have this job because I just got terminated from another job where I was terminated for no reason ( my boss degraded me and bullied me at the workplace )

Now that I had this gig , I was happy and even getting tips 

But I still needed a full time job to pay my bills 

I landed a job at a hotel and let the assistant manager aka *friend* know that I got this gig as soon as I could and that I would rather they keep me off schedule for sure until this new job have me my hours. I still wanted to work there very much when I was available and she was aware of this 

She told me she would communicate this to the head manager as I explained he may have put me on that weekend ... and well she didn’t

It turned out she was off the following day and this was not communicated ... before I knew it ... I got a message that weekend from her asking *do you know you were scheduled today?*

I explained I was at the hotel working and reiterated my availability that I explained to her earlier this same week that she failed to communicate

I would never not show up for a job no matter what and I never have pulled this before 

Anyway, I saw her out that weekend and apologized she told me I can’t talk about this outside of work ! Well she did .. she told me I was terminated because the manager already set the schedule -she also told me she recommended I write a letter that I was quitting on my end so that she didn’t have to give me the termination letter as they were corporate.

My blood was boiling ... what can I do about this situation ? Typically I hate confrontation and avoid sticking up for myself just to be cool with people but she cost me my job

Has anyone ever felt this way before and what did you do ? I’m getting so tired of letting people walk on me ... I’m a big fan of Letting karma doing the work and walking away but I’m not sure how much longer I can keep doing this .. TIA so much! ",29Nov2017,1

I just wish I had someone I could talk to guy-to-guy with again and hang out with outside of school with just each other. I should note the main reason for our drifting away was due to a plentiful amount of political disagreement and arguing between us (usually when he was hanging out with his conservative friend too).There are a few issues with reconnecting/explaining my feelings, though. Mainly,  
* I fear he will be uncomfortable with us becoming close again despite his acceptance of me as being gay (to be fair I am physically attracted to him but I don't have feelings FOR him)  
* He isn't at all as touchy-feely as I am and I also crave emotional intimacy in a lot of friendships so I could screw it up there  
* We are relatively close at this point, so just asking to hang out probably wouldn't be weird but I still am very afraid of any possible weirdness

Or I can do my option to move to Dallas Texas with my uncle work for a whole year save up some money and start taking classes a year after give myself a break.

Example, I'm almost positive she may have... ""ended someone"" for this man. At least he has proof and he has blackmailed me with it plenty. I've done almost everything he asked so far hoping I can get my sister out of this but it's now useless in my opinion. I've had sex with him, had sex with his friends, set people up for him, destroyed evidence for him, etc. All in promise he would remove evidence he has on my sister.

But last week I finally gave up. I don't believe him anymore... He made me do something that I would never have imagined. I wouldn't be surprised if someone actually heard about it. But on Black Friday -&gt; Where it's obviously packed full of people, he brought me to a supermarket that was crowded and I had to... uh...

He bought me a risky outfit and I had squat down in a busy area, pull up my squirt and show my private areas then... do number two on the ground below me... He also said I had to sit there and either drop 3 or wait 15 seconds... That's probably because I was being recorded and people were taking pictures and screaming...

I even saw kids watching and I just felt like absolute shit. Afterwards after completely wiping evidence on something this man held on my sister for so long.

121,"Hello /r/advice

This is a throwaway account and you will understand shortly. Also, let me preface this by telling you in advance that this isn't a classic ""what should I do to get with this girl"" case. This is much worse.

I'm 20, male, study at university and live in Canada. So this new girl got hired at my workplace (supermaket, student job) and we've been hitting off for a month. I found her very attractive, she's really fun to talk to, I tought about having a relationship with her and she is really attracted to me. She didn't mention her age explicitly, she said she was studying at an adult secondary school because she had trouble that made her fall behind in highschool. However I knew she was younger than me and so, I assumed she was 18 because she's also best friend with one of our coworker who is 18. I can't strees this enough. Sunday we had a shift together, everything was really tense, she was always talking to me, biting her lips, etc. and she asked me what I was doing after the shift. I agreed to hang out with her after our shift and we ended up at my place netflix and chilling. Things happens and we end up having consensual sex. 

Now this is were it gets spicy. The next morning, we started talking about random shit when she dropped this bomb on me: ""You know customers always think I'm older, like they come to my cash register and ask me where I'm hanging out tonight and if I have a boyfriend. **You should see their face when I tell them I'm 16.**"" When I heard that, I died inside. I hid everything to her, acted like nothing happend and dropped her off at her place before heading back to mine with the worst feeling of dread I've ever experienced in my life. I swear, every indication was pointing to the fact that she was 18 or over. She's also strangely mature for her age and always hang out with 18 yo kids. I really can't stress this enough.

So now I'm sitting here, she still texts me all the time and she doesn't consider us a couple (which is really really good.) However, we have an employee diner coming up this weekend and we had already planned two weeks ahead that we would hang out afterward. I would say no automatically right now, but she really seem to want me, and I don't want to piss her off and spread the fact that I fucked a 16 year old girl. So what should I do, how can I escape this whitout being labeled as a creep? [Also know that everything I did is legal in Canada.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America#Canada)

We message back and forth on Snapchat every now and then.

I really want to pursue a relationship with her. But the problem is, she is way out of my league. A few weeks ago a friend who's a girl who's also really good friends with the one I like, got me to admit that I liked her. Well with in minutes the girl I like messaged me out of the blue. We talked for a bit and it was awesome, same happened the next night, she randomly messages me ""hey"". We talked a lot that week, but we haven't really since then. I really love talking to her, but I get afraid that I get on her nerves or I'm being a pest, and I don't want to mess up any slim chance that I might have with her.

And the times that we have talked I always will say something a little dumb, or just a little cringy and hate myself for it to this day. The other friend I mentioned thinks she might like me as well but I doubt it.

130,"We signed for a 13 month lease last November, so we're fast approaching the last minute to find somewhere to live. 

I've known him since I was in Kindergarten, we grew up in the same area, went to the same high school, etc. So any decision, no matter what I choose, holds a lot of weight. Since moving in with him it's been fun sometimes, but I no longer feel like I can keep it up. It's just us two, and it would be the same situation if we signed another lease (we had a third roommate who had to drop out because he totaled his car and has to pay his parents back). 

Here's the thing; most of the reasons I don't want to live with him anymore aren't really objective things I can easily point out. For starters, he got diagnosed with Crohn's Disease a couple years prior to our our freshman semester at college. He's grown gradually (and increasingly) more depressive, reclusive, cynical, and bitter since then. On the one hand I don't really blame him; getting dealt a hand like that at our age is horrible, and I'd never want to step into his shoes. However, it's miserable to have to go home to, and it's starting to wear on me. He can't drink due to the heavy medications he's on to cope with the condition, but he smokes daily. I smoke too, so that's not inherently a problem, but he's incredibly cavalier towards the idea that he could get caught, despite close calls, which of course makes me (legally) nervous about re-upping the lease, particularly in a nicer apartment community where people might care, complain, and get us evicted. I've tried bringing it up to him before, particularly when one close call involved me. Each time, I'm ""paranoid"" and need to ""chill out."" 

His lack of ability to drink definitely contributes towards his hatred of the social scene in college, which heavily revolves around it. He mocks most everything about our school, too. And while I view most of the work as arbitrary and more of a measure of obedience, like him, I still want to get out there, meet people, and make the best of it, you know? To be honest, I don't really feel like I could comfortably bring by any of my own friends. 

However, on the surface, he's an ideal roommate. He's always prompt with rent (which he ought to be--his parents pay for everything, and I mean everything). He isn't the greatest with chores, but he's cleanly, so I don't care at all about taking the trash out more often, etc. He does have a cat that has severe separation anxiety (yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but I swear this cat has it) and if he's not around, it has to be constantly with me or it sits outside my door and yowls until it's let in. Objectively, that's my biggest ""surface"" complaint I could bring up, but to be fair, he couldn't really control that about his cat. If I ever tried to bring it up he'd be deeply offended/angered. 

He's also been constantly stalling about finding a new place and completely apathetic to the apartment search process. I've tried to remind him about it once a week for the past three or four, but no matter what I do, he just assumes I'll do all the work (which happened last time on the lease we did sign for, but at that point I was so eager to move out of my Mom's I decided to ignore all my misgivings at the time). Since we're approaching our move-out date, as well as the end of finals when apartment units are greedily snapped up, I (without his knowledge) put down an application for a single person unit in my same complex, which has been, for low to mid tier apartment homes, relatively great this past year. After doing a ton of research again (we're staying in the same area around our school) there's only one other complex that's within our budget, and it's less nice, right next to campus so it has a ton of traffic, it’s loud, and even a bit more expensive than our current apartment. He loathes the idea of staying in the same place, saying, repeatedly, that he needs a ""change of scenery."" For me, it comes down to picking something practical that makes it easy to get to and from school, so I decided to go ahead and do what's right for me. At one point I even offered to switch units from the one we have now to a different, nicer one within the same apartment community, maybe something with a balcony. I hoped this compromise would work, but it still doesn’t constitute a change of scenery for him. 

Ok, so: I need your advice. How do I tell him I don't want to live with him anymore? Like I said, I've known him for years and this would, I think, crush him. It's not been easy for me either. I haven't slept decently in weeks. I feel like I can't use a generic, ""I'm just looking for something different,"" or, ""I need some space."" He'll (obviously) see this as an ultimate betrayal, and when I finally let him know I can't imagine that he won't press me for something more substantial. What do I say? A lot of the reasons I have for separating aren't things he would agree to, if they don't downright insult him. To make matters worse, I'm completely amicable with him on a daily basis. Right before writing this we were just in the kitchen laughing at some girl giving A$AP Rocky a plate during a backstage Pitchfork event. 

I feel terrible right now. This is probably going to blindside him, and I know he'll immediately jump to the fact that I've been friendly with him the whole time, so why the hell am I doing this? 
What should I do to make breaking the news less horrible? 
If any of you have a personal anecdote about having to do something similar, please share.

A few places she wants to go are Germany and Argentina. For winter months in the US, Argentina is good timing because it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, but I know basically nothing about getting around Argentina and I don’t speak any Spanish. Flights to various airports are putting the trip at about 5k$+ and travel times look like they are over 24 hours each way, which leads for less time exploring because we both have limited time off from work. 

Flights to Germany are more direct and cheaper, but the outdoor activities like hiking aren’t as available in the winter months, so going in the summer is a much better option. 

Is it lame to buy someone a trip for Christmas that doesn’t depart for 4+ months?  Is it rude to plan a trip that uses a large chunk of someone’s vacation time?

142,"I'm working as a football coach at my old high school while taking courses in college. I was taken under the wing of and given a shot by my old position coach. He's taught me everything I know, and even convinced the head coach to cut me a bigger stipend check. He's done a lot of good for me. 

At my expense though, he hasn't really allowed me any time to care about anything else. When I talk about school seriously, I get called dumb and weird for taking it seriously, that it's college and I should just be in and out. I get told I have no ""life game"". And when I make a point of saying ""well I need school to get my degree so I can be an official and educated strength and conditioning coach/athletic trainer."" But I get shut down by him talking shit saying I'm wasting my time since our trainer doesn't have a degree and Strength and Conditioning coaches are few and far between. 

I don't have the courage to tell him ""yeah well, you were just in and out of college for the degree and what are you? Oh right, a night shift security guard."" 

He guilts me into going into the office on my days off by saying ""you're not doing anything, you don't have another job, quit jerking off and get down here we'll do blah blah blah."" Which usually involves me taking him to get food, or buying him food. Which I get repaid for. But still, bullshit! 

I'm tired of it. I wanna take more classes, I'm more than likely gonna fail my only one because of how much time he forced me to put into coaching instead of school, and I've thought about quitting because I know he's a bad influence. But influence aside, he's the best guy around to learn how to coach under and I'm getting valuable experience for my career. So I'm pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

Because he's such an asshole, I have no idea what will happen if I stood up to him and told him to leave me alone and let me handle my business without constantly getting yelled at or catching shit for it.

143,"Sorry for my bad English. I'm not a native speaker.

I have been in a relationship with him for over 3 years. He has a hard life and a terrible relationship with his family. His parents had him since they were both 17. His mom somehow went crazy and convinced his dad that he was retarded and didn't let him go to school after he was 10. He still keeps in touch with his dad but it was just so so. He tried to commit suicide 3 times when he was in America. 

I'm so sick of him because he always takes control of everything, often yells at me and makes me cry in public, insults my family. Every time I tried to work things out with him, he just made a bunch of excuses and I was not happy with that then eventually he would get mad back at me. I understand then when he lived with his family, he had to force things as much as he could because his parents didn't listen to him but I'm not the one who makes it happen. I can't stand and I told him I wanted to break-up so many times and he threatened me to commit suicide. It was taking a true mental toll on me when he would have his constant mood swings, threaten to commit suicide and direct his hate towards me. I eventually broke down as a result and became severely depressed myself. I couldn't handle it anymore. I'm just 23 and I've wasted 3 years of my life with the guy I hate. Everyday I tell myself to keep trying, because i don't want it to hurt the rest of my life. I would most certainly blame myself for his death if he'd committed suicide shortly after our break-up. 
Unfortunately, we are in a developing country in Asia, can't find a decent therapist here and he refuses to do that because he only trusts American ones. He also doesn't want to go back to America without me but he can't take me with him because of the immigration law and he doesn't have enough money.

146,"I bought a knife from WWII over the summer. It has a soldier's name on it. I used army records to find someone with his name, only one person with his name served. I believe I found his obituary online, he has the same name, residence, and birth year as the soldier. The obituary also mentions his military service. The obituary lists living family members. I managed to find the phone number of his brother-in-law's company (he's the sole employee) by looking up his name. I want to give the knife back but feel like I'd sound like a stalker or something and wouldn't know how to explain it. Put yourself into this guy's shoes. You're at work.

I just think it's kind of creepy for a stranger to call and know a lot about your family and start asking about it, idk.

150,"Hello everyone, this is my first post to the sub and I'm on mobile so I apologise if the formatting is off. I also apologise for the length, I didn't mean to write this much when I started.

First let's start with background. I'm currently a student in the US and I work for my university's campus safety program. There I am a supervisor, which means that another supervisor needs to cover my shifts whenever I want off. This is usually done by trading shifts with other supervisors.

About a month ago I bought tickets for a concert that's this weekend for a buddy of mine and myself as an early Christmas present. I told my two bosses (both also student supervisors, just slightly higher on the food chain) that I was planning a vacation (concert is back at my home, I go to school out of state) and I'll update them when I find a replacement. Now once every week the supervisors all get together for a meeting to make sure everyone is on the same page. At the end of the meeting I made an announcement looking for a replacement, and in front of all the supervisors (9 of us) I orally arranged to trade shifts with another supervisor.

Now here's a key note. Our employees formally let the supervisors know if they're trading shifts via email, however, supervisors don't do the same with each other. Since we're all basically at the same level, we just orally agree to trade shifts with others. It's never been an issue.

So my coworker and I agree to trade shifts. I already worked his shift, but last night he texted me saying that something came up with his fraternity that he forgot about and he shouldn't have agreed to trade shifts from the beginning. At first I said, no problem, it happens to the best of us, there's other supervisors I can ask to trade shifts with. The problem now is that all the other supervisors are unable to trade shifts with me. 

Now I've already paid for the tickets, but not my train ride home. Here are my options as I see them.

I could just give the tickets to my buddy and let him take someone else because I have to work.

I could approach my boss about leaving my shift unaccounted for, but I already did this before (to work that guys shift) and I wouldn't feel right doing it again.

I could ask a supervisor to cover for me, but I wouldn't be able to take their shift in return, thus being an ass.

Or I could go back to original guy and try and get him to stick with covering my shift since I already covered his. The only problem is that he's a senior and he's only got so many fraternity events left that I don't want to rob him of that.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.",29Nov2017,1

154,"I'll put the Tl;dr up top: I found a phone, can't figure out how to get in touch with the owner. Trying to figure out what my options are.

OK so I was bartending at a one-day pop-up event last Saturday and someone turned in an iPhone. By the end of the night nobody had come to claim it, so after I was done breaking down the bar I went through it to try to find a way to get in touch with the owner.

I've found phones before and I know the usual tricks, but in this case none of my go-to techniques were possible: they had no contacts saved in their phone, and the most recent text messages were from 2016 and 2015; there were some recent phone calls but despite showing full 3G service bars (service dots? I'm not an iPhone guy) I couldn't get a call to connect. Ditto trying to text. No social media apps on the phone. I found the owner's name on their iCloud account info but their online footprint is completely nonexistent. I have sent emails to the two email accounts attached to the phone—the iCloud one and an AOL account—but haven't heard back, and honestly their inbox is pretty much entirely mailing lists for chain stores so I'd be surprised if I ever get a response. Their iPhoto was pretty active so I wrote a note and took a photo of it, but I assume that since I can't send a text or make a call that the photo hasn't uploaded to their iCloud.

So at this point I'm not sure what else I can do. I once lost my phone and had it returned to me by an amazing woman who went above and beyond trying to figure out how to get in touch with me, so I feel like I have to put in every effort to pay it forward; but at this point I think I may have exhausted my options. So I've got two questions:

1) Does anybody have any ideas of other ways I can try to find this person; and

2) If after another week or so I still haven't heard back, what are my options with the phone? If I'm being completely honest, I've actually been saving up for a new phone/planning on switching over to iPhone and it's pretty funny that all of a sudden one pops up like this, so are there any legal concerns with doing a factory reset and using it for myself? Is that even possible? I'm on T-Mobile and they're on Verizon, is there anyway for me to unlock the phone so I can use it with a T-Mobile SIM card?

I understand the translation to be that she sends him the pic and he says ""who is it?"" and she says ""a young Russian who wants my ass"" and he says ""what about your boyfriend?"" (that's me, I have grey hair) and she says ""its all good"" and he's like ""ummmmmm"" and she's like well ""I just use him to pay for rides and buy me food"" and he says ""and then you'll prostitute yourself to him after?"" and she says ""no"" with an upside down face.

So, a little background: she's a stripper and she's assured me she never would and never has given a customer her number.
Well lately I started to get suspicious for different reasons.
So I confronted her about this message and she swears she would never have sex for money and never has. That her friend is just joking, and it is typical locker room talk and just the way she talks with her gay friends. Yes, she gave the guy her number to get some freebies, but that's all. 

My feeling is that yes, in this instance that is true, she didn't sleep with him. 
But the fact that her BEST FRIEND asked her this question makes me feel like she's done it before. 
It doesn't seem joking. He seems seriously concerned that she's being so careless about her relationship with me and then he seems to be seriously asking if she's gonna fuck the guy for money. 
Also, her response isn't like ""no way!"" or ""haha"", it seems like her ""no"" response is taking the question at face value. 
I've been scratching my head like crazy wondering whether this is truly a very damning exchange or if I'm just inventing unfounded paranoia and the exchange is innocent. 

Can any native Mexican Spanish speakers weigh in please!!!! 

(By the way, the other suspicious evidence against her is that she suddenly started making double the money she used to, like $7k per week; I found out that she's met at least 3 different people in hotel rooms (where she insists it was just private dances, no more.) That may sound crazy to some people, but it is actually quiet common here in Melbourne for guys to pay girls a couple grand to come back to the room and party and give dances and the girls dont put out. So while on the one hand it may seem like im crazy naive for thinking she's not fucking, it is definitely possible that she took a couple grand to go back to a room with another girl as well and she definitely wouldn't tell me cause of course I'd trip.)

173,"Hey, so I had a pretty rough first year, ended up getting grades of 40-59% which isn’t incredibly bad considering I never went into lecture.

For my first semester for second year, I was excited and was ready to finally start going in, doing the work and putting in the effort.

However, my grandad (80) then hung himself, which sent me into a spiral of depression and anxiety, so I have not been going into lectures again.

Do I have time to pull this back? I only have two weeks of lectures left, missed most, I really want to quit but everyone around me thinks it will be a bad idea.

Have any of you struggled and then found a way half way through second year to start working well? ",29Nov2017,20
174,"On Sunday morning, I woke up with a super painful sore throat. I could barely eat let alone drink. Talking was just as bad! It caused me to feel so fatigued just *trying* to talk. My mom took a look and said it was pharyngitis.

The next day, it felt much better, but it still hurt to eat. Talking was a tad easier. Soft food could go down, but solid food was a bit tougher. I also noticed I was beginning to get cold symptoms. So I knew I was getting a cold.

On Tuesday, my sore throat was much better, but the symptoms became worse. I had to work, and it was bearable except for the fatigue. I did go to bed earlier than I normally do to just rest for the rest of the day.

Now that all leads up to today. I don't feel fatigued, but the rest of my symptoms have worsened. It's 3 AM now, and I was supposed to be working today (I work as a delivery driver.), but I ended up calling my manager (had to text him - he had to take a 3 AM delivery, so he was awake and he did respond with ""Ok"") to let him know I would be unavailable to take the deliveries they had today for me to take (there were 2).

I do feel bad for saying I'd be unable to take them because I did originally say I would be able to take them on Monday (before my symptoms were noticeable). That is my only job, but I do work around food and I feel overall like crap. Did I do the right thing?

**Tl;dr:** Woke up sick on Sunday with a painful sore throat. Progressed into a cold the next day. Only got worse throughout the next 2 days. Texted my manager to let him know I'd be unavailable today despite me saying I would be available on Monday. I feel terrible for doing so.",29Nov2017,1

177,"Trigger warning: Sexual abuse, suicide, mental health

*sorry for typos, grammer and spelling issues in advance - wrote this novel on mobile and it's 4:30am. I am also still processing all of this info, so it's still a mess in my brain.

Note: I do NOT indentify myself as a feminist and I do not use the terms rape or sexual abuse lightly.

Background:

My parents split up about 10 years ago now (my mom left my dad for another man), the whole breakup was extremely messy (my dad was threating suicide and my mom was hospitalized and in psychosis for 6 months for starters) it was super traumatizing for both my brother and I (at the time, him 14 and I 17)

It took me years to recover from the trauma, I should have gotten professional help, but I managed to work it out in the end (though I really should still see someone anyways, things linger)

My brother on the other hand never seemed to recover, if anything he got worse. He has spent the last 10 years working as much as he could, ignoring and cutting out family, playing videogames and doing a lot of drugs (mostly weed and MDMA/speed). He would get very agitated when my parents would come up in conversation and not want to talk about his problems. Has had issues with communication, anger issues and I think depression. He has cut out all contact with my mom for close to 7 years and is always stoned out of his mind around my dad.

My brother finaly cracked the other day, and from the sounds of it he is suffering from PTSD. As it turns out, when my mother broke up with my dad - my brother ended up overhearing my father rape my mother as he was in the next room when he was 14. I 100% believe my brother as he has no reason to lie, my mother confirmed that this has happened and in all honesty, I think I heard it happen too... but my understanding of the situation was much different than my brother's at the time- but that's a whole other story.

My brother thinks that my dad must have raped my mom more then once (spoilers, he's right) because a rapist doesn't just rape someone once and people do not change. He also thinks he may have raped others in the past and he could do it again.

My brother is scared of turning out like my dad.

My brother is angry for my dad always lying through his teeth, playing the victim and calling himself a 'good guy'. This has added to my brother's trust issues.

I think my brother resents me for forgiving my parents, moving on and having a healthy relationship with them. He thinks I do not see that they are shitty people. He thinks that I would pick them over him any day.

My brother is convinced that he is the product of rape and that he should not be alive. He thinks I should have been an only child.

My brother said that if my dad could rape, maybe he is a child molester too (he was really mad at this point and saying this, It's not an actual accusation) but either way, he sees my dad as a predator.

My brother is angry that my mother let a rapist raise her children (my brother and I) He feels that if my mom would have gotten rid of my dad sooner, he would not be traumatized and that he would have turned out to be a different person - a better person. He feels that because she dident protect herself - she did not protect him at the same time.

My brother still gets flashbacks of hearing my mother getting raped. He smokes so much weed to numb that.

I think he has cut out my mom from his life not only due to anger, but she is a reminder of this trama and possibly guilt for not being able to help her. He has been hoping that ignoring the trama would make it go away and it hasn't, though he is realizing this now.

I think the reason he still sees my dad is because he is the baggage that I and my cousins carry with us (my two cousins, my brother and I were all very close growing up) but he makes sure to be stoned out of his mind when he is around my dad.

My brother blames my dad for teaching him that it is ok to burn bridges (the reason he cut my mom out of his life, is that is what my dad did to his dad instead of dealing with his issues)

My brother has kept this secret bottled up and never told anyone until now.  This was over chat, but I'm going to go see him very soon and talk to him face to face. He seems to be now ready to talk and get better. I hope us talking can help him get out all this crap and I can help him heal. regardless, I will be recommending he see professional help.

After hearing all of this from my brother, I felt sick and couldn't sleep, had my own flashbacks and surpressed memories pop up. I believed what my brother said but I needed to hear my mom's side of the story.

Times my mother remembers being sexually abused by my father:

After my mom broke up with my dad:

- Once lock picked the bathroom while she was having a shower, told her it was ok to cry when he had his way with her.

- Once in their bedroom. I beleave this was the time my brother heard as he was in the next room. She begged him to stop and cried while he agressivly raped her.

- would sexually harass/molest my mother around the house until she left to seek safety at a friend's place.

Before my mother broke up with my dad:

- My mother was once heavily medicated and my father had sex with her unconscious body. He told her this after it happened.

- My mother once allowed him to try anial sex on her. she realized right away that she did not like it and begged him to stop and he wouldent. She said this was the worst time as it hurt and he was extremely rough.

- He would be extremely rough in bed and hit her. she did not like it and told him so - yet he was always like this.

Speaking to my mother about this, she did not want to call it rape because she feels that a man cannot rape his wife. She said it was because he had needs. she blamed it on porn. she said she wanted to please him. I had to explain to her what consent was, that she has rights and that marital rape is a real thing. The sexual abuse was never brought up in  court when my parents were getting divorced.

I feel like I need to confront my dad about all this.

Considering how my mother did not understand the concept of consent or that she had rights to her own body, I am guessing my father probaly also does not understand the concept of consent or that just because he ""has"" a sexual partner does not mean he has the right to use them as he pleases. My guess is if I come straight out and accuse him of rape, be will be hurt, defensive and feel like I am attacking him. What he did was horrible and totally fucked up - but in regards to intent I am pretty sure he did not mean any harm. I don't say this to excuse what he did, but I feel that intent should be taken into consideration (malicious intentional rapist vs selfish ignorant nonintentional rapist)

I just don't know how to confront him (or even if I should) but I believe my brother needs answers for closure and I want to prevent the possibility of my father abusing a woman in the future. For all I know, he leaned what he had done wrong somehow and feels super guilty about it.

I'm worried that my father will take the information extremely bad and start threating suicide again. I'm worried he will think that we are accusing him of commiting a crime he believes that he has not done.

Any tips on how to confront my dad on all of this?

I can't sleep because I get an erection and constantly think about girls I want to hookup with. For years I've always just wanted to find one girl I like, bond, and grow my life. But in the past few months, especially tonight, I've been second guessing that.

Getting girlfriends in the past was hard, and suddenly, it's like I have a list of girls who I could date. I don't know what changed. But it is bugging me. I feel like I should be happy. And I'm certainly not 'unhappy', but I'm conflicted and don't know what I should do.

I met one girl on tinder and we have gone on two dates with a third planned. I will go for a kiss on this date. I like her. I think she is prettyand I'm attracted, but I don't really crave her. I do crave female affection, but it's not exclusive. And as much as I crave affection, I also crave more than one girl and want to ""have fun"" as I see so many other people do.

I went to a friends party and one girl kept telling me I was cute, asked for my number, and took my picture. I talked to her a lot, but I didn't reciprocate since I was already dating the first girl.

I like both the girls. I want to hookup with both, but I don't want to break hearts. I don't want to be a cheater. I could probably get away with it if I tried. I'd rather just ask for a casual hookup, but it seems like the only way to get a girl to have sex is to get them in a relationship. That feels really scummy and deceptive.

I used to hate people who just had sex for fun. Always felt it was kind of scummy. Especially for guys who woo girls, fuck them, then move on to the next, but in a way, I want this for myself. I think I could attain that position that, but I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

I want to hookup, but I don't want to force relationships, I don't want to hurt anyone. I know getting cheated on really hurts.

187,"So, bear with me everyone. My rather recent story is a long one, my depression has come and gone over the last few years, and I don't have the thought or organization I once had to assemble my story into an easy to follow manner. 

So I apologize but I must throw everything at you in the order that comes to my head.


Hello, my name is Tyler.


I don't know who I am or what to do with my life right now.
But this depression has been going on for awhile now, there have been days where I sit and stare vacant at my wall most of the day, laying in bed, contemplating nihilism and what worth I am to anything. 



There have been days where I wanted to end my life.



My whole life I've wanted to be an inventor. 
Misfortune or fortune, I stumbled across a game development platform called roblox at a young age for kids. I was enticed by it since it taught me how to program and got captured in its development and community and here I am now.


And right now I'm holding on to it because it's my biggest skill, I'm holding on to it like a weak strand hoping it can make me some money to justify doing it. But even if I make success off roblox, which I at times doubt, I'd still not be what I want to be. I'd still be chasing another man's dream


and don't get me wrong I love game development, at its stem its breathing life into ideas, it is inventing, creating but I wanted to be more of an engineer.


I wanted to work with machines and cognitive science, and be one of the people to help make the world an easier and better place. 


and now I'm 20, haven't even gone to college yet(2 years late to it), and I feel like I'm way too old to even jump into something like that. 

I also have big self esteem issues. I'm a skeptical person and I doubt what I can bring to the world.
 I doubt that I could reach my far fetched dreams under the premise that I don't believe I'm very intelligent. Or talented.
 
I don't believe there's much out there that separates me from anyone else. And to be someone that I want to be, I know it requires that separation. 

I'm even embarrassed to go to college, because my other peers are much more intelligent than I am, they have grants, scholarships, things going for them, talent and passion. I did well GPA wise in high school but I never got any of that. I'd be going to a community college racking up debt for a major I may end up regretting. 


I also don't know if college is for me. Being that my dream is entrepreneurship and independent innovation rather than degrees and a normal job, I feel like it'd hold me back more than help me grow.


but I don't know yet I'm considering every possibility and trying to weigh them the best I can


I've also been getting depressed because I feel like my imagination has been slowly draining over the years which I guess can be at least partially attributed to depression. I'm no neuro scientist but I'd imagine it affects part of the brain responsible for mental clarity and creativity. 


I feel like, the depression has made my mind worse, and I feel like it puts me into an endless loop because its very existence is only postponing the chance at healing. 

People have recommended anti depressants, but I feel like things are more circumstantial than they are chemical. 


Anyways, my imagination was always another huge part of what and who I was
And now I feel like with that slipping away, my meaning to live and my attempts to grow are squandered.


I'm losing myself, I'm stumbling like a fool, my life, my hygiene, my health is a mess


Most days I hardly remember what I ate for breakfast let alone having the attention or mustered focus to develop or think


And this isn't an overload of stress or anything.


It's not normal, not for me.

Where before I could write frequently, I had multiple hobbies, poetry, programming martial arts, I could come up with new , exciting ideas with ease, where before I could remember nearly anything without even trying to,

My imagination is gone now. I don't do anything.
and I can't remember anything ever.


I feel like a withering person and I'm living like one
There's been nothing scarier in my life than witnessing my own decline and thinking there's nothing I can do about it.
Every week things get more clouded.

And of course there is something I can do about it, maybe..
maybe, but I also believe if you're too deep in this hole you can't see the guiding light.


I've considered books. Reading books.
not informative books, just normal books that people read,
like story books
game of thrones. That sort of thing

But the idea isn't grounded on anything, it's more desperation, the thought that maybe if I absorb myself in the imagination and creativity of others
that some of it will come back to me.




I remember fragments of who I was , before the depression, before I went down my childhood path with game development that I today regret, and I'd do anything to take those years back. 


But now I'm falling apart. I don't know what exactly to attribute it to, I don't know what to do about my crumbling dreams, and I don't know how to repair any of it. 


But I know I want help, however I can get it.",29Nov2017,4

At first I didn't really mind it and was like yea whatever.

Two days before the wedding we (the groomsmen) met up with the bridesmaids, and we practiced where we were gonna go and all that stuff. Anyway the girl i was walking with(also 18) i thought was really pretty, and i guess you could say that i liked her. She wasn't like WAAAY out of my league, it wasn't something unrealistic. She was just.. prefect? We connected in a way, but as someone that just stays inside playing league and doesn't socialize often it was hard to initiate a conversation. I just smiled at her and gave her stares. not creepy stares but you know.

During the wedding I was dying to ask her for her Snapchat or number, which i did, with the help of a friend. thank god.
Everything went well right? But i have no idea why i feel so bad.

After the wedding she flew back to her state as did i. I left really happy, but once i got home, laid in bed, I just replayed every moment i had with her.

The university I'm going to now has a much better program and is much more well known, so it's overall just a better education. Before transferring, I went to a school about 4 hours from home. I lived in a dorm and I really liked it. I did really well. Made a 4.0, was really motivated and focused, and overall I grew a lot as a person. One of the reasons I decided to transfer was to save money. I currently commute (from Home) to school since it's only a ~25 minute drive. I save a lot of money by doing this,  but I honestly really don't like living at home. I find it super hard to focus on my academics and stay motivated when I live in my parents house. There's just so many bad habits that take place at home that I find really hard to break. I've tried decently hard to really focus on school and be in that same productive mindset I had when I was at my previous school, but I've had no success. I'm not going to fail classes or anything, but I just know I could be doing so much better if I had the same mindset as I had at my last school. I also find it a lot harder to get involved and make friends since I live way off campus. Overall, I don't even feel like I'm at university, more just that I'm taking classes at some school, if that makes any sense. I just feel really unfulfilled in my current situation, but I want to make it work. How can I overcome being unfocused and perhaps enjoy my school experience more despite me living at home? Any advice? ",29Nov2017,2

213,"Hello. I’m in my second year of electrical engineering and so far a lot of this stuff has been completely over my head. Many assignments I hand in half finished because I don’t know how to do them and am often lost in the labs concerning even the basics. My average is above the average for each class and I don’t mean to sound like a complainer but I truly don’t feel like I actually UNDERSTAND what is going on in most of my courses. I enjoy parts of my one circuits class and I like aspects of my digital signals processing class, but really my favourite is my intro to c++ course. 

I don’t know if I enjoy it the most because its the easiest or what, but I’d rather struggle through hours of it than most of my other classes. With it, it feels like if I put in the work I can get it where as my other classes feel absolutely pointless to even try and learn. On top of that, I really have a passion for coding and find it and the problem solving that goes along with it really enjoyable. As such, I am having a personal dilemma on whether or not I want to continue to pursue electrical engineering or if I should just swap to computer science. Initially I planned on pursuing a dual-degree with both, but now I am starting to feel that EE is not worth the struggle if I enjoy computer science more and wage is about the same. 

However, as I said my grades aren’t bad, my friends are in this, and it’s not all bad. I also would like to get into robotics and don’t know if that’s possible with just computer science. Also, I have already invested almost 3 terms so far so I am quite torn on what to do. Does it get easier? Is it normal to feel like so much is over my head? I just want to feel competent. I am fine with struggle but often these classes have been feeling like I am grasping at straws. 

Sorry for the rant, just need some feedback and advice from anyone who took the time to read this!

TLDR: Struggling with EE, enjoying computing class. Should I swap to computer science? Want to know the pros and cons. ",29Nov2017,2

224,"Hello,

I've been living in student housing for a couple of months now, and I've had a couple of issues with my housemates. They're great people, and I enjoy living with them, but we keep having problems with each other.

We've had a couple of disagreements about my tone and the way I talk to them. They find it rude and often condescending, and while I've successfully worked to keep my cool in situations where I'd get more aggressive, they still have issues with my day-to-day tone and the way I react to them telling me things.

I sort of know why this happens. I was intensely bullied at school and home life was confrontational, and it's left me with an automatic fight response whenever somebody makes a comment about me. Even if I agree with it, I can react badly, in a sort of dismissive or sulky way. It's also difficult to admit that I'm doing badly and ask for help, we'd had disagreements on cleaning which were solved when I admitted I didn't know how to do some things.

None of this is an excuse, but it's mostly subconscious now. Even though I can successfully monitor myself to keep my cool and not react aggressively to things, I am struggling to react to things better because I react to things without thinking a lot of the time.

I'm also apparently condescending in tone when I discuss/argue something, and everybody from my family (who I stopped discussing politics with) to my housemates to the people in my university's debate society have noticed it. Even in text form they feel I'm condescending. As far as I'm concerned I have no idea what I'm doing to give them that impression, it feels like a curse that I can't understand, let alone tackle.

Also, I feel that there's a bit of a double standard with my housemates. While I have admitted the problem and said I want to solve it, when I bring up that I feel they've been rude to me at times, they will use my reactions as an excuse, say I'm rude more than they are, and refuse to apologise.

What should I do? How can I better my tone and reactions to things? How can I stop being condescending? How can I put across to my housemates that I'm also unhappy with them?",29Nov2017,2

234,"Well, i'm 18 years old, 3 years ago my life was really a mess, i had friends and stuff but i just didn't liked myself, after a whole year of starting to trying to get myself together i did a little bit of progress but not really that much, but y'know things were going good.

That's when i met her, She was obviously out of my league,she's 2 years younger than me, she's gorgeous, kind, caring, she understood me so well, we used to have the longest and best conversations i've ever had, i just loved to be around her.
I liked her, and, as i supossed, things did not go as planned.

After that things got a little weird but we were okay.

We had a fight, our first fight. It seemed like we weren't gonna talk ever again, but we got things back to normal and we started talking again, after this we had fights every 2 months, but everything went back to normal after a couple of weeks.

Although the fights and everything, we were really super close friends, and i loved her like, holy, i would give my life for her.

I made a bunch of progress because i wanted to be better for her and i did probably x10 times of what i did in the past, but this time in 3 months. I was super happy, time passes,  and one of her friends (who was really grumpy and had a beef against me) starts to tell me i have no chances with her, that i'm just gonna scare her and than i should stop saying things and just stop liking her in general.
That gets my hopes and my everything a little bit down but y'know, i was still trying my best.

We had a fight a little bit after that, and it was huge.

She was lying to me, saying she had tests and she was bussy, to this day i still don't know why she lied, but i know for fact it had to do with that friend.

Since once we were watching a movie and she said ¨Oh no, she's messaging me, she thinks i'm with you¨ 
She got a call from her and she had to go answer the call and try to explain she was not. I suppose it was because her friend told her not to talk to me.

It's been 6 months since that.

3 months ago i tried to become friends with her again, on the time we did not talk i became a little sad, but everything was fine, this time i tried to develop social skills and i felt more comfortable since i would know what to and how to reply without sounding like her brother.
Things were going great, we were having a super long and aswesome conversation.
Out of nowhere, she stops messaging me.
I try to say hey did i said something bad? Hey, what happened?
And well, she sends me a last message saying ¨i'm sorry i think we should be friends and i think i don't wanna be friends wit you, don't message me anymore¨ 

It's been 3 months since that, and to this day i've been feeling a little bad, i tried to move on by just trying to accept a girl that said she liked me and going on with her, but it just won't work.
I broke up with her, and i kinda reject every girl that tries to flirt or anything 'cause i for some reason just want to be around her

236,"Ok I’ll just jump in, a little long. Names are changed to keep everyone safe.

The story about how I met Jackie would give it away immediately, so I can’t mention it. However, what I can say is that I am nice to every girl that comes my way, regardless of whether I find them attractive or not... it helps my reputation.  I guess that’s just my Canadian values. Well I guess being a senior in high school the reputation shouldn’t matter anymore. Regardless, I keep my slate clean. As such, I was always nice to Jackie, and as I got to know her further and I began to catch feelings. If you asked anyone how she looked, she’s no supermodel, but comes close to it. On top of her looks, she’s really fun to be with. She has gone through two boyfriends since we met, and all this time she hasn’t had a clue that I have had a crush on her since we first hung out. I met one of her boyfriends- great guy, I held no ill-will. After they broke up, we kept hanging out more and more. Honestly it’s amazing, I love that I have the ability to make her laugh. Her smile is absolutely stunning. 

Anyway, recently Jackie has been showing signs of affection, such as a noticeable amount of more physical contact than normal, reaching out to hold my hand, as well as a few social media cues. However sometimes she’ll just call me phrases equivalent to “best friend”. Honestly my gut tells me I’m getting super-duper friend-zoned, but my gut is wrong a lot of the time, so I came here to ask how I should proceed. Honestly I would be happy staying in the spot I am now, but this type of crap keeps me up at night and I already don’t get enough sleep... please help and leave any thoughts, questions, or suggestions for what to ask or say to her. Thank you! 

Note: I’m a “nice” type of guy, however I never place the girl on a pedestal or look up as I honestly don’t have the time to be desperate or vie for attention. Also I like to think I take care of myself (working out regularly, eating relatively healthy for someone who’s 17), so that’s why I think I at least have decent odds.",29Nov2017,3

243,"I'm having some trouble with my manager. I'm currently in college, and I have a student job to help pay bills that financial aid and student loans won't cover.

When I applied for the job, I listed my availability verbally, electronically, and I also wrote it on a physical form. I made sure everything was documented, and that I have copies of everything. The problem was that the position I applied at has specific training hours, and during most of those times, I have classes. I also need to maintain a minimum of fifteen hours within those training hours. I talked to the student leads, and they assured me that I could come in on other days because training is flexible. I requested electronic documentation, and they accommodated. I filled out all the free time I had between classes. I literally have zero free time to study while at school.

Out of the blue, I was scheduled for a time where I specifically said that I was unavailable. I had to commute to school, and am unable to arrive at that time because the free campus bus doesn't run before my shift starts. To make matters worse, the scheduling manager cut off the day that the student leads (and they themselves) said that I could come in to work.

I emailed the manager, and they said, ""we will not be adjusting your availability.""

The schedule for the week of 11/27 was published on the 20th of November. However, in a previous email, they stated that ""With regards to time off: Please get in your requests for the week of 11/27 no later than midnight, 11/18. Failure to do so may result in us denying your request."" 

I had no idea that they would change my availability without my knowledge or consent. I assumed that they would schedule me for shifts based on the times that were documented and agreed upon. Since I didn't know that I would be working during a time that I was unavailable, there would be no way that I could request time off. I was under the impression that they would respect my availability.

I don't want to come off as inflammatory by bringing this up, and possibly losing my job, but I shouldn't have to work when I am unavailable and have clearly communicated and documented as such.

TL;DR Time off requests were due on 11/18, I didn't know that I would be scheduled during a time where it was documented that I was unavailable, so I didn't fill it out. Schedule was published on 11/20, I found out that I was working on that day, now manager refuses to remove me from that time.",29Nov2017,3

He his VERY smart for his age - he knows exactly what to say to push your buttons and he knows exactly when to say each thing he thinks of. He, on purpose, thinks up things he can say that will piss you off. Example: Just say brother has been messing with me all day. Every time he does something to make me mad or mess with me, I just ignore it. Each time, it gets worse but I say nothing. This goes on all day. At the end of the day I finally snap and tell him to leave me alone and to stop saying things like that about me. Then brother acts like I'm crazy!! He goes "" I don't know why you're so mad at me. You don't have to be so mean"", as if I didn't have a reason!!!!! He constantly talks shit to my mom and dad and neither of them do anything.

Back to where Dad gets home...Brother is automatically being rude because what Dad brought to eat wasn't good enough for him. He said he wanted a large french fry instead of a small. Dad proceeds to tell him that we almost couldn't afford this and that he should be thankful we have any food at all. Brother gets PISSED and acts like he's not going to eat because of the fry situation. He eventually ate his food. I'm going to stop rambling on.

One dog no longer goes to the bathroom outside, sometimes has trouble standing up straight. Cannot afford to take her to the vet, though she really ought to go. The other is dog is so high strung, always breaking out of his fenced off area, chewing up my sons toys, making the nice furniture his personal grooming station and/or bathroom, barking at the voice and occupational therapists that visit my 2 year old a combined 4x a week. It's embarrassing to say the least, and I take my own anti anxiety medication to keep myself from having panic attacks when the dogs set me off. I've been taking anti depressants for a few months now, too. 

They're cute dogs when they're clean, but it's difficult to keep them clean, even when taking them to a professional groomers regularly. 

My wife says I can find a new home for the sick one, but she wants no part in the process.

253,"Hi r/Advice,

I am currently in my final year in school and am struggling with my career path after college. I always thought I wanted to be a doctor, so I majored in Kinesiology and took a hard science curriculum. However, as I get closer to the end I realize the debt, stress, and work life balance associated with being a doctor isn't what I want. What I really want to do is work for a tech company in logistics or procurement (I know, very different). I've always enjoyed business but put it on the back burner because I thought I could accept the lifestyle of a doctor.  

I am currently struggling with wether or not to finish my undergraduate degree in Kinesiology and attend a master program in business (Master of Management) that reinforces business fundamentals and helps you get hired. The other option is to change my major in my final semester to Supply Chain Management and be at my undergraduate institution for an additional year. The Masters degree would cost me $53,000 while staying at my undergrad for an additional year would cost me about $35,000. 

Is there any advice you can offer? ",29Nov2017,2

I have a job opportunity that could change my life for the better, but I have to pay for a class to get a state license in order to sale insurance. I asked my mother if she could help me out and that I would pay it back (it's $170 for the class but you have to pay by credit card and I have no credit). When I explained the details to her she didn't really say much but quickly changed the subject. I would ask my dad as well but he's do the same thing as my mom. I hardly ask my parents for money and this is the reason why. When my older sister asks for money they don't hesitate to give it to her. My sister's working,  she's a CNA at children's hospital. She just struggles with money every now and then since her husband isn't working, isn't looking for work. When it comes to school they don't hesitate I pay for my books but I'm only going to college because that's what every wants me to be. When it's something I want to do that will help me financially I get no support whatsoever. Even as a child I never really received support from my parents. How do I deal with this while I still love at home?

Side Note: if I didnt get this support from this then I will continue to job hunt elsewhere so I can pay for the class myself without them. ",29Nov2017,3
255,"I am currently on holiday with my girlfriend to meet her family. I am white mid 20s and she is SEA same age. We met in my country of origin so she speaks both English and her native countries language.

Her country is awesome, her family are so welcoming, friendly and awesome. Her mother and ""sister"" do not speak English but her father does so we talk and get along fine. I have been learning as much of her native language as possible so I can try contribute (and impress) as much as I can.

The issue is when we go out and meet her friends. She is from a well off family and in her country, the rich socialise with the rich and the poor socialise with the poor. All her friends went to international highschools and have studied abroad so they all speak the native language as well as English however EVERYTIME we go out with her friends they ALL speak the native language almost exclusively which completely excludes me from conversations. I say hi, how are you in their native language upon meeting them every time out of respect and to show I am trying however that's as far as It goes. From then on it's all another language which I cannot communicate in. I occaisonally get a very vague update on the conversation from my girlfriend every 10 minutes or so but i literally have no input and just ens up sitting there having drink after drink cause what else can I Do? I try to initiate some conversations which I'll get one or two replies in English but then as soon as someone says something in the native language, it's back to me sipping on drinks and counting bricks. They have the ability to have conversations in English however it never happens.

I told my girlfriend this however she insists it's because They are embarrassed about their English speaking accent.

Any advice on what i should do? What else i should say?

I've only started talking to her recently, on Snapchat and IRL.
We've got a kinda - uh, a specific sense of humour and normally we tell each other to ""fuck off"" and give each other death stares lmao. 
She laughs at some stuff I say, plays with her hair when I talk to her and puts her fingers on her chin. I try to play it cool when I'm around her.

Honesty I feel like it's the first time I've ever felt something close to love. Never had a proper GF before in my life.

Good things that have happened:
- she seems to get quieter talking to me
- twirls her hair when it's straight down when she talks to me
- smiles a lot when she talks to me

Bad things that have happened:
- called to her in one of our lessons, turns around going ""what?!?""
- i texted her too much one night. I think this has put her off.
- she's stopped using emojis in our convos 😂😂😂

268,"Went to a relative's (19 years old) trailer. Instantly hit by a really bad smell. Super unclean filth everywhere. Dirt clothes piled high, etc. Two kids who are not hers were running around. A puppy pooped on the floor and she just yelled at them to clean it up (they are 2 and 6 respectively). She didn't make any effort to teach or help them. Just threw them some wipes and told them to scoop it up with their bare hands. Afterwards she didn't ask them to wash their hands or clean them. They didn't disinfect the carpet. The dogs also peed but since it wasn't a solid she just let it soak through the carpet. One of the kids started spraying a cleaning solution at a cat and I politely asked the kid to stop and my relative got annoyed at me. I'm like, that's bad for the kitten and what are you teaching the kids??  I asked where the parents were and she said that ""they left for a week"". When I asked where, she said she doesn't know and they just left the kids behind and she lives with them so she ended up watching them. Just sounds super shady. My relative also isn't a very good caretaker (which she should learn soon since she's about to have a kid of her own). We went to the park in separate vehicles. She wanted the 2 year old to ride with her because they had a car seat. Ok, fair enough. I notice, however, the car seat was cracked and covered in dirty clothing but I figured she'll move everything out of the way and maybe it just looks bad. So we head to the park and I'm driving behind her and I noticed the kid was crawling all over the seat, standing, etc. After we got to the park, I confronted her about it and she said, and I quote, ""The car seat is for the cops."" Wtf?!?!? This doesn't sound safe at all! 

Now, I'm not a lawyer, cop, social worker or policeman so please correct me if I'm wrong because I admit I don't know better, but the whole situation seems... off. The parents just vanishing for a week, my relative stuck babysitting them when she doesn't seem to know what she's doing... 


Also, even if it's grounds to call CPS, should I bother? I can't see why this would change anything. Maybe I'm ignorant and stupid but what if the parents get back? What if they pretend to be on their best behavior in front of the case worker? In fact, does the state even have resources? It's a small town of 2000 people in the middle of nowhere. Why would anyone bother? I mean, I wish they would, but I can't see that happening. Or am I wrong? I want to be wrong.

About two days ago I started coming down with a bad bug, I began to sweat and vomit. I immediately let my team know that I was very sick and I needed to have a 7 hour shift covered for Wednesday (Which is now, today) . Long story short, no one was able to pick up my shift.  

I called the manager in charge for my shift and asked him if he would be okay without me, since I am still vomiting and have a rather high fever (103 F, 39.4 C). He said that he was also feeling ill and that if I did not come in he was going to be the only one running the shop and he could not handle that.

273,"Well... I'm looking for reasons to stay obviously or else I wouldn't be writing this. My pride and I guess stubbornness and anger wants me to leave... and the part that doesn't trust him wants to leave.  Here's the situation: 

In July we had an argument and in his eyes we had broken up.  I was pissed at him but I hadn't thought we were done. He ended up calling his ex before me for I don't know what reason. He says he felt like he had to apologize to her and talk and I honestly don't know what else conversation they had for half an hour. He ended up telling me this but he also told he had called her back in may for her birthday.

That I didn't know either.  She texted him one night asking if he was awake and that she was bored. She wanted to talk. He said he ended up calling her to say that he couldn't be that guy for her (of course I don't believe him that that's what the conversation was).  He also deleted one or two of the texts. Which I can't remember how I found out but he initially tried to lie about that too.  He admitted to lying about that too.

Conversation comes about that he will not talk to her anymore. Especially because he lied to me about her and tried to hide a few things.

November, she messages him online and they talk. She doesn't respond or something at one point and he says her name to egg on the conversation.    He tells me about this the next day.  When we argue I bring this up as he kept wanting to talk to her or else he would have just left the convo when it faded. 

I'm not understanding the part of why he would want to talk to her.  I don't like it obviously, I would rather date someone who liked me enough to not give a crap on whether or not they speak to their ex.

Anyway, so I'm set on breaking up. To me all these events lead to me not knowing how he really feels or felt about her. He may have felt something before and just over time it went anyway and I would never know by now. I don't know his mentality behind talking to her recently after he said he wouldn't and after he lied about her. In my mind he still has an attachment to her small as it may be because the other choice in all these situations would have been not to talk to her. 

I'm aware that it's already a seemingly bad relationship. He lied and I don't trust him. Otherwise he's a decent guy with anger problems and I'm an all too independent person who wants to do my own thing half the time. I don't know.

**tl;dr:** advisor tells me I have a choice of project, but really doesn't let me choose because he's too busy (but not too busy for other students), so I've spent 2.5 years being ""patient"" and working on small projects that are far away from my interest. Also am the only student working alone in the lab, and no group project is willing to let me join, and labmates have never been willing to talk to me. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I'm 5 semesters into my MS/PhD. The first day I moved to the new city, alone, 2.5 years ago, my advisor told me not to come in the first week because he was busy. (He knew I planned to arrive then, but only emailed me a few hours after my plane landed.) Weird, but ok. Eventually we met, and he told me I could start exploring a project (that he described to me), and then we'd talk again in a month to check in and figure things out from there, with the strong implication that we would find something mutually beneficial and he would respect my input. 

A month later, after exploring and doing experiments (and when all the other labs in the dept found their students for the MS), I told him I wasn't really interested in the first project and I'd like to do something else, and he told me to ""be patient,"" and focus, just keep exploring it, and suggested specific experiments. Every two weeks after that (when we regularly met) I asked if I could switch projects, and he did not agree or disagree. Finally, a year in, he told me to just continue exploring current project but I wouldn't have to write my masters thesis on it, we would find something else. For context, most people in the lab work on team projects, and my project was one of few solo projects. In addition, my desk was in another group's office. Add that to me being on the quieter side, and not a heavy drinker, and one falling-out with a popular group member after she threatened me in lab a year in (I wish so much that I had just laid down rather than standing up for myself and my sanity), and today I am entirely isolated from/ignored by other people in the group. 

One year later, story on repeat, advisor made me submit my masters thesis on the first project, having given me no other options. He again gave me an ""option"" for my PhD project, to join one of two teams, but again decided for me and told me to explore a specific sub-part of the project alone (as in, not part of the team, including building my own setup). I've asked and argued and begged (with tears :( ) to join another project going on in the group, and he just ignores it. **If I complain or discuss this directly with him, which I have, he gets irritated and says he's doing as much as he can for me, that he's given me plenty of opportunities.** --To be fair, 1.5 years into things, he did finally suggest off-the-cuff that I could join a specific project and I tried, and did experiments to help, and got some good and helpful results, but the person in charge strong-armed me out of the project, telling me everything I did wasn't useful, and refusing to keep me in the loop for what's going on - since he's done with classes and working hard to finish his thesis, and I'm only researching part-time in between classes, that cut me out entirely. I've swallowed every ounce of pride I ever had and have asked every semi-friendly person in the lab directly if I could join their projects, and they basically all walk away/ignore me/don't respond/""forget"" I asked (they've done this since I started asking, which was 2 months after I arrived). I've still asked some of them multiple times. New students have no problem joining other projects, and always my advisor does the matchmaking for them to get them started, while he's still ""too busy"" for me. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most people in the group are working on the larger team projects, so my advisor has a reputation for being a good, productive advisor because students typically support each other, and publish a lot with a lot of authors. So, when I went to the administration, and a student support group, for help, they told me to just work it out with him, with the implication that I'm blowing things way out of proportion. 

He has given me good advice on details of my research, and I appreciate that, but he will not allow me to switch topics or join another project, no matter what I do or say. This directly hurts my research, since I'm not working on something I'm passionate about, and since most people in the group can ask other group members for advice any day of the week, but I can only ask him, for 30 min every 2 weeks (if he's not traveling).

277,"Stopped for a second to talk to a co worker. co worker was done with all of his work, I was done with mine. talk for maybe a minute, boss comes up (who just got done taking one of his  4 or 5 paid smoke breaks of the day) and tells me to stop standing around. now usually this guy is a really cool guy, never had a problem with him. today though his manager was in the office and im guessing he got his ass chewed out for something or other (probably because he goes on break 5 minutes early everyday, hes the first one on break, last one off it).

 I reply (jokingly but truthfully) ""ok ill just go stand around and do nothing in my area"". I get all of my work done in a timely fashion, he knows this. I spend maybe 6 hours out of a 10 hour day actually doing anything because I stay on top of things. he starts talking about how he has extra work I could do, and I tell him im not doing someone elses job on top of mine. he goes ""youre technically obligated to do this other job cause its part of your job description"" I say ""uhuh""  he then says ""and if you dont like it go home. dead serious."" 

this kinda shocked me cause, being the hard worker I am, no one ever has a problem with me. I basically play manager all day because out of desperation we hire some people who just aren't that bright. they need help with stuff and since the boss is out of the office 80% of the time (smoke breaks or talking with other managers) they come to me cause they can find me. when I need my boss to do something or I ask him to talk to someone for me, its brushed off. 

 we've been short staffed for around a month, we should have 4 people working that particular job and currently have 2 there. we hire one guy another quits, its an endless cycle. This place ever since I started 5 months ago has been short staffed and have gone through around 20-25 employees during that 5 month period. 4 months ago I would have jumped at the opportunity to do something else besides doing nothing, but not anymore. I even spent 2 months doing a different job and my current one literally running around the place to get everything done. ive been given the name ""laps"" by my co workers cause they thought it was funny I was literally running circles around the place.

 its their own fault for being understaffed, and as the saying goes, hard work is only rewarded with more work, and more specifically to this place, if you get injured you get promoted. hurt your back? congrats youre the new manager. ""break both ankles with an electric pallet jack? hello new assistant manager!"" these are not exaggerations either. my boss got the position because the previous manager just stopped showing up to work due to a drinking problem and a divorce. he came back but was demoted so my boss kept the position. no one is promoted because they are good at their job. its only out of necessity and raises are regulated, not earned. I was being payed 50 cents more than the people working the job he wanted me to do, but everyone got bumped up to my pay because we couldn't keep enough people around, and apparently still cant.

SO, all that being said, im seriously considering just leaving for the rest of the day after lunch. I plan on putting my 2 weeks in in a month or 2 (staying here only to save up enough for first last and security for an apartment with my gf and all the other stuff like furniture that we'd need for it). I am under appreciated for the work I put in and apparently now im getting yelled at for taking a minute to talk to a coworker, even though he full and well knows I could leave half way through the day come in the next and catch up in an hour or 2. I get hes obligated as a boss to discourage me from standing around, but telling me to leave the first time im ever yelled at after 5 months of picking up everyone elses slack is way over the top.

288,"This feels like a rant so I apologize in advance. Using a throwaway as it's complicated.

More than a twelve years ago, a business partner and I went on to make a software start-up. We ended up making a reasonable successful product that got a surprising amount of interest. He had different plans and managed to cut me out of the business. I was bitter but after about a year of reflecting I decided it wasn't worth being angry about anymore.

I transitioned to a dev job at a specialized company and did well. As the company grew, it accumulated more and more people and ended up running into crazy management issues. With management problems and major work burnout, I got out of there with a crazy idea to retry creating another software start-up. It's been a dream job since I got the taste of it.

About a year ago all the paperwork was set. I had savings to keep me going for a year and a few months plus additional income from my girlfriend who wanted to support the business. I wanted to work alone, largely because of the above reasons.

I made a MVP to showcase the software but failed to get any real interest. Software is a lot different than what it was twelve years ago. Without being detailed about it, it has been an uphill battle to gain any traction.
So I improved the product, I finally got it to a functional 'beta', but it wasn't getting much interest.

About four weeks ago my girlfriend came home in tears. Her company recently hired a new CEO, who promptly cut her entire office building.

The choice seemed obvious, I didn't have enough savings to support both of us and the company and the product was still not catching on. So I halt the start-up and decided to get back into the industry as a normal developer.

I've acted like I shrugged it off but I'm having problems adjusting. I'm still pretty internally upset that it didn't work out and I have a million 'what ifs' I have been asking myself. A lot of close friends bring it up, ""Oh if only you did this, that would have been successful."" 

I realize I could start up another idea but this feels like a pretty devastating hit to me. I gave it a year of hard work, I made a decent, even if a little flawed product, and I feel like I took a real step towards my dream job. Now it feels like I am a dozen steps back and in the grind I was trying to get out of.

Has anyone else run into this? What did you do? ",29Nov2017,2
289,"So, everyone is a narcissist in my belief. The world revolves around each of us because each of us are only involved in their own lives and may think about the lives of others, but only for a minute period of time. Me, I'm no exception. That doesn't make me a narcissist. What makes me a narcissist is that I believe that I'm special and different from the rest of the ""sheep."" Makes me sound emo or goth. I believe that I'm special because I don't think like most of the high schoolers around me. I still have a cold side to me and can be terribly cruel when around groups (typical of a high schooler), but I also think that I have a different level of political correctness. The girls and dudes in my high school french class are easily offendable, and I am not really. I just kind of refer to all of them as the same person and don't think of racist jokes, just stupid jokes that are accidentally racist. I swear, it's like magic. To give an example, we joke around a lot. This muslim girl in my class stood up to go sharpen her pencil, and tripped and almost fell down. Madame said ""Don't kill youself. I don't know the paperwork for that."" And we all laughed, and one girl pointed out, ""I saw the paperwork for that, it's over in the corner!"" So Madame went over to the corner and looked through it. ""It doesn't cover deaths, though. It covers: Fire, Bomb Threats, Acts of Terrorism, First Aid, and Field Trip Emergencies"" and I said ""It could probably be listed under acts of terrorism."" I just got glares from people and didn't figure it out for a few minutes. That's a pretty prime example of how it works. So because of this, I think that I'm different and above even the anti-racist stuff because I just simply disregard cultural differences until brought up into conversation. This is why I could be a narcissist. I also consider myself to be the best at french in my class.

298,"I moved in with a male and female in August. They were friends previously. I knew the girl from an Internet group. 

The girl and I get on quite well I think. However the guy is driving me crazy and I want him to move out.

It started off with the fact the female flatmate and I would always leave dirty plates by the sink and wash them the next day/put them in the dishwasher the next morning - if we had our dinner very late/friends over. If he ate with us, he would also do this. Even though the other female flatmate was the one who typically cooks. Or if we (female flatmate and I) had breakfast, we wouldn't scrape our plates and pans and wash them, but deal with them when we got home.

Otherwise the female flatmate and I were the only ones cleaning the house. Like actually cleaning surfaces, the bathrooms, hoovering, etc.

All this guy would do is dishes, occasionally.  

We would do his dishes without a thought, he would 50% of the time do ours if we left them out. We wished he would clean the communal areas a bit more but it wasn't a big deal at first, especially because he would do something. 

The guy works from home. He is home all day. So having to do our plates we left from breakfast drove him mad. 

We would also leave pans to soak in the sink if we had made a fatty meal or burned anything etc. NOT ALWAYS, but maybe 2,3x per week.

He decided to stop cleaning any of our dishes and decided to only clean his own. Which could be fair enough but he still left the kitchen messy and wouldn't always clean his dishes, and still wasn't cleaning any communal areas.

I asked him to start cleaning the bathroom that we all use and he started telling me about his idea to start using the gym more so he didn't have to. He always just says 'I won't use it anymore' when I ask him to clean, then once I or the other female flatmate have cleaned it, he starts using it again until it is messy - then doesn't clean. And it falls on us.

He wouldn't even load or unload the dishwasher, he would just wash his dishes by hand when he used them. And would often forget some that we would clean up.

He then started taking our dirty dishes and leaving them in clean areas. Like by our makeup. Keep in mind, dishes would never be there for more than 24 hours. He would move things soaking in the sink onto sufaces we had cleaned or into rooms we had cleaned. Making twice as much mess.

This went on for 3 months. He didn't clean anything, didn't socialise with us, kept complaining its like there was a party every night (which wasn't the case). Sometimes my boyfriend came over and my female flatmate, boyfriend and I would have dinner.

We finally confronted him and I asked him had he ever cleaned the livingroom, bathroom or communal area once since we moved in. He said he wiped the bathroom floor last month.

That is it.

Then went on saying it was unlivable and there should never be anything in the sink. He had taken photos etc.

By this time I felt resentful that I had been cleaning up his beard hair and general mess for months and he was complaining about having to put mugs into the dishwasher.

We set up a cleaning rota because his focus was on dishes, but I said it was rich from a man who admits he literally hasn't cleaned anything else in the house. Ever.  Yet keeps his room immaculate. 

I said it was unreasonable to expect working people to always clean up before they leave or for there never to be food in the sink ever. Also he often leaves his own spagetti and food there. Which I clean up and never complained about until he started complaining about us.

The thing is, the girl and I didn't mind having to clean up after other people so long as we felt everyone was cleaning. 

Anyway, we sorted out a cleaning rota and promised to make sure we don't leave our dishes overnight and try to not leave anything out in the morning.

The girl and I cleaned every part of the house and did a deep clean of everything so it should not have been hard for him to start pulling is weight and we wanted to show him how things were cleaned properly as our mothers said 'maybe he doesn't know how'.

On this cleaning rota it had all the chores. 

He did none of them, he added a task 'descale kettle', then ticked it.

That was it for over a week.

Then he said 'clean bathroom' but it was still vile. The surfaces were not cleaned properly - he had just wiped around things, and only cleaned some of them. Didn't clean the bath. It was just completely incompetent. 

And he can't take being told he is messy and doesn't know how to clean. He just said it was because we left dishes out he didn't clean before but he knows how. So now the flatmate and I are being hypervigilent, whilst he still isn't doing anything.

We are just cleaning up after him, redoing chores he ticks off.

I explained this and he just deflected and asked me to sort out the bills instead of him. I said 'no problem, I didn't ask you to do that - you assumed that responsibility - and dealing with the bills doesn't mean you don't have to clean'.

It got so bad I arranged for a cleaner. He didn't obviously.


I am sick that I am consumed with the idea of cleaning - I went into the house relaxed, understanding you have to clean up after other people if you live with each other.

However I feel this guy is messy and also judgmental at the same time and thinks he is super clean! It is driving me mad!

He also talks about women like shit, and I think he believes 'men deal with finances' and women clean communal areas. And he thinks he is a clean person because maybe because he doesn't understand what that means.

I want a flatmate who pulls their weight and isn't passive agressive, because it brings out the worst in me.

301,Hi so I sit with a group of people at lunch and there’s one girl that sits with us that I need advice on. We talk a lot when we are working and Sometimes I try and find her to even talk to her. I can’t stop thinking about her. Sometimes I even dream about her. Even tho she is married but the way she makes it sound her husbands is an As***** I feel so bad for her some days she comes into work and I can just see it that she sad :( it makes me sad to see her like that. She also has 2 kids with this man and she’s only ever been with 1 guy and that’s the guy she’s married to .. Now obviously I’m not expecting anything  to happen .. but we do joke about sex sometimes and sometimes I feel like she serious but it’s hard to tell. Something else I should probably mention is that she is 10 years older then me. I just want someone’s personal opinion on this. Thank you ,29Nov2017,2
304,"Before I get to the title let me go back. We basically met on a game, her and I wasn't that close but we did spend 2 years together in a group chat. Everything was fine and dandy till late after a year, the group and her argued a lot.

There was maybe 12 or more friends together so it made sense they disagreed but most of them started to really hate her and thus people who were more friendly with her would stop talking to her. That led to a big fight in which she left and no one spoke to her again. Then months later she messaged a few of the people in the group and one of them invited her back.

This time she was very sensitive and didn't last very long but developed a closer friendship with me. Through chats we talked days and hours about everything. Her sex life, families, jobs, games, flirting, etc. We got closer than ever and from there we can skip to the present.

&gt; Skip to the present

The third year she has mentioned the chat often maybe hoping I'd reinvite her to it again, but lately she's dropped the idea. Instead we're pretty good now, in fact, she told me she got a house a month ago and I joked around about her letting me come over and believe it or not she recently agreed and said I should come over when we were having a flirtatious conversation.

So I did, I drove to her state and went to her house. I got there at maybe 10AM. It was an apartment but still a place of her own. She opened up wearing her sexy sleepwear she would always tease me over chats with. No bra with her tank. She told me she was flat but she wasn't that bad, her tits were fine, but her ass was so nice. I couldn't take my eyes off it as she walked in front of me.

Her apartment kind of was messy and had a bit of a bad smell but when she led me to her room it did smell pretty bad. I don't think she could tell because she sat on her bed trying to still be sexy. There were flies buzzing around and A LOT of roaches in her room. Which makes sense considering how many times she's mention being scared by one. I feel as though she was overreacting in the chat though because there were literally roaches on her bed or at least picture this.

&gt; Her covers weren't exactly fixed, which led me to believe she was under the covers before I got there, I noticed a few roaches crawling from under her covers onto her pillows.

It was kind of gross... but I didn't mind it much since I was with her in person. The only thing that did sort of bother me was a pile of old clothes she had in the corner. She told me she slept naked which is why she barely had anything on besides the tank and short shorts. I sort of imagined her pulling those out of her dirty pile of clothes considering the flies she kept waving off herself. I know she didn't smell though, she even told me she showered last night.

She ignored the bugs and pretended they weren't there so I did as well. It was about 2 hours in now and we were just talking, I did want to try to get out of the house at one point and go somewhere more romantic like out to eat, but she actually said she cooked. Then tried to brag that she can cook pretty well as if she wanted to impress me. It was chicken in the refrigerator and she warmed it up, she also had flies and roaches in the kitchen but she ignore them again. This time it was actually gross, because while she tried to keep me talking and interested, a few flies would fly on her food and she'd still be eating it.

So we stayed and after about 4 hours I stop noticing the smell. It was like it went away for me. Which I expected it to be with her, she then got all sexy again and walked back to her room saying she was going to change and I was free to visit if I wanted, I followed of course and had one last whiff of that smell as I entered her room but again it faded. She laughed, acted a bit more sexy since I followed and sat on her bed stripping off her shorts in front of me. And I was so turned on, I knew she was already hairy but her lips, her pussy lips looked pretty big. That I was actually surprised about, not only was those big, but her nipples were as well. I could see why she said she had no tits because the nipple covered a lot still she was so fucking hot to me. I took my clothes off too and she pulled me to her and said she was so very horny. So I put my head down and ate her out, she smelled a little fishy and tasted salty which was a really good taste for me. I kept going till she wanted me to put it in.

I've only had sex once and it was with a virgin as well. We didn't know what we were doing but I'd also hear from everyone pussy was so good, it was tight as if was pulling you in. This girl was loose... like very loose, it wasn't a problem but it wasn't pulling me in. It was press in, easy out. But besides that and her it was so good. There was times she'd ride me and we'd laugh at the queefs but it was, to be honest; despite how quirky she was I loved her and the sex. It felt great to be inside and kiss and love her.

Everything went well and when she went to sleep I cleaned a bit, which she noticed, and was quiet about which means she's bothered a bit. I left a little while after and she seems to act like she regretted the whole thing.

Her old friends seem to be brought back up by her and they seem to feel she's just a self-centered person who complains too much. I don't see that in her, but I do see how she's not very interested in what I have to say, most of everything I say returns to being about her. She gives advice with herself still talking about herself. I love hearing about her but I just seem to feel something lately that tells me she isn't that interested with me. Even when I try to flirt she shuts it down or seems to brag on how sexy she's being but if I get horny over it, change the topic. I don't know.

Anyone know how to further online relationships? Despite the sex we can only still talk through chats or games. She also only seemed to invite me over because she was horny one night and told me she wanted me then. Rarely will she message me and if I message her she does seem a bit annoyed and I know even know she's not really responding because I said something dumb and she's lost interest in the conversation. What do I do?

311,"I’m seeking advice about my BIL and my wife agreed that it would be smart to post and see what you all think. Sorry in advance for how long this is.

&amp;nbsp;


Background: My BIL is 20 and in college. From what I’ve seen, growing up he has always been pushed to do everything, his homework, extracurriculars, applying for colleges, etc. by MIL. If not, he wouldn’t ever get anything done. For example, if he was doing calculus HW he would just sit there (for hours if it came to it) if he didn’t understand it and do nothing until MIL would kick him into gear/help him with it. If it were up to him he’d just sit around and play video games all day. Basically, he is EXTREMELY lazy.
An aside: MIL is mostly in charge of cooking/cleaning and such. Therefore BIL’s meals were always prepared ahead of time and he’d just be summoned from playing his games to eat, then he’d proceed to put his plate away then continue playing his games while either MIL or my wife (before she moved to college) would take care of cleaning. He basically grew up with no chores. On top of that, when it came to his games and things he was always just given them. Not to say that they are wealthy but when it comes to gaming stuff things like a $600 video card would be bought for him so he could play a game at higher settings on his computer. I mention this example not to say that he is spoiled rotten but to bring to light that whenever he wanted something it would be bought for him and that he’s never earned or bought anything for himself or has had a part-time job. 

&amp;nbsp;


Somehow he made it into a very good school and currently, doesn’t have any loans out and his parents are paying for everything out of pocket that his scholarships don’t cover like food, rent, etc. Honestly, he has shown that he doesn’t appreciate this at all in some of his actions I will explain later and which leads to the fact that he has no concept of the value of money. For example, he and my wife were talking about her new and first vehicle she bought. He asked how much her car cost and she let him know her vehicle runs in the upper 30k range. His reaction was “That’s not that expensive” and when she pressed why he thought that, he said because there are 100k cars out there… He definitely doesn’t appreciate the sacrifices his parents are making financially for him to attend school.

&amp;nbsp;


**Now to the problem.** He has NOT been doing well in school at all. He wanted to be an engineer but has been failing/dropping all intro engineering courses. He took calculus in HS and in college he barely passed Pre-calc and had to drop calc 1 once and failed it the second time, effectively dropping him out of engineering. The way he failed calc 1 the second time was he wanted to make food… at 6:30pm before a 7pm exam (where they close the doors after it starts)… during the summer when the buses run on a limited schedule (about once an hour). Of course, he missed the exam and couldn’t retake it. We advised him to email the professor/TA right away. Now let me back up a little and say that I can almost guarantee the reason he was doing so poorly in school (calc was just one example, he had to drop several other classes too) was because he wasted so much time dicking around on neogaf (which was always his distraction when doing HS work)and played video games. The 500GB hard drive on his laptop was literally AT CAPACITY with video games.

&amp;nbsp;


This is where things get wild, he stopped answering calls/texts from EVERYONE in his family after he didn’t show up for that calculus test. For a week this went on. We started to get concerned so my wife and I made the 2 hour drive and got to campus right when one of his electives (i.e. easy class) was finishing to pick him up for lunch/making sure he was ok/talking to him about what happened with his calculus exam and he wasn’t there. We called and of course we got no answer from him. We then went to his apartment it was luckily unlocked and we knocked on his bedroom door. He looked like he had just woken up, at 2pm. He hadn’t been to class for a week. NONE of them, not even the others because of calculus. It was beyond ridiculous. We had a stern talking to him and during that talk he sheepishly admitted that he liked being able to live on his own and have his parents paying for it all. Basically he’s living like an “adult” but with no responsibilities including not caring about school. We ended up taking his smartphone and laptop and got him a flip phone and basic tablet to do school work. At the time there was a chance he could salvage his calc grade if he worked hard enough because they were allowed to drop their lowest test grade. Of course at the end of the semester he failed the class. We’ve had plenty of talks with him about how important it is to do well in school so you can set up a good future for yourself and he will just sit there with his eyes closed. I’ve asked him several times what he wants to do after college just in general (not asking for specifics or requesting a full-fledged plan) and his answer (if he answers at all) is “I don’t know.” I’ve even asked him if he wants a job after college and he doesn’t really answer or know how to answer that question.

&amp;nbsp;


He ended up changing his major and went to see a school therapist to see if there was any medical reason for his performance and see if he can get a medical leave. He was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety and was given a prescription. He stated before his initial appointment that he basically wanted a magic pill that will make everything better without actually having to do any work to get better. Due to this he is able to just take two classes per semester for a year to ease the load.
Currently with his two class load he is passing because… he’s only taking two classes. He recently asked MIL if he could just take two classes per semester for the rest of college. She of course said that’s not feasible. MIL and FIL would be paying for him to be in school/rent/food for ten years at that rate. He also recently asked for them to buy him a car and MIL said they would if he got a part time job to cover his own gas and insurance and he said he would but he hasn’t even started to look for one. When pressed this past week during Thanksgiving about if he started to look for a part-time job and what his plan was to get back to taking a full course load he kept shutting her down by just saying “stop talking about that stuff.”  It just seems like he’s not even trying to improve his situation at all. 

&amp;nbsp;


MIL asked me what else they can do. They would like to be able to retire eventually and don’t want to be taking care of BIL for the rest of their lives. The way things are going now, they don’t see him doing well in school when he gets a full work load again and if that doesn’t work out, he doesn’t seem to want to get a job either. I suggested that maybe they can pay his rent and tuition but he should get a job to help cover groceries/learn the value of a dollar by working and MIL said he’d probably just end up not eating if he had to work for it.

&amp;nbsp;


Reddit, what else can be done? Have you or someone close to you been like this and made it out ok? What advice do you have for a parent that is dealing with a child with no motivation to better themselves and become independent?

&amp;nbsp;


**TLDR:** BIL is lazy and not doing well in college; was diagnosed with depression but doesn't seem to be working on improving things. He wants to live on his own while his parents pay for everything and is unmotivated to do anything and is seems to be unwilling to even look for a part time job. What can MIL do short of cutting him off?

316,"All right, guys! I'll do my best to try explain to you guys what is going on. I'm a 25 years old white male living in a South American country. I'm studying at one of the best universities in South America and I don't have to pay one cent for this education (I get it for free), because I was such a good student in high school and did very well in my admission test. Thing is, even though I have a lot going on for me in this aspect of my life, something is terribly wrong with me.

I really am not sure what is going on with me. I go to the therapist every week and I've talked to three different psychiatrists that say there's absolutely nothing wrong with my health and no one seems to be able to tell why I'm so absolutely uneasy all the time. During the past seven seven years my situation has degenerated a lot. I'm more and more closed (""inside my self"") as a person and I can't create relationships with other people. It's gotten to the point where I haven't done anything other than going to the gym and doing my home work for the whole year. I feel really constrained in my possibilities right now. All of my dreams are slowly being destroyed by all of what's constraining me and I'm starting to lose all hope. I'm resisting this destruction with all of my strength, but I can't make it stop.

I feel like there's something holding me back and I can't tell what it is. My whole life has been one difficult challenge after the other, but I always found the strength to come at the other end as a winner. I think I'm in too deep this time, and I can't solve my way out of this. I've reached a stalemate. I can't change my situation by my usual means and I don't have the inspiration to come up with a solution. What's even more paradoxical is that the more I try to solve this difficult thing I'm living with, the more I suffer and am at risk.

I'm suffering from some unknown evil I can't fight and it is slowly destroying my mind and my hopes. I'm doing my best to defend myself, but it has been 7 long years that I've been using all of my strength. I've reached a point where I can tell you I can't hold much longer.",29Nov2017,2

321,"My friend, we’ll call her Sarah, has an emotionally abusive boyfriend that she stills sees and hooks up with from time to time. I can’t even count the number of times he’s called her “ratchet” “a dumb slut” or a “whore.” I constantly tell her that he’s no good and would make her life miserable if she ended up with him but she insists that they’re meant to be together and that he’s the one. On top of it, he’s very unattractive, overweight, and thinks he’s right about EVERYTHING (he even got into a fight with Sarah’s dad over some stupid shit). 

Let me make it clear that Sarah isn’t the brightest friend I have. She’s pretty irresponsible when it comes to her body (when she drinks she purposely blacks out so hard that she turns into another person) and doesn’t have very much common sense or depth to her personality. She still sucks her fingers at 20 years old, and just makes some stupid choices. Before you ask “well why are you two friends then?” She’s my sorority sister, we’re from the same high school/hometown and she’s very reliable. I know she would be there for me in a heartbeat and vice versa. 

Anyways, Sarah was with abusive boyfriend this past weekend when she visited his college for a football game. When we went to dinner before she left to see him, she asked me “...should I take my birth control before I see him or shouldn’t I?” I thought she was joking at first but..no. I questioned her on what she meant and she replied “Ya know, having his baby wouldn’t be the worst thing. I kind of want to have his child, like, I love him.” TF!? She’s a sophomore in college, has no money, her boyfriend is a dick, and she doesn’t believe in abortion. I talked her through how crazy that idea was and how her life would be completely changed forever. She wouldn’t be able to go out at all, she’d have to move back home etc. She agreed and that was the end of that conversation. I’m pretty sure that it went through one ear and out the other though. 

Before she saw him she decided to start taking her birth control again. It might have been around a month or so since she had last taken it. She’s never been good at taking it consistently, and she even, I believe, had a chemical pregnancy with the same abusive boyfriend last year. (She was choppy with taking her birth control at the time and she was late for her period so she took 2 tests that were both positive. She freaked out and then 3 days later she started a super heavy period). 

Anyways, she started taking BC pills again on Sunday. She continued taking them on Monday and Tuesday, but for some reason on Wednesday and Thursday, she skipped taking pills. On Friday they had unprotected sex and she then took one pill that night and then took one pill a day after that. They had unprotected sex Saturday and Sunday as well. 

The way I see it, they had three occasions of unprotected sex, and she was not taking her birth control even remotely correct. When we got lunch today she wouldn’t stop crying because she truly believes she could be pregnant. She couldn’t even touch her boobs because they were so sore, and she’s been craving pizza nonstop. 

I know my friend is stupid, lol, but I’m worried about her. She would be the WORST mom ever and it’s scary to me that she cares so little for her body that she continues to fuck it up and put herself at risk. I just don’t understand why. I really want to be there for her but I feel like most things go in one ear and out the other. What does one do?/Do you think she could be pregnant (again)? ",29Nov2017,2

I live in the Netherlands, not speaking dutch, so that doesn't really help me. I would say that i am a shy person, concerning initiating a conversation. With guys it is okay but i do have problems starting a conversation with a girl, as thoughts come into my head about: maybe she thinks i'm a creep, weird or whatever...
I do not have a problem to talk to a girl once the conversation has started.

It is not like i am not interested in girls, but the fear of getting rejected may actually be higher than an actual chance with that girl.

338,"I don't know what to do. I have been working at this job for over 6 years and I am just tired of it but feel trapped. I started when it was a few people and now it is hundreds. I have helped improve multiple departments but none of them are my own. I just feel like I have used up my usefulness here and don't have the caliber to keep up with the future of this job. Partly because I feel so alone here now. It is very team oriented but when you have bounced from team to team, you don't feel like you belong to any of them.   
So now I am a one man department, working with yet another team in another department for the past few months. This dept is engineering and I am not an engineer. So I often feel like the dumbest person in the room. I need clarification on lots of things. But here is one issue I face all the time, since I have been here so long, people expect me to know everything already. Which in turn, makes me want to ask things less, which gives me more anxiety about not knowing what I am doing. Having to report to 3 different people also doesn't help.  
Basically I just want to quit. I want a to take a couple months to just clear my head, focus on me, and not go to bed every night stressed and wake up anxious. And honestly, I don't think taking time off will help. Because the night before I go back the same feelings will bubble up. It has happened before. I called out sick a couple days last week just because I just didn't want to get out of bed. Am I depressed? Definitely. But it is because I feel tormented by this. If there was no one in my life, I would have quit and moved probably a while ago. But I don't have and SO or kids or anything like that. Here is what I get hung up on:  
  
-I have worked very hard and long grueling weeks over years to get to the salary I am in now. I fear throwing that away for the unknown.  
-My father is a very go-getter type and has been so proud of how far I got and would be very disappointed that I am giving it up. Not to mention that I wouldn't hear the end of it if things don't go as planned.  
-Pride. There are dozens of people here that I do like and have worked for me and I have helped them get to where they are. It hurts to think that they will now see me as a quitter.  
-Fear of the unknown. I also fear that I will quit and still feel this way. And that after a month or so, my mind still won't be right. I still won't be motivated. But mostly that I won't be able to even get a decent job that I am not just as miserable in. And by that I mean dreading going, not just dislike it (I've disliked jobs before, but that never made me dread going).  
  
It also doesn't help that I never got to finish my degree. I get anxious when people talk about where or what they got their degree in. I don't have plans of going back unless I hit the lottery. I can't justify the expenses at this point in life (I am 29). I just want to work somewhere where I feel I belong more. You would think I would here since almost everyone knows me but that is just not the case. I have at least a year of expenses saved so I would be fine financially. But I also don't want to drain it because I can't find a job. But the other part of me doesn't care, I would go be a cashier and make $12/hour and kill it. People tend to like working with me and I get along with all types. I just constantly go back and forth between this being a great and horrible idea.

I don't even do that much but I'm always tired. I always tell myself I'm going to bed early so that i can get up early and get work done but then i just opt to sleep for 10-12 hours instead and start the whole process over again the next day. Everyone i know is so much more active and productive. My little bro does classwork (highschool), concert band, jazz band, tennis, other clubs. My class mates at college take more units, do sports, and still find time to study all day at the library and i guess i just don't know whats wrong with me. I don't know why i can't be productive and capable like other people.

345,"Hey. So, I, an anxious highschool sophomore, asked out a girl that I've had a crush on for a while.

Here's the thing. From the way that I phrased it when I asked her out, I'm worried that it wasn't really that clear that I asked her out in hindsight. I only see her for a really short amount of time at school, and some of the time, she's with her like cheerleader looking kind of friend, which makes me kind of nervous (I'm like a solid 3), so I kind of back off. I don't really know why.

We've been trying to figure out a date (that has, again, never been called a date), and so far with both of the ideas that we've talked about, she has seemed interested to go, but then she texts me later with a reason why she can't go.

It could be nothing, I don't know, but for the past two days, its been seeming like she's really been hurrying out of the classroom and down the hall, so that I wouldn't be able to talk to her in person.

What I'm thinking is that at first, she thought I wasn't asking her out on a date, that I was just hanging out or something, but now she realized, and doesn't want any part of that, but doesn't want to hurt my feelings. I've been thinking about sending her a text that says something like, ""Hey, [Name]. I just wanted to ask, do you actually want to go on a date with me, or were you just trying to be nice? Because it kinda seems like you've been avoiding me.""

So, a little history: Our law school is always really cold, so I tend to double layer. Sometimes I’ll show up in four layers and I’ll still be very slightly cold. I also rarely sweat unless I’m exercising.

Today, I double layered as usual, but after my first class I noticed my hands were pretty wet with sweat, and my overall body temperature was too warm. I took off the double layers, and put on a thinner t-shirt, and still sweating. At this point my whole body was just warm, and my throat started tingling like I needed to throw up. 

I came home and took my socks off and put on a tank top and still sweating. I’ve eaten a soup, took Zicam, and might try to nap now..

Is this something I should be worried about? I’ve been having sleep problems, which is normal for law students at this stage, but no one else I know has this going on. I also had a friend who had a 24-hour bug (he claims he was never sick) but I don’t feel sick, just hands clammy.

I would like to gain quickly some gains in a good way. How do I do this? I started fitness about 7 months ago but I don’t know what I am doing? I just do random exercises. Can someone give tips? I don't know which sets/reps workout I should follow. Some friends say do 12-8-6 some say 10 x 10.. I don’t know. What is very good to eat after a workout? I have planned to eat rice with 300 grams tuna and eggs after each workout. Is this smart? How do I make fast progression with weights? In April I trained with dumbbells of 7/8 kilo. Now I do 10 reps of 10 kilo max and after that I can no longer. Is this normal? I would like to do full body. How should I do this? I work out 3 days a week. How many exercises should I do for 1 muscle group? Thanks for reading.,29Nov2017,1
350,"Not looking for medical advice.. just saying. ;)

Its just, do you think my boss would find it weird or look down on me for coloring my hair when i'm sick? I left early today, as i was dizzy, had nausea and was shaking a little. I have fainted a few dozen times in my life - doctors have tried various tests, couldnt find anything and have now given up. I faint maybe  once a year, and have these dizzy - nausea - shaking symptoms a few times a year. I just have to not move around a lot, or be able to sit, or best to lie down whenever i feel dizzy. Cant do that behind a cash register. 

So i'm not bed-ridden. it will probably affect me tomorrow and then be gone by friday. And i feel like i want to dye my hair. Right now its a faded turquoise, and i want to make it a natural brown. If anyone was curious. :P

So, do you think my boss will look down on me/be annoyed if i come to work on friday with newly dyed hair? :o

365,"okay, so I have a dilemma on my hands. Some background info: I'm currently a grade 12 student in Canada.


I want to drop physics, because I'm getting a lot lower than I had first anticipated. My mark is currently a 92, but it's going to drop probably below a 90 after a test I just did. I will be able to retake physics next semester. I know the mark isn't bad, but it won't be good enough for the programs I want to attend. (Waterloo biomed eng requires a 95, McGill needs a 95.5 for bioeng)

I'm pretty confident I can get a lot better physics mark next semester. Another reason I need a high physics mark is to carry my English mark, which has been around the 80-85 range from grade 9 till now.

Any advice on what I should do? Should I drop or not drop physics? 

TL;DR: need advice on whether or not I should drop a course and retake it the following semester

368,"Hi Reddit, I don’t really know who to turn to anymore. I’ve had the advice of friends and people in similar situations, but I actually want the help of total strangers for this one. I’ll make it brief as possible. 

My parents divorced young and it’s what it is. I know I never had a hard or rough child hood, but I always felt unwanted from my dad and his side of the family. I have 2 half sisters and a step mother. My mom always told me how my dad cares about my sisters more, but I’m a kid and to be honest I dismissed it. Every Christmas id get a book, and I’d watch my sisters open up everything they wanted. Meanwhile I’m running home to my mom after visiting my dad crying and she did the best she can to make me happy. Honestly, if it wasn’t for her I don’t even know, I’m off track here. My childhood was not rough by any means. I was never worried about food or lights, I’m honestly blessed. I just never had a dad who showed me he cares in that sense. If I was hurt, men don’t cry. I act out in school? Strict scolding. I get bullied? I do what he says and stand up for myself, get in trouble and I’m off to the barber getting my hair shaven off. 

Fast forward to this year. My dad has been calling me, we’re talking more things seem great. I think damn in his old age he’s finally showing me some respect as how far I’ve come. I’m in my twenties now, I have a great job I make good money, didn’t go to school but I’m independent and I’m doing well in my life. He offers to fly me and my girl to see him and the family, and I jump on it. It’s been a long time. I knew he was changing. We get there only to be put on the back burner the whole time, only to have it shoved in my face that I’m not important. Pictures of them all in the house, scarce pictures of me. Same pictures as my sisters husband of me. His password was even ilovemy2girls for Christ’s sake. Miserable few days, flying home I’m realizing maybe my mom was right. He didn’t talk to me, he didn’t acknowledge our presence he devoted 2 hours to me the whole trip and the rest to his daughters who he sees every month. 

Sunday night, days after thanksgiving amazing time with my mom and some close people around me. No call from my dads side, texts nothing. Forgot about it, go on Facebook and there’s a huge family reunion of my sisters husbands side, my fathers side and they’re having photo shoots having the time of their lives. Nothing about me, no texts, no offer if I wanted to fly up there (I’d pay it mind you) it’s like I’m a ghost. I’ve bottled it up for days now, I’m laying next to my girl who doesn’t even know how bad this is eating at me, but I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m disgusted by my last name having anything to do with my father, I’ve thought about it for years and I’m finally honoring my mother and her side and the people who actually cares and changing my last name. I don’t want to speak to them anymore even, if it’s all fake why bother to pretend we’re all close? Why should I try? I don’t care to have a relationship with them anymore, it hurts badly yes, but I’m a man now, the man my father told me to be. I’ve built myself up well, have a great future ahead, hopefully, and I just don’t know what to do, or even how to cope with being pushed out by all of them. It just has eaten at me for a few days. 

Thank you to anybody who takes the time out of their day to read this pathetic story. As I said, I have a great life, I had a great childhood just because I never got material things or the love from my dad doesn’t mean I had a rough childhood I am blessed and fortunate. Again, I appreciate you for taking time out of your lives for some stranger on the internet. ",29Nov2017,10

But recently, she told me that tried cocaine back in early october. I know she already smokes weed and likes to drink... but cocaine?! 
Im extremely worried about her because her father has been in and out jail for drug related charges, and her mother is so involved with herself that she seems to wear blinders when it comes to her children. K said she would do it (cocaine) again if presented the opportunity. I don't want her to become a drug addict, I've seen how it can year apart a person and hurt everybody around them. I don't think she understands how dangerous drugs can be.
Another thing that worries me is that she plans to loose her viginity to her ""cousin."" She calls him her cousin, but she also says he isn't her cousin.

397,"Hello. I'm finishing up my associates in life sciences from a community college at the end of this year. I took the required courses to be able to apply to a bachelor's degree in nursing program. As of the end of this semester, I am able to apply to the licensed vocational nurse program, associates degree in nursing program, and the bachelors degree in nursing program. I can only apply for these programs for the fall semester of 2018. So, I will have nothing to do during my spring 2018 semester. I've considered either to transfer to a university and work towards a bachelors of some sort while waiting to apply for the nursing programs or just work during this time period and study for the HESI exam (required test to apply to many nursing programs). The programs are very competitive to get into and transferring out would allow me to work towards a usable degree while I'm waiting to get accepted and in case I don't get accepted.

Based on your judgement, would it be better for me to transfer out and work towards another bachelors degree or work full-time and prepare for the HESI exam (I'm going to study for it regardless of which of these I choose). If I were to transfer out, I was considering to major in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. It's a big switch from a life sciences degree and might put me behind schedule but I've read that science degrees aren't very easy to get a job with. I took calculus 2, 3, and linear algebra a few years ago and found them very enjoyable. I also did some coding with python, java, and c++ and had a lot of fun learning those languages.

(They live together to raise my 17yr old brother, and because they've nowhere else to go).   She has no wealthy family to depend on and can't/won't look for a job that accommodates her.  She's still young enough that I think she could still have a fresh start if she could get medical help. 

Are there government (USA) programs that could help? Something else?  She has no income or insurance.  

Thanks in advance.",29Nov2017,1
401,"A girl and I have been talking where we both like each other for over a year now. We’ve said I love you’s, and talk to each other a lot. But things have changed and she has hurt me emotionally a lot recently but when I try to separate myself I just get sick to my stomach and want to run back to her. How do I get over this? We’ve had a period where we didn’t speak for months but then ran back to each other but I want this to end. Thank you for your help. ",29Nov2017,1

403,"Groundhog day. I feel like I'm trapped in the longest occurrence of Déjà vu that I've ever had. Normally I would have the feeling of Déjà vu once or twice every 6 or so months, maybe longer. But I started feeling it more and more and the 'episodes' if you'd call it that would last longer and longer. Right now I've been having the feeling of Déjà vu nonstop for 2 weeks and it's an incredibly strong sensation. Like every single move I make, think, say, see, hear or feel I've already experienced it a thousand times before. Not just as a familiarity but the actual exact same scenario. Not like ""Oh yeah, I've seen this episode before"" but more like ""wait a minute, I heard this exact same sequence of bird chirps outside my window when I woke up, I saw these same people at the market yesterday, I bumped into the man in the red had what feels like only an hour ago, my shoe came undone in this exact same spot yesterday, I dropped my drink right here when I got spooked by the train last week? Was is last week or Wednesday?."" I could go on and on. It just feels like this past week has been on repeat for years and years for me and I don't know how to break it. I've tried to do something spontaneous like drive to the city just to buy a hotdog from a vendor but our conversation that we have, a man I've never met before in my life, sounds too familiar like I've known him for decades and we have the same conversation every Friday. Is this dementia or have I just made it to the end of my life so to prolong it in the simulation they set the last 2 weeks of my life on repeat. I don't actually believe in the theory that ""we're all in a simulation"" this is just the weirdest thing I've ever experienced in my whole life and I'm not sure how to deal with it. How do you break a nonstop streak of Déjà vu? What is the thing I need to change to make the progress needed to get out? How many people's days do I need to make great before a date that I never had goes perfectly so I can move on? I think that's how that movie went at least. ",29Nov2017,0
404,"I graduated in may 2016 and decided to take a year off due to stress and financial issues. This year off was the best. No 6am alarms, no stress, just work and have fun with friends. However, this second year it hit me. I don't vision myself working a physical 12/hour job with no overtime the rest of my life.

I checked my local community college and class signups are due December 15. I'm thinking of taking two classes ( Accounting 201 and math 103) to get the hang of school again. Or should I wait until next semester? Have everything planned out; A full 15 credit schedule? I'll be able to talk to the counselors and see what classes I need to take for the accounting program.

 If I take the classes this semester, i'll have to take a hour long bus ride, but if I wait till next semester I will probably be able to save and buy a car.

What should i do? Thanks for reading this",29Nov2017,2
