1,"I'm a white male, 15, 5'9 and weigh around 134 pounds. I've always had problems with my heel bone. My heels actually bulge out a little bit in the back. What I mean by this is instead of being straight down below my ankle, there are big lumps of bone that push out, which is where my problems come from. If I do any sort of activity for around 6+ hours my heels just give out. I get extreme pain in the back and sides of my heels and forced to limp around everywhere for the next day or so. I really need advice if this sounds bad enough to see a doctor, or to just let my body grow and see if it goes away. Thanks.",22Jul2017,1
2,"So my brother's been letting me use his car because he's currently living in a state with good public transit and doesn't need it. But I lost his keys. I tried calling a locksmith, but they need him to be present while they're working on the car. This isn't really an option. I can get everywhere I *need* to go by walking so this isn't urgent, but I'm moving out at the end of the month and I'd like to take the car with me.

Also, if this takes off, and they do sell, and I make a business out of it and I start buying paintings to then resell them, is this legal? Is this frowned upon?

9,"So I'm in my early 20s, and I'm living at home.  I work part time, attend college as an animation major and have an internship at a animation studio ~45 minutes away from where I live.  

3 of my best friends have been living together for a little over a year now, and they (along with one of their girlfriends) have decided to move into a bigger house and invited me to move in with them.  

The house has 4 bedrooms and the rent is $700/month (split between five people, but doesn't include utilities). My main concern is my friend and his girlfriend breaking up, and then having to pick up the extra rent.  They haven't been dating for very long but they've known each other for a couple years.  

I don't mind living at home, I have a decent sized room and my mom doesn't really care what I do as long as I don't burn the house down.  I have a year left in school, and I can't help but feel like a huge loser because I still live with my mom.

10,My friends and I need to settle a debate. One of our friends is hanging out with us and is talking with us but has an earbud that he is actively listening to music with in one ear. He is talking to us. But the other 2 of us seem to think this is a social faux pas. And quite rude because it makes us subtly think he doesn't want to talk because of years of social conditioning to not talk to people with earbuds in. Who is right?,22Jul2017,3

Me being a friendly person accepted it thinking it may of been someone I have previously played with.
Yet they have never played a game I've played.

I've tried to make contact but to no success. And they have sent me nothing. They seem to play a mix of games, but most of the time they are playing a somewhat low-review VR roller-coaster game. (A shocking total of about 1,400 hours so far)

I finally found a curling iron that *sometimes* manages to curl *some* bits of hair. Now I've run into a new problem. The parts that do curl almost immediately get super knotted up. I think its has something to do with how unbelievably frizzy my hair is.

14,"About me:

Male. Late 20s. Have a car and full-time employment. Make small money on the side as a fiction writer for various magazines.

Cons:

- No friends. Haven't had any since age 14.
- Never had a girlfriend. Never been on a date. Never had sex.
- Suffer from crippling social anxiety, which I've come to accept as a permanent issue. Also have intense bouts of depression and paranoia. Afraid to speak on telephones because it's too personal and it feels like the listener can somehow intuit my thoughts (even though I know this is irrational).
- Live with mother.
- No formal education beyond high school.

16,"Tldr: have wanted to be a Navy SEAL since childhood and now thinking of possibly doing another career for a stable life and it's causing doubts.  What do I do

So I'm a 16M who's always held a strong determination to become a Navy Seal at one point in life. But now I'm doubting myself and beginning to believe maybe that I want a normal life, with a family and my own home, without the fear of death being at any moment. Maybe I want to do little things such as cooking with my future wife and making a garden at my home with a trampoline in the back. If I was a Navy SEAL then none of that is promised. My future kids could be left without a father out of the blue. One moment at home the next receiving a call to pack up and be on ship the next morning. I'm thinking now of the other possibilities I could have in life but not much suits what I would enjoy.

I want to be able to help others and have a meaning in life. I need the mental comfort that my life has a goal. The reason being a SEAL is comforting is that my life has meaning. I'll be doing something that will help others. Saving lives and making others possible. A selfless life. One that people will look back on and say he was a good man. But now I'm being a restless teenager doubting all I've ever known lol. I want to be my own person and live a long life with the comforts of it that make it fun. The selfish life. The life of worrying about myself and my family and that's all. I'd still help local programs and such but it wouldn't be saving people across the world in war zones. The selfish life wants to come home to a wife and watch Netflix while cooking some random meal I found on YouTube. Either life choice I make I will make the fullest of it. Life is too short for doing nothing. I have a mere 40-50 years of life left and want to have the best one I can. What do I do :/

17,"So, my friend that I've known for 3 years says a lot of things that make my other friends uncomfortable. He is kinda depressed (He's lied to me in the past so I don't know if i can believe him but anyways) We always talk in our friend group and ya know we're bro's. He will sometimes get mad at us and scream at the top of his bloody lungs. ""YOUR THE REASON I WANT TO K*** MYSELF"" then he just storms off. We told him multiple times he should go to therapy and/or a counselor but he doesn't listen. We just want the best for him plus we want to prevent that tragedy. Me and the other friends excluding him talk about what we should do and its just the therapy that he will not do. But on the other hand i feel that he is lying to me in some way. I don't feel that he is depressed nor has those thoughts of ending it. My friends have no clue of what to do. ",22Jul2017,2
18,"I finished all my coursework, achieved candidacy, did my research, and started writing my dissertation. I invested over 7 years of my life and accrued six figures in student loan debt. However, during the final year I floundered. I was diagnosed with depression and my marriage was in trouble. I dropped out. I broke off contact with my adviser and avoided contact with anyone associated with my program. My spouse and I separated, and I was in deep-deep trouble with debt collectors. I was getting back on my feet for a little while, but then I was abruptly laid off from my job. I became suicidal and had to move in with relatives (at age 37) to support and keep an eye on me.
That was three years ago. My finances are now in order, my divorce is almost final, and I feel like my mental health is in a good place. Last year, just the thought of reaching out to my adviser, or anyone else in my old department would cause a panic attack, which would take hours to subside. Now, I've reached out to my adviser, who dispelled my fears that I had permanently soured that relationship. My adviser is still just as supportive as ever.
So, does anyone have any advice for trying to re-enter my Ph.D program and finishing after 3 years absence?",22Jul2017,2
22,"So recently, I had broken up with my girlfriend. It was supposed to be a mutual thing, but some things just aren't right yet. I'm going through the transitional period, where my emotions are basically a huge roller coaster. I've been trying to recover from it and be as mature about this as possible, but it just feels like I go back in terms of recovery. I go back and forth between ""I'll wait for a response from you because I want to make things better"" to ""I just want to make things better, please give me a second chance.""

But that's not what I'm here for. I want to know if I'm in the wrong for wanting to make up for past mistakes that I've made. It's a lot of them too, 4 years worth. My girlfriend's put up a lot with me, let's make that clear. Whenever we've fought, we talked about it, at least in some form, and then made up and apologized. End of scene. But now, what happened before the breakup was this: I was forced to go to a beach by my mom because she wanted to go and didn't feel like leaving me alone, and if I were to be left alone, I wasn't going to eat that day, supposedly. But that's not the important part. I go to the beach with family only for the topic of work to come up because I have been unemployed up until now. I apply to places, I rarely ever get call backs, the whole thing. It was up to a point where I was being coerced to apply to a job or I basically lose everything. So later that night, I get home and I talk to my girlfriend about the beach. I had told her that I was either just playing on my Switch, 3DS or reading a manga I brought along with me. She then messages back with an annoyed expression and starts texting like she sounded like she was annoyed. I was already salty at the fact that I was forced to go because I knew the topic of work was going to come up. The last thing I needed was someone telling me that I should have made the best out of a bad situation in an annoyed tone. We get into a fight, and she says that she didn't mean to come off as annoyed, that she was upset that I didn't have fun at the beach. The fight started because I had told her to fuck off after her annoyed message because I did not want to see something like that. The next day, because I had turned down the work in favor of another place I was applying to, my mom had threatened to not leave anything for me to eat or any money for me to at least buy food with. So with me being angry about this, I just decide that fine, I guess I'm starving myself. I tell my girlfriend about this, and she just gets so upset that this is what I'm doing and that she felt like she couldn't even tell me how she was feeling. That was when the breakup started to happen. We were in a call on Discord up until 4 in the morning with her ranting and crying about how I've done nothing for this relationship except take and not give back. I've also spent the rest of the night crying with her, saying that I'll fix whatever it is that's wrong. She says she gives me a chance to fix things. That's not the case. I spend the rest of that week doing things to try and cheer her up. All of them have been met with some of the coldest responses I've ever heard. All of them met with her chewing me out about how these were things I should have been doing since the beginning of the relationship. We've been dating for 4 years, and it's only been the constant fighting ever since last year when I've had my mom constantly yelling at me to find a job because everyone she knows has been getting jobs the moment they apply. I was under so much stress that I've basically fallen out of doing sweet things. I became so much more concerned about my real life problems that I neglected my relationship problems. I tell this to my girlfriend and all she says was that stress is not an excuse for me to not do any regular boyfriend things like compliments, pet names, affection, etc. Did I need improvement on such things? Yes. Would I have been able to do them more if I was given a legitimate chance? Yes. She even said so herself that the only reason she gave me that chance that night was so I could stop crying. She's constantly saying that if she were to just respond normally like ""aww, that's sweet &lt;33"", it'd be letting me off easy for 4 years worth of mistakes. That night, I was scared of losing her because I had lost sight of the relationship. I still loved her. I was under so much stress and she knew this. She always tried to cheer me up, and there were times that it did work, but it never lasted long. She had basically said that night that I'll give you a chance, and by chance, I mean you decide how we break up. She was not going to be accepting any forms of affection from me anymore, no compliments, nothing. She was just there. She didn't want to be my girlfriend anymore, but she was just there. She didn't leave. She wanted me to pull the trigger on that. Either breakup on mutual terms or wait for the day that I mess up trying to make up for everything that I did. So we end up breaking up, and she says that we'll continue to be the best of friends though. Not what she's saying now. Come to learn last night that she doesn't even trust me as a best friend.

So I ask this now. I know that I've done so much wrong in the past, especially due to stress, but is my ex girlfriend right for being so cold to me in my attempts to try and make things right again because I was so stressed? Was she right to give me a chance only to then lie about it being a legitimate chance and to lie about being best friends still?",22Jul2017,2

26,"I chose to go into real estate. I figured I'll work as an assistant before I start off selling homes as an agent. After making some cold calls, I got a position at a top producing real estate team.

This is my first real job (I'm 20). I have never been in an office environment before. It's been about 1.5 months since I've been here, and it's been terrible so far.

First of all, I am someone who don't like to take things too seriously. I love giving nonsensical responses to everything, and my friends find me entertaining. At work, I am completely out of my element. I am very uptight, serious and act awkwardly. I'm always scared of saying the wrong things, which ironically results in me saying stupid things. I don't tell any jokes, and don't laugh at jokes other people tell. I stutter, A LOT. In other words, I act like someone with terrible social skills.

As a result of my terrible behavior at work, the agents on the team don't like me too much, and neither does the administrator. My boss (leader of the team) says he sees potential in me, and he doesn't wants me to leave. These days I sort of wish he would fire me.

On top of that, my job is actually quite complex. I'm supposed to make the agents on the team to use a CRM (customer relationship management) software. Nobody on the team except my boss wants to use it. Imagine this socially awkward guy in your office telling you to do something, you probably wouldn't take him seriously. I have not had success in making the team use the software, and my lack of success is also making my stressed out.

As a result, my motivation lately has been depleted. I read that social rejection is a big killer of motivation, and I think that is the primary reason I am slowly losing my motivation. I am doing NoFap and StopGaming, but recently I relapsed on both. I come home and I just want to lie on my bed and do absolutely nothing. I take 2 hour naps and I wake up feeling shitty.

Personally I am a self-motivated, entrepreneurial individual. I don't need other people giving me directions to do things. But it seems like spending time at the office environment is absolutely killing me.

I can leave my position if I wanted to, but then I'm giving up an opportunity of joining a top producing real estate team and being mentored under people with decades of experience. I also don't want to be a quitter by quitting so quickly just because I feel uncomfortable.

Nevertheless, I feel absolutely terrible. I need my motivation back ASAP. Advice welcome.",22Jul2017,2

31,"So I have an aunt and uncle that live in the beautiful nowhere-vile of Delaware, USA. My siblings and I are visiting for a week, and two days in and it's hell.

For context: my parents are not here, and I am an adult and raising my siblings. We're visiting many different family members but are staying at my aunt and uncle's.

**For starters: obnoxious playing of TV.** It started with tolerable things, like playing Fox News loudly until pretty late. Then it got worse. The sleeping situation is that we're all in the living room on the floor/couchbeds (my siblings and I) and there is also a TV in the room. They insist on watching TV there until 11-12 o'clock, and then again immediately at 7-8 AM. My little brother is 6. He can't be up that late.

The content of what they watch is awful, too. Again, first it was Fox News. Waking up to Trump screaming was a pain, but not awful. Then they started watching things like Futurama, which obviously has adult humour. That's really annoying. Then it became Game of Thrones. My siblings are between 6 and 13. They do not want or need to see that. I've asked them many times to stop and they pause it and play it again. To repeat: This is in the room we are sleeping in and it is late at night.

**Then there's my uncle staring at us.** It's unbelievably awkward when I wake up and he's just... there. On the couch, looking at me. My sisters hate it. Again, I've asked him to stop. He always goes back and then comes out again.

**And finally, the unsolicited comments about our weight.** I have a BMI of 21. I am nowhere near overweight, and neither are any of my siblings. My aunt has been telling the girls (again, the girls are between 8 and 13) endlessly about dieting, workouts, how much they weigh, how much I weigh, etc. She keeps trying to get us to go to the gym, sign up for fitness classes (keep in mind, we are here for a week.) She keeps telling us everything we eat is unhealthy and we're getting fat- it's weird and uncomfortable. I don't want my 13yo sister around this.

I don't know what to do. Home is 14 hours away, I don't have money for a hotel and I don't know how much longer I can take this. I've stayed with these relatives before but never with the kids, but they were much more normally behaved then- now I can't believe how selfish and aggravating they are. Really, GoT in front of a six year old? It creeps me the fuck out. What should I do?

34,"Hi so this might be a doozy.. also sorry for formatting I'm on mobile and also incredibly stressed out. 

So basically there were issues with our carpets when we moved out of our apartment. There was a bleach stain in the hallway caused by my roommate that we all witnessed her make (myself and other two housemates). She said before we moved out that she knew she would have to take responsibility for it. Turns out when it came time she tried to lie her way out of it by blaming me (because she hates me, she told the others girls exactly that). In the end she ended up taking responsibility.

We thought we moved on but fast forward to this week. My landlord send my security deposit to the girl I subletted from and I haven't been able to contact that girl to get my security deposit back (that's a whole thing in and of itself). The landlord said the carpet cleaning for the living room went well except one or two small stains that wouldn't come out but it wasn't a big deal. We all made stains on that carpet that we tried to clean. I personally had two tiny coffee stains because my dog stole an empty k-cup when I first moved in. However I spent a long time trying to get it out and it was almost unnoticeable by the time I moved out. Unlike tar my roommate has tracked into the living room after the beach one day. 

Anyway today the landlord tells me that my roommate is upset about the living room floor and decided she wants it to be replaced which would cost all 4 of us $1000-1500. She also sent my housemate a picture of said stains and guess what, they're HUGE. They look FRESH. They were not there before. But now the others have turned on me saying now it's my turn to take responsibility. I feel like my roommate is being vindictive and wants revenge. 

I'm also concerned on whether my landlord is allowed to try and charge us after the fact she already send my deposit with my itemized list of damages/deductions and it's been 21 days (this is the max limited allotted under CA law to send a security deposit back with deductions). 

I am so stressed and confused and really need any help I can get, especially in terms of my legal rights. Thank you. 

P.S. I am a sub letter so I know that technically any charges would actually go toward the master tenant but I am so confused on the legality of all this as we never filed paperwork with the landlord regarding my sublet (I filled it out but the master tenant never signed or sent it in) ",22Jul2017,1
35,"TLDR: Jobs that pay around $160k that aren't related to medicine? Few years of experience is fine. 


I'm nearly done completing the IGETC (gen ed) sequence at my local community college and it's time for me to start preparing for my major to transfer to a university. I enjoy computers and programming but it seems that companies are beginning to outsource tons of jobs which makes me anxious about job availability. I also find the pay a bit low. It's about $65k-$75k entry and I THINK it tops out at $110k. After taxes here in California, 65k becomes roughly 45k take home. I don't believe that is close enough at all to live comfortably in California, especially here where I live, Los Angeles. I know I could move to another state but I don't really have any desire to. 



I thought about going into medicine and becoming an anesthesiologist but I have no passion for it and I find it mundane. Also seems to be very competitive but the salary is definitely enticing so that path for me isn't completely off the table.


I'm interested in becoming an attorney as I believe it would give me the best shot at reaching my 160k goal and I am very passionate about law. However based on what I read online, including reddit, many people don't recommend it as that market is flooded with unemployed grads.


Thinking about all of this makes me really anxious at times and I feel my uncertainty is starting to take a toll on my performance in school. I have no goals or anything at the moment. I've reached a point where I'm scared to even start taking classes to prepare for a major. ",22Jul2017,0

43," Hi guys. I'm writing because I need to know what is it like to go through therapy and talk to a counselor? I have never done this before and I'm really skeptical how this can help you? Aren't you the only person who can help yourself? It's not like therapist will solve your problems for you and remove your depression or heal your broken heart or will stop you from killing yourself. I always thought that only weak helpless people go there who are not capable to fix their own life while I feel like that's the only option left for me now. But yet I feel very embarrassed. I know therapists dont really care for you and do this for money/career. Am I wrong? Is here anyone whom therapy actually helped? How does it work? I'm afraid it would be useless waste of time and money and all a counselor would feel would be judgment and disgust of what a worthless human being I am, can't even fix my own issues paying people to listen to their problems and sob story and pretend that they care.

I was thinking about accounting, but I'm worried I won't like it as much as I would have liked engineering. I still have interest in accounting, but maybe not quite as much as engineering.

54,"See, I am a Male Indian America and an only child. My parents have always been over protective of me. They had me after many miscarriages and worry about me a lot. I went to college away from home and experienced true freedom. I got a girlfriend, and had a full college experience. Since graduating I’ve come back home. I’m moving away again for a masters pretty soon, but I feel like I need to make a change and not feel so trapped every time I go home. How do I do it? ",22Jul2017,3
55,"Okay, so to flesh this all out, I've been working at my workplace for 3 years now. I'm 20, and this guy is around 25(ish?) and very popular among the managers and other colleagues. 
In December, he was messaging me late at night after work, and he tried coming onto me in a round about way, asking me to keep things just between us, I played innocent and friendly when I realised he wasn't being so innocent himself, (at first I thought he was ashamed of hanging out with me &amp; didn't want colleagues to know as he said we should meet up some time but we have to keep it quiet or something), so I pretended to be oblivious. He was very assertive after a while, and after that, I immediately politely declined, knowing he was probably drunk and I had to work with him, and didn't want things getting awkward at work, but he continued to message me sexually a while after I stopped replying. I didn't mention anything to him about it, or anyone else, because I'd agreed not to tell anyone and I thought it was probably a drunk mans ramblings and really didn't want him feeling awkward. (we don't really work a lot together much anymore but sometimes we do and I don't want that to interfere with my work, it's just fast food but I want to keep my job)
But he's attempted to start a lot of conversations late at night after, but I usually try ignore them in fears of it happening again. 

So tonight, he messaged me and I opened it without looking, so he messaged two more times until I replied with a simple 'what's up', he started a relatively normal mundane conversation, then out of nowhere told me, 'you owe a shag', which threw me off guard. The conversation pretty much went like this...

Him: :) 
Him: XXXXX
Him: Oi
Me: What's up?
Him: Why u awake?
Me: On a late shift tomorrow, don't fancy falling asleep on the way home, wbu?
Him: I'm in ____ (somewhere about 50m or so away idk?)
Me: How come?
Him: lads weekend
Me: fair enough, how is it there?
Him: you still owe a shag
Me: owe a shag?
Him: Yes but we agreed to keep it quiet
Me: ...Excuse me?
Me: I agreed to keep it quiet about the conversation, not once did I agree to sleep with you.
Him: Hey sorry that was my stupid friend
Him: Very sorry

At this point I just close the window and I'm crying my eyes out. I'm honestly scared, uncomfortable and hurt, but he keeps messaging me. I'm not threatened by him, I don't know him well, despite working 3 years with him, but we tend to work on different shifts, but I don't imagine he's the kind of person to do such a thing. But I don't know whether to tell my managers, because this kind of stuff shouldn't happen. It really shouldn't and its scary and it's really intimidated me through the disgusting entitled language he used, despite knowing I wasn't interested. But I'm also fearful that if I do go, they'll not take notice of it, or disclaim it because most of the managers are his friends, either that or because I fake flirt in fun with my friends there, and I slept with a guy from work about a year and a half ago (my best friend at the time) and thus I've given off the wrong impression to him, and I'm taking things too seriously. 
Anything you think of to at least do, to make sure this doesn't happen again, to me or any other girl. I honestly don't wanna make my work life harder than it needs to be. ",22Jul2017,2
57,"I live in California and was recently sent to the ER in an ambulance. I had bad pains in my left side and curled up on the floor of a gym hyperventilating. I stayed in a hospital overnight as they ran some tests, and they determined I had a 7cm teratoma (a tumor that is most likely benign) right next to my heart.

So I got transferred from that small hospital to another bigger hospital, where I was told I would be getting surgery. Only when the cardio-thoracic surgeon met me, he told me he wouldn't be doing surgery immediately. He explained that the tumor was a slow-growing one, so it was unlikely I would die soon, and that he wanted me to get a biopsy first. Since it was the weekend, I couldn't get a biopsy done. The surgeon said I could go home that night or next morning and have them monitor me overnight, and since it was already late I said I could stay until morning. The surgeon said okay and they kept me overnight for monitoring before sending me home.

That was 2 weeks ago, now I get this letter but I don't know what it means. It said a copy was CC'd to the surgeon, another to the hospital. What does that mean, does that mean the insurance will not pay for the second night and that I have to pay out of pocket?",22Jul2017,2

60,"im generally a loner, i have no one i can really call my friend - i'd rather be by myself if given the choice. but last year, i felt like i met my soulmate. i love that person, in all manners of the word, and it was for them that i forced myself to steer away from suicide last year.

this person means the world to me, literally. i have never met someone that made me so happy or feel so glad to be alive. for the first time in years, i felt like my depression was getting better.

but for the past few months, we have grown distant. they told me a week ago that they no longer had the emotional capacity to care for me as deeply as they used to and told me to not think of them as the same from here on out. and now, they give me so little attention and i constantly feel like my heart is breaking. they would rather play a video game than respond to an urgent text from me, and even though i have always given 150% of my devotion to them, i feel like theirs has gone from 90% to 60%. i get jealous and cry when they talk about their best friend whom they know in real life, and thinking about abandonment has made me start to feel suicidal again. after all, there isnt anyone else for me except them.

61,"So the past two years of my life, i was presented many opportunities to be social and put myself out there and in the end I took most of them. I took them mainly because I often worried about the possibility of regretting it later and most of the time at these events, I was not happy. In fact, I dreaded most of them but continued to put myself out there. I somewhat secluded myself this summer but these opportunities are coming back again and I feel the exact same way.

63,"Hey, as in the title. I have a mess of a life atm, could be worse but meh. 

I tend to set goals &amp; chores for myself and I follow them for a limited time and I bail on them. 5 months ago I started at the gym and worked out 5 days of the week and felt great, followed most of the goals/tasks that I made for myself. But I bailed on one task a time with time and now I wake up - eat - Work 9 hour - Go home - eat - Spend most of my day on the computer - eat - sleep like 3~5 AM (I work at 8 AM).
I have felt depressed for years and been comfy with it but past few months have been increasingly difficult as I stack more depression and laziness on top of my daily life.

When I worked out for 2-3 months I did lose around 14% of my total fat % , but I skipped ONE day and I said to myself aah, next day- and the next - next - next ... I haven't gone for 2-3 months now. I gained the weight+fat back and just feel even more depressed than I was b4 I even worked out. Don't get me wrong I have no self-harm intentions.

So, I would like to seek advice on to improve my life style and decisions. My current state is that I am broke mid-month in because of bad decisions such as spending too much on un-needed food, gambling, and such. Depressed, sleep deprived most of the time.

I am currently writing this 4:50 AM and I am suppose to open a shop at 7:30. Don't worry I'll make it happen. (I will check comments at work tomorrow morning)

Extras: Would be awesome to get a daily guide on what I should eat. (something that I won't get sick of after 2 days of doing)

I need help, but I don't need a psychologist/therapist or something like that honestly.

Info on me:

- Height 197 cm and shrinking

- Weight 120kg~
- Income 2600$-ish a month (-700$ straight to rent)
- Health Ok but not satisfied
- Age 21 years

Mood is deep lingering sadness most of the time.

Tonight, I asked him to in the future just give me a heads up and maybe consider that I may not be okay with a party being thrown in our house.

But im now at a place where sometime beginning next year i can start collage or choose a different path... since i was a kid i wanted to be an animator or make like 3d models and such. i've made many small animation projects here and there. But if when i do take that path it'll be you know the first 2 yrs basic collage stuff then i plan to transfer to the university for animation. But the thing is I dont wanna rely so much on my one parent, i feel like im disappointing him and feel a lot of pressure if i wait any longer. Im scared for the basic classes and fail, as i did okay in high school... so one friend told me about why not go to a beauty school for hair, as i do tons of my friends and family and others that hear about me. I thought about it and sounds like a good idea since i heard beauty school is 1 year to get licences. Then do hair for a couple years so i wont have to rely on my parent so much, and with that money i could go to collage and start my original plan since there is no age limit right? But... at the same time i feel like its a good and bad idea to go that route.. and i've talked to my 3 of my very close friends about it. they didnt really have much to say but do whatever think its right... and about my parent i've talked about the subject many times without saying how i feel as a burden but says the same too, but encourages me to take my dream of animation.

72,"So I own(ed) three knives
I bought a small survival knife less than half an inch in width and around 4.5 inches in length around 2 years ago to carve wood and because I liked the way it looked. 

and recently about a month ago I bought a Butterfly Trainer knife from CS:GO (Butterfly Crimson Web) and this follows all the rules and laws in the Australia. The blade part is just a piece of thick metal with lots of holes (to prevent people from sharpening it). 

and about two weeks ago I saw a knife (almost a machete) from Paddy's Market in Sydney. It looked like a Bowie Knife | Night from CS:GO, I bought it because I thought it was cool and I've seen a lot of other people who are collecting CS GO Knives. 


Sooo, one day I left the house to baby sit/house sit at my girlfriend's sister's house when I got a call from my mom asking to talk to my girlfriend. She told her that she found a big knife in my room (yeah, she just went into my room) was afraid that I was brainwashed by I--sis and I would use that knife to hurt other people because it was a ""deadly weapon"" and she also mentioned that she was going to call the police on me because of this. And to me hearing all of that, it broke me, she has no trust in me at all. I had that knife in its sheath on top of my laundry basket with my door slightly open. 


I didn't really care if anyone saw it, I thought it was not going to be a big deal, but I was wrong. Now, I don't know what to do, knowing that her perception of me is like that and has not a single ounce of trust in me and the first thing that comes into her mind is that ^ I don't really want to go home now, I don't wanna see her, I don't want to be confronted about this matter because to me it's stupid. I was happy now she has to bring this drama into my life. 

If you have any questions just reply, I don't know if I described it well enough.

Anyways, what should I do ? 
- Go home and talk about it ? (there's no winning with her, every argument she's ALWAYS right no matter what)
I have one sister who's probably on her side and I have no father. 
- Move out ? (I don't really want to be living with her anymore)

P.S. I'm 21 in 2 months (legal age to buy/own a knife is 18)
I have never brought said knife out in public nor have I used it on anything.

I might be over reacting but just being treated like that and her even considering calling the police on her own son all from a speculation just broke me. She doesn't even know me, my girlfriend knows me better heck my girlfriend's sister knows me better than she knows me.

TL;DR - Mom found a big knife I got because it looked like one from a game (CS:GO) and now thinks I'm brainwashed by I--SIS

73,"Edit: Should have added this earlier but it seems like every single comment thinks I am a girl, I would just like to clarify I am a guy.

I have known him since I was around 12, we have been good friends on Steam for about 3-4 years and have met a little bit, he was the boyfriend of my cousin and they came to my house to visit my gran and great gran (passed away) a lot so we know each other a bit outside of online chats, of course we have both grown up a lot but I feel I still know him well enough to meet. Now he is getting his own home and wants me to visit him and hang out to justify the new home a bit more. I am happy to do that because we get along on Steam and I would like to bring my PC over to his house and we could play some games with each other, I am just wondering what this will look like and if others will get all pissy about this? I currently live with my grandmother, I am concerned about her reaction, I haven't told her about my friend because we have only really interacted online, she doesn't know how long we have been friends for. He won't be getting this home for at least 5-6 months so it is by no means happening soon, but he had voiced his concerns about the age gap too, talking about how I am a minor, but I won't be when I would be visiting him, 18 year old hanging out with a 25 year old, to me that seems reasonable.

79,"Hello, today I am going to tell you all a story of my situation, which covers some of my young 15-year-old life.

Without dragging out my whole life story. Roll back to about a year and a half ago, a new girl (call her HR) started catching my bus, she is stunning (at least in my eyes). I never talked to her. She never talked to me and we just went on about our lives. Then I realise at the beginning of this year, she doesn't catch the bus anymore, she moved schools to a school in the city. I thought ""shit never seeing HR again"". That was that.


Come to about May 2017, I find HR Facebook. I message her and that goes on about for about 2 weeks. One of my mates (call him WC) talks to her about going to formal with me. Long story short she says yes. Keep in mind me and HR haven't met properly yet.


Fast forward all the bullshit. HR and WC are no longer friends. I want to meet HR but she always has plans. (I know for a fact this isn't a lie.) What do I do? ",22Jul2017,1
80,"So heres the story. Were a group of teenage friends, we all grew up on the same lake and theres 5 of us. We're all close more or less and all enjoy each other's company. We're all guys and there's never any of that bitchy drama or fights between us. 

So we often hang out at this one person's house in our group who we'll call Johnny. Most hanging out and getting together as a whole group will revolve around him, because were often at his place. If we're not hanging out there, it will be where we start out the day/night at least, its kind of like our home-base if thats how you'd put it.

So Johnny has a (close) cousin. Her (F)amily lives right next to Johnny's. She's a year older than him and lives in the city for college, but for this summer she's up here. She's generally a bit bitchy and also can be stubborn to get her way. On the other hand she's an adventurous person i guess you can say, and will often go far out to do the things she wants, like recently she traveled through Europe, and plan big things like road trips, and I guess you can say she's one of those people who thinks they can do everything. The surprising part is that she kind of can though. 

She also kind of has rich parents who pay for a lot for her, and she generally doesn't work often, but also because she's busy with sports and other stuff, not just because she's spoiled. She's also one of those people who you rather like or hate, and she's one of those people who will rather like or hate you. Theres not much else to say about her except for that she's a bit of a tomboy, and that she's a ginger.

I grew up with her for most of my childhood and our families know each other pretty well, and were practically neighbours. I've mostly been on good terms with her myself, and I'm sure with myself that I can say were good and she doesn't hate me, but I can't say the same for someone else in the group, but I'll get into that sooner than later.

So Johnny's cousin, who we'll call Kim, likes to hang out with Johnny a lot, and likes to drag him along for whatever she's doing. Like me, our group is no stranger to Kim. 4/5 of us grew up with her too and all know her pretty well. She'll usually come over to see Johnny when we're there, which we have no problem with, but she will occasionally pull him away from us. Its never awkward when she's here or anything, she can be fun and pretty chill. But every now and then it will be more like its them two and the rest of us, rather than all of us together when were all chilling. Johnny doesn't do anything wrong, he just has trouble saying no to her and letting her down. She can always find a way to turn it against him and he only tries to make everyone happy.

The only part of this whole thing that makes chilling around her the way it is, is because of one of our group members, who we'll call Josh. Josh is a chill guy, (Smokes the most weed out of us all) but probably the most sketchy of us all. (not that we're sketchy, but if it would be anyone, it would be Josh) His parents got divorced when he was a kid and when he was living with his mom (which is Monday through Friday) they lived in a small place that Kim's parents rented out to them across from their house, and it's on their property too. (Josh's mom is friends with Kim's parents) 

To Kim, (and her sister a bit) she sees it as an bit of an odd situation and really looks down at Josh, his mom, and his little brother. It's actually not looked like that at all with her parents and everyone else, only Kim. (And her sister) Like she looks at them like their lower class and just simpler people. They're for sure less well off than them but that's about it. Josh has always felt a bit uncomfortable living there and felt a bit unaccepted, and like a leech, but he moved passed that and now lives with his dad most of the time, (who also lives on the lake) but yet its still an odd situation for josh and Kim and she only sees him because we're with him. They're the 2 that don't really talk to each other much and Kim still doesn't really like him, but only tolerates him because he's with us, which is a really bitchy thing to do. 

So here's where our story finally starts. So about 5 days ago Kim brought a friend up to stay for the week. We've all been chilling with her more or less, no awkwardness, we're all friends, and me Johnny and another one of us know this girl a bit too, she and her family will occasionally come up from out of province (she lives in Ontario we live in Quebec) to visit us, but its been 2 years since we've seen her, and Kim decided to pick her up and get her over here. And as much as the 3 of us others know her more or less, she's kind of more drawn to Kim this time around, because she's the one who invited her up.

So like I said, everyone was getting along, and the friend and Josh are chill too. Everything is just fine. But today, for whatever reason, things were not. Today everyone was chilling and me and Josh only get there a bit later on then everyone else. It's around 7-8 PM when we get there and no one's there right away. Josh decided to bring his little brother who is around 13-14, but for most kids his age he's surprisingly mature and not hyper, just chill. He just wanted him up 'cause we don't really see him much or have a problem with him, and honestly Josh hasn't even talked to him much this summer until now and all he wanted to do was bring him up here so we can see him. 

So anyways, we get there and there's no one. Last I heard, Kim was going to pick up another member of our group. So we're just waiting and about 15 minutes go by before Kim and the friend come in and see us. I ask them if they've seen Johnny, and if they've gone to pick up our guy. Kim say's no to both questions, as they take all their liquor out of the fridge and head. 

Later we hear them leaving on her parents pontoon. (Like a boat but square and slow, but for partying) We wait another 15-20 minutes before I say the most-likely obvious that she lied to us and they're out on the pontoon with her and that she didn't even tell Johnny or the others that were here. There's also the thought that they do know and Kim told them we were there, but Johnny would have likely not done much to intervene. Kim definitely wanted to make a good ocassion for her friend who goes back soon and wan

So back to us, Josh is pretty upset and he wasn't having the best day and seeing us, and his brother and everyone together was supposed to make it better for him. His brother didn't seem to be too upset but only didn't want to make things worse. Josh went off saying how Kim is a spoiled bitch and is a child who hasn't grown up, and was pretty sad about how our group is being interfered by her and what not. He's getting a bit depressed and then him and his brother go home. I also go home too. I honestly don't really care too much on what happened. 

I for sure lost respect for Kim and ya she's a bitch, but I know nothing's going to change between us 5 guys and that they didn't have any intention of leaving us behind, and that it wasn't their plan. In fact neither me or Josh really cared about going on board to party, it's just that she lied to us so we didn't know where they were. I get how she wouldn't have wanted a little kid and his older brother who she disrespects both of to be chilling with them all, (I honestly don't know if I would be on board if Josh and his bro weren't there) but it's a really shitty thing to do when you can literally just say: ""Oh yeah, there with me right now"". 

Why I am posting this is because I'm very confused on how to approach this situation. What do I say the next day to the other guys? What do I say to Kim? Do I even bother confronting her?? And what about Josh?? He seemed really upset and he gets depressed every now and then.

And well me, I don't think looks are a problem, and I don't think the way I dress is a problem either. I'm also slightly built because I play basketball and go to the gym a few times a week.  It's just my communication skills that I think are lacking because every time I talk to a girl they get uninterested really quickly. My friends would call girls bitches and hoes and I'm just not used to calling girls that, even though that's kind of the stereotype black people seem to carry. Any advice on how I can live up to my ""role"" as a black dude.

88,"without making it out like you want to sleep with them or date?

There's this girl in one of my classes, i think she's cute but i don't think there's anything there for us to date. Very nice, very chill seems like she'd be cool to hang around with.I don't sit right next to her, but we've worked together in classwork before.

We apparently went to the same high school, a year apart. And our class ends next week. I'd ask for her number but i don't want to give the impression i want to date, asking her out for coffee seems like too much too. Like asking for her snapchat or IG is more distant but a phone number feels more personal, and there's no middle ground. And ""do you wanna hang out just us?"" feels creepy :/

Me - 30 m
Girlfriend of 3 years - 23 f

It occurred to me tonight that I used to be a lot better at reading people, but over the past couple years I have come to feel increasingly awkward and clueless. I'm now starting to wonder if that's really the case, or if I'm being manipulated. 

I second guess myself constantly. This is not a new thing, but it's much more pronounced now, especially with her. She swears up and down she's 100% honest and direct with me, but everyone sends nonverbal cues. When I call her out on hers, like her saying something is fine but everything in her body language and tone says she's upset, she gets angry. She also has told me that she doesn't really understand those types of cues and people often misconstrue her as overly harsh because of that, yet she demonstrates time and time again that she is highly observant of what people do and why.

Trouble is, my memory sucks. Like really bad. And that makes it hard to call people out on things that already happened because I'm always at a disadvantage. I'm smart and pretty good at arguing concisely, but only if I have enough info, you know? I think my hunches are usually right, but I can't back them up in the moment so I often don't voice them and I forget about them sooner or later anyway, so who knows really.

Sometimes I notice she's bothered and I'm like 99% sure it's something I did, but she shuts me out. If I press the issue, she gets more agitated, which makes me upset because I'm trying to help. Then she accuses me of making it about me. She's got me thinking it's selfish to think I did something wrong and want to fix it. Not only that, but I'm afraid to go to her with any of my own problems if she's upset about anything, related to me or not. 

I can delve into this more and give examples if there's interest / if it'll help people help me, but it's 4 AM and I need to go to bed. I just can't go to any of my friends about this because we have pretty much the same friend group.

EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect to wake up to so many responses already. I see in hindsight that I was super vague and I think I may have given a couple of you the wrong impression. Chalk it up to tiredness. Anyway...

I guess the first thing to address is that I do try to be respectful of not wanting to talk. The tricky thing is she frequently gets upset that a lot of people in her life don't show much concern for her; she's very much the ""mom friend"" of the group - always taking care of everyone else. Plus she has pretty bad depression and anxiety, so a ""bad mood"" could mean some very dark thoughts or a panic attack. So I make a point of checking in with her when she's down. I ask her if she's okay, or how she's doing, or just what's up, and lately she's started to respond with things like, ""I wish you wouldn't ask me that,"" said in a biting tone that she would no doubt deny being aware of if I pointed it out. Sometimes it's fine, but sometimes she's mad that I even asked. And I'm not talking about me poking and prodding her until she gets pissed off, I'm talking about getting snapped at for asking the initial question. And I'm all about finding alternatives if what I'm doing doesn't work, but she offers none, and I can't in good conscience NOT show concern for a loved one's wellbeing.

96,"So I live in a home that was then split into three apartments which include mine (main floor), landlord (2nd floor) and partiers (below me, basement). The basement people moved in this week and decided to throw a rager. This is an old house and I could hear EVERYTHING. Not a huge issue though. 

The landlord is out of town and I'm taking care of her cat. The cat is very much a free roaming cat. I let it out in the morning, feed it etc. and let it in at night and make sure it has all the necessities. The thing is, the rager (which my basement neighbors said was going to be a small party) got a little crazy. There's vomit all over the driveway and other possibilities of disaster. 

Ways things can go wrong: 

1. The landlord did not lock her upstairs apartment door since this is a small town and is usually boring. Drunk person could mess up her place. 

2. Landlord grows veg and flowers. They could be ruined by partygoers. 

I guess my question is: What do I do if any of these things go wrong? I also have things to do tomorrow so I can't afford to wait til later to let the cat out, and that cat goes nuts if indoors too long. Should I just clean up the garbage and vomit myself (bc cats eat everything) before I leave and text my downstairs neighbors not to do it again? Or, should I just tell my landlord and sully the reputation with my downstairs neighbors?

Also, I low-key okayed the party when I talked to one of the neighbors. I've been to parties in this town. They are usually not like this so I didn't give it a second thought. 

Edit: I'd like to add that the landlord and I have a very informal, relaxed relationship. And I'd also like to add that I'm about 90% sure that there is a no-party clause in the lease like there is in mine. This could get them evicted. 

Edit 2: It's raining. Vomit will probably wash away. Should I still tell landlord? 

I woke up at 7am in the morning and everything was cleaned up. Wtf. I'll tell the landlord if she brings it up (if a neighbors called her or something) but I talked to the basement neighbors alittle later in the morning and neither or them had a hangover (so no binge drinking) and they said that they literally could not stop people after a certain point. Call me a party pooper but if that happened at my party, I would have called the cops and had them all vacated. But then again, I'm a bitch. ",22Jul2017,1
99,"Hi so a bit of backstory to this, my brothers, although smart, didn't do well for their SPM, which is I guess the equivalent of your SATs or smthg, anyways one did very well and went on to college, only to later drop out, while the other didn't get good enough grades to go into college at all. the older one who dropped out is doing alright now, with moderate money, the second is still living with us and working a labour job. Now, as I'm the only child in school and I'm called the smartest amongst my brothers, is left with all the pressure to do well. My parents are disappointed in my recent results, although I've put in so much effort into it. they're not convinced that 8 study, my father even once said that I excelled at nothing, and I feel like I don't , they're not supportive of anything I do, and even if they are, they don't say anything. When I lost a band competition, my mum didn't comfort me, she just said it's what I get when we don't practice hard enough. They're really nice people and I love them, but I feel like they don't support me in anything, they don't see the effort I put in to the point where they want me to study outside of my room,and when my tuition teacher said I was improving greatly, my mum, in a very skeptical way, said I hope so. she didn't even stopped and say, that's great good job. no encouragement , nothing.
So once I am done with my PT3 (which is an important exam as it decides which stream I go to), if I get terrible grades, I'm going to kill myself. Everyone else I know thinks I'm a happy go lucky person who's funny and has no problems. i guess that's how everybody sees me. but I like it like that.
and even if I improve my grades from a D grade to a C or B, they still say it's bad. I don't know what to do anymore. please help.

107,"I got one of my friends a job at my work. he worked there for a while and ended up dating one of my colleagues, unknowing to everybody else. they were seeing each other for a year or more, then he quit the job and went overseas.

shortly after he left, the girl put in her notice to leave due to getting another role somewhere else. then, only a few months later she had a kid. she hid it from everybody, and only told a few people that were at my work, which got back to me.

her story is that the kid is her ex-boyfriend's, which she had been on and off with for the last while. so he believes it is his, and my friend doesn't know anything about it.

so fast forward a while, and my friend is back in the country and hasn't spoken to her. I've tried to get in contact with her but she doesn't like to pick up her phone or return messages very often, so I haven't had a proper chat with her about the whole situation (though I'd like to).

now I'm in a sticky situation - I know about her child, and my friend doesn't. he is still kind of hung up on her, and is briefly in contact with her but she hasn't mentioned the kid at all. she still sticks to her story that it's another guy's kid.

I know it's inevitable that one day the news will get to him, and when he asks me if I knew I'm not going to lie.. which will of course add a lot of stress to our friendship (I've known him for many years).

I know that it's not my place at all, and at the end of the day the most important person in this situation is the child. I don't know if it's fair for me to pressure her into telling him about the kid. obviously if she's hiding the news, she isn't 100% sure that it isn't his.

should I just let things roll out and deal with it when it comes? is it fair for me to ask her to tell him - even though it's hard for me to get in contact? I think she ignores my calls because she knows I'm best friends with him, so it makes it harder to get her side of the story.

108,"This is more of a get off the chest anon post, to anyone that cares to listen. 

I am sitting here listening to Lay Me Down by Willy Nelson and Loretta Lynn. What a powerful song. 

So, here is my story. I am 27, a guy.. who once had everything I could ask for and then some. An amazing relationship of 7 years, money, career, cars.. everything. Last year, they walked out. Emptied my accounts. Battled me tooth and nail. Lost 3 vehicles. Lost my home. A week later, my dog passed unexpectedly. Began sleeping in a warehouse I worked with soon after. That same month I get a call there was an accident at my parents and my step mother of 20 years had passed. I drove in a borrowed car to a neighboring state to give the best help I could. While there, I get another frantic call. My brother had collapsed and was in the hospital. He spent a week in a coma and I stayed as long as I could. He eventually made it out. 2 months roll on and lets face it, I was still a wreck. Broke, sleeping on a floor in an office, began to heavily drink. Thanksgiving hits and I arrive home, where it is announced another brother ( i have a large family) had cancer. I lost it that day. From then on, I chose a path that lead nowhere. Still sleeping on the office floor, I made a terrible decision and went for a drive after a heavy night of drinking. Was arrested, charged, and returned to the office floor the next day. Fast forward another month. Still having not learned the error of my ways I return to heavy drinking. During an episode at my office, I passed out. Woke up several hours later covered in blood, with a man on top of me. I was naked. I just remember running. Not much before or after. I woke the next day in a parking lot near my office. Later learning, my boss had raped me. Fast forward to now, I have lost my job. Yet again lost my car. Lost everything. Decided my last option was to leave. Lost my friends. My entire life. 

I am sitting here, iTunes filling my ears. Sleeping in a storage room in someones basement. I ask myself, how did someone so successful just a year ago, end here. How did that guy who had it all, that picture perfect life end up sitting on a concrete floor searching for another high to cover this pain. I often wonder if I should just down those pills and call it a night. That sounds so normal to hear on a thread. But, if you saw me. If you heard my voice. You would know what everyone around me has seen. A blank face of no desire. 

You might wonder if this is a thread of lies. I wouldn't blame you for this. Hell, I want to say it's all a giant hoax as well. I want to blame someone, the world, myself, anything in front of me. Not a soul around me knows of this with the exceptions of my families health/death. Everything else I keep hidden somewhere in my head. There is too much embarrassment, too much attempt at pride.

119,"**tl;dr -- arrived at Holiday Inn Express and was given keys to our room to find some random stranger sleeping in it. Was given the *last* room available which had only a Queen bed, even though our original room had a King. We are four people on a Queen. They won't do anything.**


Hey Reddit, here's the harrowing story of my first time in Colorado! I'm really not sure how to proceed or what to do, so please provide advice if you know! 

Our family of 4 [Mom, dad, me (19), sister (15)] booked three nights in an IHG Holiday Inn Express near Denver for a wedding. We knew we would be arriving late, and IHG has a policy that says our reservations aren't guaranteed after 11 PM. Since we knew we would be late, my dad called the hotel staff multiple times today before our flight, and after reaching the airport, to ensure that we would in fact, have our room. Our flight landed a little late since there was bad weather, and baggage claim was subsequently delayed. The Denver International Airport has terrible punctuality with their trains, so it was a while until we were even able to get to Baggage Claim. After getting through all of that, the car rental process took about one hour, being that it was 3AM and there was one person manning the counter. Not terrible, slightly inconvenient. 

The hotel staff was terribly friendly and understanding, assuring us that our room would, in fact, be ready and still be ours. We got to the hotel, checked in, both front-desk employees were extremely nice. One of the employees was taking a smoke break outside while we checked in (relevant for later). We took our keys, came upstairs to our room, and opened it. **Surprise, there was someone sleeping in our room!** 

That's right, there was someone literally asleep and unpacked in the bed of the room that our keys opened. We shut the door quickly before waking them up and went downstairs. The front-desk staff were, in a word, baffled. They had no idea someone was in *our* room, and actually said they had no idea who it was. As in, they didn't know who was sleeping in our room. My dad and I asked them what they meant, and they clarified by saying that their system reflected the room was empty until we checked in. Clearly an issue. We thought it was no big deal, we can get it sorted out. 

One of the front-desk staff, at first the friendliest, quickly became the surliest. She told us that she had one more room that we could **luckily** sleep in, and that it was a Queen Size. We booked a King Suite (idk if that's the exact name of the room-type, but at the very least a King bed + Sofa) specifically for four people. She said it wasn't her problem, and she was giving us the last room. We asked her to simply move the person sleeping in our room to the Queen bed, because he was alone. She actually said that she didn't know who was in there, and would not go up there at this time of the night. Like it was our fault that their system allowed someone random to check in for our room without recording their personal information. 

Skipping over the small issues of fire-hazards and health-code violations with four people in a tiny room, it still gets worse. The same surly employee told us it was our problem since we got their later than 11 PM. But my dad literally called three, four times to double check that our room was reserved. They still refused to budge. 

We went up to our new room and realized it was, in fact, tiny. So we called down to reception and asked if they could provide a mattress and blanket so two of us could sleep on the floor, since no one wanted to lie down on the carpet. The *same* surly employee then told us that we would have to come down and get it (which, in itself is really not the biggest deal in the world at all, but she wasn't pleasant at all, and at 5AM after a night of traveling and bad experiences, good service is very much appreciated) as she, would not be bringing it to us.

She said that neither of the front desk staff was allowed to leave the desk (but we passed one of the two on their smoke break while bringing our luggage in). 

Kind of adding on to the story -- we had called earlier in the morning to see if they had irons or not, since we needed one to press shirts and suits for the wedding. They had told us they did not have irons, and it would be wise to bring one. Well, we brought one. They have one in each room. Just extra space wasted and a check-in bag for no reason.

We're all pretty reasonable people, but my dad did say he was going to complain to corporate (just based on their room-reservation policy, and the fact that a stranger was lying in our bed) and the staff at the front desk actually told him to go ahead and complain since they weren't owned by corporate and it wouldn't do anything. They said their manager wasn't in until Monday morning. 

So, what can we do? We paid for a room that we didn't get, we were forced into a tiny room meant for TWO people and we're four. They have no accountability for their system or their own mistakes and don't even realize the problem with having a stranger in our room without knowing it. They treated us pretty rudely and were extremely unpleasant to deal with, even shouting at my father and I as we tried to talk about the room-size problem. What can we do? ",22Jul2017,1

The cousin never takes care of her dog. She always leaves him in the cage in the dark, even when she's at home because he's ""annoying"". He's 7 months and just energetic. She has only fed him once since she got him, my girlfriend and I have to feed him and take him on walks because she won't do it. 


She also lets him shit everywhere and destroy everything. This dog has bitten holes in the wall and there's so many dog shit stains on our carpet it's ridiculous. Anytime he poops she literally refuses to pick it up. We have to do it. 


Yesterday she found out she's pregnant. She's 19 and refuses to even take care of her dog but she swears up and down she'll take care of her baby. The father isn't in the picture since he's 34 and got the fuck out of dodge basically. So she already wants our help raising the baby. I don't like kids and I don't want them, neither does my girlfriend. We are not excited. 


Last night, the roommate asked us for a favor. Her friend brought her dog over and she wanted us to watch him until she got home. She texted us saying she was on the way. We waited 5 hours and then called her. No answer. We called her 5 times. We knew where she was so we called the friend she was with and the friend said she was asleep. The friend was under the assumption that the roommate was spending the night at her place. This pissed me off because she had literally texted us saying she was leaving. 


The new dog is super well behaved and adorable but we had to sleep in the roommate's room because our cat fucking hates dogs. The roommate's dog barked all night causing the new dog to howl. We got no sleep. I am livid. I plan on calling animal control later and getting the roommate's dog taken away, but I don't want her to figure out it was us because last time we pissed her off she up and left and we had to pay more rent. 


I need some advice on what to say to her when she gets home as I want to be civil because she's my girlfriend's cousin, but I also want to just rip into her for doing such a shitty thing. Any advice?",22Jul2017,1

* It took 2 years to get my hair this long (super short bob to mermaid covering her breasts with her hair)
* I'm heavy rn (almost 200 lbs, 5'9)
* No one asked me to do this
* I'm only this character for 2 scenes, otherwise I'm ensemble (though it's a short play)
* My sister and my boyfriend reeeally don't want me to do it
* We only perform for four days, but I'd live with short hair for about a year

Pros

* This long hair is a bitch to maintain, and I'm very busy.
* I'm ugly with long hair, so it's not like I can get much worse.
* I'm not worried about a pixie affecting my auditions, I'm more focused on non-acting endeavors rn. 
* I can donate to Locks of Love.
* This is a beautiful show and I'm proud to be a part of it.
* When I've mentioned cutting my hair to the director, he said I didn't need to do it, but he seemed pleased with the idea. 
* I already told the stage manager I was doing it
* I really do think it would help my performance, even in the ensemble.
* I normally love short hair, I've just been liking my long hair right now as it really *just* hit that point where it's suuuper long. I'd probably cut it in a few months to a bob anyway. ",22Jul2017,1

Five minutes later an email was sent out to all the employees asking them if anyone wants to pick up my weekend shifts.

141,"I'm starting uni next month and am a virgin. Well, me and this one girl going to uni with me have been flirting a lot (on the phone, she lives in a different part of the county), sexual implications, etc. She has a boyfriend, and while I don't think what is happening is necessarily right, I know she couldn't physically cheat on him (and she's going to break up before uni). Last night, she did, with her friends cousin. And she decided to lay it all out on me. 

Here's what I'm feeling...

1) I'm uncomfortable with this.

2) I'm annoyed that she didn't break up with her boyfriend already. I'm fairly certain the main reason that she's still with him at this point is for sex until uni starts. 

3) I'm slightly jealous. Like why couldn't she wait 3 weeks until she would be with me? Why couldn't she just keep fucking her boyfriend.

143,"Basically, dealt with severe social anxiety all of my life. Never made ANY friends from the time I was about 12, until now (24). These past few years, I've started to pretty much get over it. But I still have NO experience with making friends. 

I've been with my GF for 3 years now, and not only is it weird that she hangs out with her friends often, and I never do anything, but also, I know how much making friends would improve my life. 

I've lost a ton of weight, improved my social skills a bit, dress better now, and am simply so much more satisfied with MYSELF, which I know is always the first step to happiness. But still, I have NO IDEA how to make friends. I currently work from home, don't go to uni, and am not into drugs (if one sly person would suggest it...just saying).

Now, I'd like to make both male and female friends, but I'm MUCH better at talking to females, so I think that's where I should start. My concern is that, at bars, people are either looking to get laid (I have a GF already), or they're hanging out with their already-established friend groups. Kinda weird to approach big groups of buddies. Live in a college town. No one on Meetup or Bumble in my area. Been at my gym for about 7 years, and never even really talked to the regulars, so it'd be weird to start now (plus, anything other than, ""can I get a spot, bro?"" if frowned upon in the gym).

I'm just really looking to make some friends. Me and my GF admittedly don't have much, if anything, in common, so I'd like people I can talk fitness, sports, life with. Any advice for how to approach this?

151,"(Ironically all of most of these problems are the reason I don't go to bars or clubs.) I have problems studying at home. It mostly pertains to a lack of comfort in my home environment for that kind of thing (I can't buy a desk, no one is going to buy me a desk, and I have dyslexia which forces me to need one to read my own hand writing.)

I've been having horrible experiences trying to go into public and study, I'll post a few at the end of this just for clarity on what I mean.

Basically I want a place to study (maybe buy coffee), wherein no one will approach me, make loud noises, or otherwise be obnoxious. I would prefer a place where there is no background music of any kind but thats fine if its there but it needs to be quiet.

Does a place exist that meets the above criteria?
(For clarity: It must be required you are quite, do not disturb other people even people 'who look lonely like they need someone to talk to.' Preferably somewhere I can buy/drink coffee, with no background music.)

A few stories:

If I go out alone to do this I find something like the following happens 100% of the time.

I went into a starbucks around noon. Decided I was going to block out about 8 hours of study. Around 1:30 a guy walks in and orders a coffee. Hes 'one of those' people who walk around and talk to everyone to 'see what they are doing.' He approaches the women across from me, they consistently try to be polite and say things like ""Yeah, I'm working on [whatever] I'm really busy"" but this guy doesn't take the hint. No one is here to talk to each other, and the people who are know each other and came together. 

Finally after striking up 30-40 min conversations with everyone around me he comes to me. I'm wearing headphones with no music playing to send the ""Fuck off"" signal, but to my horror it doesn't work. First he comes up to me and starts waving his hands as if to say ""Hi."" When I don't respond his big stupid smiling face gets closer until its in front of my computer screen. I look up and let out a sigh, and wave. At this point he takes that as ""I can sit down now"" (or something) and proceeds to sit in the open chair across from me. He keeps pointing at his ears and my ears and trying to talk over ""the music"" I'm listening to. Again I sigh and say ""Yea whats up?"" He just spills his guts, his whole life story, everything good and bad, more than anyone wants to hear. I'm doing my best to ignore him for the solid 30 min. No luck. Finally he gets up and I think ""Thank fuck."" I put my head phones back on. He comes over and just pulls them off and spills back into his story. I was honestly fucking shocked. My mouth fell open when he did that. I looked at him and said ""Are you fucking serious?"" He laughingly said ""Yeah I'm one of those."" I packed my shit up and left all the while he was getting butt-hurt saying ""I didn't do anything wrong! WHAT THE FUCK!"" and getting angry/just generally making a scene. 

Now if you can't tell. I'm a man. 

So after that weird excursion in a starbucks I decide ""Library, bring my own fucking coffee. You have to be quiet in a library."" I go to the library and find the most out of the way hole I can. Of the 5 times I went to the library 4 of them someone came in to the library, near me, on their phone practically yelling. One of the guys kept talking about ""***I'VE GOT TO SELL THIS FUCKING CAR MAN, SHES BEAUTIFUL, ANYONE WOULD WANT HER***"" at some point the guy was approached by staff and told to be quite because he was, in effect, screaming this. So does he quite down, or scream ""***FUCK YOU I'VE GOT TO SELL THIS CAR***"" When more people piped up (non staff to tell this fucker to quite down) he just keeps yelling ""FUCK ALL OF YOU!""

More or less, being in the library isn't that bad, but people do bother me. Either they are asking to sit at the table I'm using, (older 40+ women) try to talk to me about what I'm reading in  a flirtatious manor. (Yeah fuck off I can't stand hearing women complain about being hit on out of nowhere, mostly because I fucking hate it myself because when it happens to me its always 40+ women, in public settings, where I'm trying to read or study.)

Final story on this despite having way more:

Local coffee shop. Sitting reading, nothing special. 40 Plus-er comes up and says ""What are you reading?"" I look up at her ""Fredrick Nietzsche"" Its actually HP Lovecraft, but some people really don't like Nietzsche I've found and they fuck off instantly or try to argue with you about something you may or may not agree with considering it is just a book you are reading and your opinion on it probably isn't anything like the authors, but hey people are stupid I've found. 40 Plus-er lifts my book from the table and laughs ""Ohhh the master of terror"" Despite this being about a year and a half ago I remember explicitly thinking (""If god existed, he would stop this now."") 40 Plus-er just won't shut the fuck up about her degree in english. I keep going back to reading my Lovecraft and mumbling ""Heh, yeah..."" with out looking up at her. She sits there for at least 45 min before I stand up and without saying a word start to walk out. She says some this like ""You aren't going to say goodbye to me? I've been trying to keep you company."" I replied ""I don't know you, please leave me alone."" She looked like I shit in her mouth, which really confuses me because I'm not the one approaching her in public when I don't know her 'just to chat.'

Is there something I'm missing? When did it become acceptable to talk to people you don't know in public? I don't have any social anxiety, I really like working with people, but I don't want to be botherd by people I don't know.",22Jul2017,1

168,"Hey guys, second post on Reddit but anyhow growing up I was a really chubby kid and carried the weight pretty horribly meaning most of my weight gathered in my stomach, that was when I was 8, living with my grandmother who was so sweet but enabled me to make poor diet choices and let me become almost 100 lbs at 8.5 yrs old, everyone used to say I could gain to lose a few pounds. I'm 17F now and that weight dropped after my grandmother died because I went to live with my father and he wasn't an enabler and he certainly wasn't gonna sit back and watch me become morbidly obese. I gained the weight back as I grew taller. I'm now 111 lbs at 5'1"" which is borderline underweight, I was about 117lbs at the beginning of the school year but I have a very fast metabolism and eating breakfast cereal (all my parents would ever buy for breakfast) would never keep my metabolism satisfied because my stomach growled an hour later and I was more hungry than when I woke up. So I quit eating breakfast because the cereal never kept me satisfied for more than hour regardless how much I eat plus I was sick of the damn cereal, for once I'd like some damn eggs to make for breakfast but I can't because 1.) My brother is allergic to eggs so I gotta make them and clean up before he wakes up but 9/10 times he is always awake before I am and 2.) If I eat more than 4 eggs out of the carton I get accused by my stepmother for trying to eat all the damn eggs and calls me a selfish hog and to save some for her but SHE NEVER MAKES ANY THEY JUST SIT AND GO ROTTEN! WHAT A WASTE OF FOOD. So pretty much after I stopped eating breakfast I lost 4 lbs but now I'm losing even more weight because my parents both have depression so my dad doesn't go to the store because he doesn't feel like it, and my stepmom has anxiety so she can't/won't go to the store SO THERE IS NEARLY NOTHING TO EAT OR MAKE but yet my parents tell me all the time I lost weight and that I should eat more but I can't eat and neither can my brothers if there's barely anything to make!

* two large desktop monitors with their respective power cords and cables: Dell 2005fpw and Dell 2007fpb for $70 each

* random trinkets like a brand new toy drone (trying to sell for $35), two Italian hardwood painting easels costing like $350 each (selling the old one for $150, the new one for $250), a cheap generic guitar ($70)

* barely used clothes, brand name like Ann Taylor, made of silk, pima cotton, wool, cashmere... I got them from a thrift store at around $5 an article, and I would hate to part with them but may do so for like $100 (retail cost is $200)

I'll try hard to keep this concise. Just want to hear anyone's thoughts :)

Some context facts:

25/m
Software Tester
Salary: 50 - 60k

I feel as though I need to make a ton of more money to be able to have the freedom to do what I want in the future. Some of this includes a child, a house, nice clothes, live sports/concerts, international travel, a wife who's a good companion (let's not debate how this relates to $ :P), a boat, etc.

I studied some programming in college and really enjoyed it. I've been working pretty hard to learn on my own, but am struggling to be as passionate about it as I am about music, tv, video games, exercise, etc. 

My perspective on the world has always been that very few people can find the perfect intersection in making a career out of the one thing that they're passionate about and that's easy for them to focus on.

I see myself at a fork in the road. One side is spending my very rare free time programming and working harder than I ever have to maybe become a proficient programmer with a job in a little over a year. The other side is sticking to my same sort of job while still progressing and accomplishing non-career related goals (music production, cooking, fitness, etc.) and ""enjoying"" life a bit more.

In your experience/opinion, how much emphasis should be put on career and making money if I really do want the things I mentioned above? Does it seem like these are things I could attain with my current trajectory? Have you come to this same fork in the road, made a choice and what was your experience?

189,"I've been dealing with this dilemma for quite some time now. I'm 21 years old and I'm finishing my second year on Faculty of Economics in Croatia. I'm not very interested in economics as being my field of study, but I'm doing just fine. A year ago I began taking interest in computer science and programming and now I am almost certain that is what I want to do in my life. The Croatian educational system is based on the Bologna process, which means that once you enroll in a university, you can complete the three year program (undergraduate) and get an undergraduate diploma and start working, or you can continue your education with two extra years (graduate) and receive the graduate diploma. If you want to become a Doctor of Science, you can enroll in the postgraduate program with two additional years and write a doctorate to become an expert and do research in the field.
The point is, I'm not sure what I want to do. I was thinking of finishing my undergraduate program on Faculty of Economics and receiving the undergraduate diploma and then enrolling in Faculty of Computer Science, but that means I have to start from the beginning and complete at least three more years or even five, if I want the computer science graduate diploma. On the other hand, if I decide to complete the entire five year program on my current university, I'm afraid I'll spend my whole life doing something I'm not very interested in. Although, it's worth mentioning, the Faculty of Economics does offer an option of choosing Business informatics on the graduate program. That does sound interesting but I'm afraid it's not exactly what I'm looking for...
I would appreciate any advice because I feel completely lost. Should I follow my intuition and enroll in a university I feel is right for me and spend additional three or five years studying, or should I remain on my current university and choose the best option for me there?

I like the overall look, but I've made some formatting changes in order to simplify it. The one thing that I cannot figure out how to change is the line that runs underneath the heading and above the objective. I want to get rid of it all together. Does anyone have any idea how to do that? I can't even figure out what type of design element it is.

197,"Hi,

I am new on Reddit, but I decided to type this out to see if anyone has any advice. I'm sorry if this doesn't really belong on the page, I just need an opinion or a bit of advice.
This is about sexual assault, depression and trauma. So if any of those things might make you upset / trigger bad thoughts or memories, I advice you not to read! 

I will try to keep it short; 
I was raped 2 years ago. Instead of telling my loved ones, I decided to not tell anyone and tried to continue my life as it was before. Sadly, this did not work.
I continued school, but I skipped many classes every single day. I barely managed to pass highschool, but once in college, it became too much. I started to get physical issues. My shoulders/back were constantly tensed, I developed vaginism, being touched, brushed against, or even looked at caused me so much stress. I had to drop out, cause I stopped showing up.
I went into therapy, this was for a short time cause I wasn't able to afford it anymore. We did exercises, and I realized that the problem was worse than I thought. I still face the same issues every day, and I am tired of it.
I live with my parents at the moment, this is very kind, but only temporary. I told them I went through a ""not so nice thing"" and needed to stay for a while, but I need to leave soon.

I decided to apply for a job, I got it, but I backed out because I had male coworkers. I know this probably sounds stupid, but I really couldn't do it. I wanted to so bad, but I couldn't.
I'm trying to find a job right now, so I can move out and move on.
The bills are building up, and I don't feel like there is a way out.

I have tried several therapists (Including online therapists) and did haptonomy therapy.

advice on what I can do?",22Jul2017,1

203,"So here is some background information. I work at a small dental office for the past 18 months. I'm a dental assistant for the last 11 years. [30F] so I work alongside my boss/ dentist all day [ 46M]. I have another boss as well the office manager [63F]. There is another dental assistant and we work together sharing the responsibilities [40F] And two other employees. 

When I started this job it was only for 3 days a week 10 hours day. I just had my daughter she was 4 months old.  I explain to them that I need a job but my family is my number one priority and need a position where they are flexible with me in case my family needs me. Also something less stressful. They said ok I was a perfect fit and I would the 2nd assistant. 

Then the criticism starts. At first it was mostly about my appearance. They didn't like how I had my nails done. My scrubs had to be iron before work. Then I had to buy brown shoes because they didn't like my black ones. Then my pants where to long then to short. They also would check my socks to make sure they matched. They make comments about my hair. 
One day I yawn during a procedure. They brought me in the back to talk about if I'm to tired to have a job and that I'm never allowed to yawn in front of a patient again. I explain that my daughter was up all night and needed a job. He not married and has no children. In fact no one in the office besides has a child younger then 30. 

Next was the performance reviews. I have to sit in this small room with a huge desk while the dentist and office manager discuss how I'm doing. I have had about 8 or more of these meetings. Maybe more I lost count. I can't remember everything thing they said but hear are some highlights of the meetings/ comments they have made to me. 

1. It just seems like your brainless. - dentist 

2. I don't like the way you talk I can't recall anything in particular that you have said that I didn't like. But in general I don't like how you talk. - dentist 

3. I think he's trying to say you sound uneducated. - office manager. 

4. I think you don't have any confidence. - dentist 

5. Your a good assistant but you need to be a great assistant.- both

6. Do your really want your daughter growing up to be like you.( blue collar/ middle class) office manager 

7. Do you have any normal friends. ( my friends are single mothers) - office manager 
 
8. My daughter never has a issue with getting a babysitter. ( my sitter quit with one week notice) on this Day i had enough and said I'm not your fucking daughter. - office manager 

I'm sure there are a lot of other things too. I worked at 6 offices and never had any complaints. I had performance reviews before always good usually got a raise. 
At the last review was 4 days ago I actually cried this time. Witch is not like me at all. I really wish they would just fire me already.

209,"I'm a bit socially awkward, but I started talking to this girl I met on a dating site. She messaged me and liked my profile and I messaged her back and liked her profile. However, she is busy with work and other things so doesn't get on much to check her messages. We have exchanged around 6 messages each (which from what i looked up is acceptable before asking out) for the last 4 or 5 days. The messages consisted me of asking her how she is and about what she does. I don't want to ask too many questions online because I think it'd be better to ask them face to face. So because she is busy and doesn't check every day I was wondering if I should go ahead and ask her.

Also, would this be a good way to ask:

""Hey, I know you are pretty busy, but I think you're an awesome person and would like to get to know you more. Would you like to talk over coffee at Starbucks this Sunday?""?

211,"So, my 5 yr old brother has an Ipad and parents who just want him to stay quiet so his time with the Ipad is barely regulated unless he needs to go to bed, eat, whatever.

I've seen what he watches on YouTube, both on his Ipad and Computer (he sometimes uses the computer if Ipad needs charging) and frankly, it's just SO DISTURBING. I regularly watch disturbing things on the Internet which I kinda regret, but he's a damn child. It's all those damn Spider-man, Elsa, Hulk, etc videos disguising themselves as friendly cartoons to watch, which is far from the truth, perhaps you understand what I'm talking about, many are somewhat sexual and mature, but it's only ""mildly"" adult content which strongly disturbs me, so in a sense, it's friendly enough to be allowed but mature enough to teach him things he's not supposed to know at the age of 5.

I've seen what he watches occasionally, and that's still just rarely, I can't imagine what he has been watching all other times... I'm talking crude animations, GTA mods and... comedy sketches I guess!? All with popular fictional characters like Elsa, Spider-man, The Hulk, etc as clickbait you could say? 

I've seen everything from Spider-man ""kissing"" Elsa where he actually assaults her (leaps out of a toilet and putting her on the ground to kiss her, If it weren't for the neutrality of their faces in the animation it would clearly resemble sexual assault. I've seen Mickey Mouse stab a Dinosaur's foot with a large fork on the thumbnail along with this kinda sh*t: http://i.imgur.com/gLDcFay.jpg

He also watches weird and oddly satisfying truck/anti-stress videos with childish music on but that's less of a concern for me.

I've tried talking to my parents about this (mostly when eating dinner when the subject becomes YouTube, Ipad, my little brother, etc.) but for whatever reason they always shake it off like they're fine with it, I've tried explaining it but they think I'm overreacting/they actually don't understand what I'm trying to explain (again, the videos are kinda... ""mildly"" sexual and I don't want it to seem like I'm deeming a video unwatchable just because the thumbnail features romance between Spider-man and Elsa, and we all know how that ends)

I don't know why, but it's so incredibly difficult to explain it to my normie parents (why they exist in the first place (for easy cash of course), the hidden truth of the cartoon-side of YouTube, you know it) I don't have the damn words for it, I just want to keep my brother from watching something unforgettable... which I fear he already has.

Should I confront my parents in a situation where they have a harder time shaking it off or something else? My parents told me they activated a filter on my brother's Ipad but I still catch him watching animation of someone eating pizza until they die and get buried on YouTube, along with plenty of other things!

I highly doubt they'll magically take the Ipad away from him (it's like the only thing giving my parents enough free time to I dunno drink some Coffee with a neighbor or some sh*t. Or that's what they want me to believe...) Plus, my spoiled little Brother screams A LOT. He ""solves"" most problems with screeching apparently...

So, do you have any experience with the matter and perhaps some advice? It'd be deeply appreciated.",22Jul2017,0
215,"So I'm in my mid-20s, female, and going to my first wedding. Help me not to screw it up.

217,"So heres the story. Were a group of teenage friends, we all grew up on the same lake and theres 5 of us. We're all close more or less and all enjoy each other's company. We're all guys and there's never any of that bitchy drama or fights between us.
So we often hang out at this one person's house in our group who we'll call Johnny. Most hanging out and getting together as a whole group will revolve around him, because were often at his place. If we're not hanging out there, it will be where we start out the day/night at least, its kind of like our home-base if thats how you'd put it.
So Johnny has a (close) cousin. Her (F)amily lives right next to Johnny's. She's a year older than him and lives in the city for college, but for this summer she's up here. She's generally a bit bitchy and also can be stubborn to get her way. On the other hand she's an adventurous person i guess you can say, and will often go far out to do the things she wants, like recently she traveled through Europe, and plan big things like road trips, and I guess you can say she's one of those people who thinks they can do everything. The surprising part is that she kind of can though.
She also kind of has rich parents who pay for a lot for her, and she generally doesn't work often, but also because she's busy with sports and other stuff, not just because she's spoiled. She's also one of those people who you rather like or hate, and she's one of those people who will rather like or hate you. Theres not much else to say about her except for that she's a bit of a tomboy, and that she's a ginger.
I grew up with her for most of my childhood and our families know each other pretty well, and were practically neighbours. I've mostly been on good terms with her myself, and I'm sure with myself that I can say were good and she doesn't hate me, but I can't say the same for someone else in the group, but I'll get into that sooner than later.
So Johnny's cousin, who we'll call Kim, likes to hang out with Johnny a lot, and likes to drag him along for whatever she's doing. Like me, our group is no stranger to Kim. 4/5 of us grew up with her too and all know her pretty well. She'll usually come over to see Johnny when we're there, which we have no problem with, but she will occasionally pull him away from us. Its never awkward when she's here or anything, she can be fun and pretty chill. But every now and then it will be more like its them two and the rest of us, rather than all of us together when were all chilling. Johnny doesn't do anything wrong, he just has trouble saying no to her and letting her down. She can always find a way to turn it against him and he only tries to make everyone happy.
The only part of this whole thing that makes chilling around her the way it is, is because of one of our group members, who we'll call Josh. Josh is a chill guy, (Smokes the most weed out of us all) but probably the most sketchy of us all. (not that we're sketchy, but if it would be anyone, it would be Josh) His parents got divorced when he was a kid and when he was living with his mom (which is Monday through Friday) they lived in a small place that Kim's parents rented out to them across from their house, and it's on their property too. (Josh's mom is friends with Kim's parents)
To Kim, (and her sister a bit) she sees it as an bit of an odd situation and really looks down at Josh, his mom, and his little brother. It's actually not looked like that at all with her parents and everyone else, only Kim. (And her sister) Like she looks at them like their lower class and just simpler people. They're for sure less well off than them but that's about it. Josh has always felt a bit uncomfortable living there and felt a bit unaccepted, and like a leech, but he moved passed that and now lives with his dad most of the time, (who also lives on the lake) but yet its still an odd situation for josh and Kim and she only sees him because we're with him. They're the 2 that don't really talk to each other much and Kim still doesn't really like him, but only tolerates him because he's with us, which is a really bitchy thing to do.
So here's where our story finally starts. So about 5 days ago Kim brought a friend up to stay for the week. We've all been chilling with her more or less, no awkwardness, we're all friends, and me Johnny and another one of us know this girl a bit too, she and her family will occasionally come up from out of province (she lives in Ontario we live in Quebec) to visit us, but its been 2 years since we've seen her, and Kim decided to pick her up and get her over here. And as much as the 3 of us others know her more or less, she's kind of more drawn to Kim this time around, because she's the one who invited her up.
So like I said, everyone was getting along, and the friend and Josh are chill too. Everything is just fine. But today, for whatever reason, things were not. Today everyone was chilling and me and Josh only get there a bit later on then everyone else. It's around 7-8 PM when we get there and no one's there right away. Josh decided to bring his little brother who is around 13-14, but for most kids his age he's surprisingly mature and not hyper, just chill. He just wanted him up 'cause we don't really see him much or have a problem with him, and honestly Josh hasn't even talked to him much this summer until now and all he wanted to do was bring him up here so we can see him.
So anyways, we get there and there's no one. Last I heard, Kim was going to pick up another member of our group. So we're just waiting and about 15 minutes go by before Kim and the friend come in and see us. I ask them if they've seen Johnny, and if they've gone to pick up our guy. Kim say's no to both questions, as they take all their liquor out of the fridge and head.
Later we hear them leaving on her parents pontoon. (Like a boat but square and slow, but for partying) We wait another 15-20 minutes before I say the most-likely obvious that she lied to us and they're out on the pontoon with her and that she didn't even tell Johnny or the others that were here. There's also the thought that they do know and Kim told them we were there, but Johnny would have likely not done much to intervene. Kim definitely wanted to make a good ocassion for her friend who goes back soon and wan
So back to us, Josh is pretty upset and he wasn't having the best day and seeing us, and his brother and everyone together was supposed to make it better for him. His brother didn't seem to be too upset but only didn't want to make things worse. Josh went off saying how Kim is a spoiled bitch and is a child who hasn't grown up, and was pretty sad about how our group is being interfered by her and what not. He's getting a bit depressed and then him and his brother go home. I also go home too. I honestly don't really care too much on what happened.
I for sure lost respect for Kim and ya she's a bitch, but I know nothing's going to change between us 5 guys and that they didn't have any intention of leaving us behind, and that it wasn't their plan. In fact neither me or Josh really cared about going on board to party, it's just that she lied to us so we didn't know where they were. I get how she wouldn't have wanted a little kid and his older brother who she disrespects both of to be chilling with them all, (I honestly don't know if I would be on board if Josh and his bro weren't there) but it's a really shitty thing to do when you can literally just say: ""Oh yeah, there with me right now"".
Why I am posting this is because I'm very confused on how to approach this situation. What do I say the next day to the other guys? What do I say to Kim? Do I even bother confronting her?? And what about Josh?? He seemed really upset and he gets depressed every now and then.
Edit: Sorry this is so long, ik i could've been cut down a lot, will fix soon.

227,"So recently, my friend I met at an old job, asked to hang out recently. Problem is now he's gotten himself into a Pyramid Scheme. He asked me to go learn about a new job opportunity available. But I said, I already am employed and do not wish to leave, but I went anyways because well I should go just to see him.

Turns out I went there, everyone in suits, business attire.
They talk about selling medical insurance to low income families.
TO join, you must pour in $125 and $80 in membership fees and test training/licensing. Then you pay $800 and must refer your friends and family to buy medical insurance or pay for 7702 tax.

It was sad that people do fall prey to this. People were literally absorbed at the slideshows and how the lady and guy were speaking how they were making six figures at a hospital and graduated with a bachelors. But left it all to join this company, where they can take vacations and have ""residual income"" by referring others and having them run your business for you!

You can be that multi-billionaire/Millionaire that owns a yacht, a mansion and a sports car. The entire speech, I was thinking pyramids and pyramids and tried not to laugh when he called himself a Multi-Millionaire. His friends are multi-millionaires, his friends friends. pffffffft.

However, my friend doesn't want to leave. He really believes by referring all his friends and family to this scheme, he can become a multi-millionaire. Problem is, he's also attached to other friends of mine. He could pull them in too, this will end up in a really bad triangle or square, rectangle or pentagon, whatever.

I don't know how to convince him this is a fake scheme designed to squeeze money out of all new people for membership fees, books, recordings, tapes seminars, travel tickets.

I don't know if it's against the rules to declare what company this is. But for sure this is a pyramid scheme, as ""multi-millionaire"" management confirmed to me, that all pay is 100% commission based and you must work hard to earn to become Independent Business Owner that will earn billions!
There are no benefits, or anything. You are an independent contractor and just make money selling fake insurance and tax forms 7702 (wtf is 7702). Referring people to join the company too, but they must join and pay membership fees and stuff before you get paid.
Or so they say....

Thank you all for taking time to read this. But this is really all bad. It's making me mad, because I'm taking freetime after work to go to this forsaken place and waste hours talking to them, how I don't want to join, the management/recruiters are very pushy.",22Jul2017,1
233,"I'm a College student who just started studying Computer Engineering. I've had my Hp Envy for about 4-5 years now and just got its RAM upgraded from 4GB to 8GB, and seen pretty good performance improvements. 

However, I dropped some soda on it quite a while ago, and while the laptop survived, the keyboard kinda sticks and its hard to type on it. I've been saving up for getting a new one for a while, but I'm having second thoughts because I might want to get something besides an OK-ish gaming laptop (yes they suck compared to a gaming PC, but portability! also, I don't have a decided place decided to live yet, so I don't want to be held down by moving it around and spoiling it)


I play games regularly and it plays some of the old ones I bought on steam pretty ok-ish (Previously, it played Borderlands 2 at around 15-25 FPS, haven't checked it out since I upgraded a few months ago), and the previous semester, I HEAVILY relied on my library's computers to do most of my work because of it, and since its the summer time and the lib's times are more limited, I'm kinda struggling to do most of my work.

The cost of the total repair is going to be around 120 USD which is kinda heavy for a student like me, but I can dip into my budget for the repair and use the rest for something else.

TL;DR: Recently upgraded my laptop from 4 to 8 GB and the keyboard on that computer is messed up. Have some savings and I don't know if I should fix the keyboard and get something new or wait until I can get a decent gaming laptop which will definitely have a better keyboard",22Jul2017,1
