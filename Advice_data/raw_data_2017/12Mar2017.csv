0,"Hi I don't know how to begin this so I guess ill just jump in. 

I'm currently a junior in high school along with my friend and his girlfriend. Myself along with a few other friends had learned that his girlfriend has been cheating on him with another friend (I say friend but we're not that close ) of ours that happens to be a senior. I'm not sure what to do now, ever since I've learned about this I cant look at her the same along with the guy she is cheating with. 

I've never been in this position before so I'm not sure what to do if I should even do anything at all. If I were in his shoes I would want to know but at the same time this isn't any of my business. Am I just being a bad friend by knowing and not saying anything? or should I tell him what is going on? ",12Mar2017,3

3,"..through my brother. I always get snickered at and laughed at, or sometimes I hear someone say ""why are you talking to *her*?"" To the person that's talking to me. My brother does discriminate based on looks , he will not talk to any girl that's 'ugly' for example. He also told me that when people laugh or smirk at someone it's because they thought the person did something 'stupid' , 'lame', or 'awkward'. And the one time he talked to a girl that was below average , all his friends , especially girls said ""*___(name), why are you talking to her*?"" Well.. wow, that explains a lot for me. I dislike my peers even more after what I'm hearing. He told me more too, but I don't want to make this into a super long post. But now I'm seeing a bit more clearly what's really happening. It's all about social status in high school, and people try to indirectly assert their superiority and worth by trying to highlight the flaws of others (for example a person who has differing opinions than majority, or maybe is gay, or simply someone who is not attractive, anything really).My brother is relatively involved with 'populars'. Me , on the other hand, I'm a loner for the most part. Everybody thinks I'm strange and always laughs at me. I  understand why, now. It's my unfortunate looks, maybe my mannerisms, and I have interests that differ from the majority , and lastly probably other things that I have no clue about but are considered 'weird'. I really look forward to getting out of this place. Is college any better? Or even .. after college? Is this how most of the world actually is , or is this mostly limited to high school? I don't know what to think...I just don't want to live a life being alone and undesirable, for who knows how long (or even indefinitely). 

Edit : I want to say thanks to the replies I've received , it really helps to hear some of these things. ",12Mar2017,9
4,"Nobody is perfect. We all make mistakes. But for the past years it seems that all I've been doing is making mistakes. I've always been an easy going person, not worrying about my future a lot, but this has led me to a situation where I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. But let me start from tge begining.
When I graduated highschool I was so excited about the future. I applied to uni without much thought. But after the first semester I understood that the programme I had chosen just didn't interest me. Even tho my parents were not very happy they agreed that I can change uni. Education in my country is pretty cheap but also not very good, so they didn't mind that much about me leaving. So the next year I went to study abroad in Netherlands. And in the beggining it seemed to be going well. But soon I picked up some really bad habbits. I got kinda addicted to weed (I know you can't get physicaly addicted to weed, but psychologically, i just couldn't stop buying), I started drinking a lot. On top of that I realised that I hate what I am learning here as well. As a result my grades started slipping. And as my grades got worse, I started smoking and drinking more. It turned into a vicious cycle. And now I'm at a point where I'm getting kicked out of my current uni. My parents have paid a lot of money for me to come here and I have just fucked up so bad. During my time here I have also lost contact with the few people I considered friends back home. And being an introvert person I haven't really made a lot of new friends here either. The few ones I have are all stoners and drunks. And since I have been trying (and somewhat succeeding ( which you could say is the one of few good things that I've done)) to quit weed and booze, I don't want to hang out with them either.
On top of all that, I have found out, that a girl from my country with whom I had a long distance relationship has been cheating on me. She is the only person I have ever been together with. We got together by her initiative so I don't know how or if I will ever meet someone else (as I mentioned earlier I am a very introvert person and I just don't know how to meet women)
At this point I don't know what to do with my social, love or academic life and it is making me depressed and I feel stressed all the time. I don't know how to tell my parents that I've been kicked from uni, I don't have any real friends here or back home and I my love life is as empty as can be. At this point looking back, it just seems I have wasted three years of my life just fucking around and I have no idea what I want to do with my life.
TL;DR I have wasted a lot of my parents money by getting kicked out of uni, I have lost all my friends, my love life is nonexistent and I have wasted 3 years of my life with nothing to show or be happy about. Does anyone have any advice for a loser like myself?",12Mar2017,5
7,"So earlier on today I was going out to a party with a friend of mine. I got some food before we met up, but as I was coming out of the food place I dropped a €20.00 note out of my pocket. Not realising, I walked on a few steps until a lovely lady in a car driving by stopped to tell me what had happened. Checking my pocket, I realised she was right, and turned around to see a man pick up my money. Used to this, I calmly walked up and explained that he had just picked up my money. Despite literally just watching him, he said that he hadn't picked up anything. I elaborated on what happened, but the guy refused to give me my money back. Running into my friend I was supposed to be meeting up with, I had to ignore her while I tried to get my cash back. I pleaded with the guy - who was a large man looking to be in his 50s or 60s - but he threatened to call the police on me for ""accosting"" him, and then threatened to throw me under a passing car. Spotting a police car driving by, I immediately ran after to explain the situation to them and ask if there was anything they could do. They were very helpful, and say they'd turn their car around to try find the guy, but that there wasn't a whole lot that could be done. I ran back up the street afterwards, but couldn't find the guy again. 

It wasn't a huge amount of money in the grand scheme of things, and I'm lucky enough to have a decent amount of money besides that, but twenty euro is still twenty euro, and since that I've been pissed off about the whole situation. I've just never run into such an asshole before. 

Anyway, I'm basically wondering if there's anything I could've done differently that would've helped me get my money back. Like I said, I was going out to a party, so I didn't want to start anything and end up missing it, but I feel there must be something I could have done. Maybe tried to get a picture of the guy? Though I'm not entirely sure about the legalities of photograophy without permission. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks for reading (I know it was long, sorry).",12Mar2017,1

17,"Recently, I have asked a girl out, (this Friday) in which we're both in middle school, (yes, it's probably way too early, and it will be short, but I want to see what would happen if she said yes.)-- and I need help on deciding on what she means when I asked her out. She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, yet.. nobody but me has asked her out, and we're both at the top of our class, same one. Straight A+ grades in all subjects, mind you. I love her great personality, and her straight-forward approach to everything, but not too much when I asked her to be my girlfriend.

Every time her friends whispered to her, calling my name, I saw that she couldn't help but smile and blush, while at the same time saying them to shut up. Her eyes were so meaningful when I told her to meet me after school.
A couple of weeks, including this one, she'd glance at me and I'd see her in the corner of my eye, and when we made eye contact, we immediately turned. 
Sometimes I'd see her trying to hide her eyes with her hair and look sideways, trying to see if I was interested.

I was 100% certain she'd say yes.

I was totally sure she was into me, maybe really is. I took a shower, dressed in moderately nice clothes, and went on to greet the day. The tests of this week have almost been dropped to B's because of me thinking about her, but I've barely kept it above an A- average.

I want to keep the straight A's, the fully participating, fully engaged, and nice personality that is needed in a successful relationship.

When I asked her out this Friday, she said, ""I'll think about it."" I was so confused. I felt like I pressured her. This trimester has been one of the most stressful, with our teachers trying to come down on not paying attention. I don't want to force anything upon her.

It was her first time being asked out, and I don't know if she is really interested... Half of the time, I think about her, but I know she doesn't think about me. Men crave a woman's body, unfortunately, and I can't but think of being in a happy, long relationship. I hate this even more by saying this, but I want sexual contact with her, even though I know this will never happen.

My brain is at so much of a crossroads right now.

Currently, I am now seeking advice for the following: A) Dealing with a possible rejection. B) Talking to her to say yes, even though it may hurt like fucking hell and may be extremely hard to do (after asking her out). C) Coming up with possible reasons why she said, ""I'll think about it."" D) Being a respectful, sensitive, and reasonable boyfriend who doesn't get her into trouble. E) Placing education over love.

How come she said, ""I'll think about it.""? Her friends told me she definitely liked me. It's either a no, a yes, or she really is thinking about it. If she is thinking about it, maybe it's because she thinks it's going to play out into her grades. Her parents are restrictive, most likely, and she doesn't want to disappoint them by having herself go out with a random kid. I hate the idea of randomly being yelled at by her parents... I'm not a pedophile! It's just manhood! There's so much to take in, I can barely think about any of these possibilities...

Out of all of these, however, I believe it's because I went too fast. I didn't really build a connection with her, but my hormones want to stick to her and try to salvage anything that's left.

Should I get to know her better? If so, please, please, please tell me some conversation starters or something, I can't even imagine me talking to her anymore after that. Maybe her friends will laugh at me... If I do it at the wrong time, I'm sure I'll feel even more insecure myself.

I am trying to be patient, but I hate the response she gave me. I know she is an unsure girl. Is there any way I can comfort her, and get her to say yes?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I will thank you for the rest of your life if you help me.
Even if she meant a no, it's hard for me to imagining walking past her and having relapses of a failed try.
Should I get to know what she likes, what she thinks her life is going to be like? We both want to be doctors, but me specifically, I want to be a traumatic cardiothoracic surgeon, (lots of work and too much to pay for medical school, but I will try).
If you want to know more, please ask me and I will think of some things that we could have in common.
I know there's too much to take in for y'all that are reading this, but I need one more thing-- how am I supposed to respond if she says no? I have about 12 days to do this.

I may sound like a pussy, or a kid who has too many expectations, too much dedication to a failed ""asking out,"" and a kid who is letting puberty take advantage of them, but I am in need of some desperate relationship advice. I'm heartbroken as hell, and I just need a bit of support, not to sound like an attention-whore.

And, for those of you who are wondering how old I am, I am thirteen and a half, and I actually look moderately attractive, (judging from what I've looked at in the mirror). The crush I'm trying to ask out is an Indonesian-American (pretty weird, right?), and I'm Chinese-American.

Please be realistic. I don't want a straight answer of ""no, she won't say yes to you when you talk again"" without any explanations. If you need more background, again, ask me.

Any answers will be greatly appreciated, and I will owe you a debt for life for helping me settle into my first relationship.

Thanks in advance.",12Mar2017,3

23,"When I started college two years ago, I met this beautiful girl (Joy) and was absolutely astonished by her. The looks, the style, the smarts, the humor, the hotness. She could just drag my sight towards her by smiling (she has kind of a devilish sexy smirk that drives me nuts). I saw a fascinating creature, the kind that you just wanna know more about. 
She was in another class and had a guy chasing her since junior high and he was in college with us as well, so he asked her to be his GF and she said yes. I was kinda disappointed but whatever. 
I got to know them both more and got along with them just fine, but she never stopped calling my attention even a little bit. 
A year later I met a girl of my class (Cara) on a week long college trip, but I never really noticed her before the trip. She was pretty and honestly hot. We ended up liking each other and started dating and I was really happy. Cara and Joy were friends since their childhood but not extremely close. After some time, Cara became my GF and everything was great since she is a loving, amazing girl.
One day Cara and I were talking about past relationships and she told me that two of her boyfriends had cheated on her with Joy. She said Joy always had guys chasing her and that she was fine with it after all the time that went by. From that point my dormant interest in Joy went sky high and it has been since then.
Joy is still with her boyfriend (which dropped out of college to dedicate to his band) and I'm with Cara, but a day does not go by that I don't think about Joy and how much desire she makes me feel.
Joy has a group of friends I'm not close to, but I try to reach out to her as much as I can because she is super cool and we get along just fine, but not as much as I would like to. I'm still with Cara and have great feelings for her, but I can't shake Joy out of my head. I would never cheat on any GF, never had.
Sometimes I think that Joy gave a such a high as a woman, that I haven't felt ever since. I was dumbstruck by her, with Cara on the other side it was a slow process, but never felt that ""flashed"" by her.
A friend told me to follow the one that gave me the high I haven't recovered from, but I don't want to break up with a great girl such as Cara for what could just be a super crush.
What should I do to make peace with the fact that Joy is unreachable right now and that if I'm to try something with her, now is not the time, and it may never be.",12Mar2017,9

It’s going to be very exciting for me to move on to the next stage in my life as a college student, and just in time because my daily High School life is really starting to get old. Once I complete my core classes, I plan on becoming a journalism major at -----------, as I have a passion for writing and have had many teachers from around my school acknowledge my writing abilities as significantly better than my peers from -----------. My goals are not simple, and will require a great deal of hard work, but I believe with the proper amount of effort from my end I can become a successful writer in an age where the ability to write has fallen off the deep end among young people.
	While ----------- has not been traditionally known for having a strong journalism program, I believe that I have the ability as a student to change this. I believe I can become a student who future journalism students at ----------- can look to as someone who helped make the program stronger. I want to be a person who is listed on the alumni page as someone who was a role model for the young writers at -----------, a person whose efforts in college helped him land a prestigious journalism job at a successful news company, and can be looked to as an example of how dedication to your passion can indeed make you successful in the demanding world we live in today.
	There’s definitely going to be some late nights where i’m not going to feel motivated to work hard on whatever it is I have to do to keep my grades up in the next few years. However, I will then make sure to remember the dedication my parents put into the first 18 years of my life just to get me to college, and how hard I worked as a student during High School to earn my own way to college, i’ll also be sure to picture my future, reminding myself that the choices I make now directly impact where i’ll be as an adult. A rumor has spread around recently in the news and other places about how the industry of journalism is dying, while I know this is false due to the research i’ve conducted, it’s still up to young writers like me to dictate the future of the industry. There is still value to telling the truth in the news, and there is still value to informing the public of what is happening around them with integrity, us young writers have a unique responsibility to be excellent in what we do.
	My family is counting on me to be what they raised me to be, which is a respectful and responsible person. My High School teachers are counting on me to live up to the potential they know I have as a student. My college is counting on me to be someone who can be looked at as a role model for future students, and as someone who revamped the journalism program. My future employer is relying on me to be a skillful and reliable writer who boosts the success of the company. Last but not least, my future self is relying on the decisions I make now to be the right ones, the responsible ones, so I can live a healthy and productive life as an adult.

I have, for several months, been wanting to move the relationship with my girlfriend forward and was originally pondering asking her to move in with my flatmate and myself, I quickly came to the conclusion that that would be somewhat infringing on my flatmates privacy and got the impression after hinting a few times that he wasn't up for such a thing.

I've proposed the idea of moving out and getting an apartment with my girlfriend and she is incredibly excited about the idea (in fact it's one of the happiest moods I've seen her in); my only issue now is how to break this news to my flatmate.

I've never been that great with expressing my feelings and my flatmate has always had a tendency to be very strongly opinionated and not particularly empathetic, nowadays I very rarely share with him my feelings on matters as he usually very rapidly dismisses them.

I want to tell him that my thoughts on the matter of moving out are quite concrete yet I don't want to hurt his feelings or make him feel like I don't want to live with him anymore/enjoy living with him.
I also want to try my best to support him in finding someone else to live with in our flat as he cannot afford to live there by himself (we share all funds/costs, from bills to groceries) and it would be unfair to be the cause for him losing the ability to live in a place he truly considers home now.

Furthermore I am the only one out of the both of us who discusses any pressing matters with our landlord, and although I set us up with the apartment originally I am not sure how to tackle the situation of telling my landlord of my intentions.

Any advice or explanations of anyone's first hand experiences on such a topic would be unbelievably appreciated. Any help at all.
Thanks.",12Mar2017,1

I'm 16, Male. And I've come to like a girl (I know surprising). We only talked once but I'd like to get to know her. More importantly, her group of friends. They all seem like nice people and I'd love to hang out with them or at least get to know them at school.

One of my friends goes to their hangout spot, but he only comes to school a couple days a week, and doesn't always go to that location. So it's hard to find an opportunity to try and make friends. I really can't see myself walking up to them, and becoming friends. But I want it so bad. I want to at least try. 

I need some motivation, something to make me just do it already. I know some of these people. I know I might be judged by my current friend group, as they make fun of that kind of stuff, but I doesn't matter.

I just want to be happy. And you can't blame a guy for trying to make friends. Of course, I haven't tried yet.

I told him that I'd only get into a relationship if I knew him for three months and he agreed to my terms.

59,"Without going into too many details, a family member of mine that lives with me has severe mental health issues. This leads my family member to make very poor life choices and I end up having to always fix them at great cost. 

I took my family member in 2 years ago to help them since they had no where to go, and initially I was willing to help, but now it almost feels like I am being taken advantage of. Like my family member is just going to do what they want and doesn't care how it is affecting me.

Additionally, sometimes people enable my family member and think they're helping them, but they are only making things worse... but these people don't listen to me. 

I know my family member struggles with making the right choices. I also know that they can make the right choices, it's just very hard. So sometimes they just give in without trying because it's too hard. But sometimes it feels like they don't even want to try because they just want to do what they want to do.

In any event, I am struggling. I want my family member to live a good life, and I want to help, but I also don't know how much longer I can take paying in time/money for their bad choices. It's affecting me mentally- I feel like I am losing it. Currently there are a group of people enabling my family member's bad behavior, and when it's all said and done, I am going to pay a lot of money and spend a lot of time fixing this problem.

60,"I'm a senior in college (University of Colorado) and spring break is coming up in two weeks. I have two options. 

Option 1. Visit Penn State, a school where many of best friends from high school go. Other friends would probably also visit from home/the college I transferred from. I'd get to see a ton of people and know I'd have a good time. (I'd be partying/doing drugs all week) I've went to Penn State quite a few times over the years and love it there, and I'm excited at the thought of going again. (I thought winter was my last time there) There are quite a few people there who I will not see again for awhile.

Option 2: Go camping with my college friends (7 day trip out west through Utah, Arizona, Colorado). There are a lot of people going on the trip (~8) and many all my close friends. I've never been camping besides music festivals so this would be a first for me. The idea hasn't appealed me to to be honest and when I thought of going to Penn State I became legitimately excited for spring break. I probably will not see many of my friends going on this trip for awhile either after we graduate in 2 months. 

A few things:
-I can't do both
-Cost is not a factor
-I'm not particularly into nature (im not sure if enough for 7 days)

62,"Hi, reddit! Some advice would be appreciated.  

I'm a 20 year old female and I have a crush on my coworker. I've liked him for about 8 months ( I know, much too long). In October he mentioned his girlfriend during a conversation. I recently found out he is now single.

Here's the thing, before I found out about his gf, I had a feeling he was interested in me and I still think he is. He supposedly broke up with her in December and that was around the time he started saying hi to me first, starting conversations whenever he could and asking me what I like and don't like, looking/staring at me at times etc. Maybe he was doing that to see if I was a new potential date/gf for him? Mind you, he is very reserved and might even be a bit shy. I have observed him around others and I'm the only one who he seems to make an effort in talking to.

We work at a grocery store and we're both cashiers so the only time I can talk to him is when we're next to each other on the registers. I was next to him today and I could not even bring myself to say hi. It was incredibly busy so I was trying to wait for a moment that we both had no customers to say something but that never came. 

It just doesn't make sense, I've had many conversations with this guy that went well and now all of a sudden I can't even say hi. I'm wondering if he wanted to say hi to me as well. He did say goodnight when he left and after that I felt like an idiot. I should be able to say hi. How do I expect to ever get anywhere with him if I can't? 

It seems to me that whenever a long period of time passes from our last conversation, the harder it is to be able to say something to him again despite me talking to him before. I'm literally moving backwards with him. I finally have a chance, especially because I'm 90% sure he's into me, and I can't even talk to him at times. 

My plan was to talk to him as much as possible and hope he makes a move but clearly this isn't working. Or I could ask him out but I know when the moment comes, I won't be able to.

This is so frustrating. Why can't I be anyone but me? I need to either move on or man the hell up (women the hell up?) and talk to him and/or ask him out myself. 

So finally, after all of my explaining (Thanks to whoever read this far) how can I learn to not be so nervous? How can I talk to him when it seems so hard to do? I know I should just do it and not overthink it but I can't help it. This is the way I've always been. 

TD;LR: I have a crush on my coworker who I'm pretty sure is into me too. Despite having many successful conversations with him, I can't seem to bring myself to talk to him at times. He's finally single, I have a chance but I'm screwing it up. How in the world can I learn not to be so nervous and just talk to him?

68,"I sprained my ankle in August and have been in excruciating pain since. I know it sounds like it's no big deal, right? That's what everyone has been telling me since I got injured. I walked on it when the doctor said it was nothing to worry about, but then the pain got worse. Three weeks later, I was unable to bear any weight on it. It turns out I had torn ligaments and micro fractures.

I haven't walked without crutches in 5 months, and I am nowhere near recovered. I left college in the U.S. in December and now live with my parents in rural China. I'm miserable because I can neither read nor write in Chinese and I barely speak the language (I grew up in the U.S.). I know no one here, have no relatives who care about me, and have no access to Facebook/pretty much all American websites due to heavy Internet censorship. Life here is rough for me - I live in a 225 sq. ft. studio with my parents and sometimes there's no heat. 

My parents and relatives think I'm crazy for saying that I can't bear weight on my right foot without severe pain. I'd like to get another MRI but my family refuses to order one because they think I'm just being a hypochondriac . I don't know Mandarin or else I'd go to the hospital myself. 

I've seriously contemplated suicide - every night I've been having nightmares about overdosing or drowning. I'm not myself these days. I resent my parents for having returned to their motherland 6 years ago when I was a sophomore in high school. I also resent my family for being so nonchalant about my injury - the other day, my uncle told me that I'm exaggerating my injury and that maybe I just got lazy. 

Before my injury, I was happy. I'm on a full ride at school, so I won't need to worry about college debt. I also have a good group of friends. Now I have no one to talk to, I've gained weight, and I'm in excruciating pain even when I'm sitting.

I know no one will truly care if I left this world. Life will go on. Maybe my parents will care, but they've been so sick of me lately that I doubt they'd mind if I died. If they truly cared about me, they wouldn't have permanently left me alone in the U.S when I was fifteen. Living with them is extremely uncomfortable - they don't want me here. They also dislike each other, but still live together because they can't afford separate homes. I can't bear the pain anymore and it doesn't feel like I'll be able to walk for another year.

Recently I graduated in engineering after wanting to finish my degree. I was a slacker when I was younger, I could not settle and be a model student, I couldn't focus on the usual path. When it comes to learning, my brain is ravenous. I want to learn about literally EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME. I love nature and spend alot of time fantasizing about traveling and getting away, I'm from the Caribbean, lived in the UK and now the US,so its not like I havent adressed this feeling.My friends are all married with kids and sometimes I think I want that but the thought of going to work day in day out coming home to a wife and kid day in day out scares me to the point of anxiety. I am not an average bachelor, im not a player and I dont have regular girlfriends, when I do, I choose them carefully because 1) I know I am a decent guy, I'm loving, loyal and take a lot of interest in the woman I am with (same with my friends and fam) 2) I value my time, if we arent comaptible, I just dont want to waste it. I'd rather be outside or thinking or learning. I've come to the point where I'm afraid that I'll get stuck in the day to day an entry level at 35 and never do the things I feel are vital, I feel like I am bursting, like I am never content with life and want to disappear in some far off place. I have a hard time sleeping bc I'm always thinking, I've been taking sleeping pills for 10 years, I have an older brother with cerebral palsy and our family is not rich or well off and I worry about that alot, like I need to man up.

75,"TL;DR: A close friend of mine is possibly becoming romantic with a guy who has assaulted me, I don't know whether to say something and risk my close friend mis-interpret it, or say nothing and risk my close friend getting hurt.

Hello, I'm in need of advice of what to say to a friend, or if I should even say anything. Basically, I have a close friend (we'll call Taylor), who is also close friends with a guy who is quite the asshole when Taylor isn't around (we'll call him Caleb).

Basically, I've known Caleb as long as I can remember. We used to be friends when we were really young (like, first or second grade), but then Caleb became an asshole and I found friends elsewhere. I still remain near Caleb quite a bit, and he has assaulted me both verbally and physically over the past few years, sometimes in front of Taylor. The crowd that Caleb hangs out with isn't too much better, either. They'll often catcall women, and just be general douchebags.

As for Taylor, she has been friends with both Caleb and I since about the 4th grade. We've all graduated High School now, and Taylor is coming back into town over Spring Break to visit everyone, including Caleb and Myself. I'll text Taylor tomorrow to be sure, but there may be romantic feelings between Taylor and Caleb. For the record, I think of Taylor as nothing more than a good friend, and have no desire to take it beyond that.

The reason I'm unsure if Taylor and Caleb are becoming romantic is because I have overheard Caleb brag about his ""girlfriend Taylor"" that was coming to town, yet Taylor hasn't mentioned anything about Caleb being her boyfriend as her and I have talked.

Should I say anything to Taylor about Caleb? She's been a really close friend to me, and the last thing I want is to see her hurt by Caleb, but at the same time, I don't want it to come across as me trying to make Caleb look bad so Taylor will date me instead of him.

76,"I have a conundrum that has recently been a huge problem at my work.

I want to start out by saying I have worked at my job for 4 years, 7 total in the industry, and really love it. I work hard and know that I am a good worker. But this issue has pushed me to the point of walking out. (And maybe that's the real answer to this problem!) 

In the last year my workplace has been put under new management. My new General Manager was promoted from within the company and we were all pretty excited to work with him even though he was from a different location. His qualifications are good even though he doesn't have a lot of management experience. I was one of a group that tried our best to make the transition easy for him by working very hard and showing him how things were done. My co-workers and I are a tight group and we really just want the best.

The issue is, as we all have found out, that the new GM is a people-pleaser. I mean this in the sense that you can have a great one-on-one chat with him that will make you feel heard and make you feel very positive about the issue, but then later you'll find out that he has basically ignored you.....or even worse he will talk about you to corporate in a very negative way. One by one my group of trusted co-workers have been replaced by GMs own buddies. I recently was up for a raise. I was promised by GM that he would ""do everything in his power to get me the maximum raise"" but in the end I was only given 50% of what I was promised.

I recognize this now as him really just lying to people. I know he talks about his employees in a demeaning way to our corporate overlords, but how should I confront him about this? I personally have a really hard time working for people who disrespect me as a human being.",12Mar2017,1

80,"It might sound like an easy question, but it isn't. I've been split for the longest time on whether I should ever have a relationship or not, or even if I should have children.

The reason is because my father was a mentally ill person, though functional enough, me being alive and functional is a miracle on its own. The fact the guy ever managed to make children is yet another miracle.

It doesn't come without its problems. There's something very evil in my genes, very bad which I only manage to control because my mother is a very good person. To the point that I believe I'm a good person because I have a lot of her in me.

The thing is of course once again, myself being alive came with the price of how functional I am. I'm in college right now, which is a good proof of functionality, but I have very bad spatial awareness, I can't drive well, anything mechanical or where I'd have to manually work with something I usually mess up at first, and I have a lot of issues when it comes to relationships and people.

Essentially, there's a lot in me that I don't want to pass to somebody else. A part of me don't want to have children for he sake of the child having my blood. My father was in a coma for the longest period due to his illness, and even though that hasn't happened to me, or anything really bad has, it's still in my genes and could be worse to my child. My child could grow to have schizophrenia, or other horrible mental illness which I didn't have (nor my dad), but that's where lightning stroke them same spot twice and I'm not counting on a third time.

Another part of me don't want to be alone and there's the issue that my mother wants grandchildren from me, which isn't easy either.

I think not having a child given all the issues she would have plus my incompetence on being able to make her happy would be the most selfless thing to do.

On the other hand, ignoring all that and bringing a child to the world without the problems in my blood would be bowing down to my ego instead of letting go.

Figuratively, not literally.* Maybe I should just focus on myself, get super toned, get my own place and my career straightened out the right one will come and find me after. *But in the meantime I'm awake and it's late and I'm just so fucking lonely.* Maybe I'm not attractive. *Fuck, I'm hideous.* I need to stop doing this to myself, just say no in the heat of the moment, just go home. *I always end up running home anyway, while I'm here maybe one more 'why not'.*

88,"Hi, guys! I have a problem with people in general. Here is a quick background.

I was bullied from early childhood, so I became very shut in. If there was one person who showed me a little simapthy and stuck around, I considered them my best friend. I would always try to meet up with them, I got really envious when they went out with someone else, and I had seperation anxiety when I felt they were getting away. 

The bullying stopped in middle school, but my behaviour stayed the same: I would put all my eggs in one basket. It was like I was in love with my best friends. Of course, they all left me in the end.

Now, I'm finishing high school, and it's gotten a little better. I can have more than one friend at a time. I don't get hurt as easily after a seperation, until the last incident.

I got myself a best friend again. She was OK, but as time went on I realized she is incredibely dumb, and she behaves in a very odd manner. She is so nice and sweet to me, but it's gotten so bad, I want to beat her up sometimes, so I tend to stay away to not hurt her.

So, either I get dumped all the time, or I get to know the person better and I get very disappointed. 

How do I deal with disappointment? How do I deal with loneliness when I can talk to none of my friends? How to I deal with getting dumped?

93,"Hi,

I currently need advice on either any 1-2 programs to master or become a jack of all trades (programs wise) person.

**Background:**

* I am 27 years old and when i passed through high school, I left my studies as I got a job which payed very well. But after 5 or so years with little to no progression, I enrolled myself in an under graduate program.

* Another bit of information is that I live in a 3rd world Country and do not have access to many avenues that are common in the 1st world.

* Currently I am in my 4th semester of a program called Building and Architecture"" which is more related to Architecture but has some Civil engineering sprinkled on top. We have been taught basic autocad, which I fumbled on my own and am now somewhat able in it. I have also played around with 3ds max but have no major understanding of it.

**Now the problem is this.**

1. I am not very smart. lets just get that of the way. 
One of my teacher is saying that I should focus on AutoCAD, 3ds Max, photoshop and progress in that vein. 

2. One of my senior told me to complete my undergraduate and for my post graduate move to MBA in project management.

3. Another person also told me that I could apply for the certification programs in Estimation and Quantity surveyor (both separate certifications). This can be done with my current program but would exhaust me to no end. 

I like all 3 options, however I don't have much data on what the job situation is regarding each route. I would love to be able all 3 options but that isn't realistic at this moment. 

If I should choose option 1, than what other softwares should I focus on? or should I focus on just a couple of softwares and ignore other as to not stretch myself too thin? 

Option 2 is about my post graduate. I want to study further than just graduation as I am 27 now and have a big gap to cover over all the lost time. 

Option 3 is Certification.

I would like to hear your thoughts regarding this and if there is any other option that I have missed out, please do tell me.

Thank you for any type of advice you may have.

I also posted this in /r/architecture /r/EngineeringStudents and /r/Advice . If there is any other subreddit that would be helpful for me to collect data, please do tell. Again Thanks. ",12Mar2017,2

102,"Hey,

First of all, I am sorry I made an anonymous account for this. I just can't let my friends to see what feelings I have. I try to act quite differently in real life. If this is a problem and against the rules, I, again, apologize and understand it completely.

My life otherwise is superb. I have two children, wife and we don't (really) have any money problems. But there's a big but. I am in a job that anyone could get without any degree at all. It pays enough to pay for the rent and support my family, but I don't enjoy it at all and I feel like everyone else thinks (well, of course myself included) I am under performing. I am quite shamed about this. 

I have been applying for jobs in my field but there just does not seem to be anyone to hire me. I know I could learn quick but I think my age starts to be a problem and since I took quite long to complete my Master's program, I guess don't look like an enthusiastic potential employee even though when I get to a task I enjoy, I can spend literally hours straight hooked into solving it. If I could go back 10 years, I would tell myself that I shouldn't apply for a university. To this day, I don't have any studies-relevant job experience.

I know basics of a lot of IT and EE-related. I can code somewhat efficiently in C, understand microcontrollers etc, so grasping new concepts even in ""bubble"" fields like webdesign shouldn't be all that hard for me. But there's again a big but. I can't get myself to study anything independently because I fear that I just use more time for nothing. I bought several Udemy etc. courses but I just keep feeling subconsciously that they just do not help at all. Also, with a basic eight-hour day job plus children and wife... I really have no time at all to hone my skills.

**tl;dr: No proper job. Applied, no one seems to hire me. Frustrated. Can't get myself to study independently because I feel I will just lose more years. No time for studying either?**

I am really looking for advice what to do, help, mocks, laughs and possibly friends in same position that I am in. Everything helps and writing this already vented out some of my frustration. I haven't really talked about this to anyone. I just absolutely feel garbage when someone asks me why I am in a job like this.

Thanks and sorry if this was against the rules or the wrong place.",12Mar2017,1
103,"We were out drinking. This guy hits on every single women he meets. I've known this one girl for 5 years and she just became single. I said ""wow, she is single now, I'm going to ask her out."" He said ""good luck, I'm going to get her number first."" 

I got kind of upset because every girl he has hit on, I had let him have, even if I told him I thought she was cute. I even helped him out. This time though, I've had a crush on her from the moment I met her. We haven't kept in touch much, but I see her every once in awhile. I told him "" out of every women I've liked, you've asked them out, which is fine, but this one time I want to ask her off limits from you."" He fucks up every relationship he has had. He fucks them and ditches them or they see how douchey he is.

Well, he gets all uppity and says ""I want happiness too man! I don't care that you like her, I'm getting her number"". I get upset and say ""hey man, seriously, this is beyond woman at this point. If you can't respect this, I don't think I could be friends with you. It's one woman out of dozens I have let you have. Why can't you just let this one be."" And he responds with ""why should i? I don't care, I'm going to get her number and don't be such a bitch about it.""

He asked her out and she refused. So He left me at the bar, stole my $250 shirt I let him borrow and my $200 vape pen. I owed him $100 for some stuff 3 years ago, but I've been paying him every time I had money. He refuses to give me stuff back until I give him the rest.

113,"I've an issue that has been making me rather paranoid as of late. There is an unknown person in my life who knows details of my life and appears to be expressing a malicious intention.

I dont do any social media so I lack a Facebook account. This unknown person made a false Facebook account of me. They invited my cousin (who is also my closest/best friend) to their friends list. He immediately knew that the account was fake (since I often express how I'd rather not get involved in social media beyond Snapchat). We got the account banned before it connected with my social group. It's worth noting that it tried to connect to someone very close to me early on.

On the friends list of the fake profile was some random person I've never heard of who lives across the country and the mother of one of my very good friend who I grew up with. This person could really only be connected to me by studying me or knowing me closely. 

There are two people in my life that I suspect could be behind this. A sort of unhinged girl who I pushed out of my life because she was a manipulative hoe. I have a roommate who is a compulsive liar and regularly makes up crazy stories to inflate his ego. He has odd behavior and is very easily angered. This is really only something you pick up by living with him. He can be ""charming"" and knows how to appeal to people. We have clashed before but everything is cool now. I sometimes suspect he may be a sociopath and he sometimes fits the profile. I honestly think it's more likely he's just insecure and has some form of bipolarism. I'm cautious around him still.  It's also very possible that it's someone else in my life that I don't suspect.

 It may be some scammer online. This information would have to come about by studying my friends social media. I plan on wiping my  hard drive( I was going to anyways since I plan on selling it) and changing all my important passwords.

I'll also sell out and just make a legitimate Facebook account of me to take ammunition away from this person.

118,"Hello,

I broke up with my SO 6 months ago due to lots of problems. We ended on bad terms and have had no contact since. Same week we broke up, I stuffed all the stuff he'd given me into a suitcase (suitcase was a gift from his family) and left it under my bed. It's been out of the way and easy to forget about, but I'm having a major clearout today and need to decide what to do with this. I've thrown away all the little gifts he bought me. But there's more expensive gifts including the suitcase, and stuff that was his, like shoes and clothes, that I just don't know what to do with.

Do you guys think I should contact him and see if he wants it? There's lots of my stuff which I left at his of course, and he hasn't given that back, but that doesn't bother me. Should I assume he feels the same? This is something I should have sorted out a long time ago, but better now than later. Thank you!",12Mar2017,6
119,"I noticed that recently that I have been unable to make new acquaintances; what usually happens is they'll just stop responding to me very suddenly, totally out of the blue with absolutely no provocation. I don't know why.  It's occurring so frequently that I have started to expect it to happen and I'm starting to feel very isolated and alone. To elaborate a bit more - every so often,  I'll meet someone new - usually a potential colleague or friend - either through social functions, career fairs, tech talks, or by some other means of social networking.  Sometimes we'll hit it off and have an extremely engaging and interesting conversation and afterward we'll agree to either ""hang out sometime"", ""explore that project idea"", etc..  We'll usually exchange phone numbers or email addresses, and they seem genuinely enthusiastic and glad that they met me.

So the last dozen or so people I've met in the last year have just flaked on me.  It's very frustrating.  Is this normal?  Am I just totally misreading their enthusiasm?  It's difficult for me to get out there and meet new people - I'm a bit introverted but I'm not socially inept or anything like that, just a bit socially lazy.  I definitely have my quirks at times, but most people who already know me well kind of get used to it or look past it.  I'm starting to get paranoid (this is pretty paranoid...) that perhaps people are getting some background information on me or that someone dragged my name through the mud online or something.

So who would want to ruin my reputation?  Well, last year, around the time when I started noticing this flaking problem, I got in a dispute with my former employer.  It was really ugly, lawyers were brought in, court documents were filed.  I'm not going to go into it, but my employer did something very very wrong and illegal that warranted legal action.  A law firm took my case on contingency immediately, but I eventually dropped the case as I didn't have the time nor energy to fight a long legal battle, plus I had much better things to do with my time.

So since this incident, I have noticed this strong pattern of flaking.  They're not getting back to me or seemingly avoiding me.  I've Googled my name, I can't find anything bad, I've been looking for other potential sources online where people could be getting bad information about me.  I honestly wouldn't put it past my former employer to have defamed me out of revenge for what happened.  It's just been very odd.

To further top on the anecdotal evidence: right after said fallout with my old company, I had the worst job drought of my life, because companies, recruiters, and interviewers were flaking on me too.  Just to put it into perspective, it would usually take me about a month or less to get a new job.   After the incident, it took 6 months.  It made me go absolutely nuts.  I almost left my career.

So am I just paranoid or is there some secretive illuminati-esqe database out there that has completely destroyed my reputation?  It all seems a bit much to be a coincidence, I really don't know what's going on.  I've never had this problem before.  Any clues would be appreciated.",12Mar2017,1

122,"Well, I started playing the drums like 3 months ago, I practice a lot and I've taken it seriously. One of my best friends wanted to make a rock band with some classmates and buddies, so I joined. He's the singer but has no knowledge of music. He wants so bad to make a song and he's very hyped about it. The problem is he's made the structure and composed the theme almost completely (also the lyrics makes me cringe), and it sounds like trash, and I'm not the only one that thinks so (although in my group everyone says it great but I don't know if they mean it). The melody doesn't fit with the singing and he hasn't taken into account some of the basic rules for composing, I think he's delusional. I've studied music for 4 years, so I spend a lot of time fixing a project which I think is crap from the beginning.
The other members of the band don't practice, and the bass player tries to lead everyone but he doesn't seem to know much about music although he says he's a pro (he can't even write what he plays on the bass...)
What grinds my grinds is that when practicing my opinion is almost always ignored, and I get to play shit beats because everyone wants to shine and I just play like a metronome. One day the bass player, which wants to be the center of attention all the time, told me to sit up and he told me what to play, playing a really sloppy crappy easy beat on my kit.
Well I want to leave but the thing is that I've been taking my step back, said everything is perfect to them and be a sheep.

135,"I'm having trouble with a friend since September of last year. This woman was a good friend of mine for 8 years, she is nearly 50 years old and a widower, so, she has some history. I've always felt very comfortable talking to get about my family issues and romantic relationships, since she would always give me good insight. She would trust me with her problems as well and it meant a lot to me that she saw me as a good friend to do so. The thing is, last year she started to be very pro-Trump. Don't get me wrong, she can be as conservative as she wants, but it would be impossible to reason with her about anything related to politics, she would get very aggressive, so I didn't even bring it up anymore. But other things started to bother me deeply. Like her dislike of other people's sexualities. There are four different times she made very rude comments on the topic (if you want to know more, I explain her remarks below).

I wanted to slap her in the face for being such a cunt but instead I told her that she was very conservative and retrograde in her ideas. I even made a joke, saying ""you sound like my mother!"" (My mother is old and stupid - we don't get along really well). My friend didn't take it kindly (to say the least). 

A few weeks later, I went to her place to wish her a merry Christmas since I was going to be out of town and she caught me off guard and started to yell at me all the things I told her in private, trying to show me how ""flawed"" I was (she would say things like ""remember when you said that to your mother?"" and ""how about that time you went on a date with that guy and he didn't call you back?"" ). The fact that she was trowing at me things I told her several months ago in private in an attempt to show me my weaknesses was the worst part. She is almost 50! 
She was supposed to be the mature adult here! 

Well, after that episode, I tried to put her on the 'colleagues' category, going to her place before Christmas to say hi, but she ended up making another homophobic remark.

The answer was no, he had a girlfriend, but she insisted: He looks very gay""; 2: she made a new girlfriend and complained to new that she thought the woman was hitting on her, ""I know I'm single but this is just gross!""; 3: I was talking about a friend of mine that is dating a guy and that he is not as nice as her ex-girlfriend, so it's not as nice to be around my friend this days and she said ""I bet it never was. She can't even figure out her own sexuality!"" and 4: on our last encounter I was trying to avoid specific topics and keep it light so I told her about this documentary I saw, Senna, and that it portrayed the subject without hiding his flaws, that he was rudely competitive and a womanizer, and she interrupted me to say ""but it was all cover up. He was gay. I had a friend that knew him and he had a boyfriend"". I told her that it didn't matter in the context of the movie and said I was late for something (I was not).",12Mar2017,1

145,"My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly four years now, and most of it has been spent apart. Long distance has been rough for the both of us but I guess we're fortunate enough that our love has kept us going. She has it a lot rougher than I do, considering her parents are split up and she has to pay for her education mostly on her own + with support from her brother and mother. 


Recently she mailed me a package with a bunch of stuff. One of the things she sent me was one of those hourglasses filled with magnetic powder and with a magnetic base that lets it form tiny magnetic sculptures at the bottom. You may or may not know what I'm talking about. I know it's just something small that you can find at K-Mart, but everything she's ever given me is arguably more valuable to me than any other material object I own, and I've kept everything over the years extremely carefully.


Long story short, a friend of mine wanted to see it, they dropped it, and one of the bulbs on one end of the hourglass shattered. I haven't felt so fucking awful when that happened in a long time. I didn't get mad at my friend, it was an accident after all, but I still had to stop myself from tearing up. Make fun of me if you want, I don't really give a shit. Anyway, I collected all the glass fragments and used a piece of paper wrapped over the magnetic base to collect as much of the magnetic powder as I could. 


I was wondering if it could be possible to get it fixed at some point. The  glass from the bulb shattered into pieces that are too small to have any real hope of glueing together, but I've seen videos and stuff of people who make intricate sculptures using glass, and I was wondering if it could be possible to get it fixed. Basically the glass smith would have to create an entirely new bulb for the hourglass and then somehow meld it together with the remaining bulb. The narrow middle part is mostly intact.


I know it might seem like a small, irrelevant thing to most of you but it would mean the world to me if there was even a tiny chance of fixing it. Cost is no concern. Does anyone know if it can be done? :(",12Mar2017,3
146,"Guys... i feel like i need to talk about this.
The next door neighbours dog attacked a cat who went into its yard at about 11 o clock. I was sitting in my room, right under the open window. I could hear everything. The cat yowling, and the movements as they fought. I thought it might have been my mother in law, Amanda's dog at first, but no. It was next door, which i confirmed by using the flashlight on my phone and half hanging out the window to try and see.
At first i was in shock, and unsure of what to think. I've never really witnessed anything of the sort before. It must have been a horrible death. For quite a few minutes, the cat cried out and yowled. In the end its voice sounded strangled and muffled. It's such an aggressive way to meet your end. The dog was totally merciless. It growled and grunted, and i could hear rough movements, and then all noise stopped.
I couldn't see anything much through the tree that grows on this side of the fence, but the noise was like nothing else i've ever heard. 
After the noise had discontinued, i checked around the house for Amanda's cat (Tifa), who i could not find. I was calling out, and she didn't come, but that doesn't mean much because Tifa doesnt like me much, so she ignores me when i call for her.
I proceeded to go out the back, where Amanda and Brett (father in law) were, and we three stood near the fence and tried to see what was going on, and what cat it was; it had dark fur, and was of slight build. The neighbour on the other side owns two cats, but they were still over at her house, just fine. I think i'm just now finally realising what happened. I feel sort of confused. I don't exactly know what to think. It could very well be Tifa, but i can't be certain because it was too dark to see properly. It did look like her, but there are plenty of strays around here. We'll know tomorrow, i suppose. It was an odd thing to look at. The big dog was sort of standing over the cat, and the cat was just limp. It didn't move at all. And then the dog was moving it, picking it up in its mouth by the leg, or the middle, and sort of dragging it. It was sort of hard to watch.
The death sounded painful. I hope it isn't Tifa.",12Mar2017,1
147,"I have a very complicated issue. A few years ago my family was living overseas and i was living alone - i was 14 at the time. My father would come and visit now and then, but our relationship became very tense since we would always end up in arguments, that under normal circumstances would have been stopped by my mother or my siblings (i have an older sister and two younger sisters, im a boy). A year later i couldn't take it any longer. I didn't know when my family would come home and i couldn't stand living with my father, so i went to the government and got put in a foster family for about two years. I was 15 at the time, and i am now 19. I had very little contact with my family while i was with the foster family, but i ended up talking regularly with my mother after a year and found out that her and my dad had gotten a divorce and none of my sisters were talking to her. 

I later on decided to go to my fathers apartment to confront him, as soon as i knew he was back in the country again (he would go back and fourth regularly). He wasn't home, and in my disappointment i slammed the front door so hard that i opened (without breaking). I found a video camera with footage om my father sitting with my mothers old best friend (!) very romantically, with candles etc. My mom had doubts about my father cheating on her while they were still married and this confirmed it. 

Last about 2 years ago, my sister and my father moved back to the country im living in. My sisters all love my dad and dont like my mother, despite the fact that they know that he has been unfaithful and everything that happened between me and him. They resent me a little for being put in a foster family, and claim that i ruined the family, but that wasn't the main issue. My sisters has been told by my father that i have threatened him and tried to kill him by a request from my mother - which i have not! Furthermore my sisters have accepted my fathers relationship with my mothers old best friend - which they still won't admit and keep in secret from me, despite the fact that everyone knows that i know about the relationship. My youngest sister is 8 years old the next is 14 and the oldest is 20, and despite my effort to try to gain a relationship with them again, every single one of them still lie to my face and see me as a threat, and there is nothing i can say og claim to defend myself since they simple dont believe me. 

My father is very manipulative, and they all have a soft spot for him, but i know that he is the one who is telling them to not tell me anything, even though i consciously never ask them about it! Like for example i was sitting in a train with my youngest sister (8 years old) on our way home to my apartment, when she suddenly out of nowhere tells me that she hasn't seen the woman and her children in 2 years. I know for a fact that this is lie, since i have seen pictures of her and that family on my older sisters phone, and it pains me so much that she feels like she can't trust me and has to lie to me! For gods sake, she is 8 years old! The two other sisters are the same. What can i do to make them trust and believe me. I want to be an older brother for my younger sisters and i want to go back to having a great and honest relationship with my older sister, but the lack of trust is killing me. Any advice?",12Mar2017,1

I've been depressed for 2 years due to reasons I cannot say and the fact that I dont know what I want to do with my life isn't helping. I don't feel like im in control of my life. my mind is just a mixture of thoughts and I feel like im running out of time to do something. at this point you might be thinking 'oh its just another stupid lazy kid whos going to fail life' but I wasn't always like this.

I live in london and all I want to do is go to another country where the weather isnt constantly sh!t. I hate being in a cluttered city. I want to go to a town. 

job i want the most:
pilot- can't afford it tho

jobs ive considered:
mechanic- I was wondering if I should try to get into an apprenticeship but I'm worried that I'd be locked in london.
engineer- I was thinking about doing this too and this was my plan until now. I hate studying with a passion.

159," I have a friend who I met in 2009 when I was still in school, we become friends since then . She (yeah it's a girl) was attractive to me so she was my crush in these years but we never crossed the line of friendship, she was aware of me liking her, she used to found it kinda cute. Anyway, back then she was a innocent girl that used to make my eyes bright every time I see her, but for some reason she changed a lot, she become rude and even ignorant sometimes, exclusively with me...I don't know exactly the reason of this, maybe it's because she miss me fawning her since now I'm onto another girls now, or maybe it's something I don't even imagine.

No major health problems, just auto imune thyroid (taken from parents) who recently went crazy, but it's not my complaint in this post. 

I had a spine surgery half a year ago. Brutal herniated disk because of an accident. I took the surgery but i hardly recovered. I spent 5 months only in bed. I recently started to walk a bit and go outside a bit, but not more than 1 hr/day. 

I gained SO MUCH WEIGHT. I GO CRAZY. I used to be a fit girl. I did a lot of sports but now I have a sport interdiction for at least 3-4 years. Any sport. The internal wound is too big and it takes a lot of time to heal so I really shouldn't do any sport. Not even yoga because I hardly can sit, I can't do any other pose. 

I eat around 1200 calories/day. I count them. But because I don't do anything, I don't burn anything, so I gain weight. 

My diet is really healthy, yet I don't lose weight. 

My question is: what sport can I do (or simply what exercices, something) that will not solicit my spine at all (lumbar and cervical). 
What can I do to be active?

Because I stay mostly inside, my depression is huge, I feel really exhausted all the time and the slightest effort now makes me sweat and get exhausted. 

I need help please. What can I do ? Should I take some suplements for my exhaustion? I already take vitamin D and magnesium. 

Maybe someone else went through something similar and can help me. Wht exercices can I do (and where) that won't solicit my spine at all? ( i can't lay down on the floor, i tried some movements in bed but my back starts to hurt shortly after). 

I want to lose weight. I went from 150 lbs to 200. I'm desperate. Every advice is appreciated. Thank you very much.

163,"Hello! I am so ashamed of myself to have gotten myself into this situation that i have no where else to turn to. So i'm looking for some advice. Long story short is that I've been activley involved in with my church and had a good priest-parishoner relationship with the priest at the church. I just started recently opening up more about my own story and background to him and trusted him enough to go to my first face to face reconciliation with him it was all fine- I went on a retreat and he was the one running it the weekend. We had a bible signing and he asked me to bring my bible to him a seperate time because he wished to put extra thought into mine. So I brought it to him about a week after the retreat. He wrote up the entire back of it with nothing but kindness and good will. But me being the awkward person that I am felt it was necessary to write him back a letter. A letter I shouldve never given to him. I wrote with good will but after putting some thought into it the letter probably sounded mushy and overly appreciative to the point where I feel like he got the wrong impression and has started to avoid me. It probably didn't help much that after the fact I realized I had written the letter on paper from a notepad in which I had previously was in perfume a few weeks back ago due to it falling from a top shelf of my desk and scented the paper that I used to write the letter. ( i had spent a long time blow drying it off and instead of throwing it away i saved to use so I wouldn't waste paper) While writing this letter and even up until I gave it to him I didn't give it a second thought whatsoever. And now I don't know what to do since he's avoiding me. I am kicking myself so much for allowing all of this to happen and debating to either let this whole thing die down and not say anything or actually confronting him about it and apologizing to him for making him feel so uncomfortable around me. I really never intended to make him feel awkward around me or to get the wrong impression. I was beginning to get closer to him and now I cant help but feel bad for ruining a good friendship and feel things wont ever be the same. Should I let it die down or confront him? ** UPDATE after a week since this incident** I haven't gone to him YET because i truly wanted to see if I was actually being avoided or if it was in my head. A couple of days after this post he texted me asking me i how i was out of the blue and had a simple reply and ended the conversation quickly. He explained that he had been busy and all. But im going to be honest - there was some flirting going on before this letter. Now I am not trying to do anything with mal intentions which i also have stated earlier . I simply wish to keep this an appropriate relationship. But last night at a retreat reunion it's obvious that he is keeping his distance and not being as flirty as he was a while back ago but last night he came up next to me during a quiet time where I wasn't around too many and he put his arm around me , leaned in and whispered, ""Thank you for making my heart very joyful."" Got up then walked away from me. I am so confused as to what is happening in this situation and I do feel that i may need to have the conversation with him to clear things up.... any thoughts about this whole thing? I honestly feel so confused! Sorry if i was vague in some parts. but thanks for the responses !Please I am asking for true sincere answers here and nothing silly.

I didn’t speak to my mom for over a decade. She sided with my Grandfather who sexually and emotionally abused us both during childhood and I left home the first moment I could escape. I left also because my mother sexually exploited me and used me in every sense and is also a mentally ill individual completely addicted to opiates since 1970 and unwilling to change.
I was contacted by a family friend kind enough to take her in and support her these past few years during the death of her father and told that she was about to die. I visited her and we made peace a few months back and my life has since spun out of control in a way I never thought possible and I’m left at these crossroads unsure what to do.
Her mental illness has gone so far out of control she has been Baker Acted (involuntary committed) several times and only lives to get high on these hardcore pain pills she gets prescribed for her back pain. My mother is severely addicted to pills and has a habit over $400 a month. The family friend cant take care of her any more. I’m her only surviving family member. I don’t know what to do. She has multiple personalities (D.I.D) and one of them abused me and is extremely predatory and other is this sweet sad child who breaks my heart to think about homeless. She refuses to work and never gets things done because her mental illness is so extreme. She lies constantly because of her delusions.
I have a partner, dog, and life I love with all my heart and I don’t want her to ruin our lives together. I live off tips and minimum wage. My income is not dependable and my mother expects me to pay her rent, car insurance, cell phone, gas, doctors visit, and meds. It’s well over $1000 a month. Currently, she gets her food from a homeless shelter. In two weeks she needs to be out of where she has been squatting the past years. I don’t know what do. I've contacted shelters in her area and possibly try to rent a space in a RV park but is expensive, campgrounds are $30 dollars a day, shelters are full and she is unwilling to work in part with programs to get assistance.

I have thought about studying online, but I would actually like to meet a few new people. The problem is I can't motivate myself to study and get up every morning, and that's why I couldn't finish high school. I'm actually really pissed off at myself because I think I am a smart person - just very very lazy and also not able to deal with stress well, which year 11 and 12 of high school is pretty much all about.

There was a course I wanted to do, but it went up from 900 to 2800 dollars, which is money I don't have and don't want to and can't get from my parents because I dropped out of another course last year (after finishing one).

168,"Hey guys! 

Over the past year I have grown apart from my friends both in and out of school. I have never really been close to anyone in my school. I've tried seeing if some people I used to be close with wanted to go with me but they either had dates or didn't want to. 
I used to be closeish with a friend last year but we essentially don't really talk anymore (because schedules never overlap) - but we do have a long snap streak for what it's worth. 


I have a few options.

1) Not go - I'm leaning towards this honestly. I think the whole concept of prom and asking people to prom is stupid. With that said, I fear I would regret not going or missing out on something. 

2) Asking my old friend. I think she would say yes, but I'm not certain and I don't really want to make anything weird, especially since we're going to a music festival two weeks after prom (I asked her to go with me because I literally don't have anyone else I'm close to and I didn't want to go with my little sister). 

3) Ask a random sophomore I don't know. A friend said this one sophomore (who I don't know) would probably go with me. (I should clarify that sophomores cant go unless a junior/senior asks them). After writing this the same 'ride to prom' issue comes up too (4). 

4) Go alone. This could be the weirdest of them all. I don't want to deal with the awkwardness of asking people if I could ride with them. I could probably entertain myself during the actual prom/afterparty but I just feel like I'd be such a loner both before and during the actual thing. 

I spoke to my older brother (senior in college) about this and he said that it more or less is weird/uncomfortable any way I slice it. With 1 at least I can be alone at home - *sans alcohol* though. With 2, at least I'm going with someone and the whole awkwardness of finding a ride doesn't exist as much since she has some friends. But then again I would have to ask her and o.O. 3 just seems like a bad idea. And 4 seems good, but really awkward.

They also tell me that the most valuable parts of going to an art school are the connections you make, and the understanding of the art world. I have none of those things, and I'm afraid that it's too late for me to go to school. I also don't want to be in debt, and it seems silly to enroll in school just for connections. But as I said, I have no fucking idea how to get involved with other artists, or where to find them.


I am ready to jump into visual arts and...all of it. I despise the idea of capitalizing off artwork being my main goal, and I have this fucked up idea that there is some sort of ""organization"" or ""collective"" that shares my general idea, and isn't just about helping artists get a gallery show. I don't give a fuck about a gallery. And I don't care about prestige. My girlfriend says in the context of art history, collectives always fail. I just feel like I need to learn, get a fresh perspective, and support other artists by engaging in a group and collaborating together. Enough that I cry about it sometimes.


Am I insane? delusional? does any such group exist? even if they do, where do I find them?
I'm 22, trans, from Maryland, and have extreme social anxiety and depression.

180,"Hi Reddit. This is gonna be a long one.


Some backstory: graduated CS 2016, not the best school but 1st (top UK grade tier) and lots of volunteer/sporting extras. Started a job from an internship I had previously with a large company but got a poor team placement. I feel I've exhausted internal mobility. But...

* on friday got offered to move teams - still not programming (the reason I want to leave) but this company pays well and I'd get to keep my 2k signon bonus (golden handshake type deal)
* I've never actually been trusted with a dev job and jobs other than grad schemes don't appear to care
* 2 grad scheme type interviews lined up with my plan to go traveling before they start
* don't know if I'm running out of time to go traveling (March interview / April quit work and work 4 weeks / may move stuff into storage find new home / June-July-Aug travel / sept take demotion)
* I don't know for sure I'll even get either of the grad jobs so should I just continue with internal move, but what if I do get it and leave will I just be upsetting people


Some sort of advice on how I should continue / anything I should 100% revise for a CS interview so they know I can code would also be great

184,"I find that a lot of the times when I get upset about something and stuck on it, it has something to do with other people. I compare myself to other people and end up getting discouraged and frustrated when they're better at something than me, or just more well off in general. I let other people's life style choices I don't agree with get to me a lot to. The worst part of it is that I dwell on it so much.

Prime example, I'm trying to get in shape and working out, but I get this nasty train of thought I can't derail. ""There are already better looking people me, so no one will care if I put the effort in anyway. I can't be as impervious as these people because they use steroids and I won't do that!"" Things like that, and they just swirl and fester in my head making me loose sleep and getting frustrated for no apparent reason. The thing I don't understand is why I care so much!

Anytime I try to do something good for myself this same thing happens and I spoil it over something that shouldn't matter to me. What makes it even more frustrating, is that I know I have zero interest in being the best at anything and yet when I'm aware of someone better than me, no matter how awful I am at whatever it is, I still feel so defeated and frustrated.

I don't know what to about this, it's just gotten worse over the years.

193,"I'll make it short. Depressed and suicidal for 10-15 years.

About 9 months ago I checked myself into a mental health hospital on suicide watch. Completely changed my life, discovered meditation and affirmations, exercise, and positivity. A complete turn-around for my life, it's been great.

I've spent every day slowly but surely pushing back the depressive, negative thoughts and the anxiety. I've started eating loads better, quit smoking (9 months), cut back on drinking. No liquor.

Haven't had a suicidal thought. Until last night. I think it was alcohol related. All I had was a few beers and a burger, but a couple hours later I found myself drunk and crying in a movie theater. Ever since then it feels like every wall I've been building for the last 9 months is coming down. Like I'm being sucked back into the person I used to be. Negative thoughts are coming in waves. I thought I had made them weak and ignorable, but now they're back in force, and dragging me down.

I don't know what to do. I'm not going to kill myself or anything, in case anyone is worried. I've dealt with this before. But I thought it was gone, or at least I was in the process of leaving that negative, fucked up person behind. It's extremely disturbing and sad to realize the person that I thought I had left behind is so close by, and that I can turn back into him so easily.

Especially because I feel like I keep making positive actions despite not wanting to. I'll work out, because I know it's positive, even though I'm not feeling it. I want to stay in and turn off all the lights and pretend nothing exists, but instead I went out to hang out and watch a movie. I thought these were positive actions that would illicit positive results. 

I just want to be a positive, happy person. I know I have the tools to do so. I guess I just want to know that a slip backwards like this is normal.

194,"Hey guys,

I hit the gym a lot, often with very dear and good friend of mine which is obese, and in rotation with some other friends as well.
I got into sports like 4 yrs ago (im 21 now), and I'd consider myself rather athletic, ""swole"", w/e. 

However, the problem is: I can't get him to do cardiovascular exercise himself or even with me.

In our group of friends I've talked to another friend, which is also very close to him, how could we help him lose his weight and become fit.

It is clear that my obese friends wants to achieve this goal - he signed up for the gym all by himself and often talks about he tries this new diet, did that, and so on. His motivation seems great sometimes, but apparently, the discipline does not keep up. 

How far can i push him to do cardiovascular exercise to lose fat?
How often can talk about him about nutritional choices and about the topic in general?

The deal is: I want him to reach his goal to lose his fat, but I don't want to annoy him as well. He's been at it since 4 yrs now (we all started fitness together at 17yrs old, me, this friend, and another friend), but nothing has ever changed for him.

How can we (my other friend, that I've been asking for advice already, and me) help him the best to finally achieve his own goal?

Right now, it also starts to annoy me a bit, lately, he sometimes skips the gym, runs late, how can I help him change?

If you have any questions, ill gladly answer them.

198,"Aight boys/girls, here’s my problem. Incoming a wall of text.

Kissless Virgin. 22 Years old. Not an ugly looking dude – I’m described as ‘cute’. 7-8/10 by girls I have asked. Just some high standards, and I get friend-zoned by every fucking chick I’m into. I am in my final semester of Chemical Engineering at a local college, and have a very high paying job at the end of April.

So I met a girl. Online, in December. She told me off the bat she got out of a relationship recently (October/November) and wasn’t looking for anything. So a month goes by, she and I joke around, talk about almost everything and anything (sex included). And then I ask her out mid-January, telling her that I know she needs some time and that I’d be willing to wait. She tells me: “no” more or less since she’s ‘Vibing’ with another dude at the moment (they’re just fucking, no romance as far as I know). And I say okay, in the deluded hopes that after a few more months she’ll feel something for me.

A few more months pass, we still talk EVERY day all day. She 90% of the time texts first. I wake up to her texts, and I fall asleep to her texts, we have multiple late 5-7am skype sessions, I coin a cute nickname for her based upon one of the movies we watched, really starting to fall for this girl. Start to form several inside jokes and references etc. She and I start hanging out in real life, watch 50 Shades Darker together as a joke, she’s very friendly but body orientation is very neutral entire movie. She and I see another movie with some of my friends, same kind of deal. Get frustrated that she and I aren’t going to be anything else. Make a rage-face book status that she sees and she asks me what’s wrong and if it’s something she did.

So two months after asking her out and three months after meeting her (This is last week). I lay it down for her and tell her how I feel and that I’m getting frustrated and I am afraid I’ll dig myself into a pit. She says she doesn’t feel the same way and lists her reasons as: 1) Sexually (I have some fetishes she knows about and she thinks she’s too vanilla to able to be able to deliver on them. I try and argue the other side to no avail). 2) She’s still finding herself. 3) She just doesn’t feel that attraction towards me and she feels as though if there isn’t that attraction, then it’s more or less a failed relationship. I’m sad.jpg. Try and talk it out with her and she sticks to her arguments and asks what I want to do. She seems to be very honest in what she says and says she’s ‘nervous’ etc. I am usually good at reading body language, but who knows here.

I say I’ll try and remain friends but no guarantees, and that night I have my first cry in five years and hate the fucking world. Finally found the –perfect- girl and end up crushed. Talk to some close friends, feel a little better. Feel okay over last few days, still a little hurt. Still talk every day like nothing happened, she insists she feels bad about it and I believe her. Today she’s telling me about how she was semi-flirting with some guy, he got drunk and how she was rejecting his drunken advances and he was kissing her on the legs and shit before he passed out in her lap.

Color me super jealous. Starting to reflect on some things and starting to wonder if she just wants the attention from me and I’m just being naïve and being used as an emotional tampon. I don’t know what to do here guys. I have it bad for her, and I think losing the friendship will crush me harder than I was last week, but being stuck in this pit for a girl who won’t fall for me isn’t a smart plan either. I would love a magical way out of the friend zone, but I know it’s not an easy task and probably not do-able. Any thoughts or advice you guys can offer me? They are appreciated.

201,"Reposting this on a throwaway account as right after I posted before I remembered that the person I'll be talking about uses Reddit

***

So this guy... I'll call him Sam.

I met Sam a few months ago. He seemed nice enough. A bit weird, a bit socially awkward, but I don't mind that. I used to be very socially anxious myself so I can empathise, and didn't mind.

Sam and I would hang out occasionally. He remained a bit weird, but whatever. After a while he asks if I have sorted out where I'm living after the summer (in UK unis, first year is on-campus residence and after that is private accommodation).

One of my friends wanted to move out of his parents' place back where I'm from (~80 miles so not very far away), so he's moving to my uni city in with me. I asked Sam if he wanted to come with us because it was a pretty clear hint that he wanted to. He said that the people he was previously going with were mucking it up a bit, but I now believe he didn't have anyone to go with previously (though that's just a guess - since that conversation I've realised that I'm the only person he hangs out with other than occasional nights out he tells me about where he spends absurd amounts, sometimes &gt;£100). Nothing is official or signed with this arrangement currently (thank god).

He's not a very smart person. I'm not one of those pretentious twats who thinks he's really smart and all that but straight up, he's just really slow. Both in terms of social interaction and just common sense. And literacy. And time management. And work ethic. I know how mean that sounds but if you met him you would agree. Frankly I'm bewildered he managed to meet the entry requirements for the uni.

I think many of my issues with him can be summarised by a conversation we had via Facebook messages today. To paraphrase (and word his replies better):

Sam: Do you want to go out tonight?

Me: Too much work to do, sorry

Sam: You know you want to

Me: I need to save money anyway, sorry

Sam: I only had an apple today because that's all the food I have left

Me: You can't just eat an apple all day, go to the shop and buy some pasta or something

Sam: My overdraft is -140. When my flatmate is back I'll try to get some food off him

Me: It's worth going to -150 so you can eat. Weren't you going to go drinking tonight anyway? Just buy food with whatever money you would've spent and don't go out

Sam: Can't for the rest of the month, that's when I get my next loan instalment. As for the drinks they're like £2

Me: How did you spend all that money already?

Sam: I'm bad with money...

***

Basically I need to decide whether or not to kick him out of this house arrangement (again, thankfully nothing is signed). Here are the factors as I see it:

Kick him out:

- He's bad with money, and I don't feel confident that he will be able to make rent each month

- Living with someone who blows through all their money in less than half a month and resorts to scrounging for food off flatmates is not a good situation

Don't kick him out:

- On a moral level, I feel bad for mucking him about for so long when he could've spent this time looking for housing with other people - if I kick him out he won't have much time to sort something else out and knowing how he is socially I don't think he can

- I'm currently in-between friendship circles and we probably couldn't be friends if I kicked him out

- I don't have anyone else who could take his place, and 3 bedroom properties are MASSIVELY nicer than 2 bedroom places for the same price per person

- As dim and annoying as he is, he has good intentions and isn't fundamentally a bad person, just very socially unaware and not very bright

***

I could really do with some third party opinions here. I've been very stressed with uni work and various other things not worth going into here, and this dilemma is just adding to the pile.

I want to kick him out and I know it's the logical thing to do, I would just feel like a total wanker for keeping him on the line so long and then kicking him out leaving him little time to sort out something

203,"I was at an event with a bunch of people from my high school over the weekend.  Whenever I talk to people, they seem like they like me, but I have reservations about whether they do or not.  So, basically, I am insecure about my personality at the moment. (Side note, I am a senior in HS and a female.  I don't believe that I am considered unattractive (not saying that in a cocky way, but based on what people have said about me)).

I used to talk a lot in middle school and I used to annoy a lot of people, so I scaled back on talking going into high school.  Now, as a high school senior, I feel that I am having trouble finding a good balance.  I see people being liked even though they talk a ton, and I see other people being liked even though they don't talk too much. 

Hanging out with the ""popular"" crowd (I usually hang out with this crowd but moreso this weekend.  I don't get like invited to their houses for parties or anything but I still talk to all of them and they dont seem to have any issues) this weekend and observing behavior, I am now stuck on how I am.  I seem to be liked by people, but I can't help but feel almost socially awkward?

It's almost like I never know when I should talk or not.  I observe and stay quiet sometimes, but talk too much others.  I almost feel like I say weird and irrelevant things (people don't say that I do, but I feel like I do), which makes my mind trigger telling me to just shut up.

How do I become more conscious of my behavior, and how do I be myself without being annoying?  Every time I go to hang out with people, even if they invite me, I can't help but feel that they either feel forced to invite me or something.

In addition to this, I am always overthinking everything.  I will give an example, [it's definitely a TMI].  I was in the hot tub and I had borrowed a friend's bathing suit.  It was a little too big for me because she is built a little larger but it still pretty much fit.  Anyway, about halfway through I noticed that if I bent over, there was a gap which would cause kind of a nip slip.  I couldnt help but feel like the guy next to me had noticed at some point, even though he didnt seem to mind standing next to me, making a few small comments, and he kept brushing up against me (he was nice, he's kind of quiet/shy sometimes so i can never tell what he is thinking).  Then all I did was worry that everyone could tell that there was a gap.

Also, one of the people at this event posted a photo on Instagram today.  There was one without my friend and I, and one with us (we slid in at the end of the group).  He posted the one without us and I couldn't help but feel that he didn't want us in it, even though he has been nothing but nice to me (he's also pretty quiet, but my mom is best friends with his mom).

Is all of this just insecurity that I need to work on, or could there actually be something off about my personality? I have felt this way for a long time and I finally decided to reach out to the internet for some advice.",12Mar2017,1
204,"So I'm a shift manager at a fast food resturaunt. We're a small store in a small town, so everything is everyone's business, both inside and outside of work. We recently lost our assistant manager, and the store manager really isn't capable of picking up the slack, so the three shift managers have been stretched pretty thin.

Honestly, I've never felt fully aprpeciated, but in this time of menial job I never expectted much. However, lately all I hear is how I'm not doing enough. Every day, how I'm not doing enough. Now I'm no slacker, I do my job and then some. I dont' stay over for hours or anything, but I close the store 5 nights a week and they're damn fine closes.

Our new assistant manager was promoted internally, and I feel he's not pulling his weight. I turned down the position because I knew it was high stress and more hours, yet I feel like I'm still picking up the stress. It's difficult to criticize him, thouhg, because he's a new father. I try to be sympathetic, but he knew what would be expected of him when he took the job, and now doesn't want to put in the work.

It's a similar problem with the other two shift managers. They're very friendly and likeable, but I feel like they're not putting in the effort. I'm afraid to say anything though, because they're nice and social ""bros.""

I'm not even sure what I'm asking for here. It just, everything I say at work lately feels like the wrong thing. I'll start a sentence, and regret saying it before I""m even finished. There's so much gossip it's hard to tell what an innocent comment will be turned into. I'm pretty socially awkward to begin with, this level of petty high school drama is not something I've ever prepared for.

Out store manager isn't great, honestly I feel she's pretty incompetant, but given the record of managers within our company, she really is the best we can hope for. The thing is, she likes these people who are slacking off, and doesn't like me. I'm weird and awkward and not religious (which, with our GM is a big no no). So anything I say she won't want to believe. I'm some horrible bitch for complaining about dear lovable Gerald*, don't I know he's going through a divorce(3 months ago)? How dare I expect Hank* to work his full shift, don't I know he has a new baby(who's 6 weeks old now)? 

Things are further complicated by being in such a small town. My own mother works with me, our store manager was my neighbor growing up, etc. And it's not like I can just quit. I've got student loans from my unsuccessful try at college, and no car. I'm limited to what's withing walking distance, and can't go back to minimum wage just now.

I don't even hope to fix the problem, I'm just tired of everyone seeing me as some uptight, bossy girl just because I want people to do their jobs.

Wow, this got off track, any advice is welcome. I'm just so angry and frustrated most days now, and then have to pretend to be perky and social at work, when all I want to do is curl up and sleep.

209,"Hello,

My husband and I have been together now for 10 years, married for 2 years.  I recently found out I am pregnant with twins, which my husband and I are both very excited about. Our families are both very excited as well, and I will be making both of our moms first time grandmas.  It honestly is a burden that I did not ask for or wish to carry. My mom is not overbearing, but my husband's mother is causing me a lot of stress and frustration. First of all, her level of involvement in our lives prior to this information has been minimal. This is for a lot of reasons, but largely because my husband wanted it this way, as he has thought of her as being rather toxic to our lives.  From what my husband has told me and my own observations over the year, his mother has done little, if anything, to encourage her son to pursue his dreams and basic responsibility. I think that his parents may have tried to teach the responsibility part of this at one point but they more or less just taught him that taking care of them was his responsibility. His father was a drug user for his entire life, smoked marijuana with him at the age of 13, and also later used him to grow marijuana and sell it for money. During his childhood, he abused his children physically and mentally and his mother made no significant attempts to remove him from the situation, something I feel as though I have a hard time not holding against her - mostly because she denies the whole thing to this day.  His father committed suicide last year via drug overdose.  His mother is an avid drug user and has multiple prescriptions of medications for all sorts of different issues. She will take various kinds of pills, some narcotics, and also will attempt to give these pills to others, even though they are not prescribed them.

For this reason and many others, we have not had a close relationship with my husband's parents over the years.  She has been telling me since I was 17 years old to have babies, even though I was clearly not ready at that age, and Jeremy and I didn't get married until I was 24. I am 26 now. She has always been excited to be a grandma, but the idea makes me sick. Jeremy has two brothers that are a shining example of her ability to be a mother - one is a full blown drug addict, which happened at the hands of his parents, and the other knowingly contracted HIV. Jeremy has made it out as good as he has because of the distance he has chosen to put between himself and his family. His mother is currently not working and went broke after quitting her job ""for the summer"" last year and not working until this day. 

She lives on Facebook and has made multiple comments to me on Facebook that have made me uncomfortable because other people can see them and because it is embarrassing. I think it would be annoying to hear these comments anyways, but being in public like that really bothers me. She will even ""Share"" pictures of me that I take of myself. It is over the top and out of control. I have been guilt ridden in keeping her as a friend and not blocking her, both things that I have done before feeling bad because my husband would start getting incessant texts. 

She is over the moon about me being pregnant but I don't have a relationship with her at all and she has already done so many inappropriate things. She took my ultrasound picture and made it the background on her phone. She took my ultrasound picture to an ultrasound technician for her own personal analysis. She suggested that my husband I start growing marijuana to support our children financially (something that we obviously have no interest in doing).  She shared my announcement to friends and family on her Facebook and got upset that she ""found out that way"" even though she already knew about the entire situation. She also keeps talking about me and this pregnancy online which I don't think is her place. She will not stop being possessive about my unborn children and it is really stressing me out. She is constantly referring to them as ""my babies"", when the are MY BABIES!

I know I need to do something, as my husband it pretty much useless in this matter and will not confront his mother. He already says he told her to keep our personal business off of Facebook and to not bother me about the pregnancy but clearly that does not matter to her. I don't know what to do because I was raised to have respect for people but me not confronting her is more than that and she is mowing me down at this point and stressing me out. What should I do??",12Mar2017,2
212,"Okay, I'll get started with things that have happened today. Full disclosure: I know the things that I do are not okay. I know I should seek professional help (I have and I am). Posting on reddit is a last resort. So please, no judgement.
Today I did some social engineering to try and find more about my boyfriend's ex. Which is wrong. And I did manage to find out things I had been looking for. But I feel gross about it and anxious and awful.
I've done many things about my obsession with her that make me feel awful: -stalk her social media -pretend to be her on social media as a means of discovering more about her -tried and hack into her social media, etc.
She lives in a different country or I'd probably try and meet her or something.
Here's the thing. I've always been obsessed with my boyfriend's exes. I know what triggered it. The first boy I was in love with still had feelings for his ex. He took my virginity and then immediately stated ""I wanted to save my virgnity for [ex-girlfriend] because I love her and not you"". Thus I began obsessively trying to be more like his ex, etc.
It consumes my life. I compare pictures of her and I side-by-side to try and determine who's pretty. Also doesn't help that she's an artist and so am I. So art comparison is huge.
More about me: I'm a fairly successful person for my age. I work at a high-paying job. I have a 3.8 GPA. I have many friends. I just completed my second gallery show and am working on my third.
I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist for this very issue and see a counselor regularly. I also meditate and try and maintain a spiritual view of the world. I'm healthy, physically and mentally (except for this one issue). I suspect I may have OCD though.
I've asked random people on the internet to compare us phsyically. And I wish I could share this obsession with someone. I'm just dying to hear ""You're prettier, smarter, more successful, nicer, and have better art"". But I know that's not a reasonable thing to ask for or to want.
I'm looking for solace. Perhaps someone can relate. Or advice (besides from the 'seek professional help' because I have and I am and it's not doing much for me). Thanks.",12Mar2017,20
214,"So yesterday I felt so ill at work, I basically had really bad period pains and couldn't be at all productive. I told my boss and she told me to go home and seemed sympathetic. 

Anyway my experience with period pains is they are absolute hell for the first few hours and then ease up. In the evening my friend was having people round since he is moving away, at this point I felt a lot better and decided to go for a bit. I had a few drinks which is the only thing that does ease the pain for me. 

And to my horror my friend posted a picture of us all to facebook. The place I work is really big, there's like 300 members of staff. I don't have any of them on facebook but then realised someone in my department is friends with a mutual friend on facebook. Thankfully I got him to untag himself but it had already been up for a while.

Obviously I'm terrified someone saw, realised I went home sick and told my boss I was faking it because I was with my friends that night. If I get questioned I'm planning to say the photo was from last weekend and my friend always takes ages to upload things. 

I don't need any lectures about taking time off lol I just want to know how fucked I am. And if my excuse is enough to get me out of trouble.",12Mar2017,1

216,"Okay, so I'm an 18 year-old girl and I still live with my parents. My parents have never liked the idea of chatting with people online, but they allowed it, as long as I stayed completely anonymous. 
I recently started Youtube, so my social media became less private, but still vague. Anyways, I recently met this guy (who's 23) on the internet a few days ago and we started talking on Instagram, but moved over to Snapchat. We've been talking and talking, for hours at a time. We really hit it off. The thing is, I'm worried that it's not such a good idea to be talking so much with someone I don't know. I mean, he seems legit. He has an Instagram full of photos of him and his friends (his friends comment on his pictures), and last night when everyone was asleep, I voice chatted with him on SnapChat. It's something I never thought I'd do on the internet, but something about this guy is really pushing away all previous logic.
I also can't meet him to know if he is who he says he is. I live in the US, but he lives in the UK. I just want to know if this is a bad idea? Should I try and continue to voice/video chat with him when I can? Or should I just stop? It's got me in a situation, because if he isn't lying or catfishing, I feel like I'm really starting to get a crush on this guy. He's really nice and we have really great conversations. Any advice for me?


Edit: Also, I know I'm an adult, but my parents kind of have the rule ""if you live with us, you're still a kid"" thing going on, so that sucks. I've always respected my parents' rules and I'm legit getting anxiety from breaking them.",12Mar2017,1
219,"I had (or have) a (best?) friend. Since the beggining of the relationship, I felt like I as the one trying to get in touch with him. While we were at the same school he didn't texted me or tried to hang out with me. Not completely of course, but I was considering myself lucky when I had a text message from him after 1.5 months. I texted him a little bit more frequently, but not much, because I didn't want to be sticky. I asked why he is not trying to communicate with me several times, and he said;
-because we were in the same school,
-he thought our communication level was good enough
-he went abroad for a year (I understand this; it can be hard to live abroad)
-he was busy
-he had exams for university
I don't know. I had exams too, and we weren't actually seeing each other in the school that much anyway. After we gratuated from high school, we still weren't seeing each other too often. We were hanging out one night for every two months, and most of the time I was the planner and the initiator. I was also depressed(not because of this situation), but I still thought I should try to maintain our friendship. Anyway, after some time I started to call him less often, but that didn't change the frequency of his calls. After some time we went to our universities, and I thought I should stop calling him, because I think it is natural for a friendship to fade when you are in different social groups and one side is already not doing much to keep in touch. So I stopped calling him. By the way, I always remembered his birthdays, and I even once gave him a hand-made present. He remebered only once, and that was because I told him a week ago that it was my birthday. And he didn't even asked me to hang out (I didn't have any friends, and I still don't), just a message. Anyway, I stopped calling him 9 months ago. Then, yesterday, out of the blue, he texted ""hi, how are you doing, it's been long since we last talked"". So we talked about what we are doing and stuff, and then I asked him, ""I'm confused. Am you talking to an ex friend just because you are curious how he's doing, or are we just still friends?"". He said that we are still friends. But I am confused. If the communication ends completely for 9 months when I stop trying, how can we still be friends? What should I say? I mean, I know he's busier than average people, he went abroad, he has other friends, and stuff like that, but I was the only person putting effort into this friendship. I don't know, maybe I am a bit angry, but what should I do? I just want a definitive answer, am I doing something wrong? Is it over? Are we still really friends?

To give some background, he's had many jobs, the most significant was he was doing geology work on oil rigs out in AZ, TX, OK for a total of 8 years. He had a serious GF, lived together, planned to get married, but when there started to be less work on the oil rigs, they moved back home and she ended up breaking up with him. It's been over 3 years since then and he's had no direction. Over 10 years ago he got a DUI, and often gets speeding tickets, but still has the idea he's going to be truck driver. He likes to travel, drive, he's very outgoing, loves to be outdoors. He was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and he clearly has some of the same behaviors. Often can't focus on one idea or plan and that sort of thing, he was awful at school, got his GED but absolutely does not want to go back. He has some certifications related to construction. He got a job for the summer to give him time to figure it out. He's somewhat depressed I believe due to no plan, no love life, and no foreseeable future. I just wish I had some ideas of long term jobs he could actually work his way up the ladder and not just jobs that lead no where. Or some idea of how he can make some obtainable goals and reach them. Does anyone have any advice on how to do this? Possible job ideas, words of wisdom, etc. Thanks and sorry for a wall of text.

242,"Hello guys,

Gonna try to make this really short.
I'm 20 and barely 1 month ago I went to a party about 100km from my house with a couple of friends. I'm usually shy but since I was drinking some of that inhibition went away, when I was there I saw this hot chick and approached her, it was really easy to start talking with her, she was really nice and I loved the chat with her, eventually I had to go and we exchanged phone numbers.

The day after I wasn't really planning to text her because I tought she was way out of my league, but to my surprise she texts me late at night and from there on we start texting every night.
 
Since I never had a girlfriend I feel like I get really hooked to girls who pay attention to me, I try my best to not look needy but there was this time she got real flirty and I swear she hooked me, now I mean, I don't feel in love with her but I see myself thinking about her more than I want to. The problem is, I don't want that to happen because I live far away from her and if we were to see each other it would have to be monthly.
And yeah, over the time I've discovered she talks to many more guys, the same way she talks to me, that should make me stop obsessing over her right? Nah, it doesn't really, I still think about her all the time.

What can I do to stop this from happening?

250,"Hi. Sorry in advance for the long post. Just please read it. I really need some help. I'm 15 now. And my cousin  and I aren't so close as to where we talk everyday. But we talk on occasion. And we go to same school. My cousin is in the grade above me. But we are almost the same age she's about 6 to 7 months older. And we were swimming one day at my house and we were done. And we went to my room just to hang out. My mom was outside with her garden. And we were talking listening to music off our phones. And me being 14 and a half at the time (her 15) she noticed I was kinda sitting weird she asked why. ( we were in the floor not my bed.) I said no reason and she told me to just sit normel. I tried telling her I was fine but then she started trying to wrestle with me just to screw with me. She pulled me flat on my back and she saw my boner. She just laughed and said ""so that's why"". I was so embarrassed ( I only got puberty a few months before.) She said it was fine. I tried to tell her it wasn't bc I had saw her in a bikini. ( she is pretty don't get me wrong. I never looked at her like I wanted to sleep with her. Once or twice I might of looked at her. But I was 14. When your a 14 year old male you mostly can't help yourself) she just laughed it off. And we went back to talking. My erection went away. So we kept talking and then she got up in front of me and purposely let me see down her shirt. ( shes got big boobs. Not like huge. But I'd say about the size of a softball and maybe two golfballs. ) so after just noticing that I got an erection. I didn't want to I knew it was wrong but I couldn't help it. Then she looked down sure enough she said I knew it. Then I started to panic. I tried to explain to her she then just said she wasn't mad. And it's perfectly fine. She then said have I ever seen a girls boobs. I said no. (And no I didn't in real life. Online yes. But I didn't tell her that.) She said oh. Then she sat on the bed and looked at her phone. She said these exact words ""just ask me."" I didn't think she ment what I thought. So I asked ""what'' then she said '' you know what'' I said ''are you sure?'' She then looked at me and took her shirt off. I was shoked I of course looked awAy and she told me to look. I did. And she said take them off I'm tired of seeing it through your pants. I said no. That's wrong. And she said ' if you do I will take something else off'' I did. I'm ashamed now that I did. But I did. She looked at it. Just grabbed it s couple times and said alright now I'll take mine off. Before I could say anything she had taken her pants off and was standing there. She said nothing. But then as quick as she took off he clothes she put them back on. Then she said she had to use the bathroom. I should've know it was a trick. Bc as soon as she left I was jerking off and I went really fast to. But I never came that hard ever. And I cleaned up. Then she came In. And said ''glad you enjoyed yourself.'' I acted like I don't know what she ment. But that was all we ever did. And since then when I had a class with her I kept staring at her. And that was like months after. Then I ended up seeing her she went to the mall. We were in a really small photo booth. It was ment for like couples. Si we stated to take pictures and I ended putting my hand on her leg but took it off right away. And got an erection. It was dark so she didn't notice. But then I texted her later that night and bright up what happend that summer day. She said what about it. Then I said I was sorry she said it was fine. And then I did the unthinkable. Something if always dreaded. I asked her to take a selfie. She said what kinda selfie. And gave three options. One with just her face one with her naked in it and one with just her boobs. I chose 3. Thinking she was serious. Then she called me saying I was sick and she was telling her parents and that I asked my oldest cousin (who is now 20) that I asked for pics of her to which was a lie. Terrified I begged her not to. She made me confess what I had asked on to a recording she had. And she said I had to admit I asked her both time so scared  I did as I was told. And she ended up deleting it but still. Since then when ever I see her I get horny. Once i even took a pair of her panties. Which i put back. And I can't help but get turned on. I really know it's wrong but I jerk off to her sometimes. And iv even wanted to sleep with her. Idk what to do. ",12Mar2017,1

254,"Hello, my fiance of 1 year and love of my life has recently been having severe emotional issues. It's been hard since it started having an effect on his ability to hold jobs, we moved in to live with my father. The panic attacks start when he wakes up, unable to eat and suffering acid reflex. It's worth mentioning he's had a previous surgery on his stomach, that was serious enough to be transferred to a University Hospital. The best I can do is comfort him and try breathing exercises to calm him down, and it barely works leading to chronic fatigue. 

The job security really started to shake when he started having a panic attack every morning. He couldn't handle the stress of being at work, piled on top of the panic attack morning stress. Then it became hard for me to hold a job because I didn't like the fact that me being away would cause him panic attacks. Lately I hold a part-time job and treat him with what basic pharmacy meds I can find. 

His surgeries, IBS, GERD, and lactose intolerance really make the anxiety that much harder for him to deal with. I'll try antacids, non-dairy, even CBD oil for appetite. It barely works. He claims to have been on anti-anxiety meds before, as well as some visits to psychiatric wards because of suicidal thoughts from anxiety and depression. 

It was only a recent realization that he may be disabled and qualify for some sort of living compensation. He wants to gather his medical records and approach the SSA, but is struggling. I really think we need some further advice on the what to gather and steps we should take. Maybe even some personal advice on how I can help to take care of his personality disorders?

256,"I feel like my best friend is holding me back. We we're really good buddies at university for finance and we both took a job at the same company and moved into an apartment complex in Pennsylvania about a year ago.

He's not particularly driven and often lazy, but he's still a good friend me. Without him, I'm a very lonely person. Even now, I get depressed often and feel like I need to join a group. I was thinking of joining a boxing club.

Anyways, a couple months ago he got a girlfriend. I don't particularly like her. She's not overtly rude or anything, she just doesn't acknowledge me, is not hygenic, and basically lives here now at no extra cost to her. She relies on my friend maybe too much financially considering it's only been a couple months. She posts really dramatic and ambiguous over the top facebook posts, and I'm worried about her affect on my friend.

My friend has no time for me now and has spiraled in a state where he's even lazier and negligent of me. His girlfriend smokes pot (I have nothing against smokers), however, bringing it in without asking and smelling up the place was not a nice thing to do.

He seems very happy but also like he's becoming lazier. I'm worried that one day he won't be happy with her anymore and realize how much he's spiraled downhill.

For that reason (him being happy), I'm not trying to pry him away or anything. I just feel like living with him has made me more lazier. I want to be around type A personalities that are hard workers and in fit shape (because I am stuck in between type A and type B and want to be a type A).

Part of me is considering exploring moving into a single in the same complex. Like I said, I'm looking for a mentor (more so, someone to look up to atheltically to get back into shape), however, I don't know anyone like that....so I at least want to consider a single.

He eats a lot of junk food and I used to eat healthy but now I am gaining weight back. I don't blame my weight gain on him at all, but it's affecting my choices (these were my wrongs).

I'm 24 years old and I feel like I'm in my prime. It feels as though I've already wasted so much time being lazy and wasting potential. I don't want to upset my friend, but I know him...and he will be offended.

257,"Hey, /r/advice.

I'll just cut to the chase. Yes I know what I did was dumb, yes I know there's probably nothing I can do. I just want to vent and I'm holding onto hope that I can get the money back.

So, recently was my birthday. My sister lives somewhere in the area, and I don't have her phone number, only snapchat. For my birthday, I asked her if she could order me something online for $350 I've earned from doing people's homework at school. She said yes, and told me to leave the money in my mailbox and she'd get it later.

I probably should have asked my parents first to order it, but I had my doubts. Or I should have bought myself some PayPal gift cards, but I really thought I could trust my sister, she is 21 by the way.

Days later I asked her if she ordered it. She never responded. I called her over snapchat and nobody picked up. Later she blocked me on snapchat, and made her Facebook private.

I added her boyfriend on Facebook and asked him in a nice way to tell her that I wanted to talk to her for a little bit, and if she could at least tell me if she's taking the money and not giving it back so I don't have to bother them about it anymore. He shortly blocked me after that message.

I really don't know what to do. I have a good idea of where they live, in some apartment complex but not the exact room number. I tried calling their apartment complex, but nobody ever picks up.

I would tell my parents but I think they'll call me stupid for losing my money to her (They really dislike my sister.) and I already know I've made a mistake. 

I've already tried googling her and her boyfriend, and I have some information on where they work, but that won't help with anything. I wish I had their cellphone number so I could call them at least.

Please let me know if there's anything I can try. I worked so hard for this money and I'd really hate to see it go all to waste.

He claims he is busy and hates fb which is our only messaging platform. I beg him to talk to me, I have dont so much for him and all I want is one thing that I can't get. 

So, I met this man who is in the same country. He is a nice guy but I am not attracted. We plan to do some stuff, mainly just giving him HJs. He knows I am not attracted to him but I like the attention. There is no kissing or affection involved in this, and we will hang out less than once a month. Is this considered cheating? I feel lost. Serious replies only please, thank you.

EDIT: I have decided not to do anything with this man. It is pointless and will not fix my relationship. Thank you for talking sense into me",12Mar2017,0
263,"I can't really move on from past regrets and memories, I've tried and it still hurts.

 I've wasted so much time, wasted my youth, my education - was home tutored, but didn't bother doing much - obviously regret it now. I acted so stupid in my teenage years.
I thought I'd started to move on, I'm back in college, uk version, trying to get my education back, but it hurts because this wasn't me. I was meant to be better than this. I was a good student, I was responsible and mature. I don't know what happened to me nor why I made so many bad decisions, why my life went down the toilet.
 I didn't want to spend parts of my youth looking at porn, doing crappy courses that didn't go anywhere, acting like an idiot or trolling the internet. What a waste.

I hardly have any friends, so I haven't done much/anything in the last few years. Some of my life has been spent imagining how it could've been, wasting yet more time. I know it's not a healthy way of thinking.

Is there a way I could move on? I try, but then it hits me out of nowhere. I can't seem to accept it. Typing this out, I know how bitter it sounds.",12Mar2017,5
267,"Long text ahead. Will be both ambiguous to protect myself and oddly specific when it doesn't matter, and will try to portray both sides of the argument fairly because I don't know what to do.

So I'm 50 years old. I have a degree in something that usually leads to careers being waiters or throwing bags of fertilizer at Wal-Mart, but 5 years after graduation I lucked into a career doing what I loved. Let's say it's a sort of graphic design.

It was great getting paid to do my art. Didn't feel like the ""real"" jobs I'd had after college. I was using my degree and most people I graduated with didn't.

At first there was volatility. The first two places I worked at closed within 6 months of my arrival (then I got married). Stability got better over time; my last job in this field lasted 10 years (during which we had children).

Then, I was laid off, and couldn't get back in. I applied to every opening I found (which actually were rare - this specific industry in this area is very tight), but the roles would always go to younger, less experienced candidates. I have roots here and choose not to relocate.

After being unemployed for 2 1/2 years and our finances looking grim, I took an entry-level job at a friend's company that had nothing to do with my career, skills, or degree. However it was a check.

I'm still there three years later.

It's been a while, but another opening in my ""previous career field"" has come up, and I'm actually debating whether to apply. I would appreciate your advice.

On the one hand: the position would be working with two people I've worked with in the past - so I know the people are good (okay maybe I wouldn't choose to drive across the country with them). This specific company has been around for a very long time (for that industry), so they are stable as a place like this can be - though I know they have had layoffs in the past. And if I don't apply, I'd feel like I was ""giving up"" on my previous career.

On the other hand: I know I probably have a small chance at getting the job. They are casting their net wide for ONE person. There will be a skills test, and I have done poorly on them before (and probably sulked a bit afterward). The skills test and any potential interview would probably mean taking 2 days off of work, and I don't get as many of those as I'd like. My wife pointed out that, though this isn't in my field, I do have a very stable job - the company I'm at is in the Fortune 500 and has been around over 100 years, they won't close their doors tomorrow (as has happened to me THREE times) and they never have layoffs. I'm making 84% of what I made when I got laid off in 2012. I'm making 59% more than I did when I started this job (got promoted once, got three nice raises).

Should I throw my hat in the ring for this job?
