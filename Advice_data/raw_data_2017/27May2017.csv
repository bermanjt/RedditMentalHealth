0,"Hi, using a throwaway I've always had on hand just in case something came up, and well 
Yesterday my friend attempted suicide. He said final goodbyes, ran away from home, and was found by his family with a gun to his head and the reason he didn't pull the trigger was because they were in front of him.
The problem is I do not know how to help him. His family refuses to get him medical help ( therapy, medication etc )because they are afraid he will get taken away from them. But he is diligent and has told me again that he has already made the decision, and will go through with it when he gets the chance.
What can I do? Is there anything I can do? He is a minor and won't be 18 for another 2 years so he can't go out and get help himself. 
Please help.",27May2017,1
1,"Feel kinda stupid posting this on my first throwaway, especially cause Ive never done anything like this before, but here goes... So, basically theres been this quiet, beautiful foreign girl in most of my classes for the past 2 years. Never really talked due to shyness on both parts but she's really great all-round. I've seen less and less of her this year and have been determined to talk to her 1 to 1 if I ever got a proper chance. Except, I basically bottled every interaction, often due to other people being around. I think I catch her looking at me every now and again too. But, today was my last day of my second year at uni before leaving for a years placement. Likely never seeing her again, but I do know her facebook. A big part of me thinks its way too creepy to add her out of the blue given the lack of social interaction, especially if ive misread the whole situation. Ahhh its a tricky one, I think I fucked this one bad, learn and move on, like the massive bottle-job I am. But there's reasons for and against for sure.. had months and months for this crush to wear off but its still there.

Update: sent a friend request after staring at the same screen for like an hour lol. 

Update 2: Accepted. Cant do it.",27May2017,1

4,"I am graduating from Southern New Hampshire University with a BS in Game Programming and Development. I was wondering if anyone had advice on what steps I should take before or after graduation that will help me get a career.

So far I have experience with C#, C++, Java, Unreal Engine 4, LiveCode, Adobe Animate, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Visual Studio, and I will be getting more experience each term. I live in Michigan, and I absolutely do not mind moving for a career. I would like to work on game projects, but any software project is interesting to me, too.

Does anyone have advice for me on my future?

7,"Let me preface this by saying that I don't hate my mom and she's not a terrible parent. She's done a lot for me when I was growing up, but our situation has become extremely tricky and unstable and I don't know what to do but every day with her is starting to burn me out. 

I'm 25 and I live with my mom. Not by choice. I'd much rather be living alone, but my mom would never be able to afford any of her bills alone and I felt compelled to stay home and help her pay bills while saving up money to eventually get out on my own. Mistake number one. My mom already makes barely $300 a week (she's a waitress, has been for 30-something years, and in my state waitresses only make about $2 an hour plus tips) but recently, she herniated several discs in her back and had to cut down her hours at work. Now she's bringing home $200 a week, if that. 

We used to split the bills 50/50; I'd pay half of the rent, she'd pay half of the rent, etc. But now, I'm paying all of the rent (almost $800 a month!) and the cable and electricity. She has a $400 a month car payment and a $250 a month car insurance and she can barely afford those most months, so I get stuck with everything else. She can't afford groceries by the time she's done with her car payment, so I end up forking more money over for that too. 

I'm depressed and I'm at my wits end. I know my mother is depressed too because she can't afford to do anything about the situation we're in either, and her back problems are not getting any better, but my mother is completely financially dependent on me and it's breaking me. I'm depressed, I can never afford to do anything because I don't have any money left to myself after paying all of the bills and buying groceries. I tried applying for food stamps, welfare, you name it, and I was rejected for all kinds of aid. My mom applied for disability because of her back and she was rejected, so she still forces herself to go to work 3 or 4 days a week even though she struggles to walk with her back problems. 

And it just seems to be getting worse and worse. Every month, there's something new that she can't pay that I need to cover, and I've put myself in the negative and I'm drowning in debt that I can't pay off because I'm paying all of my mother's bills.

I didn't want to post this in r/raisedbynarcissists because my mom isn't a narcissist. At least, I don't think she is. She's always had a hard life and she dealt with my physically/psychologically abusive father for more than 20 years, but it's like I've become her crutch in more ways than one and I don't know what to do. I stop paying the bills, we both get evicted and end up on the street. I keep paying the bills, I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle that's slowly killing me for at least another 5 years until she's paid off the car.  I just don't know what to do to keep myself sane, or if there's anything I can do at this point.",27May2017,1
10,"My current place is dangerous to my health in other ways... infested with American Roaches and has a gas leak...

The new place would actually not have gas, have a CO2 monitor, bigger space, cheaper, and close to work! It's just under a freeway, and I am worried about THOSE new health risks.

11,"I've always been pretty damn skinny and usually fairly athletic. These last 6+ months I definitely went out to play my sports a lot less and I feel like I've been able to eat a lot less as well.

I've always hovered around the 53-54 kg (115-120 lbs) mark, but the past month or two I think I've been around 110 or even less.

The last four or five days I've been sick and just have not been able to eat much. It just feels like my stomach is constantly full. 

I just weighed myself knowing I was gonna be around 45 kg (100 lbs). My cheeks look pretty sunken in and I'm just a bit worried almost at this point.

Summer is pretty much here and being a Senior in high school who didn't do the best, I think I felt suffocated during the ending months and mostly just felt dead, so I was going to take advantage to get back into a good routine.

14,"So ever since i started dating i would always date white guys, then my preference started to change to mexicans, asians, and so on. But i've never found attraction twords a black male before. I have plenty of black male friends and they are some of my closest friends, but i can't picture myself in a relationship with them.

(I'm not going to get to in-depth depth with this, i will summarize)

 When i was in pre-school i had a traumatizing event happen to me, i was crying for my mother when she dropped me off at the school  because i had seperation issues, to get me to stop interrupting the class the teacher sent me into a small closest and sent 3 boys into the closet to make me be quite since i started screaming and crying because i was scared. One boy sat on me, i think i kicked one of the other boys (my memory isnt the best since it was a long time ago)and as i was kicking and crying one of the boys bit me because i kicked him. My mom picked me up and noticed the bite mark and talked to another teacher about it and they covered the incident up. Years later we ran into the teacher (not the one who told the boys to do that to me)and she told my mom the truth. Of course my mom fliped out, was on the verge of crying. Then at 19 i was sexually assulted by a black man. I am 20 now and went to a theripist and was diagnosed with PTSD. 

Today i was talking to a black guy  whom i have Mutual friends with an he asked why i only like white and asain guys (thats what he heard from my friends) and i replied ""well its just my preference and what i'm use to"" then he called me racist. 

I've encountered this so many times in my life and I'm just sick of being called racist, I'm also mixed with black and white. I could never hate my own people, i just have preferences. 

I don't know how to handle these situations anymore when i encounter them... any advice would be great. 

Edit: Yes the boys were black as well.",27May2017,4

23,"Long story short my bfs mother kicked me out of his apartment. His Nana showed up as I was packing, while she was watching me she told he that he has made a lot of progress in his life and that as a failure I didn't need to be around dragging him down, and I only just realized that statement has two meanings for this situation. But she also said that we would still be dating I just couldn't live with him. It was really rough but okay I can live with that. Other stuff happened as well between family members. Now he is telling me that he loves me and misses me but he told his family that he stopped talking to me (because they said that they didn't want him talking to me.) I don't know why this bothered me so much but it did. I love him so much and I don't want to let him go but I feel like he is ashamed to tell anyone he loves me and wants me in his life. Who is he lying to, me or them? My heart is breaking. I haven't seen him since the morning I got thrown out, I never got to say goodbye. I just want to see him again, hug him again... I very briefly saw him in a friends video on social media and now I can't stop shaking, I just want to cry. I know the only way we can really be together is if he stands up to his family and tells them he wants me. But they pay for all of his things like college, and his apartment.

26,"okay, so, let's start with establishing that I'm in middle school. 
that being said, here's my issue:
In third grade, I became best friends with another girl. She was really nice until somewhere around fourth grade, when she came back from Vietnam (she went to visit her dying aunt, who died while she was there). When she came back, she suddenly wasn't very nice anymore, and she only got worse as years went by. She treats me like I'm the annoying girl that everybody tolerates but nobody really likes. She kinda treats everybody like that, but me more than others. And she *cannot*, for the life of her, take responsibility for her actions. Just today, we were at school getting out computers from the COW, and she started to hit me in the head with her computer to get it out of the cart. I told her not to hit me, and she responded with, ""Well, it's not *my* fault your head was in the way.""
What should I do? I want to stop being her ""friend"", but I don't know how. should I talk to the school counselor? Other people don't really like her, but they don't not-like her either. You know? So if I got mad at her, it would seem like I'm overreacting about something. ",27May2017,6
30,"I'm looking for the opinions of people roughly my age and older (I'm 26) or who have been in this situation. I'm a new lawyer and I've made pretty much zero friends out of law school.

I'm hesitant because I think that getting a cat or dog might turn me into even more of a recluse, because it would give me an excuse to stay in and/or dote on a pet instead of interacting with actual people. There are obviously benefits to pet ownership (and I would love to run/walk with a dog) but I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

Please note that I'm only asking for advice on this specific aspect. I can afford a pet, I've thought about the time commitment, I know how to keep pets healthy, I'm not so irresponsible as to pick up a cat or dog on a whim and dump it at a shelter the next month, etc.

Anyway, so the task for the project is to find a historical figure (ones we've discussed like Charlemagne, Augustus, Brunelleschi, etc.) and write about events that happened through their lives as if I'm the one who experienced it. For example, if I'm writing about Marie Antoinette I'll have to write something like ""I remember the week before they planned to have me executed. How dreadful it was!"" The professor basically told us it's like writing a novel in first person. What a weird assignment.

The marking period is ending in a few days and my math teacher gave me a 3/4 on my homework dropping my grade by 2% (I had 100% in homework before that). When I came to him about it he wouldn't hear me out and just said that I handed it in 3 days late with nothing on it and that I should be lucky its not a 0. I know for a fact that I did show it to him on the day it was due because the app I do my homework has the date.

I went to my school adviser and he told me to just let it go and that it wasn't worth going through that much trouble. My grade already isn't that great and the 2% would really help my average.

On both sides of my family, knowledge seems to just drift after the great grandparents.  On my mother's side, we have family from Italy and my father was born in Korea.

I have a couple names, but other than that, no information that leads me to create a decent family tree.  My dad is older, confused and the stories change too often for me to take any of the details too seriously.  His mother is from South Korea, but aside from her name, I don't know anything about her or my Korean bloodline at all.

My mother's great-grandparents were from Italy and left family behind there, but, again, there isn't any solid leads, aside from some names.

I've tried Ancestry and some weird sites, but they haven't been much use because they require so much information about the family members in question.

I'm 19, but I am constantly mistaken for a child. People all of the time ask me if I'm twelve or thirteen. This gets kind of annoying as they speak to me like I'm a little kid just because of the way I look. I'm 5'3 and have a really round face and big, round eyes, so I'm guessing that's why. I usually dress in T-shirts and jeans, but the T-shirts don't even look childish (either solid colors or just random art prints. No Forever 21 graphic tees or anything like that lol).

Today, I was there until 9:15, when the schedule said I should only be there until 8:30. My mom called and was really pissed off and yelling at me over the phone and the manager told me that I could leave in a few minutes. I told her and she said that she'd be on her way shortly.

The ride home was horrible, she didn't say a single word to me and only uttered _""ugh, fuck,""_ when traffic was bad. We got home and I went to my room, and she went to the bathroom.

I just finished my first year of college, and am now home for summer vacation. I have a 3.7 GPA with almost all As, and am in the honors program. I come home for college expecting to relax and hang out with my friends but my parents seem to think it shouldn't be past 10 p.m. They stated that it wasn't because they didn't trust me, they tried to reiterate it multiple times that the problem wasn't the trust of me, but the trust of the outside, and their own sense. They felt that past 10 p.m., there would be drunk drivers all over the world and they didn't want one to hit me. They also stated that what parent would let that child outside of the house beyond 10 p.m. For their first problem , I felt it was right to explain to them that nothing happens really before midnight, I suggested that my curfew be by then, but they didn't believe that everything really starts at midnight. I told them multiple times that living in a college campus the past year has allowed me to realize that usually everything doesnt start till midnight. I also stated that wouldn't being in college, and there being a higher concentration of drunk people with cars in one place that a town as small as mine be even more dangerous. They said that that is a college setting and it is different from a town setting. Even if they believed nothing really starts till after midnight, they stated that no parent should allow their child outside of the house past 10 p.m., my mom even said that it was too late for her. I feel that it is comprehensible that a parent can allow their child out past 10 p.m., especially if their child is in college. They also eemed to somehow bring up racism in this conversation in that if someone caused a crash involving me, the police would believe the other guy because he was white. I said multiple times that the police wouldn't automatically accuse me of anything, and they would at least look at the evidence, but they said that I was underestimating racism and was ignorant and refused to listen to anything else I said. I'm looking for advice here on how to allow them to understand that my curfew should at least be extended to midnight, especially since I am a college student that has been making sure to keep my grades up and has been out far later than midnight regularly. It is extremely hard to convince them since they are extremely set in their ways. They feel that every parent that does things differently than them is extremely irresponsible.

I'm a 22 year old, marketing student in college, and applied for a summer internship at a big agency with global offices. Their internship program is great (competitive, but low pay).

3 weeks ago, I had a phone interview with a Manager to work on his team as an intern. Usually the phone interview is enough for them to decide who to hire. The interview went well, I'd say a 7/10 scale. They said they'd give me an answer before Memorial Day, which is this Monday.....

65,"A buddy and I are looking for a place close to campus so we can just walk there once semester starts up. We toured two places, literally side by side one another, and we are a bit stuck on either of them. 

Both are duplexes. Both use gas heating. 

The first one is on street level and is the larger of the two. It's $500 + utilities. Overall it's a decent enough with two bed, one bath, a living room, and a front and back porch. The bedrooms are decent sized, but the one isn't actually supposed to be a bedroom; it's an extension of the main living room but has two wooden sliding doors that close off the room and lock to basically create a wall from the actual living room so the sound dampening isn't great and whoever is stuck with it has significantly less privacy. The other major complaint is that the bathroom is incredibly small, to the point where I don't think we could fit a shelf to store towels and toiletries. On a less crucial note, our upstairs neighbor is a single mother and while neither me nor my friend are huge partiers, we do like to have friends over and occasionally drink among ourselves which can get loud. Having talked to her only once she quite shy but nice. Of the two it's the one we prefer but the landlord has been a nightmare to contact. He has never once answered the phone and only responded through text. He says he is hiring someone to help him with his work load so he can be more present but it hasn't been a welcoming sign to start. Even when we met him it felt really unprofessional as he didn't have any of the lease papers or contracts on hand for us to look over.

The second is the second floor of the building to the right of the first. It's $550 + utilities. It has two bed, one bath, a kitchen, and a back porch; it has no living room which really put my friend and I off since we are both pretty social people and want to have some sort of main meeting area. Both bed rooms are a tiny bit larger with carpeted floors instead of hardwood and with closets for each (the last didn't have closets). The biggest improvement was the bathroom which was actually pretty sizable with tons of storage. The kitchen however was smaller by comparison, so really there is no area in the place that would be good for socializing, meeting, or whatever. The neighbors above and below all go to the same campus but the people on the ground floor are the fratish jockish types and we could hear them even while touring. Above us we only could hear slight thuds but it wasn't enough to be annoying and we have no idea anything about them at the moment. Now, the landlord for this place was much easier to contact and felt much more personable. She's responded within minutes to texts and emails and has even picked up when we called.

68,"My mom and her ""fiance"" have been together for 8 or so years now. My mom got diagnosed with breast cancer a couple years ago and is cancer free now. She still has to see doctors very often and we really haven't moved past it yet.
My mom and her ""fiance"" (more her boyfriend, since I don't think they'll ever actually marry) fight constantly. They have fought as long as they have been together. I'm 16 and have depersonalization/depression. That is hard enough, but seeing my mother constantly in such misery fighting hurts me to no end. I know there's really not much I can do about it, but it's really hard to hear it all the time. It's also really hard for me to stop myself from intervening; I've only done so once. There's nothing physical; it's all verbal.
I'm just not sure how to cope with it anymore. There's just so much misery around me it fucks up my own mental state.",27May2017,1
72,"So I decided to make a throwaway account because I've only just come to realise the effects this event had on me. This is long so bare with me. 

When I was 6 (I think? I suppressed it so much I can't remember exactly) I was being minded at my aunt and uncles house who live locally, and these cousins were all older than me by 8-12 years. One of them was a girl who was in her younger teens (14 probably at the time?) and I remember she was looking after me whilst my uncle and aunt were entertaining friends they had over. I remember my cousin asking if I wanted to come upstairs and play a game with her. Being the shy 6 year old who admired his cousin, of course I said yes. We went upstairs and into her room where she shut the door behind her and said to me that we're going to play an adults game this time. I must stress that we were never super close with this set of cousins and generally speaking would only see them once or twice a year (Christmas and maybe one other time max), so I wasn't as comfortable with her as I was with other cousins. She took her skirt and underwear off and asked me to take my pants off and jump into bed next to her, and then she got me to come up against her and she grabbed my penis and pulled it up against her (just pulled my little pecker up and down) and then when she got close to climaxing, she asked me to stop and I remember her making herself orgasm right next to me. I remember how wrong this made me feel (I didn't even know what sex was until I was 11 or 12 I was a really naive and quiet kid, but I understood that this was not something I should've been involved in) and she looked over at me and told me that this had to be a secret. I never mentioned it when I went home and somewhat decided it was just something to keep to myself so I suppressed it over time. This was the only time it happened. 

Things I look back on that I think we're directly related:

- When I was a bit older (13) it flashed back at me a bit and that's when I started to gather something really wrong had happened there, and for the next 2 years I'd have nightmares about having forced sex that I didn't want. They were always with female family members making me do it, and it'd give me really bad anxiety and fuck me up in my head. 

I used to think about it but being a young kid in high school but I just thought that she was at least good looking (objectively speaking only, even though I'm not at all attracted to her and understand how fucked that sounds) and I thought that even if it was forced, you're a guy so you weren't molested because that's not how it works. I tried to run with this theory and let it subside until I've started thinking about it again as an adult and realised that this wasn't normal. 

- Another big impact it had on me was that I didn't masturbate until I was 19, and the only reason I did it was because I had a girlfriend at the time and each time we'd have sex I'd be way too humming to go and last all of 2 minutes. Prior to that I always had this feeling that I was being used if I was to touch myself and I think it was because of that. Talking to the rest of my mates now they all say they started playing with themselves between 10-14 and I always lie and say it was around then just to avoid questions. 


So basically I don't know if I want to speak to my cousin about it, tell my mum/dad about it or what to do. I've only just as a 25 year old man realised how that impacted my younger self, and it's something that's been in my head every day for weeks so I wanted to ask the reddit world for some help. I feel robbed that this happened and she got away with it, never once apologised to me and every Christmas I see her face and I no longer want her to think that I'm in any way going to accept it, even if it just means I ignore her quietly. 

Feel free to ask away because I've probably worded this awfully but thanks again for any help my dudes and dudettes. ",27May2017,23
73,"Throw away account to pick the hive mind of reddit parenting.

I have a significantly younger sibling in college right now and shit is about to hit the fan.

She basically flunked out of college during her 3rd semester of college and was allowed to stay in on probation after appealing to her dean on the basis of psych issues (depression and anxiety).

She confided in me about this, and was too afraid to tell my parents. (we are more than 10 years apart in age). I told her she needed to rethink her major and take some classes she’s actually interested in and prioritize academics and health (trying to get good sleep, exercise, eat better). I told her this was a big wake up call and she needed to make significant changes. 

Shortly after her semester started, though initially she seemed to be making a turn for the better, I began seeing FB posts about skipping classes and she was telling me things like “oh I napped instead of going to class today.” She stopped working out.

To make a long story short, this semester I don’t think went particularly well either (though she has not told me the specifics), but she lied to my parents about finding a job over the summer (she told them she has a job when she has no job), she lied to them about classes she’s taking next semester and faked an official looking schedule. They know something is up but they don’t know how bad it is.

I’ve confronted my sister and asked her to come clean – clean slate – just be honest. I told her the best thing to do under these circumstances is to take responsibility and try to think of ways to improve. This was a train wreck/face plant that was bound to happen at some point. I told her it was wrong to lie to my parents (who have taken out a huge amount of debt to pay for her education) and subsequently she accused me of being emotionally abusive because I was guilting her. 

Like I said, my parents know something is up. I’ve expressed to them before my degree of concern without actually telling them that she flunked out last semester. Either way, my parents have gotten the school to release her transcript by proving that she’s a filing taxes as a dependent and will be able to see it on Sunday. They have no idea it’s THIS bad. My sister seems to have little insight too on how bad it is and refuses to take personal responsibility for it. Any failure she has ever had, she manages to blame it on someone or situation without ever taking any responsibility.

I am really worried. I’m concerned about my aging parents and how they are going to react to this bombshell. I’m concerned that my sister is going to be confronted with all of her lies and feel that she is pinned into a corner. Not sure what to do in the next few days. I feel like I’m watching a train wreck that inevitably going to happen. 

TL:DR sister sucks at college and is constantly lying about everything to my parents, they are about to find out  and likely confront her, it’s going to be terrible and I don’t know what to do

78,"Hi.

The job I am in is EXTREMELY demanding but sticking with it for a few years will help me a lot in the future. 

Most days I am working 9am to 8pm and because I am sitting at my desk looking a numbers, forecasts, spreadsheets and so on I am not really tired. I do however often feel drained, energy comes in spikes and sometimes I simply don't have the energy to pick up my phone and call colleagues. 

I am trying to think up a good daily routine for this job. This is what I am thinking so far:


6am: - Alarm, wake up

6am - 7am: Eat a small breakfast of some fruit, do some light exercise in my room. Watch financial news whilst doing this, so take it slow.

7am - 8am: shit shower shave, get dressed, head out to work

8am - 8:20am:  Travelling time to work. 

8:20am - 8:45am: Eat breakfast at work canteen - offers cereal, fruit, honey, milk and so on. Eat well. 

8:45am: Arrive at my desk. Read the news headlines. Perhaps make a few shitposts on reddit. 

9:00am-9:15am: Start reading my emails from yesterday/over the weekend, ensure there are no tasks I forgot to do. 

9:15am - 12pm: Work. Meetings. 

12pm - 1pm: Lunch break. Eat lunch. Go for a walk if it's sunny outside.

1pm - 2pm: News headlines, read the news of my industry, read a few case studies, maybe close my eyes and phase out for half an hour. 

2pm - 6:30pm: Work, meetings, etc.

6:30pm - 7pm: Dinner in work canteen. Socialise with my fellow overtime brigade, especially the seniors.

7pm - 8pm: Begin to wind down, handle a lot of the aspects of work where other people are not required. Ensure all tasks of the day are dealt with before leaving the office. 

8pm - 8:20pm: home travelling time

8:20pm - 10:00pm: Wash face, eat a small snack, watch the news (yes, i enjoy doing this ok?) wind down, maybe read a few chapters of whatever book I'm reading. Aim to have my head down in the pillow and be fast asleep by 10:15 to 10:30pm. (Allowing at least 7 hours sleep)

80,"I'm kind of clueless with dating. I usually don't grow fond of people for years between them and even then it may not work out. Last time i had a SO i was in high school and it lasted a week because i didn't show her i really liked her (even though i ""flirted"" with her for a couple months). The last time i was interested in someone was last year, but i think i took to long to act (tbh i was waiting to get my car to take her out on a date) and she dated someone else.

The relationships i have with friends are also starting to wane, either i see them less and less, i don't want to see them, or i do want to see them but they don't want to see me.

But with dating i'm just kinda weird. It usually takes me a while to like someone, i never flirt with people unless i'm interested after weeks or months of knowing them. And i tend not to flirt (even if i want to) unless i have a reason to talk to that person in the first place. I'm passive in nature rather than shy. 

I want to ask the receptionist (not an office or business environment) from my work out for coffee, but i want to make small talk for a while before i do but i find that difficult at times when other people are in the way. But even then i don't want to go out and ask, it's something i always tend to be patient with.

I've only ever had 2 girlfriends and flirted with 3 people within the past 5 years (i'm 19), i'm not even sure that if i were to date her what to do. Most of my friends are either working too much to be in a relationship, just not wanting to date, or F around with multiple people.",27May2017,8

82,"I'm female and 19 years old. I've had one serious relationship of about 3 years before my current one. I've never really dealt with long distance before. I'm absolutely smitten over my amazing boyfriend now. We've been together for about five months currently. He's leaving for basic training in about three months and signed up all together for four years. 

I know I'm a bit young to even think about marriage and having kids or long term commitments. Especially on such a short amount of time being with my boyfriend. But when I say that I love him, I mean it. So the advice I'm seeking is how to prepare myself? 

We started this relationship with our own set goals: his military career and my nursing career. So I'm not worried about our dreams being shattered or at risk due to our passion for each other because we walked into this relationship knowingly. I'm also not too worried about the distance so much. I love him enough to believe in our relationship lasting. I'm also not oblivious to the fact that anything can happen in a span of time not being around each other. Whether that means breaking things off are staying together. Which, of course I hope for the latter.

I get more anxious about him being away and me being impatient. We've mentioned us moving in together maybe a couple years down the road. (We always keep an open mind because we're both young still. So we don't set relationship plans in stone. Although deep down we both believe it'll happen one day.) I've never really been involved with military life. Not much of my family was armed forces, and my boyfriend is the first love interest I've ever had interested in the military. 

What keeps me up anxiously at night is thinking about how I'm going to prepare myself when he finally does leave and ship out. Or what am I going to do in my time waiting for things to progress between us. I'm not much of someone who always has to be moving in a relationship. I'm not worried about not having sex or anything like that. I mainly will miss just being around him in general. But, I am scared that I'll get so worried and fearful waiting for things to move forward between us while he's in the military. (Such as us seeing each other, us moving in together, getting married, etc.) 

So, what I'm asking here is if anyone has any advice from personal experiences similar. Especially couples who survived being away from each other and growing the relationship through the years. Thank you so much in advance for any readers and replies!

I don't want to work this weekend because I'll be seeing my closest friends that I haven't seen in a while, some for years. It will be a while before i get another opportunity like this.

This job is a side gig. I work as a freelance videographer, camera assistant, and PA. I'm new and i still don't make enough money to fully support myself, but i live with my parents, so there isn't a real financial burden.

I'm saving up money to move to LA to get better work. I told my manager the truth. The trip had been planned way beforehand. But she told me I was still responsible. This trip is important to me because I honestly don't have any friends at my current locale. No one to be myself around.

But there is a huge amount of guilt behind skipping work and being irresponsible. The only thing that gives me comfort is that it'll be the night shift an should be less busy.

89,"I have known this girl for just under a year. We first met at a friends pool party last August and just started to casually talk. She is currently learning English, Japanese being her native tongue, so the conversation was slow, but it was still fun. I had asked her to go to dinner some time in the future, and she accepted. Great! So we talked for a while, and decided to do it again. And again. We go out to different places a handful of times. At this point I have started to develop feelings for her, since we have a lot in common and we mesh very well (at least I think we do). The topic of relationships come up and she said that she's been single for a while now. So I knew that I had a chance if I wanted to keep trying to pursue something. 

In October, she had to go back to Japan to get her workers visa, so I knew she would be gone for a while. We still kept in touch here and there since she told me she was working a few different jobs at once. She finally came back to the US in the middle of May, and things haven't changed from before she left. We still talk to each other daily, hang out a lot, have lessons (I teach her English, she teaches me Japanese), and mainly do what couples do with no physical contact of any type.

Once again, the topic of dating and relationships come up. I feel confident at this point, I felt like I was ready to ask her out. She then says,""I just stated dating someone back home. We've been dating for about a month or so."" I was shocked because she never told me, and I felt heart broken. 

None of it was her fault, she has every right to what she tells me and what she doesn't tell me. I really like this girl, and ever since I broke up with my ex over a year ago, I felt like I was finally able to date again. It's very hard to me to find someone since I am not very social.

I really regret my decisions and I hope to make up for this as much as possible. Feel free to ask for more details as necessary.

EDIT: Thanks for the support, everyone. I didn't expect to get this much back already. I was just talking with my mom about this, and she says my dad looks to me as someone who does not make mistakes. He's really torn right now. Do you have any suggestions on earning back his trust and respect? Thanks so much.",27May2017,5

114,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  Long wall of text, sorry.

I am going to need some advice on how to proceed with my wife after this past Wednesday evening.  This is entirely my fault and I am a horrible person for what I have done.  I am very aware that I have fucked things up for us.

My wife and I have been married for 18 months.  Around the end of April, I was feeling a little bit down on myself.  I had been feeling fat, ugly and overall just not acceptable.  Mind you I am 5'7"" and 145 pounds.  My wife jokes with me on occasion, and while maybe not acceptable, but she asks ""why are you so ugly?""  My reply is usually ""because you love me.""  However, she also does make sure to mention when I am handsome and help find clothes that make me look more handsome.  She hadn't made the joke for a couple of weeks before I posted the photos and it was only last week the joke resurfaced.  Anyways, to boost my self esteem I took some nude photos and posted them to a subreddit to see what people thought.  They were definitely NSFW photos.

Moreover, I downloaded one photo I found on another NSFW subreddit and I had pictures of girls that sent to me as a result of my posting.  I have done a similar thing in the past when I first discovered Reddit (way before I met my wife).

This leads to a discussion yesterday after she had laid in bed all day Thursday and Friday crying and basically not speaking to me.  She confronted me and told me she found out I was cheating on her from my photo roll on my phone.  She did see the photos and I didn't want to lie or be untruthful.  I explained them, and why I did it.  She now has kicked me to the downstairs room, and basically doesn't want to speak to me until I ""sort out my narcissistic stuff out.""

I don't know why I posted them.  I have ruined my life because of it.  I am the problem, it is not my wife.  She tries to communicate with me and I don't listen quite often.  I don't really talk to her much more than how's your day.  The main reason is often I feel she nags a bit too much on me and because she offers advice rather than sympathizes I take it quite personally.  Therefore I don't tell her much because I always feel like I am in trouble.  This absolutely sucks, because I fucked it up.

Is there anyway I can repair the situation?  She's not going to believe me, because she is right doing what I did is wrong.

I am planning on seeing a counselor on Tuesday to help with the communication issue and at times narcissism because I will admit I hardly ever put my wife first.  I am a terrible husband to my wife and she could do so much better than me.  How could I do something like this when I have all the love and support I need?  How can I go about repairing myself so that I can be the husband my wife deserves?

TL;DR I fucked up by posting nude selfies and they were on my phone.  My wife is devasted and I want to know what can I do if anything to save my marriage.",27May2017,3
115,I've been with my partner for nearly 3 years. We speak in English but my native language is Italian. My partner just hasn't learnt any Italian in the last 3 years even though I mentioned many times how much it would mean to me. Not sure what to do...,27May2017,10
117,"First off this is going to be long. There won't be a tl;dr so I guess strap in.

Second, I don't think this breaks the medical part of rule 5. Yes this is about my mental health, but I'm asking for advice on what to do, not a diagnosis, and I'm not suicidal so I don't think I'm breaking rule 6 either.

So let me get started on what's going on with me.

I can't sleep. I'm only unconscious if I get really drunk or I literally pass out from exhaustion. Even if I do pass out (drunk or not) I wake up a couple hours later and struggle to get back to sleep.

When I do get a 'good' night of sleep I have nightmares. I had a night terror recently. The first one in years. This happened weeks ago and I still feel like I'm recovering. 

I struggle with anxiety and depression. The insomnia sucks too, but I think it's an effect and not a cause. That's the problem I'm running in to. All of this shit is stacking on top of itself and I don't know what the root cause is anymore. 

I'm not sure how much 'personal' information I can give and still follow the rules, so I won't give out my city or state.

I can't afford to just go to a doctor. So how do I get help? I have no health insurance. The insurance that is offered to me through work is not only too expensive, but it wouldn't even cover the problems I'm talking about. 

I hate asking for help. I've actually typed up dozens of rough drafts of this in the past few months that I have just deleted. Unfortunately I've realized that I *need* help, whether I want it or not. I'm not sure where to go next or how I can better this situation... So what's your advice?",27May2017,1
122,"Before I cut him out(about two months ago), he had started making fun of me more, teasing me about my weight, ditching me, and getting angry at me for very very small things. Here's an example of that. We went back to our hometown for about 4 days, and I decided to go visit my parents and ended up staying the night. It was our last night before driving two hours away. He claimed he was angry because he didn't want to go out of the way to pick me up to leave. The thing is, my parents live a whole ONE block from the highway on the way out of town. It would be a less than 3 minute ordeal. One for him to drive there(barely a minute.), one for me to pack my stuff up, and one to drive to the highway. In my opinion I did nothing wrong. It was one night out of four and we didn't have anything planned that night. In fact, that was the only night I got to visit my parents, meanwhile the three other days we spent with his family. Thats the last time I was able to put up with his attitude, and I cut ties with him as soon as we got back.

Now, fast forward to this past week. Im starting to apply for jobs and I was already always cautious about what I put online. I remembered a video he had put up less than a year ago of us acting like a couple of asses, drunk. I didn't want any potential employers to find this(one already had) so I texted him and asked him to delete it. He actually said okay, but he said it had nothing to do with an employer. We went back and forth a bit but I deleted his contact info and text messages, so I don't remember exactly what was said. I will be honest though, I was rude once. I said that I was about to take off and kick ass in life, and he would never be a part of how great my life would be.

Some of what he said got to me, and after I blocked his number I texted my mom because I talk to her about almost everything. 

This is what she texted me.

""He's always had your back..... And you will never find another person like him who has your back he is genuine which is hard to come by and as you get older you realize that is truly genuine!! What he gets handed to him shouldn't interfere with your friendship he still means we'll towards you!!""

He may have had my back during some bad times, but that doesn't excuse how he made me feel like shit for so long. I didn't hear it from him directly, but I heard it through one of my best friends from back home. He talked bad about me behind my back constantly. 

I think the thing that upsets me most about my mom's text is the fact that she thinks I'll never make another good friend. 

She's always treated him like the son she never had, which doesnt make that much sense but it was the only way I could think of explaining the way she treated him, the whole time we were growing up. 

I'm a lot happier now without him in my life, and I'm already making new friends. I start applying for college next month. I am seriously about to kick ass and take off, and she doesn't support it. 

I could go on for a long time about all this but in order for me to save my own sanity I need to go for a walk and get some fresh air. I look forward to some advice, I know I need it.",27May2017,10

126,"I've two job opportunities to choose from within the weekend. I'd be working full time, from next week until the end of August.


I've two choices: Remain at my Best Buy job, with a pay of $10.85, with day-time hours, around 30-40 hours a week. 

OR

Take a new factory job, with a pay of $16.49, with third shift hours (11pm - 7pm five days a week), 40 hours a week


Now, I'm not really sure which one to choose. The factory job offered me the job without an interview, but offered to give me until tomorrow to decide which job I want to work at. I've been working at Best Buy for almost two years, and everyone is very friendly and such. I seem to be pretty well liked by literally everyone there, and I've never had any form of drama or issues with anyone. It also helps me constantly learn and stay up to date with new technology, which I like since I'm a Computer Science major.


Now, the factory job would be completely new to me. The official title is a ""Machine Operator"", and I guess I'm honestly not sure what all my tasks would be. I have a friend I MIGHT be working with, but I have no idea if we're in the same department or not. Again, I'd be earning a ton more at the factory job.


It's not like I'm in a desperate need of cash for college, but I still want to earn money this summer. Doing the math based upon my current pay and estimating hours of each job for the summer, I'd earn about $4000 from Best Buy this summer and about $8000 from the factory job in total for this summer. They are both within the same driving distance form my home.


So, I'm really not sure which one to pick. Again, I have until tomorrow to decide.",27May2017,1
127,"The title sounds bad but after all the information you might feel the way that I do. 

The bride is a girl I went to high school with and now we live about 1.5 hours away from each other, but her family lives in the same town that I do but we rarely see each other. She's now engaged to a woman, someone she's been dating for two years and her first same-sex relationship. The fiance is crazy smothering and I can tell it drives my friend (the bride) crazy. They've been to therapy for this and are working it out. 

Ok. So now the background. When we met in high school we had a big group of friend and she was always considered the ""bitchy one"" AND she was aware/proud of this. Year after year she started losing friendships within the group because she would say/do horrible things to get people to not like her. She was always civil with me so I never had an issue with her. I often told our other friends to see the better side of her. Anyway, high school passed and one of our other friends was engaged to be married. The now bride-to-be(the bitch), was cut out of the bridal party for telling our friends' mom that she hated the groom. She was still invited to the bridal shower and on that day she made a huge scene and acted so crazy that all the guests understood what was going on. Since then all of our friends have stopped talking to her. I am the only one who keeps in contact.

Over the years we have only really stayed friends over phone calls and texts, which is fine. But she never made time to come see me. 
Recently her dad was diagnosed with Cancer and after many years of treatment, he became cancer free. She asked me to take photos of her dad (I am a professional photographer) to celebrate his remission and to hopefully find him a partner on a dating website. I said sure and did the job for free. 
I've known her dad for a while and the day we shot together he talked about all the new things he wanted to do with his 2nd chance at life. He bought a new boat and invited us (the bitch and myself) to go sailing. The bride-to-be, hates water and being in a boat so she said no. I said I would be willing go out so I could take some pictures. The bride jokingly accused me wanting to ""sleep"" with her dad.  Later that week I invited all of our friends to come over for a camp fire and also invited the bride in hopes she could rekindle some relationships but instead she accused me again of wanting to sleep with her dad in front of everyone. I didn't say anything at the time, but I was pissed off that she humiliated me in front of my friends after I had done her a favour. 
Fast forward half a year later and now she tells me shes going to get married. She asks me to be MOH. I said fine. 
So now I am planning the bachelorette. The bride said she wanted a relaxing weekend at a cottage. So I planned for me, the bride and two other bridesmaids to go to a cottage about 5 hours north. WE all decided to go to a fancy spa, and just chill out. 
The weekend finally came and one of the other bridesmaids backed out two days before, and when I asked if she could still help pay for the weekend I never got a response. So me and the other bridesmaid fit the bill for the spa gettaway weekend. I drove myself and the bride to the resort since the other bridesmaid (has kids and needed to leave early). Anyway, we got the spa and the bride seemed fine. We booked her a facial, massage, and pedicure. Everything was going well until we were getting our pedicures. I arranged for the spa to bring wine and chocolates for us and the bride refused it. That's when it went really downhill. 
After we left the spa, (a $455 bill later) I drove us to the cottage. It was rustic but in the heart of the forest. I could tell she wasn't happy with the accommodations even though she picked this place out of the list of places I emailed her. 
After we got unpacked we drove downtown to have dinner on the docks. She complained about the food, service and the wait staff. Then we headed back to the cottage to hang out. I got a local bake shop to make her ""boobie"" cup cakes, I also made custom treat bags for the girls, I bought pink bubbly, decorations. The bride took one sip of the pink bubbly and said it was gross, then dumped the rest down the sink. She took all of the decorations down and said they were dumb. Didn't try any cupcakes and was pissed off. I was in shock, I didn't know how to react. 
Then she asked if we could smoke some weed (both the bride and bridesmaid work for the police) and can only smoke in secret. I said I had some weed but it was old since I don't smoke anymore. Thankfully the other bridesmaid had a electric pen pipe, so we headed out for a walk. Once we got to the road to smoke we realized the pen wasn't charged-forcing us to smoke my crappy weed. I said it was bad but if they wanted to smoke they could. She bitched about how bad the weed was and talked about all the embarrassing things I did in highschool
ANYWAY, we got a little high and went back to the cottage. The bride was like ""I'm going to bed"". It was 10PM.
I laid beside her and we all went to bed. The next morning the other bridesmaid had to get up to go get her kids from their dads house and since it was a 5 hour drive she left at 7:30AM. That was okay because the cottage hostess was making us fresh home made waffles for breakfast. 
When the other bridesmaid packed up to leave the bride said"" I want to go home too"" I was like ""ugh, we have breakfast"" She said she didn't want any. At this point I was so pissed, I said ""I've paid for this I'm getting breakfast.""
So the other girl left and the bride said to her and myself ""THANKS FOR THE LAME BACHELORETTE"" I nearly jumped her lol. 
I quickly ate breakfast, loaded the car, and drove her bitch ass back home. I was quiet as can be in the car and when I dropped her off at home, she didn't say thank you or hugged me and went inside. I haven't heard from her since. 
Her wedding is in September and I want to back out. I don't want to be friends with her anymore.

I've seen her work myself, it's great and organized. She is convinced her boss is out to destroy her in one way or another, and I believe her at this point. For a great example, here is something that happened just yesterday. Her boss handed her a list of tasks to do, and preaches that she delegate the work to the employees so that they have things to do. She gets with all of them and assigns them all tasks, including the assistant managers she is over. Later that day, her boss finds out that some of the tasks aren't done and explodes on her. She started listing off how it's her responsibility to make sure they are done, even though she worked with everyone to see that it was getting complete. So, instead of having that discussion with those who were assigned the unfinished tasks, she basically said to her ""I don't think you understand what your job is, maybe you should reconsider being a senior assistant manager"". This pissed me off considerably. She is trying to get her own store, and her boss knows this, and she doesn't want to just quit and lose that dream because of her. I asked my gf if she contacted HR, and she said her boss beat her to it, apparently describing my gf as ""unfit"" and ""black and white"".

I live in the Salt Lake City area and have an offer from Company 1, a leading public tech company (stock ~$300 a share) here for $64k /year + $30k in stock, in what is essentially a lateral move, with some added responsibility. 

My current company, Company 2, is a private tech start up, which I do truly believe in, is currently paying me $37k/year, and they're counter offering me to relocate to San Francisco for around $80k a year with a lateral title, promising a ""fast track"" promotion to a better title and salary. They would be unable to pay me a comperable wage here in SLC for political reasons. 

The factors:  
* $64k is a 77% raise from what I make now, should I choose to stay in Utah.  
* Partner both work for Company 2 making the same salary
* We're about to make an offer on a house here in Utah.  
* Should we move to SF, my partner would need to find a new job in the Bay Area

I love Company 2, and now would be the time for us to take a risk and move to SF if we decide to do that, experiencing a different life before we settle down with our dog and a house. On the other hand, Company 1 is exciting in itself, and would allow us to still purchase the house we wanted, while increasing our standard of living, saving more, etc. the hard part with that, is the companies he could move up in are more limited than they are in SF, albeit less competitive.

All throughout high school I'd hear about parties and want to go but my parents wouldn't drive me, they would often say ""it's not safe, we don't know the people there, we don't know if the parents are there"". Now that I'm 19 they've had some change of heart but now there's no parties to go to and I feel like asking them to drive me anywhere like a nightclub is just a recipe for disaster.


I genuinely hate it when people say ""it's not a big deal, life isn't all about partying"" because I know that.

What do you do or say when a friend or customer tries to talk religion or pseudoscience with you? I'm staunchly non-religious and don't really have any strong political beliefs. I'm in southern california so it's not so much Jesus lovers. Rather, I'm dealing with crystal-healing, alternative medicine, holistic bullshit. 

These are real examples: 

""What church do you go to?""

 ""If you eat 12 parsnips, it will cure your pancreatic cancer.""

""Let me tell you all about how astrology controls your every life and is relevant to anything and everything we'll ever talk about.""

""I see angels and they tell me what to do.""

""What!? How could you have gotten the flu shot when you know it causes autism?!""

""Want to buy some of my magic jewelry? It will bring you prosperity and protect you against evil.""

""The whole government and news media are fake and ran by a deep government conspiracy with secret illuminati leaders so don't trust any news source""

In short, should I just lie and be like ""Oh totally, I believe in [xyz belief] too because I value our friendship/business relation"" or is there a tactful way to let them know I don't agree. I feel like when I play along sometimes they start to think I'm enthusiastic about their belief and talk to me about it constantly which can get tiresome...

What do you guys do when someone says something blatantly fanciful or incorrect? ",27May2017,1
158,"I'm moving 2 hours away from my work to be with my family. I am actively looking new work. I told myself I wouldn't take a job offerinf significantly less, but I'm worried maybe I'm being too picky. Should I just bite the bullet and get a minimum wage job at my new home while still searching for something good?

For reference, I'm currently making 12 an hour, 48 hours a week over 5 days. So that's so extra overtime cash also. The drive is 2 hour one way so I'd be driving 20 hours per week. With gas prices and my fuel efficiency I'd need to put $40 put in every other work day.

When i get drunk, i have no social anxiety and can literally talk about anything for hours without saying anything specific at all :D

161,"I've been debating making this post for a while but figured fuck it. I guess this is a good place to put it. 

A few years ago I moved to a different state with my girlfriend and left the few friends I had behind. She was my absolute best friend for 7 years and that's really all I needed, one close person that I could share everything and anything with. As of about 8 months ago we're no longer together and now I'm pretty alone. I've never been good at making new friends my age and have always been a bit of a loner. My mother was very strict and never let me have a ""normal"" teenage childhood. I tend to get along better with people that are older than me.

I'm 22 and working a full time job, I tend to enjoy ""manly"" things. My main hobbies are riding my motorcycle, cigars, and kick boxing. I find that while I enjoy these things I'm not a textbook of knowledge on any of them which makes it difficult to connect with others who share similar interests. I don't have a true passion for anything really. I don't know how to use these things to meet people. 

Without even one person I can do things with it's intimidating to try new things or go places. I don't want to go to a bar have nobody to talk to just like I don't want to go to a cigar lounge or motorcycle meet alone.

How can I meet people and make new connections? I always say yes when somebody *does* invite me to do things even if I don't really want to do them in hopes that it will lead to future gatherings or whatever but it doesn't seem to happen that way.

Most of the people I work with are much older than me and the ones that are closer in age don't seem to like me or have any interest in getting together after work hours (there's very little comraderie in the company for some reason. It's a smaller family owned company, around 100 employees. Everyone seems to have the mindset of ""put your time in and GTFO."") 

I guess I just don't know what to do, the connections and people around me don't want to hang out so I can't just say ""hey want to grab a few drinks after work?"" 

Any advice?

Edit: I feel like another big limiting factor is that I'm not particularly fond of watching sports. I can't really go out and watch a football game at a bar and talk to people when I really don't care to watch and am not knowledgeable on it. I know the rules and whatnot but I can't discuss plays or why player a is better than player b etc. ",27May2017,6
162,"Im currently holding two jobs and losing my mind. The reason im doing this is because im a hair away from flunking out of college. I no longer recieve aid because my gpa has dropped so bad so I must pay out of pocket. So far things have been okay but in the last few months I noticed myself going back to a few of the old habits i had when i was suffering from depression. My saving is going great but i am mentally exhausted. 

My first job is at a retail store. Ive had this job for 3 years, im good at it, the location isn't the best for me but co workers are understanding, aside from the constant micromanaging, being forced to meet unrealistic sales goals, and standing for 10 hours a day. I only make 10.00 an hour which is why I found a second . 

Next job is a bank teller. Ive only been here 5 months but from day one (literally) ive been named called judged, and picked on. Often forced to do others work and given the short end of the stick. Often working 10 hr shifts without a break or being allowed to have water near me. Ive found myself tearing up at my desk at least twice since ive started. Ive bern verbally assaulted and physically touched against my will since my first day, but told not to take it seriously. Im a little antisocial so find this extremely disgusting being that everyone is over the age of 21. 

I stayed this long because it pays 14.00 an hour and at 21 this is a God send for me. But im literally nauseous at the thought of going to work its frustrating. 
Being that im treated this way, I wonder if I'll ever have an opportunity to move up in the company, if I wanted to. 

I won't allow myself to quit because I don't feel like im accomplishing enough in any area of my life. So i was trying to hold off until i pay for classes, and get my gpa up   That seems like it'll never happen because this job is making me deteriorate. Today i cried. I cried like a baby. Im literally being bullied as an adult. Im staying in a toxic environment because of money. 
I have to quit one of these jobs before i lose my shit. I just don't know which one.

168,"Hi guys. This might end up being something if a rambling post, but I need advice. 

**Situation** 

I am moving (or potentially not) across the country with my boyfriend of 7 months on Thursday. We both decided to go there after we graduated before we even met, so now we are going together even though it is early to be moving in together. I am having second thoughts about moving though, for the following reasons 

**Problem 1** 

Boyfriend (we'll call him Nathan) is very inexperienced in relationships/sex. I've had to take on a teacher-type role in which I have to tell him how to do almost literally everything. I can't just ask him to seduce me every now and then, or tell him that it would be nice for him to compliment me sometimes. I have to tell him exactly what to say and do. I don't blame him for this as it's not his fault he's inexperienced, and he always listens when I ask him to do something. However, I don't really like having to be the teacher. I'm used to relationships where I don't have to micromanage the other person's behavior, and sometimes I feel guilty about making him change so many things even though he insists he's grateful for feedback and wants to learn. Am I being a bad girlfriend for considering breaking it off instead of helping him become a better person?

**Problem 2** 

Money. They say money is one of the most likely things to break a relationship if not handled carefully, and I've been irresponsible. For some backstory: I just graduated with a bachelor's in human physiology and French. During this time I worked in two laboratories and mentored high schoolers as well as working a fourth job online in order to save a bunch of money because I love travelling and am moving to Korea in January. Needless to say, I was busy and stressed but got it done. 

Nathan is very poor. He just graduated with his master's and had an unpaid practicum. I ended up having to pay for his last semester of school because he couldn't get approved for a loan (0 income) and would not graduate if he couldn't pay it. He does plan on paying me back. If I travel, he comes with me and I have to pay for all of his expenses as well as mine. I have to pay for all of the travel costs to get to our new home, pay for the downpayment on the apartment alone, will probably be doing the first month of rent alone because he hasn't gotten a job offer yet. I'll be buying him a car as well because to have a job in his field, he has to have transportation. So do I, so he can't keep sharing my car unless we end up with opposite schedules (unlikely). This is absolutely wrecking my nest egg for leaving the country that I worked so build up. 

And the real problem with this: I'm resentful. If he had been trying his hardest, I wouldn't have minded so much because in some of these cases there has been literally no other option. However I took a full load of classes in two courses and worked essentially 4 jobs to get where I am financially. He had 15 hours of coursework per week that required no outside work. He could have gotten a job on top of it, but he didn't because he was depressed about school and thinking hes in the wrong field after spending 6 years on it. I feel really resentful now that I can't travel, can't get a small plastic surgery procedure (spider vein removal) that I've wanted for a lot time, will have to work my ass off again to build my savings back up to where I want it be to move in 6 months. I feel like I'm supporting a child, even though he's a 25 year old man and doesn't have any malicious intent/hasn't intended to use me for money. Most of the time he is hesitant to accept any money or big gifts from me, and only does so when I'm offering or he has no other options. 

**Summation** 

I like our relationship outside of these two things, but these things are significant. I feel like he is not in a position to be moving across the country and that I shouldn't have to do all of these things for him. I don't really want to break up with him, but I don't think moving with him is a good idea either. Long distance isn't an option. 

I would love to get some thoughts from someone with more experience than me. Or just any outside opinions. I don't really have any adults in my normal life that I can talk to about this, so any feedback is welcome. Thank for reading

169,"Preemptive apology over the wall of text.

I need your advice. I’ll fully admit to not knowing anything. I’m eighteen. Five years ago I thought girls peed from their butts. I don’t value what I think too much.

I’m guessing I have a lot of half-baked ideas about how the world works. I’d like you to set me straight and hopefully point me in the right direction. There aren’t many honest adults in my life, and Reddit’s always felt sincere at least. 

I dropped out at sixteen, worked full time, and never spent much. Right now I’m at a crossroads with a GED and 48k in my pocket. I’m camping out in my car right now since my parents kicked me out immediately. *

Here’s a list of things I’ve forgotten: my birthday, where the gas and brake pedals are, where left and right are, simple addition, and my phone number.

With that in mind, let’s talk career paths. College is right out. Loans are a collar and school was miserable for me. So I was thinking trades. Hopefully my work ethic can trump all the sheer stupidity. 

My other issue is that I think I’d rather have a job over a career. I was thinking of doing Habitat for Humanity for a while until I get enough know-how to build a tiny house. Maybe put it on some land somewhere. Keep a garden, maybe some chickens. I was hoping it’d give me the economic freedom to pursue, I don’t know. Something. 

I tried to figure out how much land I'd need, so I figured out how many pounds the average American consumes. Then I figured out how many pounds of produce per crop per acre and lined them up by variance. I cut out the outliers and averaged it. If my math's right, and it probably isn't, I'd need about an acre of land.

To tell the truth, I don’t care what I do too much so long as I’m good at it. I just can’t think of anything worth doing because I can’t think of anything I can be.

A third of your life is spent sleeping. That’s 121 days right there. Assuming you work 40 hours a week, that’s, what, 40 hours multiplied by 52 weeks, so… 86 days? 121 + 86 = 207 - 365 = 158 free days. That’s not counting the commute, household chores, stuff like that. Seems grim.

Part of the problem is that I don’t want anything. I’ll forget to eat, sometimes for days. I have no interests or hobbies. I’m mostly content to exist. 

I also feel weird buying stuff in general. It's hard to trace what companies aren't abusing someone or something's rights in some way, so I'd rather buy as little as possible. That's more of a side thing but it's partially why I want to grow my own food.

It's important for me to least feel like I'm doing the right thing. I work soup kitchens and put in some time into the pound. I've also donated every now and then but I'm generally pretty stingy.

In conclusion, I don't feel like I can justify the choice to continue living. From the outside in I feel like I’m doing stuff I hate to continue to live a live I wouldn’t choose if given the option. The thought of doing this for sixty more years fills with dread.

That’s about it I guess. Sorry for the self-indulgent whinefest. **What do you think I should do moving forward? How wrong or right is my pov? Are my goals feasible? Thanks for your time.**

186,"Hi Reddit, I’m looking for advice regarding my employment situation. I’ll put a TL: DR at the bottom because I’m going to vent 

I’ve been working with the company I am with (lumber mill/retail yard) for about 7 years now. I started a minimum wage knowing nothing as a bottom tier yard hand at $10 an hour (CDN). Today I’m forklift certified, have general knowledge about western red cedar products, handle most/all sales in the yard, run our social media pages, train new employees, run the yard myself Mondays, diffuse negative customer experiences, manage some custom sales, occasional procurement of circumstantial inventory, odd jobs for the boss, attend/run our booth at large home and garden shows as a company rep and I’ve been being sent to a class here and there on social media management and sales approach. I also handle the yard dogs, the sales office and work closely with our installation branch.

Today I make $15 an hour (CDN). My problem is I have no idea what sort of advancement I should be looking at. I feel like $15 is pretty low given all of the work I do (I do a lot of other people’s jobs too and I still do physical labour in the yard and mill as well), especially after 7 years and my new responsibilities which I perform fairly well (I’m not perfect, but I think I do damn well and I think I have exceeded most employees if not all in my branch).  A lot of red flags determining my future with the company have been popping up. Low wage, increased responsibilities, zero respect (I mean I don’t care but I’m constantly berated/spoken down on/blamed/used as the whipping boy) simply because management put me in the sales office as a priority... (IE: the rest of my co-workers feel because I am not outside in the yard 100% of the time I’m lazy/worthless). No one takes me seriously as an employee etc... This is all pretty much whining even in my mind.

But recently we had an employee who recently quit come back. They’ve been with us under 2 years time, made $13 to start... upon being rehired they now make $15. They responsibilities are the same basic, entry level responsibilities I had when I started 7 years ago. Pick order lists, keep the yard clean and load customers... But somehow they manage to make the same wage as me. Obviously my time with the company has come to a close (I simply can’t take it anymore. My work load is huge, spans over multiple branches and I receive no credit to my work, advancement, retain a politically bottom tier position in the company ...) so leaving is not even a question.




****TL : DR****
My problem is, I don’t know how to leave. I want to apply for a position with our main competitor, in doing so if I get hired (I’m in the thinking stage) at a basic, entry level position like I did when I first started with my current company I’ll already be making almost 3 – 4 grand more yearly. I don’t want to burn any bridges with the current company. I am bitter but I am not going to act on it or show it. I want to be safe as well. I know my boss is going to counter offer (he won’t match their wage though) to try and get me to stay until he finds a cheap replacement...

I know I’d be starting over at the bottom again, but at this point I am not sure if my dedication to the company for nearly a decade matters at all...

I am trying to find advice for my best friend from elementary school. A bit of history, at a young age both of her parents died.

She almost graduated high school, but did not in the end. Since then she has either lived with her sister, or two different guys. She has never gotten her drivers license and is too scared to drive. One guy she was engaged to for five years. She then lived with her sister again, until she met a new boyfriend which she moved out of town with and lived with for 2 years. Recently, they broke up as he was not treating her well (I do not know his side of the story). She has never had a job and has never really wanted to change her life except for getting a boyfriend. She basically has just relied on either her sister or her boyfriends for everything. I have tried to convince her to learn to drive, to get a job she'd enjoy or something like that but it seems to fall on deaf ears. She is not an idiot, I think she is just stubborn and set in her ways now. She is now back with her sister. All the time I want to be able to help her but I can't figure out how.

I'm worried that he sees me as his meme friend and nothing else. 
I suppose my question is should I ask meme friend out or bury the feelings deep inside?",27May2017,1
190,"Recently I went to a dance with some friends. I didn't have a date and was perfectly happy with that. Towards the end of the night a group of guys started hovering towards me and one of them tapped me on the shoulder. They said that their friend thought I was cute and then this friend came towards me and asked me to dance with him. I said yes because I didn't realize how serious this person really was and I felt like I had to with this group of guys waiting for a response in front of me. I thought I would dance a few songs with him and then leave to my friends. But as we kept dancing I couldn't find a way to tell him I wanted to leave so I kept dancing with him. On top of all this he started getting really close and intimate. He pulled me against him and we danced very closely and he also grabbed at my waist. He kept pulling me closer. He also kept telling me how beautiful I looked and that he couldn't believe I didn't have a date. Then he asked me if I wanted to go talk with him so we went and talked for a little in private. Afterwards we went to dance again. At the end of the night he asked me for my contact information and I gave it to him. Ever since he has been texting me, asking things about myself and it seems like he really wants to get to know me. I had been answering his texts because at first I thought I should give him a chance. He also goes to the same school so he has been implying that he wants to spend more time with me. When he finally asked me if I wanted to hang out sometime, I said yes. I don't know why I said yes except that somehow I felt pressure to do so. I felt bad and I couldn't leave his question unanswered but still couldn't bring myself to say no. I had hesitated for a long time until I felt like I was driving him crazy making him wait. That's when I said yes. But since then I have made excuses and put off spending time with him. I realized I don't feel comfortable seeing him; I don't think I like him in that way and he is a stranger to me. Besides i was a little uncomfortable with the way he moved so quickly on me at the dance, I just don't think I'm ready for this. He makes me nervous but at the same time he seems genuinely interested in me and kind of nice. So how can I break the news to him ( in the nicest way possible) that I don't want to hang out with him after I had already agreed to do so? In other words how do I say no after I already said yes. What do I do or what do I say?",27May2017,1

192,"So, to start everything off, my teachers say that I wouldn't need to study for the GED exam. However, I don't want to wait until August to be able to take the exam due to my birthday being in October. I'm a senior in high school, proposed date of graduation is June 15th. I'm wondering if I could dropout and be able to take the exam or would I have to wait until August to take the exam? Of course the alternative would be to take a credit recovery program my school offers, but I am about 60 credits deficient and at this point I don't see it worth spending approximately 200 hours in classes compared to 135 dollars for something equivalent. To summarize everything, is it possible to dropout of high school so that I am no longer enrolled in high school therefore allowing me to take the GED exam? If so, should I go for the GED saving me about 200 hours of time and frustration or credit recovery program my school offers saving 135 dollars?",27May2017,1
193,"I am 14 and I've been struggling with post concussion syndrome for 3 years now. Before I got my TBI (Traumatic Brain injury) in 6th grade, I think I'm confident enough to say that I was fairly intelligent. Even when I was little based on tests I took I was deemed as extremely intelligent and I was also a very good kid. I was extremely ahead in most of my abilities, for example my reading was at the level of a 9th grader when I was in 5th grade. My writing was also exceptional and I was able to produce well written stories off the top of my head. I'm not trying to say that I'm better than everyone based on my ability, but that I miss being that child. I was a quick thinker and extremely sharp, and now I'm very slow and dull.

There is one good thing that the concussion gave to me though, something I cherish. I am able to clear my mind easily and focus on the moment, and even at times I'll feel euphoric and connected to the universe without drugs. I don't do drugs currently, so I know it's just me. Sometimes I will see ghosts (I'm also sure that this isn't the cause of a mental disorder of some sort) and although they come and go quickly, I can still feel them in the room with me. Enough of my rambling though.

I want to help my brain recover to a point of where I can be just like how I was before, but even better. Im going into high school next year and the past 2 years of middle school have been hell. Doctors think that I am faking all my symptoms and I've had to learn to deal with my cognitive problems and help myself, because no one with the exception of my best friend understands or tries to help.

Regardless though I've improved a lot in terms of emotionally and how I think, but my cognitive abilities are still as dull and my mind is still extremely foggy. I am 14 and I know it's possible for my brain to recover from this but it's been 3 years. I am still growing too, wouldn't that aid recovery in a sense? And since doctors won't help me, I feel like I have no choice but to self medicate. I've cleaned up my diet, I exercise on a daily basis (weight lifting and occasional running), I also meditate quite often. I've heard of shrooms aiding the repair of the brain in micro doses, and I was thinking that could help as long as I don't abuse it.

But please reddit, I want to heal and improve. I feel as if I've learned many things with this injury, however it's been too long and I think that I've learned mostly everything that comes with a disability like this. In some ways I think it's made me more intelligent as well. 

How do I go about this? Thank you :)",27May2017,1

196,"I'm trying to grow out my hair. As a kid I used to have dandruff problems, which I was able to get under control. Now that my hair is getting longer, the flakiness is back. On the rare cases, my hair is visibly flakey, but typically the flakes only show when my hair is moved which is a problem because I constantly have to move my hair out of my eyes. 

I've tried:

Showering and using shampoo everyday, but I've been told washing it everyday is bad for hair. However, this does help reduce the dandruff. 

Only conditioning + washing my hair 3 times a week. My head gets really itchy. 

Washing my hair twice a week without putting anything in. Same problem as the last option.

197,"I suppose I'm generally a boring person. I work 3 jobs all centered around childcare- therefore most of my time is spent with children. I'm an introvert, I have a lot of self esteem issues to work through and ways I want to ""improve"" my life. 

When I have free time I tend to spend it at home with my immediate family, or going to the mall with them, or taking my dog out for walks/dog park/etc. 

I have my ""likes"" - I bullet journal, do simple crafts with the kids that I enjoy, baking fondant cakes for birthdays of close friends/relatives, doing my and others make up, reading, playing cards...but I don't feel like I have an ""actual hobby"". Like gardening, or scrapbooking, or what-have-you.

So my question is, what is something that is fairly simple to get into: easy for beginners to understand, not too costly to get started, and could possibly get me into events or clubs to socialize with other adults down the line (not a requirement of your suggestions).

I'm open to anything. And I'm sure I can google and find a lot of typical hobbies to pick up...just curious if anyone on Reddit can offer some better insight, maybe to something unique or unusual that you yourself enjoy to do. Thanks guys :)

206,"This is my 1st reddit post. 

Let's just start this off with myself, I'm 29
I'm married with a 6 year old son. We purchased a house in a small town in California. 

I have a cousin who  has a son from a previous relationship who is 9 and ,was married to a man much older than she, about a 25 year difference. Through the duration of their marriage it was pretty much total chaos. Very controlling, accusatory, and down right abusive. Through this  three years they had a daughter.  She had already moved out once [into my home] and took the steps to get a divorce and move on, start fresh... this lasted about one month. [she went back]  At this time I told her this was her only chance if she chose to leave now, my home wouldn't be an option for her to live in as it was
breaking the kids' hearts to be torn apart, they're best friends. 

Fast forward to a year later: 
She calls me in tears barely able to speak.... telling me please I cannot do this any more. I can't take it. It's not good for me, it's not good for the kids, cousin I have no where to go, I don't know what to do. He keeps accusing me of cheating, I can't even take a shower until he comes home from work because he thinks I'm washing someone else's juices' off of me. He makes me face chat while he's working to make sure that I'm home with this kids, and check all the rooms and back yard incase there is another man here.  He also told me that he put a GPS on my car to monitor where I am at all times. 

[ I know this man, he's dangerous. He's a Butcher who slaughters animals. He has threatened her saying he would cut her into a million pieces and no one would ever find her *her weight is about 108lbs*He also has a terroristic threat charge on him for telling the mother of his previous children that she would cut her head off and kick it down the road. ]

At this time I have a conversation with my husband about letting her come back giving her ANOTHER  chance. I know that we've done this before. More than even just the once but, I'm scared for her. What about the kids?
Listening to all of the screaming and the fighting? 
What goes on behind the closed doors? We don't know. What happens if we don't give her this chance? She could get hurt or even worse murdered. The same with the children..... 
I could never live with my self. We were raised together, more like sisters.   

We decide together that it is the right thing to do, to give her this chance, a chance to change to get away to get on her feet to have no worries, everything would be taken care of, but there of course would be ground rules, we can't have a repeat. 

As she was leaving, she is working with a resource center to get a divorce and restraining order to get away and move. This is one of the ground rules as I do not want this dangerous man around my home or my family. 
Due to the restraining order it would be hard to drop off and pick up the baby so a third-party would have to drive to a halfway mark to drop off or pick up the baby. 
This made her nervous and she didn't know if she could do it. She begged my husband and I to let  the rule slide, and the contact with him would be only child related, this would make it easier for her. 
.... we reluctantly agreed with the exception that he was never ever to come to our home, and that contact would be child related only. 

A few days after this she got a letter from the courts saying her divorced was finalized, because the year before she had, had him served .... he didn't contest, they got back together and she filed again. 
Now she is legally divorced! 

Things are well she's here, older child is in school, baby is here. She gets her name
Restored to her maiden name, applies for jobs, has interviews, gets three offers!! 

It's awesome So exciting!!

One of them is in her home town [an hour away why here? Gives me bad gut feelings ] close to the ex husband; whom she has been seeing, texting, talking to on the phone .... not about the baby, they argue and fight, then he gets disgustingly lovey. Baby I love you that's what I married you l can't live with out you ... [typical abuse cycle] 

There she is doing what she said she wouldn't we're so confused but we know she's an adult ... 
what are we do? I don't want her do go back. She has no where else to go. 

Fast forward : Today
 
I wake up this morning, myself and my son just got home yesterday evening from our week long summer vacation. I knew she was going to spend the weekend with my aunt [her mother] so she wasn't home when we got here. I called my aunt but she didn't answer, so I called my cousin, asked here how she was , what the kiddos were doin, what they were up to today ...... 

She said they were just gonna hang out at the house kids were playing around and my auntie was cleaning upstairs.  ... I was like oh that must be why she didn't  answer the phone.  We went on chatting for a few minutes  and  incoming call from my auntie ... I said hey your moms calling she said oh okay call me back later .... 

Switch to my auntie and she said sorry was driving couldn't answer the phone ... oh I thought you were cleaning? 
She said no I took the oldest [my cousins son]  to the park he's playing. 

Well where's cousin then? Her the baby and ex husband are at a rodeo/parade event out of town.  

She lied right to me and didn't think twice. Of course I confronted her about it and she said she didn't tell me cause she thought I'd be mad. 
She's an adult and can do what ever she wants... but don't ever lie to me. It really really pisses me off!  

So here's where the advice part comes in: 

My husband says she needs to go,
She doesn't want to take an opportunity to better   Herself and make a life for her and those two children, I'm over it .... she can't stay away as the ground rules states she's gone. I will not monitor an adult like a teenager! 

My thing is that the only other places she has to go is back with him or to my aunties house 
That is exactly parallel to his. Their front doors face each other.  

BUT

She can't follow the rules. I open up my home and give her free room and board, will baby sit her children for free while she works, then get lied to like it's no big deal. 

Should she stay .... or should she go?

208,"I work for a commercial glass company in Florida, have worked for the same place for 8 years. We have a contract with a 6 story retirement home tearing out patio enclosures and replacing with storefront window systems. 

After we tear out the old windows/screens we use ropes to pull up the storefront windows up the side of the building through the open side of the building. Standing literally on the edge of the 6th floor pulling them up, on 6 foot ladders set up inches from the edge prepping the opening or installing the windows with no fall protection. 

My foreman is a salty dinosaur who thinks this is totally kosher. ""in the old days I'd use a piece of rope as a lanyard!"", doesn't give a fuck about safety, etc. I've been doing these for years with no complaint, walked through minefields in Afghanistan,, however the danger is not what bothers me. I have 2 small children and a measly life insurance policy through my company, and I don't feel like dying or being a cripple/lifetime of pain over a retiree's patio. How should I correct this? According to OSHA I am supposed to have fall protection in these conditions, correct? I'm worried about retaliation from my supervisor for bringing the subject up, but as I said earlier I don't want to die installing a window because one of my high on pot/ alchoholic coworkers bumped my ladder. Usually everyone else balks at getting on the ladder at the edge so I have to do it.

214,"Bear with me, as I'm aware this post is very long and perhaps easy to dismiss but in order for me to get my feelings out and truly express my concern for this complicated situation I feel like I need to include all the important details. Back in August of 2016, a girl messaged me on a dating app I had been using casually and was very consistent about trying to talk to me. The biggest red flag to me, when we first started talking was that she had JUST broken up with her boyfriend of nearly three years because he cheated on her with a close friend of hers. (And now this guy wants to marry this girl) I knew, in my mind just being friends with her was the best option at the time. 

Eventually, things escalated and after asking why I had friendzoned her she said that she thought I was really cute and would be down for a friends with benefits situation. She made the first move and initiated sexting between the two of us. As time went on, we grew close. Texting, calling, video chatting all the time. We got to a point where some would say we were inseperable when it came to talking. But in the midst of all of this, she was still very heartbroken about her ex. She cried on the phone with me over and over at the beginning, because not only did he cheat...he cut her off for good and never spoke to her again. She was seriously in love with the guy and did not see it coming. So naturally, I helped her out. I was the shoulder to cry on without even meeting her yet. She saw that I cared and would tell me everything about herself. I did the same. She once even cried over a guy who she was hitting on at work rejecting her cold. Yet another red flag, to me. So as time went on she began telling all her friends and some of her family about me, and one day when she got drunk she told me over the phone she loved me in front of a group of her friends from work. She eventually started saying it sober, too. She closed her dating app pretty quickly after we started talking.

 When we finally met in January, things were a little awkward on the first hang out but we were clicking immediately and started hanging out alot. She was still intiating most of the first actual ""benefits"" of our friendship and we were doing things like holding hands, and kissing aside from sex. She introduced me to her friends at work, and then her family too. Her family didn't know where she met me, but to them we appeared as just friends on purpose. Her friends new we were having sex and that I helped her with her sadness about her ex. 

Over time, things started to change a little. I was developing small feelings for her, and when I sprung the question of if I was potential for dating, she told me that I'm not undateable and that she is broken and if the situation was different she wouldn't mind trying. I would cuddle with her and become affectionate with her from time to time, and she said that she had became cold to that because her ex hurt her so badly. She told me ""I feel like a horrible person, leading you on even know you know the situation already. I can't even trust a guy, or handle affection from a man."" So I backed off. Furthermore, her friends started telling her that she should date me someday because I'm only going to get hurt in the end. And she continuously asked me about this heavily worried, and I began to play stupid. 

I was getting feelings for her, and I was having a hard time denying it. One day, when she was drunk she texted me ""I'm scared because I think we're getting attached, and that scares me."" I told her not to worry. She later said, ""the reason I don't kiss or hold hands with you in public is because it becomes too real. Like you're not my friend anymore you're like a thing thing and that scares me because I'm not even close to being there and I wanna be your friend. Like forever. You can't ever leave me."" This became my biggest indicator that she really wasn't okay. One day, when I was at her house the truth came out, she started crying after I held her while watching a movie because she was sad about ""leading me on"" I told her the truth about my feelings for her and so she started crying more.

 The next day we kept space and she asked if I was okay. I wanted her to tell me the truth, I demanded the truth about why she said she couldn't see me as anything more and to see if ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" was honest. She then responded after I kept asking: ""You need to let this image of us die because we will never be. I told you going into this all I needed was friends. We can't do the benefits anymore until you're okay. You're still my friend but thats all you'll ever be. Its the age difference, the level of confidence you have for yourself and the fact that you don't present yourself in an assertive manner. I was heartbroken, and in response acted as if I was okay and continued the benefits with her. This time me initiating it. 

From then on it had been an incredibly bumpy road. She re-opened the dating app a couple of times telling me she swore she was looking for more ""friends"" which never worked out. She led them on by talking to them so much until they asked to date and then would cut them off completely. She still cries about her ex and I still hold her each and every time. We stopped kissing as much and holding hands. I hang out with her family and her all the time still. I helped her out with getting back into college at the beginning of our friendship and still do, she should be getting in early june. Amongst all of this I still act like I don't have feelings for her when I clearly still do. To try and change this I've taken her on ""dates"" without calling it that. Been to the movies, a concert, market places and places to eat with her. She still reminds me how important I am to her and thanks me for being so nice and so on. She went on to say I've treated her better than her exes and that the sex has been better than them as well. Part of me feels like she's changing her stance on me, part of me doesn't. She's still very upset over her ex, but still wants me around and wants me to continue the benefits. She's told me the sex has really been getting better and better. A guy she cut off a while back told her she didn't need me and to stop having sex with me, and she was upset by this and ultimately got rid of him too. 

So now I'm stuck. I really enjoy being with her, and she's everything I've ever wanted in a girlfriend but won't give me the chance at making it official. And part of me wants to say confessing again by asking her on a ""date"" and taking things slow will result differently than the first but part of me also feels like it won't. I remember when she rejected me the first time, I told her I was okay with being rejected and she went on to whine and say she didn't reject me. I don't know what to do, mind you I've been the only person she's been sleeping with. Tells me that she doesn't sleep with ""just anybody"" and has only been with two other guys--her boyfriends. I want to have my best shot with her but I don't know what to do. Last night, at her friends birthday party I was asleep and she texted and called me a shit ton while she was drunk. She told me ""You know I legit feel so safe when I'm with you. I miss you. I feel the safest when I'm with you."" Hearing that makes me want to draw myself back in. Part of me feel like next month when she goes to so school its time to giver her space and tell her we can't be friends because in the back of my mind I still like her and this feels like I'm being used. I want to be with her but cutting contact and giving space seems like my best bet. I need help. ",27May2017,1
