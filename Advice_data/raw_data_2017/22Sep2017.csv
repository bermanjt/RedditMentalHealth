About 30 minutes later I fingered her for maybe a minute before realizing I didn't wash my hands. What exactly will happen in case I had live sperm on my fingers. Should I worry or will the fact is was dry mean it's dead or something? Before you say it yes I know I'm fucking stupid. ",22Sep2017,5

2,"So I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year, we started dating in college after we were both pretty fresh out of relationships from highschool. I have had a pretty good relationship with my ex since he and I broke up, but my boyfriend has had a more complicated experience with his. 
Anecdote that will relate: At the very beginning of our relationship, I accidentally stumbled on texts from him to his best friend gushing about how hot this girl at our college was and how much they had in common, and calling me a ""crazy bitch"" for thinking we could last through the summer. I confronted him, forgave him, and we moved on. 
Continuing on: My boyfriend hates that I talk to my ex still, even though I'm very open about it and my ex is genuinely one of my best friends. I stopped talking to my ex to make my boyfriend happy. Then, over this summer, which we did stay together for, he visited me, I visited him, we are now back at college. 
I recently had someone come up to me and tell me that they had proof that my boyfriend had cheated on me over the summer, and they proceeded to show me screenshots of a text exchange between him and his ex girlfriend, who he had previously sworn to me he had no communication with over the summer, discussing her trying to kiss him. He texts her ""I like kissing you too"". This is where I'm torn up. He claims she only tried to kiss him, and he got angry that she tried. However, nowhere in their text exchange is there any evidence of him mentioning me, even though he and I have been together for over twice as long as they ever were. He really offered no explanation for his actions but genuinely apologized and said he should've told me. Problem is, I just don't trust him any more. While these to me are still isolated events, I could see them turning into a pattern and I don't know if I should wait around long enough to see if that's going to happen, or muster the courage to trust in him again and trust that he didn't actually cheat on me and is going to be faithful from here on out. Sorry for the lengthly post, this just has me awake at night trying to figure out what I want to do vs what I should do. Any and all advice is appreciated. Feel free to ask clarifying questions, it's hard to justify a year of being with someone in a text post. ",22Sep2017,1

4,"I’m in the process of getting better insurance to see a professional, but in the meantime, what advice or tips can you offer to help alleviate symptoms of depression?

For the past few years, I’ve been displaying a lot of symptoms including occasional thoughts of suicide. I saw a doctor last year because I thought that maybe it could be poor physical health, but it turns out I’m actually in “perfect” health. 

When I was in high school, I somehow managed to read a book daily, draw, web design, keep up an active blog, *and* binge-watch TV shows in my free-time. Now I can’t even participate in a hobby I love without stopping within the first 30 minutes and wanting to sleep or waste time on social media, games, etc. It has only gotten worse the past year because of a number of reasons, but I should be overall happy with my life *now* regardless of my circumstances. 

The most important change in my life is my pregnancy (a couple of months along), but I’m actually *happy* and excited about that. I’m currently back with my mom, just got hired for a part-time online job, and I pretty much have immense support from her, the rest of my family, and my ex-fiancé. After the last few years of constant struggle—financial, emotional, academic—I finally have time to rest, relax, and do the things I love because my mom wants me to take this time to grow a healthy baby and plan for a better future. The fact that this will be her first grandchild only makes her more supportive and charitable, what-with the physical changes I’m undergoing.

Yet I still feel this gloominess and cannot find that strong sense of motivation that I used to have as a teenager. What gives? Any help or words of wisdom will be sincerely appreciated. ",22Sep2017,1
5,"It was my first sex that caused a 15 degrees bend left. After that when i was sleeping my hard on pressed too much to my pants and it popped causing me another 30 degrees dorsal bend. I dont know what to do other than drinking alcohol and crying a lot. What did i do to deserve this at my age? I have both physical and psychological ED and doctors don't seem to care about it(3 urologists i have been to). It is extremely rare for this to happen to a 19 year old and i even think i should kill myself so my child doesn't live the same stuff i have in this age(it is a genetic disorder). So i feel like alone and nobody cares about this problem in public either.

6,"So my fiance is a waitress at this restaurant and she's been working there about 8 months now and has a new supervisor (the kid). 

Some history about the place of the last few months.

A few months ago all the bosses quit. I forget the reason why, but the owner needed a new GM (general manager) so they hire this woman who I think was friends with the owner. Now the kid had already been working there for a while and by what everyone has told me that also works there including my fiance this kid is a shitbag. I mean he is alwase late, gives everyone an attitude, and was a no call no show for 2 days in a row. Now when the new GM came showed up they needed new supervisors, and I dident know it at the time but low and fucking behold the woman who was the new GM was the shit heads mom. So who do you think got the job? Exactly, and every thing went downhill from there. Every time some one would tell him he was wrong about something (which was often) he would go off on them and threaten to write them up (tell his mommy). And him being late didn't stop either, yet he's alwase getting on to people for being 5 min late, even though when he is late it's always about 45min to about an hour. His mother knows about this but does nothing (of course). 

Now back to the present. A bout 2 days ago everyone had a meeting with the GM (his mom) telling her about her shity son. Almost nobody wants him there, others than his like two friends, which one of them is unfortunately our roommate and my fiances best friend. Now the fucked up thing about this kid is that has a child and shouldn't even be a supervisor and can't take criticism. So his response to his friends was ""I'm the supervisor and if they don't like me then I'll just fuck with their schedule"" implying that has going to cut people's hours because they don't like him. Now I don't know about you but I take this verry fucking personal. This little shit is talking about taking money away from people that have bills to pay. Taking money from me and my fiance.

Now he hasn't done anything as of yet. But I'm waiting for him to do some shit. Granted I could verry easaly beat his ass because he's a scrawny gay kid, but I'm getting out of the army soon and can't afford assault charges. I just want to know if anybody had any advice. I have an idea for what I could do, because I can easaly get his number and post it online. But I just want to get somebody else's opinion

8,"I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 4 months now, it has been going great and it seemed as if her parents really liked me. She has always fought with her parents for her whole life. They're currently divorced and have married other people yet both of them still fight with her. She has been diagnosed for depression a while ago and takes medication, she has a history of self-harm too.   
  
I'm not entirely sure what to do because if she doesn't have these things I don't know how to contact her. We don't attend the same school, I don't know where in her school she is and at one time, that is all alien to me. I'm hoping she can keep her phone even without the phoneline and use it with the WiFi at her school.  
  
I'm trying to get a car soon myself so that I'll be able to take her out and such. She says when she turns 18 (End of January) she will have more freedom and will hopefully not fight with her parents anymore. She has been taken by CPS before and they said that her mom is manipulative and abusive. I'm not entirely sure what I can do for her or if I can do anything for her.  
  
She was thinking of applying to a university in another province (we live in Canada) so that she could have a fresh start and escape this city. I tried to see if we could move out in our current city after highschool (this is our last year) but I think she is quite interested in leaving to another province. I'm not against the idea if I'm able to follow her but then again that's my main concern. I love her a lot, but I have heard people say don't go and chase a girl into a different province or a different school because she might not end up staying with you. Does that ever work out for people? I have the hope that it would and I really want to stay with her. How hard is it to move into a different province, especially straight after highschool?",22Sep2017,1
9,"OK Reddit I need some advice. Our sixth wedding anniversary is on Sunday, the 24th. So I don’t have a lot of time. I just found out that both kids will be gone basically all day (from like 9 am to 7 pm). Obviously, sexy time and all that are going to happen.

I am looking for advice on how I can make things a little more romantic. I’m thinking of decorating our room or doing something like that because I know she’ll really like it and it will be memorable (hopefully). Our first valentine’s day as a couple we weren’t together so I sent her a sort of DIY kit for decorating with rose petals and candles and a (gag gift) of some fuzzy handcuffs (at the time she was training to become a police officer so it was kind of a double joke).

I’d like to do something like that, but less silly and more romantic. Especially since we will be together.

I’d like to keep the budget (for decorations and such - anniversary gift is already done) around $100, if possible, but I’m willing to go over if someone has a really good idea.

12,"My mom has quit her job. It's been three weeks and she hasn't filled out her resume. The problem is, my name is on the lease and I know I'd be held responsible for paying the rent if she doesn't get a job, which I can in no way afford, because the rent is more than my monthly paycheck. I am taking college classes. Any attempts to point out the personal risk to me or to try to motivate her to get started looking for jobs is 'disrespectful'. I'm an adult, I am more than polite.

14,"Hello, anyone willing to read this. TL;DR at the bottom. I've shortened this up as best I could while trying to leave in important points.

Foreword: I have a ""friend"", let's call her H, that's dating one of my boyfriend's best friends, called C.
H and C used to be married around 6 years ago. C found out H was sleeping with several people while they were married. C confronted H, H filed for divorce, they divorced. Two years later, C had a traumatizing experience, and H came back into his life. They're now dating again.

H and I have had limited interaction, and not because I won't hang out with her, but because she seems incapable of pulling her face out of her phone screen.
She texts me often and says she ""misses"" me and ""would really like to see"" me, but when I arrive at her home, she greets me, then is lost to the world on her phone for the remainder of my visit. I usually spend my time with her bored and restless, wishing I had just stayed home so I could at least entertain myself.

But her being a rude hostess isn't really why I want to end this friendship. 
It's because she slept with her boyfriend's despised ex-friend (among a number of other people) while she was married to C, now just her boyfriend (see foreword). We'll call the guy she slept with T.

""Oh, you're making a big deal about this, Idkwtdat,"" you say. ""It's in the past,"" you say.

My boyfriend is still friends with T while the rest of the friend group isn't. H tears T apart every single time we're over there (red flag, huh?). We don't even have to mention T, she just starts in about how T is awful and she absolutey hates him. Obviously she doesn't hate him that much because she put his dick in her mouth and her other orifices.

I cannot sit in the same room with her without feeling disgusted. I don't want to be ""friends"" with her anymore, but I'm not sure how to go about telling her why. 
I've just been writing her off with ""I'm so busy with work,"" and ""I've got so many deadlines this week, sorry,"" but I'm not sorry. 
I didn't like sitting her house bored out of mind anyway, but now I don't even want to talk to her anymore.
I don't want to tell C because it'll crush him, and he's still a little out of it from the traumatizing experience.

She's become ruder and ruder to me in our text exchanges, so that's another thing I don't want to deal with. I don't like being guilt-tripped because I don't want to hang out with her. She just can't take a hint.

Should I be brutally honest with her and tell her what I know, how I feel about it, and why I don't want to be around her?
She's going to make me out to be an asshole no matter what I do, but I'm not really concerned with that.
I don't feel like I can just ghost her because my boyfriend would still like to see C. I can just drop him off at their house, but I know she'll come out to the car and try to talk to me.

TL;DR: Found out my ""friend"" slept with someone our group knows (despises) while she was married and I can't handle being around her anymore. I'm tired of giving excuses not to see her, but I'm not sure if I should tell her the truth or try and ghost her since my boyfriend will still likely see the couple and she will likely try to talk to me.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and obviously my story does leave out some details, so I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of, ""Wow, you're being an asshole, who cares,"" but I think I've already given too many details as it is.

This is the same with nail biting and pencil biting. I really don't know how to stop. My teeth are getting slightly bumpy on the ends because on the pencil, my nails will never grow the way I want them to and I'm afraid I'll end up with a permanent hole in my cheeks.

16,"I do not know how to process anger, as it is not common in my life. I read and do yoga and try to bring my mind to a new subject, however I do not know how to confront the problem properly nor how to prepare myself for the worst possible outcome. I want to leave. I want an easy out. I want to pretend it never happened so that I don’t have to feel this way. But when you see someone treat someone else poorly, is it really wrong to be angry? Is it wrong to want justice?

I was wondering if anyone else has this problem. If so, how do you deal with it? I don’t want to blow up in someone’s face, as that is not generally very productive, nor do people tend to listen to that approach. I’m worried that speaking up will just make my situation more tormenting, but I also don’t want the others being affected by this to continue to be treated the way they are being treated. For myself, I could just keep my mouth shut, but for the others, I don’t feel right not speaking up.",22Sep2017,1
18,"I live in a house with 3 other girls. Let's call them A, B, and C, and I'll be D. Roommates B, C and I are all on the same page when it comes to cleanliness. We pick up after ourselves, do our dishes, clean counters/floors/etc. 

Roommate B and I spend a lot of time downstairs and both have a tendency to leave our bags, backpacks, shoes, things like that downstairs instead of taking them to our rooms. This stuff is never in anybody's way and the house is never dirty or disorganized. Roommate C occasionally leaves homework/backpacks downstairs, too, and all of us are fine with this. 

Roommate A is another story. For some reason, her only definition of a ""clean house"" is absolutely nothing downstairs except for furniture--no shoes, no bags, nothing. B, C, and I all have an issue with this for a couple reasons:

1.) People live in the house. Our common area is just that; an area where we all hang out. Naturally, this means that some of our stuff is left down there, especially the types of things that you grab when you're running out the door like shoes and bags. Personal items are never in anybody's way and like I said, the house is very rarely anything CLOSE to messy because we all pick up after ourselves. I'm talking a backpack sitting on the table or a purse hanging off the back of the chair. Anything beyond that is picked up within a reasonable timeframe. 

2.) Roommate A is only bothered by things being downstairs when she's in a ""cleaning mood,"" which is about once a month when she throws a fit about any semblance of disorganization. Her normal state involves leaving suitcases downstairs for weeks on end, filled with her dirty clothes and open so that she can grab whatever she wants out of them instead of taking it upstairs to her room; cutting her hair and then leaving her hair all over the shared bathroom; letting dirty clothes pile up in her room for so long that you can smell them when you walk past her door; and ""cleaning up"" by throwing so much garbage and empty bottles into the downstairs closet that it smells and collects pests. 

3.) Now, I'm sure it would be one thing if roommate A decided she was going to respectfully bring up any issues with the house in a face to face conversation and come to a compromise. This isn't the case. Roommate A sends passive aggressive group texts, tweets things like ""you can really tell who's parents have done everything for them their whole lives"" or ""some people can't pick up after themselves"", and, most recently, put our things (again, bags and backpacks) on a chair and put the chair in the middle of the walkway as if she was trying to send a message. When you talk to her in person she makes no mention of there being any issue whatsoever and is perfectly friendly and compliant when you ask her not to move your things, but her actions and her texts/tweets tell a different story. 

4.) Roommate A shit talks the other roommates behind everyone's back about how everyone else is ""so messy"", acting like you and her are the only ones who have it together, then she'll turn around and say the same thing about you. She also has compulsive lying issues that I won't get into.   

I'm not quite sure what to do in this situation. B, C, and I are all annoyed with A's passive aggressive behavior and her flip-flopping between being an absolute slob and an unreasonable neat freak. None of us want to change a system that 3/4 people are perfectly happy with and waste our time trying to live up to A's standards. Nobody wants to just do whatever A asks of us because then she'll grow to expect us to do anything she says; however, none of us particularly want to bring it up in person, either, as we're kind of waiting for A to do it and knock it off with the passive aggressive behavior. Does anyone have any advice? Should we just buckle down and confront A or keep up with the system that's working for everyone else and wait for A to let it go? Any advice you have is appreciated.

21,"I work for a small organization (less than 200 people) where everybody basically knows everybody. An acquaintance of mine in another department recently gave notice and let me know he was going to do so in case I wanted to apply for his position. It's higher up and better paying than my current position. I have relevant experience and a small knowledge gap that I'm working hard to fill in the next couple weeks so I can demonstrate my dedication and willingness to learn. The head of the department already knows me pretty well and we've had an amiable relationship for a couple years. My acquaintance said he'd put a good word in for me as well. 

Today, he dropped by my office to let me know he'd floated my name to his boss, and another guy in his department raised concerns about my personal organization. (He comes by my area from time to time and admittedly my desk is cluttered - I am not a naturally organized person and it takes a lot of conscious effort for me to maintain an orderly space, but I can do it.) My friend pointed out that with technical knowledge, they can train me as needed but a personality fit is something they can't fake, so I need to make sure that the next time someone from that department drops by my area, it looks well-maintained. I'm getting it in shape right now and I really took that to heart, but I'm afraid it will be too little, too late. These people have been seeing my cluttered desk for 2 years. 

(I should note that while my workstation often looks a mess, it doesn't affect the quality of my work. I'm good at what I do and my current supervisor has nothing but good things to say about me. She does sometimes give me a gentle reminder to tidy up my space when it's worse than usual, but she overall doesn't mind it as long as my work is stellar, which is why I haven't been strongly incentivized to change it until now.)

I guess the advice I need is a professional way to explain in the interview that I understand this is a shortcoming of mine, and it's something I'm committed to working on and I won't allow it to interfere with the work I'd do for the new boss. I don't want to come across as sounding whiny or trying to explain away or justify my disorganization. It's the way my brain is wired, and fighting against that inclination is difficult but I can and will do it. I want this job, and I feel like most of the other factors are lined up in my favor but I might still lose out because of this one thing. So how can I best approach this so that it reflects well on me in the interview? Any advice much appreciated.",22Sep2017,10

25,"So I've been mulling this over in my head a lot because a really want to solve these issues, but I can't think of what to say. Since around September, my friend and I have been fighting a bit. I don't consider them traditional fights (we've just been having short periods of time where we ignore each other for a while). This is probably the second time this has happened, and the first time I talked to him about it. I thought we had worked it out, but I guess not. Although, I'm pretty sure it's my fault this keeps happening and I really want to stop it. Anyway, we've been in school for about a month and he and his girlfriend have made friends with a lot of juniors. I'm sorted acquainted with them, but not well enough to consider them friends. So he and I have known each for about 2 years, and he's already better friends with the juniors than he ever was with me. (I'm adding to much preface to this than I need to). But anyway, the other day he, I, am some of our other friends were hanging out with the juniors at a restaurant, it was pretty late at night and since me and my friends are mostly freshmen all our parents were coming soon. My mom was giving him a ride and we had a little spat about that earlier (not important) and she happened to come earlier than I had expected. So I told him that we had to go, because of course Mother's giving me a ride and I can't just tell her to come back later, and he just sort of gave this look like ""seriously? I thought I had more time, I want to stay here."" I really hated it, he looked so sad and it was making me feel really bad. The juniors offered to give him a ride home so he can stay, and his girlfriend offered for her parents to give him one also, but instead he went with me. At the moment, I was really pissed for an irrational reason and looking back on it I probably shouldn't have been mad (don't worry, I didn't yell, I was just a bit moody). But yeah, we dropped him off and I didn't talk to him at all over the weekend or for this entire week. I've been thinking ""if it really matters to him, he'll say something, right?"" but he hasn't said a single word. Anyway, that brings us here. I need help coming up with what to say to him because I want to fix this, I don't want to end like this. Please, and thank you.

31,"Long story short I have a Masters degree that aims to design more inclusively/accessibly. Most of the graduates call themselves accessibility specialists in ""X"". 

I live in Canada, and I am really struggling to find work where I can use my knowledge. I've tried to get into design (as a researcher, ux, or strategy designer), but I have no practical experience to make a portfolio be cause my degree was theory based. So I have minimal physical proof of my knowledge/skills.

Worst thing is employers look at me like I'm speaking an alien language when they ask me to explain my skills/education. If I find a position related to accessibility and inclusion the description asks for this magical rainbow unicorn or skills that wouldn't usually exist in a single role.

I have built a portfolio online (albeit a merger one) and I have spoken to industry experts and they've reviewed my resume etc. I've also reached out to recruitment agencies and my classmates to flag opportunities if they hear anything, but I don't have anything yet.

Tl;Dr - I am in a specialized field as an accessibility specialist and I can't find work. Help! Advice?",22Sep2017,1
32,"I'll do my best to explain this, but it's admittedly going to be difficult because it's hard for me to talk about, even in complete anonymity.

When I was in college, I struggled with severe depression. I started becoming depressed in late 2010 when I was 17 and a senior in high school. It got progressively worse in college due to being away from the familiar, the difficult academics, realizing my parents were emotionally abusive, genetics, bad coping mechanisms, and feeling like I couldn't bond with most of the insanely rich people there (I went to a liberal arts college), among other things. There were other factors, but these were the main ones. 

I procrastinated a lot and didn't ask for help about the material nearly as much as I should have. I was a straight A student at my high school, and I struggled to maintain a B average here. It was so, so difficult and I really only enjoyed about half of my classes because a lot of it went over my head. I would struggle to add to the class discussion, and it felt so embarrassing when I just didn't have as much to say as the rich kids that had gone to good high schools. I felt like I was struggling so much with academics and my feelings about that that I didn't really grow much at all between age 18 and 21. I was just struggling to get by.

My parents weren't very supportive. They were pretty passive aggressive. Even now, anytime I ever talk about those days, they both just say, ""Well, we *told* you to get help and you didn't.""

These feelings got worse and they finally came to a head when I was a senior, aka at the worst possible time. I failed my senior thesis due to procrastination and complete burnout and a feeling of being unable to do anything. Part of me felt like I deserved to fail out of college, too.

My professors actually allowed me to redo the thesis and I passed the second time. One of my professors was always kind to me about it, but the other seemed deeply upset at first about what I did, and then later softened a bit. They even asked me if anything was going on. I was emotionally numb and trying to protect myself, so I said no. I probably looked very apathetic to them about the whole thing, but in reality, I was terrified and very sick, and I was determined to hide it.

I graduated in 2015. Two months later, I moved to Seattle area for graduate school to become a teacher. In February 2016, student teaching proved to be too much for me, so I dropped it and got a Masters without teaching certification instead. These days, I'm working as a teacher's assistant with the intention of going into social work or advising. I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I did, so that's admittedly why I want to go into advising or social work.

I have since friended one of the professors on Facebook. I really look up to her, and I hate that she likely remembers me as one of her worst students. It's probably accurate, but I want to let her know that I've learned from what happened. I also want to tell her the truth: I was concealing my depression. And I've learned from that, too. 

I just don't know how to start this conversation. I don't even know if I should. 

Thoughts or advice as to what to do?

If you want any more details as to what happened, I can provide them if asked. Like I said, it was really hard to write about this.

Exactly last week she said she had to go to the hospital because she was having back pain. I picked her up from the hospital and she was out of it when we came home and went straight to her room. The following day i texted her if she was feeling better, but she hasnt responded ever. 4 days ago my other roommate asked her in person if anything was wrong but she ignored her and jist went to her room.

49,"So this is kinda a long story but I'll try not to ramble on too much and get to the point. I'm 16 currently sophomore year in high school, I just moved from Canada, Alberta specifically, to America so this is my first year in high school ever, I've never played football before and still only know the basics but Im definitely interested in learning it more complexly. So I never got to try out for the team because the tryouts were held before school started, I'm not too familiar with how the season works and their schedule but they've already played quite a few games, but this week I learned that the team is actually really small and they're looking for anybody who wants to join so I'll most likely get on it if I ask. I'd of course do a bit more research on the game before hand but i still don't want to show up having never played before, is it worth it to join with no experience what so ever?

51,"So I haven't dated in two and a half years. The first girl I thought I was going to marry. (I was 17, and I only had my parents relationship to go by) and she cheated on me. The second girl let her parents boss her around, and I didn't want to date all three of them. It seen about since then. 

I sorta just focused on self improvement and dealing with some bad habits I acquired. Now I started talking to someone who works where I work in a different department. I already kinda knew I liked her since she did fun stuff, and seemed kind, hut we have been talking a bit more, and she is quite a pleasant person. I certainly would like to ask her out, once I get to know her more. So my question is this. I'm sorta losing my mind right now. I seem to be reading way too much into long pauses in text conversations, and I have about two and a half years of this just like stress I didn't know was there. How do I deal with that?

52,"To elaborate from the title, I was doing horribly in uni to the point that I either got kicked out or withdrew from the semester to make sure I didn't flunk out and get kicked out. In the midst of all of this craziness, I thought it would be a good idea to take a semester off. So in short, not only did I withdraw from Spring 2017 semester, but now I'm taking Fall 2017 semester off. This isn't the issue, however. 

The real issue is that my parents think I'm in school at the moment and it's killing me that I'm lying to them. To be quite honest, they probably know that something is up since they know that I withdrew from the semester and I've talked to them about taking a semester off. I want to tell them the truth about me not going to school for a semester but I've already ""convinced"" them that I'm at school. I don't live with them anymore and live in my own place with some friends but still depend on them to help me pay for some of my school expenses. To add in to the pressure my dad said he won't retire (he really wants to retire) until I graduate so I feel like I'm betraying him for taking an extra time to myself. 

Should I come clean? Should I continue the lie? I truly do plan on coming back to school for spring 2018! I'm really motivated to do better, I know I burned myself out but my scholar flame is back on! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the sloppy text. 

TL;DR: I lied to my parents about going back to school for this semester even though I reassured them that I'd study this semester. I could fake it until next semester since I really am going back to school, or I could come clean and risk hurting both my parents. Please help. ",22Sep2017,1
53,"I was raised in a very traditional household, so as you can imagine, I was ""indoctrinated"" with the idea that I would eventually meet a nice girl, settle down, and get married. That's just what everyone told me would happen when I was younger, and I subscribed to that idea up until about three years ago. I'm no longer a Christian, and I've sort of removed my rose-tinted glasses, and now I'm frightened of the reality of relationships.

People cheat and manipulate. They are unpredictable. I hear about it on a daily basis. I've read hundreds of stories about people's lives being ruined by their significant others for no reason. My brother was a victim of this, and now that he is divorced, he rarely sees his children. I don't want to become like him. I want to avoid this, but the only way to be completely immune to this is to just stay single forever. 

I see relationships as a hugely emotional gamble now. There is just too much that can go wrong, and I don't think I would be able to handle the turmoil of being cheated on, or ghosted, or used, especially after investing myself into someone. 

After much deliberation, I've decided I do not want to get married or have kids. This destroys my chances of finding a like-minded person to begin with. What percentage of woman don't want to get married or have children? It's essentially zero where I live.

I'm also hung up on the idea of sanctity and being genuine. I would never pursue a relationship with someone unless I knew I wanted to spend my life with them. That said, I don't really ""experiment"" with relationships. I don't like the idea of having sex or being intimate to any degree with someone I don't care about (but I suppose that's an entirely different subject). I just see that as selfish behavior.

I'm not sure where I'm even going with this. I guess I just feel like I was lied to as a child, lead on to believe that ""God was going to bring someone into my life"" and it would be happily ever after from there. I know now that isn't true. Even if I do find that ""perfect person"" there is no way of predicting what the outcome of our relationship will be. Will she cheat? Leave me for some undisclosed reason? And with all of these questions buzzing in my head, how am I supposed to trust the next person I get involved with?

I want intimacy. I want to share my life with someone else eventually, but right now, I almost feel as though the loneliness is worth saving myself from future heartbreak. But other times, the desire to have an SO is just crushing, and It's getting worse as I get older.

Hope that wasn't too much of a rant. Let me know if you have any advice for me, and thank you for reading. ",22Sep2017,1

However, fast forward to now, we're both Juniors in HS, go to different schools, and I see her twice a week due to church and youth group.

58,"I always had trouble doing my homework in elementary school. Not that I didn't understand it, but rather I just never did it. Or I did it but never turned it in. I used to talk a lot in class and my teachers used to give me low marks because of it. I was always considered for Gifted and Talented Education but they never added me because I never did my homework. 

my teachers would make me get my report cards signed and they would always say 'he talks a lot' and instead of trying to address why I talked a lot or didn't turn in my hw my mom used to beat me. She threatened to put me on medication, she used to ask me if I'm retarded because what kind of normal person cannot turn in their homework? this happened from 2-7th grade. 

My mom didn't ever ask my why I talk a lot, it would instead follow this path: Report card comes in, she sees it, and she starts hitting me. SHe asks if I'm retarded and if I need medication and if I wanted to live on the street, while beating me. Sometimes she would take it farther. 

One time in 3rd grade she made me pack my backpack and walk it to the dumpster and throw it away. She used to promise me things for good grades, like a hot wheels car and then never deliver on it when I did get good grades. Her reasoning? People lie. Why do I deserve it? People lie all the time. Get used to it. Again I was in 3rd grade. 

Anytime anybody in the family would give me money as a gift, like 5 or 10 dollars she would take it and 'hold' it for me, never to be seen again. Her reasoning again was that she would provide it to me later. I never would see that money again. One time I bought a 50 cent sharpener fr om the school book fair and she and my brother berated me, and then she proceeded to beat me because I didn't know the value of money. I was 7 or 8. 

The most prominent one was in 5th grade. I had to type up a report on dinasaurs. Issue was, no one taught me how to sue word on a computer. So in that sense I didn't start the project. She got wind of it, it was her day off. Instead of helping me, she beat me, drove me up to the hills where i'd never been and told me to get out of the car,that she'd be right there when I got out. I knew I shouldn't get out of the car because she'd abandon me. I didn't get out. Eventually she turned the car back on and drove us to a pet store to look at reptiles. 

When I was 10 I wanted to be a lawyer. SHe told me don't even try because you're not white, you'll never make it. 

She was rarely home due to work so I feel as though I raised myself. My dad didn't give a shit, he used to and still does watch tv 12 hours a day every day. He never showed any fatherly love. He might as well not exist. 

Does this count as narcissistic behavior, how should I take this? ",22Sep2017,7

67,"This is long, and doesn't have a tldr because there's no way I can sum up everything below in two sentences: just a warning. Also, alt account, obviously.  

I've always struggled with friendships, and have been lonely as long as I can remember. A few years I got diagnosed with pretty serious depression, and am currently on medication to help me cope with it.

Last year, I finally found a friend group. I became friends with this one girl (Let's call her Jane). It started out as a crush, but I've never even really had friends, so I had no idea of how to cope with that. I ended up just trying to befriend her. We have a lot of common interests, and end up in the same classes a lot of the time. We became close, and talked on face time for a few hours almost every night for months. She's always been a bit rough, especially to me. She used to (and still) jokes that if she were to be called out on bullying anyone, it would be me. In the past, it was just small physical stuff, like soft friendly punches or messing with my emotions for her own amusement. I became more integrated into her friend group, who are also in the same group of classes I am. 

Me and Jane have spent time together after school, and it seemed to go well. I genuinely enjoyed speaking to her, and spending time with her was fun. However, she always was a bit moody, but I attributed it to just being a teenager. This summer, I hung out with her once in June and then didn't see her until the beginning of school. She didn't return my texts, and she was in a summer program. 

Since school has started, she's been uncharacteristically mean towards me. She straight up ignores me, even though we see each other every day and sit side by side in one class. If I ask her for help or clarification during class, she either answers or tells me to f*** off. If she needs help, she either steals my notebook (something she also used to do) or purposely asks someone further away. It seems petty, but she also blocked me on her secondary Instagram. 

I'm honestly at a loss here. These people are really my only group of friends, and I don't want to end up alone like before. I also know that this isn't normal, and I deserve better than this. I still talk to and enjoy hanging out with the other friends in the group, but I feel like she is badmouthing me. 

I know this is probably just petty teenage drama, and I'm sorry for wasting your time. What should I do? I have a hard time making friends, and have a few things some people have a hard time looking past. Most of people think I'm weird, and I was really excited last year to have a group of friends that liked spending time with me. It made me feel valuable, and for once in a long time, happy. I still have to talk to these kids because we're in all the same classes, but I could not talk to her. What are my options? What should I do?

For example she will never say hi to me until the class we both are is finished, and she always chooses other people to do works. Every time I want to do something over the weekend she says she has a ""family affair"" or that she already has plans with other people. She never replies to my messages but after 8 hours later, and sometimes she doesn't answer them at all. She only starts conversations when she needs something from me (like something printed or a teacher mail). I consider her my best friend because she helped a lot through my depression, she talked to me in person when I needed to, which was enough for me, and she says I'm also her best friend and she sees me as her brother. 

In short words,the reason of why I feel she's ashamed of me is because she never replies my messages, she never open time for me to hang out, she barely talks to me when there are other people around her, and because she's always bragging about how she misses her old friend who transfered to another school a few months ago. Is she ashamed of me or is it  simply that she doesn't like me at all? What can I do in this situation?

My father also sees it. She doesn't have the maturity to accept that she behaves like a little girl, and I've told her I'm going to cut communication if she doesn't improve. Is there ANYTHING I can do to make her realize how psychotic she acts? I just need some advice on where to take the situation. ",22Sep2017,1

83,Ive never interacted with this company before but somehow they have my full name and address and think I owe them $40. What gives? My bank account looks fine. ,22Sep2017,1
84,"So I'm a 17 year old who graduated high school a year early (didn't like that place besides PE and sports). I have a full time job and full time online college + an extra class. I do karate once a week (used to be 2 but I cut down). I want to start working out 5 days a week before work (because I am an evening shift so that's the only time I'd be able to). I want to make it big on youtube, so I'm using my free time to record gameplays and upload videos. My college is for graphic design.


Now I have a lot of stuff that needs done on a daily basis (mostly college and youtube). Even though youtube isn't important in some of your eyes, it is to me so pretend it's something equally important please. I have a lot of stuff on my ""To-Do List"" (i.e. college assignments, youtube videos to make, movies to rate and review for youtube, games to livestream and stuff around the house). I get all the stuff that NEEDS to be done (stuff around the house and college assignments) usually done just before they're due. Like 10 minutes before they're due.


My problem is I procrastinate. Not like most people and just say I'll do it later. My issue is I make a schedule for the next couple days. I either stop halfway through the next day or even before I start because I feel like it's not getting enough done. Then I re-make a schedule. I know it's stupid so then I did just a to-do list for each day, but I felt the same. I feel like I'm not getting stuff done and then I'll scrap up a to-do list and remake one. So most of my time literally goes to making to-do lists and not getting anything done really. (I feel like if there was a job making lists, I'd really enjoy it, IDK why, lol)


It really bothers me and I just want to get stuff done. I want to just decide, make a schedule, make a to-do list, make a small list of just 5 things at a time, or just a general list and I'll get them done when I can. I don't want to keep switching between organizing methods. Am I making my to-do lists to far in advance? (I usually do like 3-4 days or even more because I'll put ALL the stuff on the big list down so they get done.) My big list has like 60 things that need to be done. Most are just ideas for youtube and college assignments, so the youtube stuff doesn't have a due date, but I'd like to get them done. I've been really lazy since I started procrastinating like this. So out of these ideas, which do you think would be the best for someone like me.


A) Strict Schedule (I'll put time constraints)

B) Loose Schedule (I'll put in order of what I need to do, but no time constraints)

C) Daily To-Do List (I'll put stuff that needs done that certain day)

D) Short To-Do List (I'll make a list of 5 things that need done, then when I'm done I'll make another short list and so on)

E) Nothing, just have that big to-do list and get stuff done whenever

F) Anything else?



TL:DR, I can't get anything done, because I procrastinate. I procrastinate by making new lists and schedules, but I keep re-making them because I feel I'm not getting anything done. What kind of schedule/to-do list would be best? How can I just decide what I'm going to do?",22Sep2017,1
86,"Hi Reddit,

Looking for some advice/insight. I am a registered nurse and have been working as an RN in Alberta, Canada for the last 5 years. Previous to that, finished an undergraduate degree of nursing. I have never been too crazy about nursing, mostly went into it and stuck with it because it seemed like a good, meaningful job with good pay and stability. And it is! But I have always struggled because I never really liked it. I have always wanted to do something more creative and challenging but have been too scared to try... but I am hitting a point where I feel like I should make a change or else I will just keep digging myself further and further into my career path and it will be harder to get out later.

I have been interested and looking into the environmental design faculty at UofC, and thinking about applying to get into the Masters of Architecture or Masters of Planning program.

I have a WHOLE BUNCH of questions that I will list below... if you have any insight on any or all questions please share. I realize it is a huge change so I want to gather as much true and realistic information as possible. Please be as brutally honest as needed.

1.Is it totally crazy that I am going for something like architecture with a nursing background, and essentially no technical training in art/design? (My experience with art has only be hobbies such as photography and fairly basic graphic design). How strong of an arts background do you need?


2.I essentially am aiming for entrance next year; are there any courses or things that you would suggest I do in the mean time that would help prepare me and make my application stronger? (for example, night courses for drawing or painting or something)


3.What kind of things do you suggest I include in a portfolio?


4.What are the major differences between a master's in architecture and a master's in planning? differences between Architect vs. Planner as careers?


5.What career paths can people take once finishing school and obtaining a Master’s in Architecure? Master’s of Planning?




For those who already work in this field:

1.What are the pros and cons of this kind of work? What do people generally love the most and complain about the most?


2.What positions do people in this industry generally strive for? What is considered a great position/job as an architect?


3.How much money should I expect to be make when starting off? How much can I expect to make after 5 or 10 years of working?


4.What are general daily tasks/expectations of an architect or planner?


Any advice/insight in this area would be much appreciated!

I told him how cute he was as soon as I met him. We are both single so he asked me to hang out and put his number in my phone.

On our first date I took him to a cool hiking spot and it was going well and he wanted to have sex. I didn't really want to but I'm really attracted to him and I like him a lot so I did it because I Don't know how to say no. He excited me a lot but only lasted 30-60 seconds. Afterwards he wanted me to drive him to his car. This made me feel super upset.

I figured he was just using me for sex. But on the third time we hung out he asked ""how long I was gonna be around"" in his life. I told him that sort of thing has to happen naturally over time and I didn't want to rush anything because I just left an abusive relationship about 2 months ago. And that is true, I am not ready for a commitment. I am scared of investing in a relationship.

So here's my question: why does it make me so sad when he just wants to leave me after sex? Why do I want him to stay and hold me?

I don't want to grow up to be dependent on my parents' finances, but from how they've spoken to me about this topic it seems they'd be content to let me live with them forever, and as much as I appreciate that obviously I'm going to want my own place someday. 

Except I think that day will come much later rather than sooner. 

I have to be reminded what day it is almost every day, which is dangerous for me because I have to take different doses of a medicine every day. I can't forget about them or I could get sick. 

I don't feel confident enough to SPEAK to people IRL most of the time, and my self esteem is buried 60 feet under so I have no idea how I'll handle job interviews. It also doesn't exactly help that my eyesight isn't the best (half blind) so of course that's going to impede me no matter what anyone says. 

Sometimes I wish something would take my voice away so I wouldn't have to bear the terror of making conversation. I hate humans anyway, the company of animals is much better. I've tried selective mutism but that didn't work because I'm surrounded by people who repeat themselves until you answer them. 

I don't like figures of authority (probably because of my mother) and I loathe making corrections to my schoolwork. Logically, I know they're necessary. Logically, I shouldn't get so angry about it. But I do. Makes my blood boil just thinking about it. 

I have to write a personal statement for a mandatory hypothetical 'University application.' In spite or the fact my school ignores you that can go to college or just GET INTO work as an alternative option. Everyone still has to do it, and my option isn't an apprenticeship either, it's college (I want to go to college, we have A Levels in England which is basically something of a substitute for college, but college still ends up useful as extra education). 

Time is up for the Personal Statement in a few months and I haven't even started yet. I can't 'sell myself' if I can't think of anything good to say. Except 'all I can offer you is an extra pair of hands to the workload.' Because I don't have any talents that are applicable to real life jobs (I like writing creatively and drawing,  so yeah). 

I'm lazy, impatient, have to be TOLD what to do to be motivated to do it (and be too frightened to do it well, probably), lack foresight, I'm HEAVILY disorganised, can't cope under pressure at all…And oh yeah I DON'T LIKE WORKING IN A TEAM. 

They're all the bare bones requirement for jobs, right? Guess I'm out of luck. 

I just don't know what to do. Parents keep asking me what I want with my life. Frankly I don't know and don't care so much as long as it gets me money and isn't obscene or illegal. I DID want to be a writer or work in cartoons, since they're the things I'm actually passionate about, but I couldn't survive on just those alone and again I'm BLESSED with poorly eyes so that might cut my work time in half.

104,"Hey /r/advice. I need advice, encouragement, wisdom, or whatever. My wife and I had a big fight which lead to me being charged with felony domestic violence. I’m out on bail and my wife wants to stay together and work on our marriage. Here’s my predicament. This has been a tough few months, and frankly, I’ve put her through enough. She has everything on her shoulders now since I can’t even go to my home or see her. I still have my job (for now) and my paychecks still go to our joint accounts so that she isn’t burdened financially yet. I’m on salary at my job and it pays well, and if convicted with a felony I doubt I’ll ever be able to get another one like it or make near as much. She’s now left to raise our son basically alone (I take him for a day occasionally). I think that she is under the impression that this is going to go away and that I’m not going to serve any time. I have immense guilt and remorse over the whole situation, but there’s nothing I can do now. Tonight, I wrote her a letter and put it in a tamper proof envelope that I’m going to get to her if I’m sentenced to prison. The note basically says for her to forget about me, to move on, and asks for a divorce. This isn’t what I want, but I feel it’s only fair to her, and I don’t think she’ll leave on her own. I’ve caused her enough trouble and after I’ve been to prison and lost my job I’ll only cause her more. I don’t want that for her. I can’t stand the thought of her giving up even more because of me. I’m the breadwinner in the family and she’ll have to work full time just to make ends meet, she’ll have to sell the house and probably car(s) too.

105,"I am insecure about my girlfriends ex still being in her life.

Backstory: It's not in the normal ""we are still friends"" sense. It's because he has a child and they lived together during their relationship and she grew fond of his child and now considers herself the boys Mother.
The boys biological mother abandoned him as a newborn, so he doesn't have a mom in his life.

Now: My gf keeps in touch, hangs out from time to time, sends gifts, money, you name it to the boys father and it's justified because it's ""for the boy"". I believe her. I sort of have a soft spot for the whole situation too.

But I can't help but be upset about the whole thing b/c I want her to close that chapter of her life. 
Will they ever be able to move on if they're still connected through a child? What happens when her and I decide to marry and have children of our own? Where does his child fit into our lives? Where do we fit into theirs?

107,"Tldr at the bottom!


Okay this is going to sound really silly and lame but, to be honest... I never had a friend in my entire life. There I said it. It's mainly due to my (pretty horrible) social anxiety. Although I've been really trying to overcome this anxiety, it's still... well it's pretty bad lol.


Since I'll be graduating college in 2 years, sometimes I feel like it's too late for me to meet genuine, close friends in college at this point. Now don't get me wrong, I still try to enjoy my time here and socialize with people! I've also been really trying to overcome this anxiety, and I genuinely feel comfortable spending time with myself and being me.


But honestly, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I sometimes feel really lonely, especially recently. Usually I do okay at being not-lonely (I mean not to sound egocentric but I've basically managed to do that for all my life lol), but the fact that I'm graduating in 2 years made me realize things I suppose. Okay this is getting very ramble-y so

110,"So it seems like society is fine with whatever anyone does as long as they apologize and ask for forgiveness later. The ONLY exception to this is sexual abuse but everything else seems to be fair game.


Example 1: I know two identical twins. We'll call them Tom and Brad. Tom was married and had a daughter with this woman. Brad then had sex with Tom's wife. Tom's wife then left him and ran away with his brother. So now they had a kid together and got married. So this new boy that was born is Tom's daughter's cousin/half brother. Pretty much some straight Jerry Springer shit. So now years later, the family is asking that Tom forgive Brad and not bring up the incident in family reunions. Tom thinks this is bullshit (rightfully so in my opinion) and says he doesn't want to see them man who stole his wife and created so much dysfunction in his family; However, the family is taking Brad's side on it and saying Tom needs to learn to let the past go. 


Example 2: Myself. My older brother bullied me throughout my entire youth. He would sometimes come come and if he was having a bad day he would hit me or try wrestling holds on me. (He actually choked me unconscious one time). He didn't stop there either, he would always make fun of me at school and he and his friends would join in. As an adult, I've been diagnosed with PTSD and struggle with depression and addiction. Well as adults now, he seems to be doing much better as he had no one to torment him everyday. He tries to be nice to me now but I told my parents I forgive him but I just prefer not to be around someone that has caused me so much emotional harm. My parents said I should spend more time with him and bond like a brother. I told them I would rather not, and they say I should stop being bitter and holding grudges etc. So it's a double whammy of his abuse and my parents making me the bad guy for refusing to be around him. I honestly regret not hitting him with a baseball bat when I was younger so my retaliation would all be ""left in the past"" and maybe he would have a few scars like he left me. 



So in conclusion, it seems like you can literally do ANYTHING besides sexual abuse and still have everyone on your side as long as you apologize and ask for forgiveness later (extra points for evoking Jesus). Interesting how our court systems don't work that way. You can't just go rob a bank and then when you get caught just say you're sorry and avoid going to prison. Sure there is being mad at petty things like ""he broke my N64 controller when I was 12"" which I agree should be forgotten. But your own brother stealing/banging your wife and years of emotional and physical abuse shouldn't fall under this. The victim should have the right to remove that person from their life without being shamed and called angry, bitter, and not enlightened etc. Because it seems like it's better to let it all hang out and  be an asshole,be abusive, and steal whatever tickles your fancy as long as you apologize later.

113,"Alright so I’m going to write this and not make a sob story. And be as truthful as I can be. Sorry if it comes across as a “woe is me”.

So 2 weeks ago, the love of my life asked me to move out. I’ll get this out of the way now, I thought she was my soul mate. We spoke about what our children’s names would be and marriage, every thing. 

Now the facts about me, I’m badly dependent on weed at the moment. And I have been for the last 4 years fairly solidly. And before that it was was always in my life. I’ve tried to quit a few times but never lasted long then a few months. 
A have a condition that effects me called “cluster headaches” that knocks me down around every spring, the last year and this year I was out of action for around a month. Now this is where the problems started.
When I got sick this year I also had a flue which almost mad me bed ridden. I started to sleep in our spare room, so I wouldn’t disturb my SO, we will call her “Jane” for now.  The distance started then, and I should of caught it, but I didn’t.
Now the last year and a bit have been fairly turbulent for me and Jane in our personal and relationships lives, Although the two are were almost one entity. 
When I got my headaches I completely retreated into my self, I lost a job and couldn’t see the point of finding work while I was sick, as I couldn’t even drive most days let alone make it out of bed with my migraines.this was step two on my slippery slope. I lost all my confidence and drive in a very small amount of time, and resorted to smoking weed and playing video games to escape my current predicament, wouldn’t confront my self let alone open up to Jane. 
Jane and I prior to me getting sick had made plans to quit the weed and go travelling, as we basically had a house given to us. We had money, and we were spending it on weed and stoned purchasing. I was the drive of the weed, and she enabled it, we both smoked a lot. I was the biggest smoker though and the one that would go and buy the weed. When I got sick that changed, I would want to smoke and she would go and buy the weed, we lived our old life style with only her income. Which was not easy on her. This was the last and finale step in my eyes.
One day she sat me down, and said she had been thinking about breaking up and I had to go. We talked it out that day and made plans to quit and move on, and for me to get my finger out. But the next day came, and she wasn’t home when I woke up. She came home after breakfast with friends and said she loves me so much but I had to go. I left. 
I left my home, my Dog and my cats. And the family I had found. Just like that.
2 weeks have gone by, we are still in contact but it’s fairly clear she loves me, but she is done. I know what I have to do, I want to better my self for me. I haven’t smoked for 2 weeks and I’m having all this clarity on what I did in the relationship. All the wrongs, all the things I could of done to stop it ending. It sucks but there isn’t anything I can do about it. My head is in the now, but my heart is in the past(corny I know). Now I’m sitting here at my mothers house. Trying to think of all the things I will do on my own, but I just can’t see it. I want to succeed on my own, I want to find my self and find love again. I want what I lost, but I don’t want it if I’m just going to throw it away again.  I can’t see what I’m aiming for, but I’m aiming for something. I have no idea where to start, how do I find my self again? I guess that the question I came here with, after all that lol. How do I do it?",22Sep2017,1
114,"19/Female/Bipolar, Asperger's, and PTSD from abuse

I used to only have hallucinations after sleep, just after waking up. I always see something scary such as a guy with a chainsaw threatening me, a spider the size of a horse, an aggressive dog growling at me are my most common visual hallucinations. They were never verbal unless it was chainsaw guy or the dog growling.

Anyway, last night I experienced an absolutely terrifying hallucination *before* sleep. Worse than ever before. This one was both tactile and verbal. So I was going to sleep and I heard a voice say, ""I'm right here, don't ignore me!"" And I began screaming as the voice began threatening me, saying he would rape me and stab me. Then I felt the blankets be pulled off of me and I felt myself being pushed onto the floor and I rolled off my bed. I continued screaming and yelling throughout this. I ran over to my light and turned it on to an empty room. 

I have security cameras and checked them and didn't see anyone break in. I also have a dog that barks whenever someone is on the property, and he was silent. I know this was purely a very realistic hallucination. I eventually fell back asleep and awoke to more threats. This time instead of only screaming I began crying too. He said he was holding a knife above me and if I moved, he'd stab me. This continued throughout the night and I barely got any sleep.

Now it's 3am tonight and I'm terrified to sleep. I'm worried I'll get the same scary hallucinations as I got yesterday. I know the hallucinations aren't real but they are terrifying. It scared me to no end and each time I close my eyes I just begin to cry and shake and quickly reach for my lamp. 

I need advice on how to sleep because I'm so scared right now. This guy is more scary than chainsaw guy since I felt myself being physically attacked. Plus, with chainsaw guy, I was always able to defeat that hallucination by getting up and beating the shit out of him and choking him to death. That hallucination would occur in the morning so I'd have no trouble seeing chainsaw guy. This new guy, knife guy, I can't see and it's always dark when it happens in my room. So I feel like I can't defend myself. 

I'm at a loss here. I have work tomorrow so I can't afford to lose sleep. Please help me.",22Sep2017,1

When he asked me to help him with electronic, and I did it while pointing at the screen so he could remember it better for thr next time, he called me smartass who was so cocky and disrespectful because he was offended by the way i helped him, saying it was how you taught a kindergarten kid, not a grown up. He forced me to drop out of the college i went to after halfway through because he didn't like it, and then I had to start college all over again based on what he liked, then he was angry at me for not graduating alongside my high school friend and called me stupid and that's why i couldn't graduate. (I graduated from HS in 2012, then drop out of first college in 2014 to start over so when my friends graduated in 2016, i was still halfway through my study). then he accused me for losing my gold necklace and was so angry about it, then a few days later I found my necklace on a box of unused stuffs he put on garage.  today i accidentally send money to our family member, roughly worth $50 in us dollars twice because i was confused with the atm system of that bank and even after i convince the family member of ours to send back the accidental $50 transfer, my dad was so furious he told me that i am not allowed to eat for five days because 5 days meals equal $50 and when i tried to give him $500 from my paycheck, he refused to take it and called me retarded coz i don't understand technology. one time i scratched our car and then he forbid me from driving us coz he said i couldn't drive and even if i did drive, i am a very slow driver -- then he whined to literally everyone that i am a lazy person who didn't want to drive on my own.

I can't take it anymore. He always yelling on how I lost my focus and always so depressed while he is actually the reason why. But if I told him that, he'd be so mad at me and won't admit it 'coz he is great in parenting' and what should I do to cope?",22Sep2017,1

122,"Okay, so I'm in Highschool and I joined the IB program this year even though I'm not a freshmen. So I've always realized that I read slower than most other people and I absolutely despise reading! I hate it! I like what is said in the novel or text or whatever most the time but I hate the actual process of reading. I also started to realize a couple years ago that sometimes I take words from what part of the area I'm reading in and replace it with a word that is right there. Unconsciously of course. Sometimes I can read a word over and over like ""Can..."" only to realize that it's actually ""Can't..."" after like the 5th time of reading it. Plus I constantly lose what line I'm on. My dad has dyslexia so there's definitely the genetic chance. Idk! What do you think?

So right now I'm kinda torn on this thing that's been bugging me for a while now. In my school, currently we are in production of a fall play. Now I have to say that I'm enjoying myself up on stage (this is my first play EVER). 

Now the problem is that once the fall play is over, auditions for the spring musical come up like literally in less than two weeks and then production for that begins. So it's kinda back to back in a sense.

But the thing is: I need money for insurance for my car and gas money cuz i drive. So I don't know if I should skip the musical (this will be my first musical too) and get a job, or I should do the musical but have a much harder time getting a job.
Some things to key in before you answer:

I'm socially new with these kids in the drama club, so I only know them for about a month. I'm slowly breaking the ice, one day at a time. But I don't know if they will kinda forget me or not wanna talk to me if I don't do the musical. Also I have choir with these kids as well so I see them in that class too.

130,"So I'm a 27 f sharing an apartment. I just moved in September 1st without too much scrutiny because I needed to get out of where I was.

Two weeks later, my roommate got fired. A week has gone by and she hasn't job hunted as far as I know.

 The place is a dump. I had to spend hours cleaning before I could use my bathroom. Its also far from my work. 

Rent is 475 plus utilities so I just paid her 600 to cover them in the beginning of September, but she still hasn't shown me a copy of the bills.

I have a goal to move out of state and I thought she shared that goal but I don't see how that's possible with her not even trying to find work. Maybe she has family supporting her, or lots of savings, I don't know. I'm just fearing a worst case scenario where she can't pay the rent. What would happen or what should I do if that's the case? I can pay it but I REALLY don't want to and I'd lose a lot of respect for her. I feel like a good roommate would never put me through this.

I've found other rooms online for less money and closer to work now. I am thinking about moving out and finding someone to take over my lease. I really wanted this to work out because we share interests and are both laid back but her cleanliness is not up to my standards so I haven't even wanted to use the kitchen yet, where it seems there is a nest of fruit flies. 

Should I give her time to find a job? Should I start looking for an exit now and showing people my room/bathroom? Should I tell my roommate my reason is because the commute is just too much because I don't want to hurt her feelings.

133,"I've been in a relationship for what's going on 4 years. We're slated to get married next year, but over the past year my depression has been getting the better of me. I've had about 2 nervous breakdowns and one serious contemplation of suicide (where I was about an hour away from doing it). 

But in that time, I've noticed myself growing more and more distant with my fiancée. I've noticed my attraction to them has gone down, my interest in being around them is nearly 0, and I just generally don't like being touched by them. I know depression makes you feel that way about people who are close to you. It makes you want to pull away and be distant. But, how do you know if the way you're feeling is actually how you feel or if it's just depression getting the better of you?

Now, my fiancée and I before this would fight a bit, and argue about stupid things a lot. And recently since being open with them about this stuff (to an extent) they've been better at not causing as many fights, but I still feel like walking on eggshells around them because I don't want anymore fights and I just am exhausted with it all. We agreed maybe couples counseling will help us, and we're planning on starting soon (we have an appointment), but for people who aren't even married yet, it just seems like this is a red flag. 

We do have some good days, where we both are enjoying each other, days when I wake up and don't feel like I wish I was dead, and THOSE days are good (for the most part), but they happen so seldom now. My family actually approached me and said they are concerned about me. They said they are not trying to blame my fiancée by any stretch, but they said since we've been dating they've been noticing changes in me and this year it reached its peak. 

So, how can I tell if the way I'm feeling is legitimate and that I should just end everything with my fiancée, or if it's my depression being terrible. I just don't want to make a decision, one way or the other, that I'll regret the rest of my life. ",22Sep2017,7
134,"A former friend (FF) of mine is stalking my apartment. How do I know this? Because said FF walks directly in front of it, and any time that FF sees me or my husband come home, FF speeds up in walking or outright runs away. Our apartment faces the street and sidewalk, too, so it's not like FF has to try hard to see our place or check up on what we're doing (or that we're still together, which is semi-important below).

This is the third time I've seen FF come by our place. The first two times, I just saw FF's back, so I wasn't as sure (still had that deep-down feeling of dread when you know it's someone but don't have proof), but I recently saw FF's face as FF strode right by.

Our friendship did not end well, not even remotely. FF tried to destroy my marriage and tried to control every aspect of my life, manipulating me and making me believe my husband was going to beat me to death (he wouldn't hurt a spider, and he HATES those).

This title surely is owned by *someone* right now, since it's possible to buy this game on STEAM.

136,"UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your responses and the time you took to look into my problem. Will certainly look into therapy but not at present as I am really enjoying my time away from it all physically, lots of responsibillities in my new home and work. Getting lots of stuff done so that helps. Brother is the same though looking durther into all his bank transactions done as he believes my mothers parents and sister are also involved in this. Again, thanks for your help. 

Hi people. Just needed multiple opinions and advice on this matter as it is too personal for anyone but my SO. 
A little Background:
I (24 / M) have been having problems with how my mother was always so attached to me and almost seemed to me selfish of her to think we should be doing everything as a family. I do mean EVERYTHING: Xmas, Easter , Holiday Vacations, birthdays, weddings etc. and if me or my brother could not attend these plans she would be devastated, she would do anything to make it happen and act all pushy towards us or our girlfriends. It always seemed natural to me 'cause that is how she raised us and having not been around other people's families it never really hit me. I have been in a relationship with my SO for around 2.5 years now and after her inputs on my mother's behavior I started seeing clearly that it was obscure. She was showing abnormal affection towards her children. My mother (55) is a wife of a Ship engineer (My father, now works for a maritime company as an office Superintendent) who has been providing for the family all that we ever needed. She is not working or ever had a job and she has mostly been the king of the house as far as cleaning, cooking, laundry etc. Me and my brother (30) always praised her for that and made her feel that it was important for us to have her. But she had cheated on my dad when I was 5 years old with a friend of his. When she told my dad we were going through a divorce face but after a while he accepted her back. And we lived happily ever after but I never really let it go, nor my brother. She has been so difficult for my girlfriend basically talking shit about her at my brother’s girlfriend who my mom thought felt the same resentment at the time. But the two ladies got to like each other eventually and started gossiping about my mother and the stuff she said to them. So they ware basically full on FUCK YOU towards her but not in an open way, she had no clue they knew.
  My Brother is also a ship engineer like my dad and the past 5 years has been making good amounts of money though through a very painful occupation where he has to be away on a ship with so many dangers lurking in every step so to be fair he is giving his life for it. I have been economically independent for 3 years now ever since I got to work as an IT Systems Administrator for the company my father works at. And since August I started living by myself at an apartment I rented. My SO did not want to see or talk to my mother so it was awkward for me and I couldn't blame her. My mom is a bitch.
 While my brother is away working, all his funds are controlled by my mother. She is basically his accountant. 
But, while he was here the past months he noticed that his salary account wasn't getting the money it was supposed to. So he decided to do a little background check, only to find out that sweet mommy has gambled 100K Euros at casinos since 2014 until today. 
My brother told me all this and we decided to confront her and my dad (we thought he was in it)
My dad who was not aware of it offered to sell his other home and give my brother his money back but my brother decided to just give him full rights to that property instead. During this conversation my mother was still feeling betrayed and misspoken by her children. We told her we don’t want to see her again.  And it was a good way to say FUCK YOU MOM for all the times she disrespected my SO. 
My brother has been devastated not for the money but the fact that she has been lying to us all this time yet being perfectly able to try and manipulate us into giving her that ""happy family"" feeling. I am the same.

Basically, I have been taking care of my dad for a while. He falls a lot, dementia, alcoholic. He is a big ol boy and requires my help when he falls, and he also needs my help for other things. I love him very much and with his habits and such, no way to tell when he will be gone. As much as I try to help him, he will not help himself and I have put my life on waaaaaaaay hold to help him. (I have another brother who stays here that helps but he is not up to any sort of help he needs and frankly he just pisses everyone off and bitches about everything.) Now, the dilemma:

I have been offered a space to live at basically free (I mean, looking at Cali or Seattle prices that is) to live. The room is huge and it would be with good friends in an area that's way better than here. I wouldn't have to deal with the stress of my dads shit, nor my brothers either.

What I want to ask is, should I do this? 

My mental health is dying in a nasty pit here but I am helping my dad and putting my life on hold at the same time. I cry too often, but I am helping my dad. I haven't even been out since my birthday last month. I told him about the possibility last night and he for once gave me a sincere reply of ""well, I sure do love you being here."" And sincerity is something he doesn't do.

I am having a big ol think over this, but I am split and would really love to hear some views. Thank you. ",22Sep2017,8

140,"Years ago I was depressed. I lost all my close friends and was literally completely friendless for two years. It took that long to finally build up the courage to go out and start meeting people again. By finally going out and doing things, I happened to bump into someone two and half months ago, who I quickly became friends with. More than that, SHE reached out to me to become friends after our first meeting. It was a complete shock and gave me courage to help fuel me into meeting other people. 


Now we hang out every week, and at least on a friend level we've grown fairly close. More than that, unbeknownst to her, she kind of ""saved"" my life. Instead of spending all my time alone in my apartment, I actually go out and do things. Meet people, and make plans, like a human again. In a short two and a half months, life is now 180 degrees different than it was before I met her. Before her, zero friends. Now, three.


But ever since I first started spending time with her, I've definitely liked her as more than a friend. I never acted on it, because one, I've always suffered from low self-esteem. Two, I genuinely liked her, and was scared of the idea of losing her completely by making it awkward. I mean she was literally the only friend I had in years.


I've never handled feelings well. I can easily catch feelings for people, and then feel hurt and jealous when they start showing interest in other people. I have no idea where I stand with her. We got close very quickly in my eyes. So much so, that even some of her other friends made comments about it. But it took a month before we ever even spent time alone together. She always invites many people to do anything so we were never alone. Not exactly what I wanted but I was happy just to feel connected to someone.


But over the past weekend she happened to meet someone, and in the last 6 days she has already hung out with him 3 times. On their second meeting I was there, and in front of me, she's made plans with him for weeks in the future, and playfully demanding he change his plans so they could spend more time together. 

Just now, I was invited to join them for dinner before they see a show together tonight. I have no idea what they are seeing and was never invited. There is a good chance I might never have been invited to dinner if I hadn't texted her first.


The jealousy is raging. I can't help but feel hurt and rejected. I also have a serious dislike for this new person and I think when I met him it seeped through with some abrasive comments. He's done nothing wrong. She's done nothing wrong. Yet every part of me wants to just run and hide. To start avoiding her as much as possible so I don't have to deal with the pain. This is what I've done in the past. I can't afford to lose her as a friend. But it hurts seeing her and this new person get close so quickly.

142,"Hi everyone!

I need some advice for a quite ""gross"" problem..so thanks in advance, I just don't dare to talk about it ""IRL""!
I'm studying at the University (in France) to become a philosophy teacher, and I'm currently in my last year. So I mostly have to follow pedagogy courses, but next week I'll have to follow a workshop called ""theater/relaxation"", revolving around technics allowing us to teach with ease before a class full of teenagers :)
The problem is that I have a quite severe..well..bladder issue. And because of the current lack of appropriate medication, I have to wear ""diapers"". And not the discreet ones, because of the severity of the problem (to say it dully, I have very sudden ""urgencies"", leaving me 1min max. to rush to the bathroom before the disaster).
It's a daily challenge on the emotional side, but I usually manage to hide it effectively by wearing long shirts and jeans covering the noise, etc. But for this workshop, we're asked to wear loose clothing, jogging pants, etc. And I think we'll have to make moves leading to some difficulties for me to keep my condition hidden! In addition to all that, the workshop's teacher doesn't really like me ; so I don't feel comfortable at the idea of confessing to her before the course...
I really don't want my problem to be discovered, it's a huge source of embarrassment for me :/ We'll be +/- 20 students next week, and amongst them there are some friends that aren't aware of my situation.
I feel helpless, really..any advice to manage that, at least on the psychological side? A huge thanks in advance for your comments; and sorry for the ""whiny"" tone, I just can't bear this fear anymore",22Sep2017,4
143,"Hello Reddit,

Normally I would bounce this problem off of my friends, but it seems they are the very problem I currently face. Hence you are my only hope….(jk, kinda)

My wife and I have been friends with a particular group of people for a few years now. There are 8 of us in total, 4 couples all about 30ish years of age. We used to do lots of things together, go on vacations, hang out at each other's houses, go to dinner, etc. Four of them are cousins and their spouses, and the other couple are best friends with them. Then there is my wife and I. Translation: we are the outsiders.  

However, I recently found out that they have been intentionally excluding us from the groups activities for the better part of 5 months. The de facto leader of the group told via text message last night that they are going down the shore without us this weekend, and that we weren't invited. She also went on to tell us us that they have been doing this for a while. What’s more is the lot of them have lied to us about it all summer. We would see them all together at a winery, or at an amusement park via social media, and when confronted about it we would get excuses from them like “oh we forgot to invite you” or “we thought you were on vacation.""

It has been told to us in no short order that I am the one who is causing this exile. I have an anger problem with also a smattering of PTSD from serving in the Army for 6 years. As such, I get emotional from time to time. There have been a few big arguments with my wife that happened in front of the group, and apparently that makes people uncomfortable. This situation has been remedied. The wife and I have been going to counseling for the past two months, and we are happy. I have also broken down and cried a few times because of events that happened in my life in front of them stupidly thinking that I would get support from them. (one time I got a phone call from the vet that my cat was going to have to be put down because he had cancer. This happened while we were all hanging out at my house for New Years Eve 2016. And instead of offering me condolences or anything everybody with the exception of one guy ignored me.) I also have been seeing a professional about my anger and other emotional issues for years. This however has caused them to feel that I will burst into tears at any moment, for any reason.

As if that weren’t enough, I also apparently have a personality that grates on people in the group, it has been reported to us that I make crude jokes and comments, and it has offended some of the women. However, the other 4 men do the exact same thing. In fact, most times they say and do things much worse. However, hen they do it, everyone laughs; when I do it, I’m the asshole.

Hence my need for advice. The wife wants to extend an olive branch, and essentially apologize to them for our (my) behavior, and get back in their good graces, while making no mention of the fact that they have lied to us for 5 months, and no one had the spine (until last night) to address this problem with me directly. She wants to continue to be friends with them. The reason being is these are her only friends. If we were to cut them out, she would have no one except for me.

 I, on the other hand would prefer to just cut them out of my life. They clearly don't want me (us) around, and at least from my POV, they would just rather exclude us instead of coming to us like good friends would, and air their grievances with us (me) so it can be rectified. Apologies if this was a little hard to follow, my blood is still boiling about the whole thing, and I am having trouble thinking clearly.

Wherever there's a family pool party with my husbands family, I hang out with the women outside of the pool- but they hang outside the pool because they're body conscious not because they can't swim. I'm afraid that if I try to utilize what I've learned in swim lessons in front of them, it'll be obvious I'm a barely-able swimmer.

How does one get over a fear of water (therapy isn't an option because 1. It's expensive 2. I haven't found a therapist who can address this)? Is it obvious to swimmers when a person can't swim well or is new to swimming?",22Sep2017,1
146,"This is a 46 year old woman I (21, M) saw on tinder who had her snap in her profile. So I added her about a week ago and I chatted and told her I'm from tinder and that I thought she was cute and thought I'd snap her, and she didn't have a problem with it. So this morning I was in bed and received a video from snapchat of a woman masturbating. Well in the heat of the moment I sent back nudes (2 to be exact)  These nudes had no face or distinguishing features, and couldn't be identified by the picture alone. Well after we were done, I started to feel guilty and bad and now my mind jumped to the worse case scenario of her saving the snaps or being ble to somehow recover the snaps and I'm getting very paranoid, even if I know she didn't take any screenshots. It's safe to say that I think I'm going to delete tinder and never sext again after this realization.

150,"So, I'm a junior in NYC right now and I've constantly been told that this is the most important year of my highschool career. The one every college will look at when they consider accepting me, and this worries me. A lot. 

I've always been doing well in school, heck, I'm doing pretty well now. I don't think I have much to worry about...

But recently, I dropped out of 2 Honors classes. The reasons why: Trigonometry and mathematics in general are something I've never been particularly good at, and I feel I'm better off passing a mainstream class than getting a lower grade in a much more difficult class and Physics, well...I don't think I've ever had a teacher that doesn't seem to even be able to do her job. Zero class room control or lesson consistency and very little to nothing learned in the two weeks, and she's already pushing tests on us on things we didn't even know. So, I left, and I still have two AP classes left which I hope is enough to look good for college...

Sad thing is, this scares me. What'll they say when they see it? What'll they think of me? Will I be able to get into a good school?

If anyone has any general advice for getting into a good college, and later finding myself a good career path, that'd be really helpful. I need something to help clear my head about it. Just worries me, a lot.",22Sep2017,1
152,"Firstly, a bit of context.

I have been dating this girl for over 2 years. About a year ago, we moved in together. Throughout this whole time she has suffered from serious depression. When we first started dating she was on antidepressants, but stopped taking these after a while because she hated them.

Since we moved in together life has been extrememly difficult. I work full time with a lot of unpaid overtime due to the nature of my job, while she has bounced from casual job to casual job never working more than 30 hours in a week. Even being jobless for a couple months at a time. She's always paid her rent, but more often than not I pay the bills and buy the food. I am also in the process if building my own house and paying that off.

I am also doing 90% of household tasks. I cook most meals, do most of the cleaning and washing of clothes. She does sometimes assist, but I mostly end up doing it by myself.

Her depression has got worse since she stopped taking the antidepressants, but nothing I could do would get her to take them again. Recently it has gotten a lot worse. Almost every night I'm up until 2 or 3am with her crying, usually I start work at 5 the next morning. Sometimes she gets out of bed and tells me she's going to kill herself. I try to take her to the hospital but she fights me until I can talk her down and she goes to sleep. I try to help but she won't let me, and she won't help herself no matter what I do. 

It's gotten to the stage where I don't want to be in this relationship anymore. My constant lack of sleep and frustration has pushed me towards depression which I have fought to stay ahead of my entire life. But mostly I just wish I could be out. She relies on me for everything, her mum kicked her out a year and a half ago, and her dad kicked her out for not cleaning his house for him shortly after. She has since gained a much better relationship with her dad.

I have this huge feeling that if I leave she will try to kill herself and that is one of the reasons why I'm still here.

I really need advice on this, because it's tearing me apart. I love her so much, but after trying for two years and nothing changing, my mental health is diminishing by continuing this.",22Sep2017,1

166,"Hello Reddit,

A bit of personal information for refrence: I'm a 20 year old, Dutch guy who is about to quit university for the third time in three consecutive years. I have an IQ of 140, but despite that I can't seem to complete a year of univerity, mostly because I am not motivated at all to work for it.

I've talked to multiple career/study counselors and a psychologist about this, and the general answer I've gotten recently is that I shouldn't try to make university work for me if I have no interest in it. Instead, I should do something I have a passion for, and what I know I will be able to do for a longer time without getting bored of it.

Now, I am decently skilled in the online game League of Legends, and I am willing to put loads of time and practice in so I eventually could play this professionally. My parents are almost a full 100% against me doing this and will not support me if I decide to follow that path. So if I, and I am very likely to, chose to go through with this, I will need to live on my own.

In the past two years I have worked quite much after I quit my other two studies, and thus I have a nice little buffer to get things started. I will still need some kind of reliable income though.

For housing:

I could stay enlisted at my university, so I can get a room from an organisation until I fail this year, since I will not be passing any exams. I would have to move out around July.

I also can try to find an appartment on my own, but that will probably be more expensive, althoug I would get some of my money back from the university. Still, it would be more beneficial to stay enlisted.

For work:

I can not go back to work where I used to work, as they have hired new people, and I really do not wish to go back to that repetitive job.

Finding a new job that doesn't take up most of my time (since I need most of it practicing and learning to up my game) is not going to be easy for me, since I do not have the best social skills, and I dont know where I am going to live yet.

I know it is going to be hard, but this is something I am willing to work for. I hope some of you who might have been in similar situations can give me advice.

I thank you all for reading this, and wish you the best of luck in your lives!",22Sep2017,3
169,"I [20F] have been living with this weight on my shoulders since I was 8. My stepfather took me into his room and just laid on top of me. I didn't know what was happening, didn't know it was even sexual, but it always bothered me and I knew it was wrong. Even so, I never told anyone about it and although I seemed to always have flashbacks and remember that instance when doing everyday stuff I never counted it as being molested because in my head nothing really happened. 

So, a couple of days ago my older sisters and my boyfriends were talking about how much different the two younger girls were ( me and my sister f22) than the older ones and if anything had happened to cause our withdrawnness and everything. They related an instance where my sister [f22] told my mother our stepfather had laid on top of her and the frustration my sisters felt when they found out our mother did nothing about it. They hadn't known until my stepfather left my mother and my mother waited to tell them out of fear of what my sisters would do. They were horrified to find out that it happened to me too.

This has really thrown a wrench in my entire life. My fears and what I previously could shrug off as something I made up in my head actually happened. Its making it even worse that I had to leave college and Im back in my childhood room and every memory I have reminds me of him. I haven't been able to sleep because my chest feels so heavy and my heart and mind races and I feel like I'm psyching myself out for a panic attack, but I can't clear these thoughts from my head.

How do I talk to my mother and my sister about what happened? I've been trying to decide if its even necessary because my mothers the type to just say ""oh well, whats done is done"" and if she didn't do anything when my sister when he was still in the house I don't know if she'll do anything to console me or assist now that its years after the fact. My sister doesn't know that it happened to me too and I don't know if I want to bring that up...i'm terribly sensitive and she's quite the opposite and always sports a idgaf attitude, so she'll probably hate me for bringing it up and dismiss me.

174,"I got an infected tooth out on the first week of August. While I was there the dentist said I'd need another one out which I figured because it's pretty messed up and broken from grinding my teeth in my sleep. I was planning on doing it this month as the dentists rotate three days (mine works Thurs fri and sat) and after September they switch so I would have to do it on the first three days of the week. I can't do it then because I would have to take a couple days off to get it done.

Now here's the problem. I work in a two-person team as a valet in a busy dealership and my partner took two weeks off leaving me working last weekend and next weekend. Now that wouldn't be a problem as I could still do it next weekend right! Still time! But no. I recently found out that they are doing a service clinic at work next weekend (dumb free thing where everyone has to show up for work whether they're scheduled or not). Now I can't get it done this month. Which means I can't get it done until next year and I don't know when my insurance year ends and I still need to get lots of other dental shit done so I'd like to be able to get it done this insurance year. So I was thinking of just getting it done on the Friday before the clinic and not going in using my tooth as an excuse. 

Then again I don't think I actually have the balls to do that and if I don't go soon I have some more bad stuff going to come up (I chipped another tooth since I last went) and again if I don't go soon I probably won't go again until something major goes wrong again (like the infected tooth). Part of me also figures I'll be dead in less than 3 years anyways so why bother going to the dentist anyways.

177,"I’m 19M and a sophomore in college. and my parents (specifically my dad) has a curfew for me at 2:00am.  The reason for me wanting to stay out a little bit later is because i never go out past 12am except for Saturday’s because I’m at a party. Matter of fact I don’t even go out EXCEPT for Saturday’s or sometimes Friday. Also I always have to ask for permission to go somewhere. Honestly I don’t mind disclosing my outings with my dad, but sometimes it’s unnerving because it almost turns into an interrogation. “Where are you going” “how long are you staying out” “who are you going with” etc. For example 2 days of the week my classes begin at 5:30pm and both of my parents work so I’m at home by myself during the day. If I don’t feel like eating leftovers I would go and get some sushi which is less than ten minutes away. Yet I get my ass chewed out by my dad for not telling him where I went.

The most recurring job offering was for a clinical/medical social worker. I've done a bit of research further into the position, and it talks about working in hospitals for experience, and more things related to being knowledgeable about the human body and illnesses, etc.

I could see myself gaining and understanding around physiology and mental health, but I've always been bad at science. I've never once considered being a doctor. I know the social work program involves taking science classes and labs, and I can deal with that, but I've always struggled with science.

I get anxious, depressed, feel alone, pressure builds up and I can't do anything about it. Thing is this doesn't last long, at most it's the rest of the day, usually it's a couple of hours and it doesn't happen very regularly, this is not a daily struggle on my part. But I do need something to do to relieve this temporary pressure. I have tried gaming, but it is very unproductive and has a habit of not going well with depression, it's like drinking tbh: Easy to go overboard. I was thinking about doing sports, or something that is productive, won't go overboard in the opposite direction, and keeps me busy during these phases so I can move on, do what I have to do, and become productive instead of, well, borderline suicidal (I joke).

188,"Ok, quick background. I am 23 with a 15 (almost 16) year old brother and 7 year old sister. I have been the main financial provider for us, my grandmother (67), and my mother (41), on-and-off for the past 7 years. All three of us siblings have been raised by my grandma, as my mom has never had that ""mom gene"" that signals a parent to take care of their children in a real and meaningful way. She never abused us, it was the kind of situation where it was very clear she cared more about herself and her comfort than her children's. I either lived with both my mom and grandma, or just my grandma.

While I was still in highschool (and duel enrolled in community college so my financial aid could pay our bills), my mom decided to quit her job to become an EMT. Only problem is she has a bulging disk in her lumbar region and can't handle the workload. Ever since she quit, she's worked at only 2 places, a vitamin factory and then a Circle K 2 years after quitting that. She's been living off of my money, federal assistance, and my grandma's social security check.

My grandma's health has been going south for the last few years and is now mostly incontinent, has very little strength, her memory is going, had a bilateral mastectomy, and has developed Macular Degeneration so blindness is in her future. Basically, she needs to be taken care of and relieved of stress like cleaning and raising 2 children, for example.

After a lot of contemplation and talks with my family, I decided to move out for sure as a way to light a fire under my mom, so to speak, force her to get off her ass and start providing for her family. It didn't work. Now my family is struggling to pay any bills, provide clothing/school supplies, or even enough to eat properly.

My move put me into a place where I make less money overall, but because I was supposed to stop paying my family's bills, it should have been fine. However, I can't possibly sit by and watch their situations get worse and worse. My siblings are very bright and have a big future ahead of them, and I need to make sure they don't get swept under the rug due to their not-so-great circumstances. My grandmother is the most important person in the world to me, and I can't bear to watch her suffer anymore.

I just....am at a loss. I want to just take them all and move them to my city, but I don't want to keep enabling my mother. She used to work for EchoStar, the uplink side of Dish Network, and I know she could get a job if she just asked.

But, she holds her convictions that the decision was a good one, and not actually the cause of most of the struggles we have faced in the past 6 years since she quit. Which it most definitely is.

I've finally asked this girl out last weekend, Saturday afternoon, September 16; She had to admit, that when I asked her out, She really likes me, since the soiree before college begin's on classes start on Monday and facebook stalk me when we first met (she's genuinely an honest person), however she still has feelings for this other guy who she hasn't gotten over and it's been well a year that she hasn't gone out with anyone else, as she said: ""I don't wanna hurt your feelings with him being on my mind when we do go out""
My question now... what can I do at this point?
we still talk and see each other,especially in the school campus, other than the fact I've asked her out and gotten the rejection (I guess?) should I continue being myself towards her and pretend that it never happened? (first post of mine btw!)",22Sep2017,1

194,"Hello guys,

I just don't know what to do. It all started 3/4 years ago, when I started to chat with a girl in my class (I thought chatting was a good idea because of my stutter). At first I just had a crush but after a time I slowly fell in love(?) with her. I had all those years little to none face to face contact, although she was every day just some meters away.

Before our class split up, I told her personally, that I like her very much and she responded that we could sit in the next class(es) together, if we would have the same ones, and that we can be friends.

We got the same classes and are sitting in the same row (not together because of her friends). Every time I interact with her I get really sad because I know that we will never be together and that she just feels pity for me. It always destroys.  
What should I do?

199,"I am a 22 yr old female who hasn't really been in a relationship i consider real. I don't think that in my life so far I have had a real relationship with someone to the extent that at we mutually feel a connection that is both strong and genuine. I have been in 2 relationships one in gr.8 and one in gr 10 high school.

My first relationship was 'mutual' but it wasn't based off of a connection but rather looks. I found him very attractive and I think he found me attractive as well since he had asked me for my email at the time and we would talk on msn. 

The second relationship I entered simply because I wanted the sense of being in a relationship and didn't want to loose that type of attention from someone. I didn't find him particularly physically attractive or personality-wise there wasn't much of an attraction. But I decided to play along and pretend it was something real. As it went on, he felt that I wasn't really the type of person he liked and started to become more distanced and I hated the feeling of losing someone. Even if it wasn't someone I truly liked and I continued to pretend that it was something real, especially to him (so maybe it could guilt him into staying with me a little longer). But he wasn't dumb, in a way he was socially smarter than me and kept me at bay to still have someone to hook up with even tho we didn't really talk too much anymore and the 'connection' from before was very severed. 

After those two 'officially titled' relationships I've had a few 'hookup friends with benefit' guys and somewhat 'relationships' that I don't consider as an actual relationship.(Since they were messy and usually one-sided usually starting from a hook up)

Up until now (being 22 and turning 23 soon) I don't feel like I have had a real relationship with someone. I do not know if it is because I am just not as mature for my age or what? I have not truly had a relationship built on personal connection rather than looks and 'hookups' nor have I ever LIKED someone. (Given that crushes don't count since most of the time they are just crushes and don't go further from there... since either once I got to know that person I didn't like them or I was too shy to start a connection). 

Is it normal that I am now 22 and still never truly liked someone??",22Sep2017,1

210,"Hey Reddit, I've been pondering a post like this for years because I haven't known what to do to even secure a future for myself and no one around me seems to have any idea either.

 We are all stuck in a rut in this small tourist town where all the jobs are food service and hospitality... yet I dream of an office job, filling out forms and spreadsheets, I love being told what to, I love helping.

I've lived here all my working life, since 14, and haven't saved a penny. Me and my girlfriend share a loan on a new car and when I turned 18 I got myself in to about $2000 of credit card debt that I am still paying off. 

Throughout the entire time, any money that could be saved or spent towards paying off debt, has gone to marijuana. I've tried and tried to get myself off of it but I have such a hard time dealing with the melancholy town we live in, where there is absolutely nothing to do but sit inside and the most you can make here is $15/hr being a head chef.

Me and a lot of others in this town have smoked our days, years and money away with no light ahead, but I want to get out. My first step is quitting marijuana, but I've been trying since 15 and every attempt has been utter failure.. Any tips would be appreciated.

We do have a small college in town, but I have no idea what I could go for, nor could I afford it with my monthly debt bills. I am at a loss on how to progress.

Every day I think, ""Tomorrow will be the day I quit smoking and get my shit together!."" and at night I get all anxious about stopping, worrying about the future and never having money and cry myself to sleep if I'm lucky.

So, really, the point is;

How can I quit marijuana if it has such a tight hold on me psychologically? I wouldn't know how to approach my doctor or anything.

How should I narrow down my dream of an ""office job"" and start working towards it? I am very very proficient at using computers and typing and basic office tasks, but my only work experience is cooking. There are NO office jobs in my vicinity.

And lastly, how can I start saving to ensure a secure and happy future for my girlfriend and myself? We have no savings and no investments in to anything ahead.

I apologize for the jumble of paragraphs, these are all thoughts and questions I've had in my head that I've wanted to get out for years but have never been brave enough to put or ask them anywhere, but I'm SO tired of sitting at my computer, playing games and wondering what could be all day long, smoking literally all my money away.

212,"This question has been on my mind for a year now... I'm studying journalism at my local university, but I just dislike it so much... I have no passion for it, 90% of the lectures are incredibly dull and I just want to be elsewhere all the time I'm there. I'm at the start of my second year now, and I feel like I gained absolutely nothing from the first year. It doesn't help that more than half the people on our course have left, there's only 10 of us remaining now and most of those are people I don't talk to whatsoever.

The only thing that's giving me happiness right now is the fact that I'm taking a free standing 2 month film course in a Swedish university based in Stockholm. And there I finally feel the passion that I feel like I should have when studying in an university. I'm hugely into filmmaking and that's what I want to do in the future and this course just encourages creativity, the lecturer is passionate about the subject, the tasks are interesting and offer a challenge.

I just don't see that I'll gain anything from the Journalism course, I'll have to sit there in boredom and misery for nearly 2 more years and I won't be a single step closer to my dream job of being a writer/director/actor for feature films/tv series. I went into Journalism hoping that I could refine my writing skills and maybe work with some equipment like cameras, microphones etc and get some experience in front of the camera too. And although there has been a little of that, it's very few and far between, a lot more time is devoted to things like politics and newspapers, which are things I couldn't care less about...

The only reason I haven't quit already is because everyone around me is constantly warning me that it's difficult to get anything done without a Bachelor's degree and if I quit I better find a new course quickly. But that puts a lot of pressure on me because what if I won't get accepted into a film course right away? I don't want to end up working a low end job for 2 years while I desperately look for a course either...

But would a Bachelor's degree in Journalism really open a significant amount of doors for me? I feel like my parents and the others around me are severely overestimating that paper's importance, especially considering that I want to work in the entertainment field.

220,"Hello there,
I am 19 years old and just finished the 2nd semester at university.

I study Computer Science and I really enjoy this field, but I absolutely hate this university, the city and the people there. Maybe to a large extend because I am horrible at making new friends and therefore I was basically completely alone for a year now.
I spoke to exactly four other people during this year and would easily go weeks without speeking to another person at all. 

While I did very will during the first semster, my lack of motivation caused my grades to drop during the second (I only passed one class out of four).

Now I am wondering if should switch universities. 
I could go to another one near my hometown, where some of my old friends from highschool are which maybe would it make easer to find at least some friends are. 
It would also cost a lot less money, as I could move back in with my parents (right now I just feel horrible spending all this money on something I hate this much).

But if I would do so, i would have to wait one year until I could start over at the new school and I also couldn't ""carry over"" most of my successfull lectures from the previous university.
This means I would be twenty when starting over again, which seems very late, as today there seems to be the expectation that you sould have a PhD with 20 at the latest (I most likely  couldn't do this even if I stayed at my current school).

Should I switch, make some money for a year and start over again, or would it be better to just stay at my current school, hate myself for two more years but save some valuable time.

Last night (Thursday, September 22, 2017) she sent me a pic of her ass (panties on). We went back and forth. She asked me for a picture, so I sent a pic of my boxers with a super hard dick beneath. She got horny and curious, and said it was hot. I asked her if she wanted to see what's underneath. She said yes.

So I sent her a dick pic. I then asked her for a pussy pic. She replied ""Ok. Nice baby"" and sent a pussy pic (in which she was masturbating BTW). I then replied ""I can't wait to make you cum... [eye heart emoji] [kiss emoji]"". A few minutes later, since I saw no response from her, I basically said, ""Gn, I'll see you Saturday"".

Woke up this morning early, worked, came home at 1200, and texted ""Hey baby, whatcha doin rn?"" No response for 20 minutes. I then started backpedaling ""Sorry, have I been too forward again? Sorry XD"". 3 hours later, still with no response, I go ""Ok, did I go too far with the 'make you cum' comment? Or are you just busy lol? I hope I haven't made you uncomfortable with any of this lol.""

What really sent me over was hurricane Harvey which kept me at home for 2 weeks, I broke my routine and got used to not facing my fears everyday.

229,"Hi, I’m a 25 year old guy and I’ve been noticing some change in my mind state/ways of thinking in the last year or 2. 

I’ve always been shy by nature but during my childhood/teenage years I didn’t feel I had any social anxiety with the familiar people like friends or family, only people I didn’t know. With friends and family I would be perfectly normal and outgoing, having a laugh, joking around, going to parties, all the normal stuff.

Now though I seem to be reclusive, more and more I’m preferring to chill on my own than hang out with other people. I do see my friends and family fairly often but I’m not as outgoing with them as I used to be. I find myself after socialising for a few hours wanting to leave, go home and hang out by myself. seemingly uncomfortable in social situations. I notice myself to trying to keep responses and conversations fairly short, seemingly trying to contribute as little as possible so as to end the conversation and go back to a state of quiet. 

It’s almost as though I put on a quiet face on a near permanent basis, so people think this is the normal me and don’t really question it, rather than being happy and jokey like I used to when I feel that way, and then noticeably changing when I have an ‘I’d rather be by myself’ phase. 

When I am hanging out alone, much of the time I’m not happy, i don’t think I’d go as far as being depressed but it’s as though something is getting me down and I don’t know what it is. Really I don’t think I’ve been truly happy in years (since my lovey dovey relationship at 18).

Him and I are sexually active, and she knows and is okay with that, so it's not like she'd be worried we would have sex. 

I have a new job, and the idea was for me to pay for the trip myself with some of the money I earn, so it's not like I'm asking her to pay for it. 

The place I am looking for as my first choice for the trip is a safe island that my family spent a week on a few years ago, and it's really small (you can walk around the island in less than a day) and only 3.5 hours drive from home, and roughly half an hour from where my grandparents live, so we wouldn't just be in the middle of unfamiliar nowhere, either. 

My mom has also been letting me spend a few days at a time hanging out at friends' houses lately, so I don't think the amount of time away from home is a concern either (not to mention that I'd be going to live away from home in a dorm shortly after, anyway) 
I just want to know if there's any other reasons she could have as to why I shouldn't go. 

Edit: she already said she's okay with me traveling this summer. My primary concern is what she'd have to say about that traveling being with just my boyfriend and I. ",22Sep2017,2
237,"Long story short; we had a accident and I (21F) am currently a week late on my period. We are taking a test on Sunday just to be sure my body isn't late because I was sick last week.

Since than my boyfriend (25M) of three months has been acting kinda weird. He had some emotional difficulty the last two days so that's fair. But since the day this happened I am very willing to talk about it - I am not that scared; abortion is a set plan and to me it's more a annoyance than a actual issue. But whenever I bring it up because I am still kinda nervous he just shuts me off and starts a different topic. 

How do I starts this conversation and figure out what the actual problem is? I get that he is nervous but it's my body and I am doing fine at this point. I scared something else is going one and he will leave me....",22Sep2017,2
238,"If I come off as mean and demanding in this post, I'm so sorry. I really don't mean to be. 

So, my father, works at a family restaurant, which I worked at for two months. The pain I had went through working there, wasn't worth it. Since the majority of the customers were senior citizens, I would have to deal with a number of them, complaining about food temperature, senior discounts, the side dressings, and much more, that would fill this whole post. I wasn't even payed a penny, for what I worked. Yes, I was working there for experience, but the family knew they could get away with not paying me. And no, I don't hate seniors. It's just the type of people that would come there.

I specified that I would not be working there anymore.  They took it well. I had told them that, since school was starting, this was my main focus. Now, they have less than three employees, which leads them to begging me to come and work. I don't want to go there, honestly. They are forcing me however, when they are clearly aware that I have an enormous amount of schoolwork. What should I do? ",22Sep2017,1
239,"hello guys,
I've been making music since 2013 but have gotten around to releasing only a couple tracks in the past 2 years. Lately, though, I've noticed (by googling it) that there are quite a few brands (even founded after I chose and used my name online...) using it.
There's this clothing brand, a drug brand, a lounge bar, a radio station and few others, a few of them are actually ""serious"" in terms of trademarking and stuff like that, one of them has even bought the .com handle.
Now I really need to choose if I have to change my name, to avoid branding issues in the future, (other than the embarassment of seeing sunglasses with my producer name branding carved on it, which makes me cringe) even though none of em are musicians/producers/djs.
It's pretty frustrating because I've been producing for years and I've been waiting for my productions to get to a decent level to be published and all and just lately I've found out about this ""branding problem"" which is holding me from releasing stuff.
If there are any managers, or people working in the industry that can help me with that I'd love to speak to someone (even in pvt) and get some advice for the best of my career, and I'd be so grateful, thank you!
p.s.: no, I'm thinking all day but I can't seem to find a nice name that I like, or has a meaning like my old one :/",22Sep2017,1
240,"Recently I've been a mix of negative and positive. I'm usually upset because my family is pretty toxic and they upset me a lot. At the same time, I have plans to move out in December and in December I will also be finding out if I get into my dream school or not. I'm also pretty positive when it comes to school and my goals, but here and there I have my bad negative moments/situations. (just like any normal young adult who's figuring out the ways of life TBH lol)

Anyway, since I just finished applying for my dream school and I'm stuck living with my parents till then, I posted on snapchat ""if i'm negative please just ignore me, i'm just waiting for acceptance letter so I can leave lol"" I was partially joking and it was not to be taken seriously. 

So my CLOSEST friend responded to it and said ""Yeah, I've noticed your negativity skyrocketed lately and I've been meaning to tell you that I don't like it."" And I just laughed it off and said ""Well there's nothing I can do about it."" But in reality I'm honestly offended. As a good friend you would think they would accept your negative and good moments, you know? I'm the kind of friend that likes to listen to my friends problems and give them advice or my intake. I also tell my friends my problems, but it's not like it's a very often occurrence. Plus, she knows that my family is really terrible to me so it's not like it's surprising if I tell her something that happened. 

Now my friend is telling me that she ""doesn't like"" how my ""negativity has skyrocketed."" I didn't know that I had to force my positivity for her so that she would ""like it"". Keep in mind, we've been friends for 5 years so it's not like this is a new friendship. I'm offended. What would you guys do? ",22Sep2017,1

242,"I'm a 20 year old male who currently works at a major hardware store. Ive outweighed the cons and pros at this job and honestly there aren't many pros. I was recently offered a contracting job making 4$ more than what I currently make and Fridays and Saturdays and sundays off. However when I get comfortable at a place of work, I get too comfortable and often fear leaving no matter how terrible I'm treated. Mainly because I can go to work and know exactly what I'm doing, and own the day.

My question is should I take this contract job or stay where I'm familiar with but unhappy with.
I'm also worried about losing my benefits ( I currently use NO benefits through the company) but its nice to have them there in case.
I'm no longer enjoying my hardware job because I'm expected way too much, and other employes get to cruise throughout the day, but I'm expected to do an unrealistic amount during the day alone, and get sort of reprimanded when I cannot complete my task, while the managers reprimand me but acknowledge I should have help? 


Current job:
Pros: I like driving the heavy machinery its interesting and a fun skill.
I like a few of the people I work with, and see a potential to make some good friends soon.
holiday parties and pay.
possible great benefits.
guaranteed 40 hours a week.
sick pay and vacation pay

cons: Very little help
too much expected out of 1 person
not paid for what you know but your tenure (means longer vets get paid more, and use this to just coast through work)
managers arent very praising but negative
coworkers can be very aggressive and tattle tally when you don't do what they ask
no immediate path to move up or be promoted. 
customers can get INCREDIBLY aggressive with you when you don't immediately help their every problem

contract job:
Pros 
Higher pay..
learning a trade..
weekends off..
travel..
meals paid for..
trying new challenging task..
work what I work and don't have to be bothered with small tasks with no relation to me...

cons: Hours could drop drastically and I could lose money weekly if the hours don't get made up...
benefits=none?...
way higher pay almost a 3rd of what I make currently...
very easy to eventually be promoted and get raises based on knowledge of skill...",22Sep2017,1

245,"Soo, this just happened today. 
This weekend, I went to my mothers place to see my grandparents and her (very) new boyfriend. It might seem odd that my mother introduces him after just a month or so of dating, but that's how she handles things I guess.
When I first met him in person (she sent me pictures beforehand) it went all just as expected; he greeted me very silently and all in all, we didn't really talk that much; Some people are rather quite and I'm okay with that.
But then, the red flags appeared..
Later in the evening, I went out with him alone, since we still needed some groceries for dinner. As we were casually speaking about running and sports in general, he mentions that he recovered from a paraplegia a decade ago and that he wouldn't be able to go for a run...
""awesome that he recovered that well!"", I think as I ask him what caused his condition. So he tells me that he doesnt really remember and that he probably fell off something when he was totally drunk. Red flag number one.
Later this evening - I just came back from my evening run - everybody is at home and bf is already finished with preparing the dinner. So as we prepare the table, my mom realizes that bf drank almost a full bottle of wine (which was supposed to go with the meat) and is kinda upset about it. Everybody in the room noticed that something was wrong and we all just ate in silence. It turns out that bf had an intense argument with his boss earlier and that he got himself drunk because of his frustration.
So yeah, maybe I'm overthinking too much but what do you think? Should I just speak up and tell my mom that I think it's bullshit? It's really not that I miss my father or something; they filed a divorce 17 years ago. I just don't wanna be near them anymore for now. It's my mom's business and I don't wanna be involved in it (I live a few hours away anyway...).

I have told him to stop numerous times, he still does it. I am not afraid of him, because I can beat the fuck out of him easily, I know it, but I would get expelled. And I know the only reason he tries to neck me and roast me (worthless roasts btw) is because he is jealous of me. He only necks me about once or so every two weeks. I feel weak for not solving it by now. So, should I just keep deescalating this annoying situation? Or should I let him know I am dominant and shove him into a wall next time he necks me?

I asked if there is something I should be doing as far as setting aside money or investing in the company is some way to which he didn't really give me much advice to go on and just said that if I'm smart about it, then I will have the company pay for it. 

Now I know I will obviously need to get a loan in order to buy the company but I don't expect any bank in there right mind to hand me $3 or $4 million to buy a company.

The good things about this job: Able to do homework all shift as much as I want, pays $12/hr. 

The bad: It's boring, and it's 18 miles away and a 30 minute drive from my school + 10 minute walk. So that's a total of 3 hours and 40 minutes per week of commuting. I also work alone so there's not really anyone to talk to or anything.

I've been offered a job at the university and I'm not sure if I should take it or not.

The good: It's on campus so those ~3.6 hours of commuting are gained back. May get some connections of some kind/knowledge on internships and things from working in the university environment. May get more experience that is useful instead of learning nothing at my current job. Would save a lot of wear and tear on my car since it's got 270,000 miles on it.

272,"Hello reddit!

I've been always interested in passive/side income for as long as I remember. However, even though many years have passed and I've attempted many things (albeit quite half-heartedly), I still haven't managed to build such an income stream.

So here's me asking for advice.

I've gone through so many subreddits, websites and articles where people recommend so many things.

I've identified 3 ways to make passive income (please feel free to provide additional options or correct me where I'm wrong)

* Make something and sell it (mobile apps, teespring, blogs with ads, affiliates, etc).
* Buy something and sell it for profit (flipping, ebay, amazon, etc).
* Get a side job of some kind (part time, working online, etc).

**My background** - I'm a sysadmin with pretty good income and a decent amount of spare time. I'm very good with computers in general and have a lot of programming experience with multiple languages and on multiple platforms. However, I've absolutely zero marketing skills.

I've many issues when it comes to the three points listed above. The first way **Making something and selling it** has the following problem:

I've tried (and failed) at generating sufficient income from mobile apps - both iOS and Android. I come up with a new idea, spend all my time working and perfecting it. Then I release it and since my marketing abilities suck, not many people find about it and I ultimately abandon it and it dies a slow death. Then I come up with another app or website idea and the same thing repeats. I'm currently developing an iOS and Android game at the moment and I fear this is what is going to happen to it as well.

The second way **Buying something and selling it for profit** seems like a difficult task for a newbie to get into. It again comes down to marketing. If I get something to sell, I've to put it up on one of these sites and find some way to market them.

The third way **Getting a side job of some kind** sounds good until I realize that on websites like Upwork (oDesk), Freelancer and similar, I need to first build a profile, have experience, have a good rating, feedback, etc to actually get jobs to do. So I get disheartened again.

I know I sound like a guy who can't get off his ass and commit to anything. The thing is I'm feeling pretty burnt out after attempting so many things over the years that whenever I see a new way of making money, I get all skeptical, lose motivation quickly and look at all the reasons why this will fail. I don't feel like spending time on something just to see it fail.

I've a lot of free time, a lot of skills, but I am burnt out with no motivation.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? What would you recommend I do? Which of the three above listed do you guys personally prefer or follow in your life? What has worked for you guys and what would you recommend to a newbie?",22Sep2017,25
273,"I use work as a way to fill the boredom and feelings of inadequacy in my life. I feel guilt for taking breaks but, what is even worse, is being absolutely bored. Music, video games, Youtube, etc.; I run out of desire to use these things. It happens about a third of the time but it sucks.
What's even worse is not knowing where I need to take my life. I'm learning Python in college so I should wait to make a video game. I don't have the equipment to produce good music. I have to actually have strong emotions to write poetry. I don't know. I need to do something",22Sep2017,1
