0,"I wasn't sure this would be appropriate in either a parenting sub or relationships or what, so I just stuck it here.

My wife and I have been together for coming up on 4 years. We've only been married about a month and a half, and up until then in the years we dated, everything was always great. We've been living together since December 2016 and welcomed our first child in the beginning of April. 

After the baby was born, things were fantastic, we were so happy together, even in the sleepless nights we cherished every moment with our new baby, all up until about the middle of May. Since then, it's like I've been living in the nightmare version of our relationship. 

In mid May my wife's post partum depression kicked in. It started off very mild. Some days she'd just be down, and couldn't help it. I offered to try getting her into therapy but she passed on it and seemed to be alright for a week or so. 

By the beginning of June, it's been like a different person. Any chance she gets when she's not taking care of the baby, she sits in whatever room I'm not in and watches Tv. It's become so impossible for me to have a conversation with her because no matter what I try I can't get her attention. 

I've convinced her to go out with friends and family a couple times but she always ends up coming home and hiding out.

In the last couple weeks she's finally told me she's just so sad and wants to be alone all the time. All this has caused me to become extremely depressed now as well. She is irresponsive to my affection and constantly wants left alone.

Am I freaking out too much to think this relationship is dying already? Is this just normal post partum depression? How do I go about getting her into therapy if she refuses?

1,"This issue has been going on ever since I was a kid . I don't know why I was so defiant and had a short temper , this caused my mom and I engage into arguments . Not everyday however but I feel like I made my moms job as a parent more stressful than it should be . This unfortunately went on for my teen years too..

Thats when my behavior grew worse . I became negative and I would easily flip shit . I would complain about the simplest things my mom told me to do , like getting off the phone , going to the gym with her , and sometimes when she asked me questions.. I got irritated for no reason . I felt like I was ungrateful for so long . By me being disrespectful I mean , yelling , talking back , I rarely slammed the door but I did a few times . I would only yell when me and my mom would get in a argument , I would be the cause of it.. Then she would yell back and we would argue .

I decided to change , be a better son and apologize . I'll write a apology letter and tell them that it was never my intention to be such a bad son . Me and my mom did have good times in the past but some bad ones too.. I feel horrible and will probably never forgive myself . My mind is too attached to the past . Thé desire of going back into the past and changing things never goes away , I want to make things right.. I just feel like its too late .

Now I'm 16 . No longer having a short temper , being grateful to them , telling her that I love you more and I'll even start helping around the house more too . Trying to spend more time with my parents as much as I can.. 

As I mentioned before , I can't forgive myself at all . This made me remain as a negative individual because I don't like who I used to be and I can't seem to accept myself . One day after getting out of summer school I opened up about my guilt like I should have done long ago and admitted about how I felt like a bad son . 

She told me . "" You're not a bad son , you stay in school and stay away from drug influences . You're not putting yourself in danger and aren't choosing to do the things that I don't want you to do "" .

I then asked her.."" Did I make you stressed ""? . Eventually asking her the same thing when we went to the mall.

She said no . Every kid isn't perfect.. You still have time to improve.

I've always loved my mom . It was just my defiant and bad side that concealed that fact . I need advice . I'm grateful to have a person like her.. Nobody can replace her .",24Jun2017,2
3,"So I just walked into the testing room to take my piano exam and I started playing for like 3 minutes and all of a sudden my mind just blanked out and I forgot all of the notes and rhythms and everything. I am on the piano bench right now with my phone in my hands typing this reddit and the judges are yelling at me so much and whenever they come near me i just kick them away. What do I do now?

EDIT: They just called the police. Please. What do i do? jump out the window?

EDIT: I have escaped through the window, but the police are hot on my trail! I am currently in the woods!

EDIT: There's a WATERFALL out here!?!??!?!?! Should i jump down it? Don't worry my phone is water resistant, but i think there are crocodiles down there!

EDIT: I just lost my left arm to those damned crocodiles. Currently running on land, i can still hear police on my trail.

EDIT: I am currently surrounded by eighteen ferocious tigers.

EDIT: The police just came and started shooting everything like crazy. All of the tigers dropped dead, and I was the last one standing, but the police tried to shoot me but they had ran out of ammo. As I sprinted away, I heard them calling the military

EDIT: Uh-oh. I hear helicopters.

EDIT: After five minutes of intricate combat, I have successfully overtaken one of the helicopters. However, two heavily equiped jets are on my tail

EDIT: Ok so I am currently hovering over my house except I'm 20 miles into the sky. I'm gonna try and jump out of the helicopter and hopefully I will crash through the roof and land safely onto my bed. Here goes!

EDIT: Good news, I performed a miraculous landing onto my bed! No injuries (aside from the left arm I had already lost) Bad news, almost seconds after I had landed, the police charged into my room and strangled me and then threw me into this police truck. They drove me down to a harbor and threw me into a boat. I had no idea where I was but then I saw an island. Then I knew, it had to be Alcatraz Island. They told me I received a life sentence threw me into the cell, which is where I am now.

EDIT: Luckily, I was placed into a cell where someone was digging a hole for 35 years, and he's just about to escape. I'm going with him. Wish me luck!

EDIT: I have successfully gotten out of the prison through the secret underground passage, I am underwater right now, i think i see sharks.

EDIT: I was about to tell the shark that ""fish are friends, not food"" but i accidentally ended up saying ""fish are food, not friends"" So they charged after me. Luckily, a dolphin swam by and I grabbed its top fin and am currently riding it while the dolphin jumps in and out of the water.

EDIT: The dolphin made a sharp turn near the coastline so I was flung all the way into the air and I am about to land in the center of a military base.

EDIT: I'VE HAD ENOUGH!!! THERE'S THE BOMB BOXES! I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS TANK OF GASOLINE AND THROW IT ON THE BOMB AND THIS WHOLE MILITARY BASE WILL BE DIED!!

EDIT: I just realized that the gasoline cannot get out of the tank unless I open the tank and then throw it. I am opening the tank now.

EDIT: Ok i just threw the tank of gasoline. It's about to land. This may be goodbye everyone!",24Jun2017,0
6,"Hi!! how are you guys doing? I'm here because I NEED ADVICE! I've been living in East LA for about a year with my husband and all of the cars he's had have had nails in them. (he's had 3 cars and all of them had nails in the front tire, on the driver's side. And now my car has a nail on THE SAME FUCKING PLACE. Now, I don't like pointing fingers without evidence because that is just plain silly BUT this is ridiculous! Earlier on, when we recently moved here, I was told by the landlord that I can park inside, as this duplex has a single car driveway but it expands in the back where two cars can fit. The back door neighbors however never let us and when we asked if we can park there, they said NO because they had been living there for 12 years and never were asked to share. We are peaceful people, therefore we are not loud nor disrespectful but that infuriated us. We didn't do anything about it (stupid, I know) Fast forward it a few weeks later and my husband's tire went flat. After that, we found nails around his car almost all the time. The wife of the back neighbor became aggressive and demanding that we don't block her but where else could we park? The driveway is what is written on the contract so I suppose it is allowed?! And she would ALWAYS HONK HER HORN like there was no tomorrow. Even if we were getting in the car to move it she was already speeding in reverse and honking aggressively. We began to park on the side of the driveway-not blocking it and allowing their cars to come and go as they please and she came banging on the door telling us to move the car because it was ""too hard for her to get out"" which again is complete bullshit. We got fed up and told the landlord and all she said was to work the parking out with them-something that they had already told us they were not willing to do because of the time they've been living there. And now, his new car has a nail and my car has another nail in the same place-the front tires. I am angry because i don't know who it is and scared because we always travel with our 4 month old. What should i do? set up cameras? because coincidentally , we always find nails when we are on the driveway(we don't last more than 30 mins there anyway because they always enter and exit every little while) As soon as we park there, it doesn't take 5 mins for them to come knocking saying that they need to go out. We would put the car further inside so that they can park behind us but they still kept honking at us to get out...our temporary solution has been, parking on the side of the driveway but like I have told you guys, even that's a problem. I am scared and upset because we always travel with my baby and I fear for our safety...any advice is appreciated. I suspect that it is them but I need to be sure before saying anything ...",24Jun2017,1
10,"They asked me if I'd like to move in with them a couple months ago but never followed up, so I've made other arrangements, but now they asked me if I was moving in with them? I don't know what to say",24Jun2017,1
11,"About 6 months ago my roommate convinced me to get rid of the couch I owned and we shared in the living room. I was fine with that because it was well past it's prime and really needed replacing. The roommate then decided to purchase the new one so he had it when we inevitably moved out. This week though after a few arguments my roommate has ""banned me from using any of his things"" (Other than the couch I don't anyway). He decided this included his couch and has banned me from it. It's the only couch in the living room and I can't buy my own because of the lack of space. It's pretty ridiculous. Can he do this? He still uses my tv and many other things in the living room. Should I ban him from my things? (I don't want to I think it's childish)",24Jun2017,7
12,"Don't really know where to post this but I guess here would be the most suitable. I should start off by talking a little about myself. I am a girl but all my life, in a sense, I have always been tomboyish. I'm not very feminine in the sense that I don't really care about how my appearance is portrayed to others. I have struggled all my life with not feeling hyper feminine like all the other girls but I have finally come to accept that about myself and I am happy. For example I am a huge gym rat lol I like muscles on girls and I think it's super flattering! I'm not really the type of girl who likes to wear a full face of makeup and most girls don't! Normal! I'm not obsessed with dressing to look hyper feminine either. You could say I am a plain Jane and feel the most comfortable wearing a plain t-shirt and some jeans. I have a very unique personality but I am a very confident person! 

My mother, however, thinks otherwise. Growing up my mom and I have always butt heads because our personalities always have conflicted. She has in the past gotten mad at me, ignored me, and not talked to me for MONTHS. Over anything really. It was really hard for me to accept this but I have come to realize that my mother has never really accepted me for who I am. My mom has this image of who SHE wants me to be but I know for a fact that I can never be that person she wants me to be and I will always disappoint her. To describe the context I am practicing to drive with my mom and have been going with her on my regular drives. Recently I got into a fight with my mom over how I was dressed (sweats, a regular t-shirt and a really messy bun) on our way out for a drive. It started off with my step-dad commenting that I should do something about my hair. Which now that I look at it fine my hair could use some readjustment whatever lol. But as we entered the car my mom began picking at my personality, saying things like why don't you wear make up, you don't dress like other girls, I never see you get ready to look nice to go out, you always look like that, etc... And I snapped I told her that she's so obsessed with how others perceive her or me and I'm tired of it. I told her that I don't not care how others view because they don't pay my bills! To which she begins to say other hurtful things that I'm kind of already used to her saying. We're driving out the driveway while still arguing to which I say then maybe you shouldn't hang out with me since it bothers you so much. She replied with okay I won't, thought about it for awhile and then she said you know what yeah I don't want to be seen around you dressed like this right now and you're so rude. She then told me to get out of the driver's seat so she can run her errands without me. I told her she was crazy and got out of the car. Initially it didn't upset me because I was shocked but I later I started crying because I realized my mom is embarrassed of me. She always has something to say about me.

I don't look like my two other sisters (one is 12, the other is 5) because we have a different dad so they are much curvier than I am. My mom has always compared them to me because I look like my dad. She makes comments on my nose how I should get a rhinoplasty, how I am not as curvy as they are and I should lose weight in my stomach area, she ALWAYS comments on my FUPA saying that I should get lipo there, and before I used to exercise a lot she used to comment on how flat my butt was. She never says things like this to my other sisters. She always tells my 12 year old sister that she has a nice body and nice legs, and that my little sister will also have a nice butt in the future. 

I guess what I'm trying to say that I feel like I'm always the one my mom points her indiscretions at. And I don't understand why. She's has never even liked me wanting to be a veterinarian, even though I have been saying that I am since I was 7 years old! She always asks me to be something else because she doesn't like animals, how they smell or all the hair that they leave. But I love animals and I want to spend the rest of my life with them. Every year she asks me if I'm sure I want this and maybe I should look into a career as a doctor or something else. I can't be my fucking self around her and I'm tried of it! 

For a long time I haven't talked to my dad's side of the family due to how their divorce ended which I never knew about until now. Turns out that my mom left my dad by cheating on him with their coworker (my current stepdad, he's a nice guy though honestly!) at the restaurant that they both worked at! Everyone knew except my dad! When I was about 2 years old my mom used to call my dad's sister (my aunt, she used to babysit me) a slut and say that she is sleeping around with a lot of men every time she would go out. She would manipulate my dad and tell my aunt that he would never believe her when in reality she was just scared of my mom so she didn't want to stay at their place :( I'm finding out all these mean things that my mom did and I honestly don't doubt them. I can see my mother doing this very thing. 

I just don't know what to do. I used to want to do anything for my mom but I've had enough. I don't think I can live with her like this. She is embarrassed of me whether she likes to admit it or not. I don't want to live with her if she can't accept me for who I am, if she always going to pick at my self esteem like this. I know I will be unhappy if I continue to live with her. I don't know what to do :(

16,"Just going to quickly summarize the current situation. I walk home from a local creek from my bus-stop (the creek has side-walk). And recently a few people have been robbed by a gang of 3 people pointing knives at them asking for money. The robberies have happened just ~30 min to 1 hour around the time I come home from work (5:30pm-6:30pm). Cops where called each time a robbery occurred, but they could not find the suspects. From the account of one of the lady's that got robbed, the robbers are 3 black teens. It takes me ~4-5 mins to get home if I take the creek, going around takes ~15+ mins. 

I have been so scared lately thinking about getting robbed that just I have just purchased a dog spray from Amazon(pepper spray is illegal in Canada). One part of me says, I can take these teens on in a fight if I spray two of them in the face and then scare the 3rd away. Or I can just scare them by keeping a knife on me. Another part of me does not want to take the chance and walk around. My heart has been racing the whole day thinking about this. I am ~220 pounds, Male, 5'8. 

Please give some advice. ",24Jun2017,1
19,"hello

i am currently a senior in high school and transferred to this school when i was a sophomore. I made many friends and this ""asshole friends"" was just my friend's friend. 

 He is one of those rich friend who is obsessed with school grades and only think he is right. whenever i make a mistake or ask him for help, he says stuff like ""You fucking dumbass, this is so easy"". Maybe he thinks he is just joking around but this really hurts my feelings.  Recently ""we"" did a school project together about biology (Which i am good at). I asked him about the topic we are going to present, which he responded with ""You suck at presenting so dont even fucking do anything. You are going to mess me up so im going to do everything"". I said ok well if you need help just ask..  well when ""we"" did the presentation (I was just standing next to him, not saying a word) my biology teacher asked my friend what i did and he said ""He didnt do anything, i made the presentation and did the experiments all by myself. Of course my teacher gave him an A and told me i was going to get a separate grade for not participating in the group project. After biology, he kept saying ""You are fucking useless.. What are you Trash? "". then he told me to say sorry and stuff like that so i apologized and told him i wasnt feeling well so i was not going to eat lunch today.

There are more examples but thats not the point. i need an advice on how to deal with him...  I cant just tell him to fuck off because he is close friends with literally all of my friends and cutting ties with him would mean cutting ties with my friends. I tried ignoring his insults but that didnt really do anything.. i am really lost on what to do...   This is killing me inside...



Edit. I thought of some of the reasons why he might hate me

1. I am good at biology. 

Before i came to this school, apparently ""asshole friend"" was the guy my friends would ask him for help on biology. After becoming friends with me though, my friends stopped asking for his help and instead thought of me as the smart guy

2.i love video games and talking about wildlife

my ""asshole friend"" doesnt like video games and he thinks wildlife is boring. So when i am talking about videogames/wildlife to my friends, maybe he feels left out?

 So this is pretty cray cray. Here goes nothing.. I'm 27 years old, never met, seen or even heard my biological fathers voice. Since I was a youngin, my mom had me convinced that he died.

Basically, I was supposed to be aborted, or we'd both die etc etc. Well I love my mom, don't get me wrong but after all the years of knowing her, I've come to the conclusion that she is a compulsive liar. Always has been, always will be. So I don't believe her stories. Another reason I don't believe her is, wait for it.... He's alive!!! Yup alive and well in fact. Did I mention that I caught up with one of her highschool friends, who also knew him, and believe it or not... He's not dangerous.. Well according to her he's not. I don't know the guy, so I can't say. Well, anywho....I recently purchased his phone numbers, like a crazy person, and now I don't know what to say to him when I call... I mean, imagine, 27 years later, ""hi pops"". Not to say that he's even my dad, for all I know, she might not even know who my dad is. Lol. Anyways reddit. I've googled the shit out of what to say and I've come up empty handed, perhaps the amazing people of reddit can shine some light on what I can say without projectile vomiting and hanging up.

We hang out one more time and I got too nervous to make my move before she left. I should've kissed her or something, but chickened out because I liked her so much. She goes away for a year and we don't talk but then she comes back in June and I ask to catch up. We hang out and chat until late one night and it goes great. Then the next time we hang out at a family party and I meet her parents and it's all going great. We snap and text with great convos. She tells her friends she likes me emotionally but not physically yet since We haven't hooked up yet. So I ask her to hang out and we watch a movie and I didn't know how to lean in or push past the nerves and didn't kiss her again.

I keep trying to start conversations but it's clearly not the same since I didn't make a move but she won't even see me to fix it. She probably doesn't want to hang with a guy and do nothing.

Thats why you had your headaches"" fast forward to june We went to sunsplash and my sister was pissed off for some reason 10 minutes later she comes in the house uncontrollably laughed if i said hi she would laugh so hard. A few days later I over hear my brother say ""if we gave some to mom when she wasnt looking she would be so happy"" then he says ""its not bad if you don't smoke it"" then a few days later (Today) I walk in the room and they want me out I knew something shady was going on. Then they burst out laughing. Later my brother says ""it usually goes away in a few hours"" then I had a mental breakdown my brain was overwhelmed and I just started crying because it was so obvious but no one would listen.

44,"Hi. First time posting. I'm just going to jump right into this. If this isn't the right sub I'm sorry. Also. Kind of long. And probably a wall of text bc mobile. 

 Backstory. My boyfriend had a heart ablation today and asked for me while he was in post observation waking up. He is a type 1 diabetic and uses an insulin pump. We had to educate most of the staff on how exactly his pump works because he didn't feel comfortable removing it. He is also on the autism spectrum. 

So after the surgery, when I was brought back to the observation room where there were other patients waking up as well he was mostly awake. His blood sugar was low and they had given him sugar through his IV right before i got there. He recorded the number in his pump. The nurse that was with him told me he bolused for the sugar, which he told her he did not. She did not understand that his pump just records the number and did NOT deliver any insulin. He and I were having a bit of conversation when she checked his glucose levels and they were beginning to rise. She told him to stop talking that we could talk later and to go to sleep. She then left and returned with some juice. 

I politely asked her why she was giving him juice if she had just pushed IV sugar. She told me the doctor knew what he was doing and proceeded to force feed him juice. He and I both told her to wait so that his levels could rise on their own. She rudely told us she knew what she was doing because we both bolused in his pump. We informed her that we were just recording numbers and she insisted upon the juice. 

She gave him a drink and spilt some down his back. He absolutely hates feeling wet near his head and upper back and so he asked her to clean it. She ignored him and he asked again. She told him she would clean it later. So, not wanting him more uncomfortable than he already was and trying to avoid an autism meltdown I reached across the bed and wiped his back with his blanket because she would not give us a towel. She told me she would have gotten it later and gave me a pretty ugly look. I informed her that he is autistic and would not be okay leaving the juice spilt.

She disappeared for a second and heard her say something about my BF being too awake. She then returned and told me they were getting another patient and I had to wait in the waiting room instead of with him. We were completely sectioned off and his curtians were closed so we could not see out. But I agreed as she told us it would be fast. She then left me in the waiting room for around 45 minutes. 

I later learned that my BF repeatedly asked her when I could come back in and when he was being moved to a room. She ignored him. He began getting more stressed out and upset. After they met me in the hall 45 minutes later he looked so upset and frustrated. 

I just don't believe her behavior was okay, however, I'm not sure it wasn't just my emotions running high and overreacting. I got her name, however my BF's family thinks we are overreacting. I don't want to get her in trouble for something stupid, but I don't want other patients/families to be treated the way that we were. I honestly think she caused him unnecessary stress and anxiety after he had just had a heart procedure. But I'm not 100% sure it warrants a formal complaint.


Edit: One of the things bothering him and me the most is his autism. He is decently ""high functioning"" and could understand she was not answering him on purpose. We are mostly concerned that she get an autistic patient that isnt as able to speak up or have someone willing to and for her to tell them to stop talking and go to sleep. Not to mention the lack of diabetic knowledge seems to extend to several staff members that have been assigned to him all day. They don't seem to know what they're doing.


Update: I will probably be writing a letter about this nurse specifically and another letter about the general need for education throughout the hospital regarding care for type one diabetics and others on the autism spectrum. ",24Jun2017,4
45,"my boyfriend (of a year) and I have smoked on and off, before and after we got together. It used to be an occasional thing but ever since we got our own place (I moved out before I got kicked out) it's becoming more frequent. I don't mind smoking, but like after three nights in a row, it starts getting old for me. It also becomes kinda irritating when I come home to him high. (He used to smoke and not help clean but I got him to help out and now he cleans and does what I ask him to do and he smokes after.)
I can't seem to figure out why it irritates me so much. It's like when I'm in the mood to smoke and relax then I don't care... but when it's just him, I don't like it. I know this isn't fair to him, so I never bring it up or try to use it as an argument. 
Basically, how can I get him to see that doing it every night isn't good? (He rarely spends money, his friends usually give him some)",24Jun2017,0
46,"One of my parents had a child outside of wedlock in another country and we are probably going to face some financial troubles due to the $1000 a month the separate family is asking for (unofficial childcare) compensation.

We can't necessarily ignore them considering the situation regarding the adulterer having relations to the military and getting ""caught"" would result in us losing almost everything due to all the support we get from said military. 

Long story short the adulterer is getting somewhat blackmailed to pay unofficial childcare. It would seem simple to just let the adulterer deal with the situation themselves but emotionally as a family we can't really do that.

Just as a disclosure I am not asking for financial support, just informal advice regarding this situation, I do not blame the child for doing this to us as that is unfair to the child as they never decided to exist in the first place. 
What can we do in this pretty trashy situation?

53,"In actuality, this is the third pet cat death that happened this year

*(we have, well, had 6 cats and we keep them in a separate room becuase of the furs and the allergies and some of them still have claws and one of them have not been properly fixed yet so he ends up urinating everywhere. Plus we have two dogs too who as much as I love their enthusiasm with other animals, they never leave them alone so we had to put them in another room for their sake)*

The first cat did died this year was becuase he was old. He was at least 13 years old. The second one was becuase of maggots but we are not really aware of this becuase she was always a withdrawn cat *(I honestly blame myself really becuase I was always cautious of this cat becuase of her withdrawn behaviour. My sister took her to the vet and didn't say that she had anything. I blame myself really becuase I feel that I should have seen this coming)*

This cat, I think I am finding it hard to cope with it.

We knew her time was about to come. She has been with us for 14 years and she was changing a lot this year.

She became much thinner and she started to lose her sense of balance and motor co-ordination.

So we made sure she was getting proper care before her time came.

And funny enough this cat always took a liking towards me. She always liked to cuddle with me or at least be even near me so we let her more in my room to sleep in there.

*(like seriously, there were times I geniunely liked to push her away, as in put her away from me on my bed or put her near the corner only that she is straight back next to me like I am her teddy bear. It was both funny and adorable at the same time considering that no matter I tried to push her away, unintentionally of course, she always was straight back next to me like a kid who does not want to let go of her toy)*

 She always liked to come to my room and always liked to cuddle with me.

But the past days I starting to avoid her. Not only becuase I had exams and I was priorisiting those over my cat and the stress was making me act funny *(lack of sleep deprivation probably made me more nervous)* and prioritise other things *(I have to admit it and I do not like saying it myself, I have been paying more attention to my dogs because they are way more active than the cats and their bubbly behaviours always like to brighten my day. I feel cruel that I am admitting this but it is true in comparison to cats, especially mine despite that I do genuinely care for them)*, but she was developing this unpleasant kind of smell *(and the hair everywhere becuase funny enough, I have allergies despite I really loved this cat)*

I never was sure what it was but my dad told me it was becausse she was going old so almost every time she wanted to cuddle with me, I kept removing her becuase the smell was unpleasant. Not unbearable just unpleasant

Plus she was starting to urinate in my room as well. The smell was not pleasant either but it worried me becuase funny enough she never did that before, not even after being in my room for the whole night, which worried me.

I somehow woke up at around 5am so I wanted to check up on her and wouldn't you know it. 

I don't see her belly moving, she is not responding to my voice, she is motionless.


It is 6am as I am writing this and she is died and I am actually sitting next to her right now


I am sitting next to her right now wondering whether her last few days were the best days of her life.

I tried to make sure to take care of her but I was prioritising other things and the smell is not pleasant.

I mostly kept her in my room. At least if I didn't pay attention to her, she was at least with someone *(like I said, this cat somehow took a liking towards me ever since I was a teenager)* and she was in her favourite room 

But right now I am not sure how to cope with it or whether I should feel guilty that I did not treat her better than she deserved. 

Looking back right now, I am wondering whether my presence, despite the fact that I was not always paying attention to her, was at least enough to know that she was being cared for and not alone


Jesus, this cat took a liking towards me a lot and I did to her as well. No wonder I am finding it hard to cope right now",24Jun2017,2
54,"I work at an awesome company that I love. I get great vacation time, lots of (non-financial) perks, and it's a great culture. I make enough money to make ends meet, but have a lot of debt (mostly medical, but some credit cards, too). If I really work at it, I can have everything paid off in three years and have a great savings.

On the other hand, I just got a job offer at 25% more than what I'm making. The offer was with a place that has similar benefits, but better hours. At this new place, I could reach the same goals in a year. Easy choice, right?

The problem is that the place I work has shown an active interest in my development. They seem to really care if I succeed, and have covered my (and my team's) way to various conferences to help us move forward in our fields. I know I won't get that at this new place. On top of that, my current company regularly does fun outings, like going to movies and white-water rafting.

So, I went on the Google Store on my account, added her credit card information with her permission (she was behind me the whole time), and made the purchase. A few minutes later, I get an email from the Google Wallet team telling me that they are suspending my account indefinitely due to potential suspicious activity. They include a link to submit my state ID and some other information to verify it's me. I do so and go to bed in a shitty mood.

I woke up today with an email from them telling me that the Google Wallet account associated has been closed. I called Google support and was on the phone for 5 hours and ended up being told that due to the suspicious activity that nothing could be done. My mom, owner of the card in question, even got on the phone without any use. There is nothing suspicious being done here. I just want my card back on my Google Wallet account; I don't really care about hers at all.

New phone aside, I need that Google Wallet account reopened. I use it to pay for Google Play Music and my phone service (I'm on Project Fi).

62,"Basically in the title. One of my close friends is in ""love"" with me (he's said it quite a few times to me and other friends) and keeps broaching the subject of a relationship. A little bit of backstory is needed here:

We were close throughout highschool as best mates, to the point where we went overseas together with a few other mates. Not awkward at all - we were good until we came back and he told me he loved me since the moment we met in early high school. After I rejected him gently (not ready for a relationship, don't think of you like that etc) he became really awkward around me and could not maintain eye contact. We remained good friends though, and we steadily built up our friendship back to where it was. 

For the next few weeks, our mutual friends told me to speak with him, as he would not stop talking about me (in a ""good"" way, apparently). We spoke once more about the subject, and I told him that I had come out as a lesbian. He didn't seem to mind and told me that it wouldn't change how he felt, and again told me loved me and that he wants to be with me.

This week was my birthday. I invited him out on the night because he's part of our friendship group. He gave me a present, had a laugh, it was all good. He then found out I had a date with someone else, cracked the shits and left the bar. My friend demanded I talk to him about it, but I was adamant that I hadn't done anything wrong. He then came back in and asked if we could talk, and then started crying and telling me that he couldn't take it anymore, that he'd never love another girl and that he didn't know what to do if he couldn't be with me. We had an argument, I left him outside the bar, he walked off and punched a few walls. I haven't heard from him since.

Basically, I'm asking for advice as to how to deal with this, since it seems to be a pretty common complication. He's been a massive part of my life, and was one of my closest friends. From the way he was acting on my birthday, I am genuinely afraid that he'll do something stupid because I rejected him. I don't want to cut him from my life, I don't want him to hurt himself, and I just want this to be over.

Any advice? :(

65,"Hi everyone, I'm currently a student doing a summer internship right now and I'm feeling depressed about it. There's not much work to do and I don't feel the work we do adds value.

To give a little context, I work for an asset management firm. The function I work in is mathematical which I enjoy, but I feel the work we do are all analyses. These analyses don't feel like they add value to the big picture of things. I don't really have much work to do and I just found out the project I was going to be working on just fell through. 

My team typically gives me stuff to read but there's no real application to it. In my downtime, I'll typically work on an online programming course and ask if there's anything I can really help anyone with.

70,"I don't know if this is the right place to come to, but it seems like the most logical place to come.

So, I'm 15 and gay, and this guy is also 15 (and I presume gay, that's what all his friends have said), just to get it out there and out of the way. So being my age I follow some trends and do what others do to. I use snapchat a lot and often there's pictures that go around like ""screenshot if you would not mind dating me even if you single or not,"" etc. So I throw that exact photo up on my story, because why not?


So I wasn't really expecting someone to screenshot it, and it was this guy that I liked that someone tried hooking me up with before. So naturally, I was excited. Well I didn't want to seem to hyped about it, so I texted a few friends like ""Holy shit, a boy screenshotted it!"" Well I didn't message him first just so I didn't look like I was just sitting and waiting for a screenshot.


He sends me a message about 10 minutes later just saying the usual, ""What's up?"" I want to seem casual so I just respond with ""Nothing much, how about you?"" After this message is sent, a new person adds me out of nowhere and I always accept requests and then block or keep them depending on what they want. So I add her, I say hey but she only sends me a ton of pictures of chickens. I was confused at the time but I feel like it may have been a ""Look at this cock"" joke. I ask her eventually after she's done how she's doing, usual starter questions for new people, then she says ""Me and HIM are plotting to get you."" That set off the first red flag.


I push her to evaluate what she means by that but to no avail, she won't budge, just saying ""He"" won't let her say, at which this point i've put together that it's the guy. So I'm still thinking ""maybe he is just shy and is scared to ask me questions personally?"" So she starts asking questions which I automatically understood as questions about my sexual preferences (i.e. Do you like dark or light meat, Do you like it lean or fat on your meat?) I'm cautious at this point, not really taking these questions seriously answering kind of jokingly. She sends a picture of the guy (clothed) and said ""Would you like this cock?"" So I'm like sure bud, tell him to talk to me.


She eventually stops messaging me much anymore, and him and I start exchanging selfies. They start off innocent, like just smiling with like peace sign or sticking tongues out. He eventually, however, sends a pic of his buff clothed (shorts and shirt on) laying down. Now I've sent pictures of myself posing in mirrors to my close friends before, so i thought nothing of it sending the same picture back. Well this is when things really going out of control. He sends a picture, butt-naked laying on his couch, penis covered but ass in full sight. Now let me say this is happening as I write this, but most has already occurred, so this may have been an hour or so ago. So I turn off the lights and message the guy, ""Hey sorry I won't be sending anymore pics, my mom wants me to go to bed but I can stay up and still talk if you'd like."" The next thing he sends is him posing on a chair saying ""Come on, you've always got the flash ;).""

Major red flag.

So during this whole thing I've been talking with friends like ""Ooh this happened!"" and all that, but one of them starts thinking this is all a bit weird how fast this is going, and everyone, including me, are all agreeing on that. She said something like this happened in the Netflix show ""13 reasons why"" (Fact check? I haven't watched it). So she tells me what happened so I let them know ""Well I'm going to act oblivious to all of what's happening and see where this all goes.


I respond back to the guy with a simple, ""I dunno man I've never really sent a picture like that and I think it's kind of illegal isn't it?"" I thought maybe he'd get that if I'm saying no that I'm on to him at this point, but he says ""Hey buddy, don't be shy :)."" No, I already know at this point that it's definitely either a bad joke or him trying to do something bad, so I'm not going to be upfront or anything, since I am not 100% sure that I'm correct, so I just say ""I'll pass man.""


TL;DR Guy try is trying to ""hook up with me"" but is wanting me to send almost completely nude photos before we even know who we really are other than having mutual friends.


So in my opinion this sounds all too fucking sketchy to me, but I may just be paranoid by how fast he's going. So what should I do, keep text to see where it goes or block him or what? Thanks in advanced if I can't respond to your comment!",24Jun2017,3

My dad works nights and my mom works days, but there's a couple of hours that their work hours interlap. ""Oh, a couple of hours a day of babysitting isn't that bad.

82,"I'm a 19 y/o college student. I'm surrounded by socially adept people who have plenty of connections, deep friendships, relationships, etc. I don't really have any of these, and I know why - I'm a socially stunted person. I want to say part of it is personality, but I think the big majority is my parents' overwhelming over-protectiveness up to the 8th grade, when my parents split up. I could rarely play with friends, visit their houses, etc, and when I did they would either judge my friends and basically choose who I could be friends with, or constantly lecture me on staying away from drugs/alcohol, focusing on school, etc, and it made me just not bother with it. My dad was a real cunt and ruined my self esteem with insults, which I also think was a big part of it. 


Anyway, what's done is done and I can only work on fixing myself from here. I have one close friend I've known for like 10 years now, and I think the only reason we're friends is because he's a lot like me, and we just kinda grew up together. We only really play video games together and exclusively talk about games or online issues, we never have any actual discussion and he's expressed zero interest in doing more ""social"" things, like going to parties or just getting out to do whatever, which leaves me pretty much alone. I don't know how to make friends, I've tried but it seems really hard. How it usually goes is 1) I try to drive the conversation, which usually ends up with me talking about things people show a visible lack of interest in. This is usually the end of the conversation and makes things really awkward. 2) Instead of talking about my interests or myself, I try to ask things about the other person, which usually turns from a friendly conversation into a weird interview type thing and no reciprocation from them. 3) Very rare occurrence; we find a topic of mutual interest and the conversation goes well. This, well, rarely happens. These things paired with the fact that I have a relatively poor physique for a male (skinny/below average height), poor skin (moderately bad acne) and am very poor at making eye contact (probably a symptom of the previous two) makes things really hard. I'm trying to work on these with better diet, skincare products, working out, and just straight up looking at people more, but it feels like I'm just in a really awkward transitional phase at the moment.

Two months ago, ill family member went into temporary “respite”, and would probably go into long term care, the relative then told us that we had 6-12 months to get out of the house.
We started looking for a small place, when we have been advised that the ill family member is coming back to the house with a care package in place whereas “two carers” will come in for 15 minutes four times a day. They will get ill family member up from bed, washed toilet etc. then bring ill family member into the front room where she will sit for 4 hours until the next visit. This will be repeated until bedtime whereas she will be put to bed at 20:00 hours.
This care package is only slightly newer than the one that has bee in place for a year, the difference is that there has only been one care giver for 1/2 hour visits 4 times daily, now it is 15 minute visits with two carers.
For the past year, we have done everything else that the “carers” do not do i.e. cleaned “toilet accidents”, urine soaked chair, urine soaked bed sheets, urine smelling house, mould infected bedroom, filthy house, provide home cooked meals, doctors appointments, pick up meds, etc, etc, etc, put up with being treated like servants as opposed to family all at a lot of cost to us.
Since we were asked to leave, prior to the news of her coming back, should we:
Continue to live here?
Live with no additional assistance to her? i.e. let her family step up?
Just leave?

When I'm in this state, I am incredibly focused, I think several times quicker, and my reaction times are better, it's like I'm processing everything within my field of vision at an increased rate. Kinda like slow-mo but everything is still going the same speed if that makes sense. After I get out of this state, I feel like I've used a decent amount of energy. Makes me feel a little fatigued. It also isnt the easiest thing to snap out of, almost have to let it fade away. Never had it ladt longer than a few minutes.
The way I do this by focusing on the back of my neck, right where your spine meets your skull. After ive focused on this one spot, i disperse it wherever i want it(basically shifting my focus somewhere while maintaining a certain level of concentration at the point of origin). By sending it over my head, i can activate this heightened state although it occassionally gives me headaches.

97,"As the only Indian kid in my community before middle/high school I never went out. I never went to any school friends houses or parties that weren't Indian. It seemed like everyone went to others birthday parties and play dates and other stupid stuff. Back then it didn't bother me at all, cause I had all my outside of school friends 

I went to my first Halloween ""party"" freshman year. It was just some of my friends who I'd known since elementary. We went trick or treating and I think had a good time just being kids. I guess this is when I realized how much I craved being around friends, and going out and doing whatever. The same group of friends and I had several other get togethers freshman and sophomore year. 

However this year was my junior year and I realized I barely hang out with/know these people anymore. I hardly even see them outside of school. It's like they've all expanded, made new friends, and gone to different things. I've gone back to basically only going to Indian parties. It just feels 10 times worse as with the pervasiveness of social media I always have to see that they're out doing something fun, while I'm at home reading/playing video games.

100,"I'm on month four of a new job. Due to a combination of having been fired from my last job as a result of incompetency, been without a job for over a year, and thankfully when I finally landed one, turned out to be one where I actually really enjoy the work that I do and the people that I communicate with, I’ve been working incredibly hard to prove my worth. However, at the same time, I’ve been causing a lot of easily preventable mistakes that end up causing more work and frustration for my senior coworker that has been teaching me the ropes. These typically range from forgetting a step shortly after I’ve learned it, to forgetting to communicate with teammates in regards to time sensitive issues. It generally happens at least once a week, and my work/ life balance has slowly been getting more difficult to maintain, as I’m always trying to find ways to compensate for my errors by doing the extra work without being told, often on the weekends.

Whenever these issues happen, I tend to beat myself up over them when I get back at home. I think it’s in part due to my fear that I may lose my job again/ I really want to stay, and it doesn’t help either that another coworker around my age that started at the same time and with the same title as me has since moved quickly up the ranks to the point where I’ve begun taking many assignments directly from her, yet hasn’t been producing nearly as much trouble as I have. I’m also sensitive to certain words or actions; the same senior coworker mentioned previously is one of the nicest and fun individuals that I’ve met in person, but whenever he pings me about a mistake that I made over the company slack, his word choice feels like he’s berating me/ chewing me out. I don’t know how many times I’ve apologized to him already, both in person, and online.

I know that tomorrow is another day, and all I can really do is to pick myself off the ground, dust myself off, and face forward. Fact of the matter is, that aside from these issues, the amount of work that I’ve put in and accomplished has been acknowledged by my boss and coworkers, so I don’t think I’m quite on the chopping block just yet. But I really don’t want to continue causing trouble, and could use some ideas and advice as to how to do better, not cause more trouble for the office, and start living a proper working lifestyle.

So again. Wall of text. This all happened around 3am. My BF has still not been released from the hospital. His blood sugar was all over the place from the over corrections that were made during the day. 

While the day staff nurses and aides and charge nurse were wonderful, even making sure to tell night shift in front of us that he uses his own lancet for finger sticks and he is autistic, night shift is a nightmare. 

His levels were around the 50s or 60s and he had finally fallen asleep. He was only out for maybe 2hrs when they came and checked his levels. He was at a 49. So the nurse came in. Guys. I told her he probably wouldn't get up to talk to her, my intention being he was tired and didn't wake up when they came and checked his levels. He didn't really have to since I have express permission to check for him in the event he won't or cannot wake up.

She took that to mean his levels were so low she needed to immediately push IV sugar. She called his name a bit and he half asleep made noise to her and she told him it was gonna be cold. He sort of nodded but was still totally asleep. She started pushing this sugar and he woke up screaming in pain. He cried. He begged her to stop. He told her his arm was hurting and freezing and he wanted to go home. She kept pushing it. She then left the room. 

He hollered and cried and begged for a good 4 or 5 minutes before she came in and asked what was wrong. He told her that it was not okay to push that sugar. He did not want it at all. He was not fully awake to consent and she was not in the right to do that. SHE TOLD HIM THAT HE TOLD HER IT WAS OKAY. Then when he called her out on it she said I said it was fine because he wouldn't wake up. I informed her that was not the case. Had I known it was going to cause him any discomfort I would have made sure he was awake and aware. We aregued and I told her that he is autistic. Even in an emergency we have to deal with the autism first. Then the emergency. I told her she probably ruined any and all future doctor visits.

She got me her charge nurse. He asked what the issue was. I explained over my BFs cries, pleads, and scream. He asked if he could sedate BF i refused because he was already scared, confused, in pain, and half awake. He agreed that his nurse was not in the right and took her off BFs room. He also asked what we do when this happens at home. I very coldly told him this does not happen at home. We always slowly and clearly discuss things. BF also says to charge nurse that he never wants to go to a hospital again because they hurt him. I also told charge nurse we were fed up with him being treated like a glucose number. We understand it is their jobs but this woman went too far. 

BF was distraught. He thought he had done something wrong. He at one point asked if he made her mad because she had punished him. He also asked if they were mad at him for yelling and if they were going to hurt him anymore. He told the charge nurse to get out and that he would not consent to anymore IV medications. Then he called his dad. BF thought his dad could come and help diffuse the situation. 

He was wrong. Dad comes in and pulls me out of the room. He tells me it's best if I leave for the night and I need to trust him and agree with it. To go in the room and tell BF i will see him in the morning. I cannot do this. BF is afraid I will abandon him. Dad tells me I'm too young to deal with ""this"" (he didnt clarify if he meant BF or the nurse situation). He also says it's nothing personal but if I leave the situation will go away and be handled. Aka he'll pretend it didn't happen and not advocate for BF. I told him if i left he had to tell BF why. He told BF that i decided to go home. While i was outside the room crying because I did not want to leave.

I had just calmed BF down and when Dad told him I was leaving he lost it again. Began screaming that he wanted me not Dad there and if Dad wanted to stay then he would be leaving with me. He screams so much Dad caves in and lets me stay. Dad leaves the room but I'm not 100% he isn't somewhere on the unit. 

At this point it was around 4am, BFs arm and hand hurt till about 630. He wants to move out. I'm not sure he should because I think he is upsrt and trying to make a snap decision. Where we stand is he is not speaking with his dad and will not allow him in the room. He's hurting and upset and we just want to go home. What I'm not sure about is how we are going to either mend things with Dad or get all his things and find a place to put them. The room he and I share in my mom's house is too small. I don't want to be the reason he alienates himself from his family. 


Tldr; Nurse fucks up, BF'S dad tries to kick me out, we need to decide if we cut ties or try to mend this situation. ",24Jun2017,1

Yesterday, my family and I were touristing in a large town on holidays in a country with English as a second language. Lots of people speak some English. We were looking for a place to eat. As we walked past a pub of some sort, a pretty rough looking man in his 50s said to me in English "" I like your shoes "". The way he said it made me feel really uncomfortable, exposed, and shocked. I think he was drunk and probably high. It was the first time anyone ever said anything in such a way to me. It looks like an innocent thing to say, but it felt different to a normal comment. I'd always been aware about catcalling or stuff like that, but I'd never seen it happen let alone to me. The worst part of it all and what I'm most ashamed of was that in my shock and disbelief, I said thank you. I just reacted like it was a normal compliment and I wished I'd just ignored it or retorted. Thanks was the worst possible thing to say. I don't know why he said it, I wasn't wearing anything revealing. I was wearing some 3/4 length trousers and a sleeveless top. The only skin was my arms, neck, face and shins. My shoes were ankle boots ( they're really old now and the soles are almost falling apart ). He wasn't making fun of them because it is only visible from behind. I haven't told anyone about this so its also a way of getting it off my chest. I was sitting on it trying to make sense of it until now. Please tell me your opinion of whether it really was a compliment, or was I overreacting. Thx, Tadild.
Edit: word + seeing all these comments and advice, I think I can be sure that I was just overreacting and should look at people in a better light. I shouldn't have said anything about ignoring or retorting, its always polite to say thanks. Thanks again, Tadild.",24Jun2017,1

120,"Hi. I'm in a bit of a strange situation and really need some advice. I've just finished my university degree and done pretty well for myself. My plan was to stay in my university city with a few of the people I had lived with while studying, perhaps for a year, get a job and figure out my next steps. However, one of my housemates (Not one I would be living with but one that would still be around) regularly gets very drunk, and when he does, grows angry and violent. I will refer to him as Daniel. He has smashed our banister and television when in such a state, and has previously hit my girlfriend when on a night out. This behaviour is long documented with him; he was evicted from his last house for biting someone and has a history with the police. Daniel claims he attends AA meetings and tells us that ""the next step in his recovery is not quitting drink entirely but learning how to be responsible with it."" However, there does not seem to be any improvement with him and indeed things seem to be getting worse. Every night out with him ends in disaster nd something going wrong.

This came to a head when we were all on holiday to celebrate the end of our time at university. On the final night we went to a club and this Daniel came too. Nothing we could do to stop him. Daneil got drunk and said some very cutting and hurtful things to a friend that caused him to burst into tears. Vicious attacks on his personality and nasty stuff like that. When we told him that was not ok he grew aggressive and had to be evicted from the club. We thought that was the end of it and continued our night and myself and my girlfriend went home not long after and went to bed. 

However, when my friend came home Daniel was waiting for him and set on him, punching him repeatedly in the face. He has quite bad swelling and many cuts around his eye. 

When I heard about this I was furious. But the rest of my housemates are not willing to take a stand and prefer to ""stay out of things."" I feel that this is a dangerous position to take as I think it will enable daniel and allow things like this to happen again. I am scared for my friends, for myself, and especially for my girlfriend who has already been the victim of this. I tried to tell my housemates how I feel but they simply think alcohol is to blame and point to stupid things we have done when drunk (none of them violent, destructive or regular). My insistence that their apathy has in some way contributed to this situation and to our friends getting hurt was labelled ""disgusting"" and has led to myself and my girlfriend being ostracized from the group. On the way home from the holiday our injured friend was basically ignored as they rallied around Daniel, something I still cannot understand. 

I have ongoing mental health issues (anxiety/depression) that I am trying to work through and sort out but this situation is making me feel as if i am crazy. Are we in the wrong here? I just feel as if physically assaulting someone is a matter that has to be taking seriously, especially when it is backed up by such a long history of that behaviour with the individual. Pretending that it is ok or sweeping it under the rug is only going to make it easier for it to it to happen again. And I will not let my girlfriend get hurt again. I will not. 

I want to simply leave now and go home to my family to be away from all this because I feel I cannot take it any more. Though my plans were to stay in my university city, with Daniel and these apathetic ""friends"" of mine I no longer believe this is the best option for me. However, when I explained the situation to my father he said that I should not make any rash judgements and to ""wait and see.""

131,"Hello everyone

I got a job scheduled to start mid July. My current employer is a consulting company And because they were only giving me 16 hours per month. I took on a temporary job until my consulting company was able to find more work.

My consulting company job kept telling me they might have 2 clinics to work in but no official dates to start. So thinking that I can't survive on just 16 hours per month after my temp job was over; I kept applying elsewhere.

I was offered the job just this last week, and I wanted to be fair and help my current job so I emailed them and told them I wanted to work w them and let them know I couldn't take on any more accounts meaning more days of work because I found a full time job but that's I could continue w my current 2 days a month if they need me to.

Now the main boss is messaging me late at night telling me "" how come you never let me know you were seeking employment elsewhere , I had 3 days of work scheduled for July, if I would have know you wouldn't be available I would have not taken the work, and you are almost going to be full time here w me, I still want to talk to you this weekend"". He sounds pissed.

I told him I'll give him official 30 days if he needs me to (even if I have no official jobs for these 3 supposed clinics but my official start day is July 15). I mean his comments are straight out rude, zero professionalism.

How Should I handle this ? I want to end my consulting job since now I find the company's attitude a huge red flag. I mean it sounds like they never give anyone full time because they don't want to offer benefits that come along w being a full time employee. I want to end my job in a clean and professional way.

132,"Hi guys,

Basically, I was dismissed from a tech/retail job about two months ago for reasons that I won't get into but I don't feel it was done completely fairly and caused me a lot of unneeded stress and anxiety. That's a story for another time.

I'm only 20, I've dabbled with education but I prefer just working to be honest. I've got nearly 2 years experience with KPI-driven sales in tech/gadgets/computers and it's a strength that I'm glad I've built.

After being unemployed for all this time, I got applying to jobs, had interviews and didn't have much success until I got accepted to a job that is very similar to what I have done in the past and is still within selling gadgets, so it's what I know and I know I'm good at it, this is **Job 1**. However, I've only actually just finished training despite accepting the job almost 3 weeks ago and start through the week, next week. The job is only contracted to 16 hours and they are letting me flex up to match my needs (I live alone, don't rely on my parents). I'll be earning bonuses and commission on top of my hours still, but not having all the hours I'd really want is a bit frustrating, given I'd actually like to be working 40+ hours a week. The money is *alright* and honestly I could get by easily on this amount of money but the stability isn't quite there. Ideally I'd like to say that I could aim for progression in this role, I do feel capable of it and it is in fact a very strong company in the industry to work for, but I feel the short contract could withhold my potential. Also within this job, the work is definitely geared a lot more towards my age group and I've already started getting to know the team and I can genuinely say I'd have friends working here. Staying with this job is the easy option for now.

My hard option is the job that I've just been offered today. Gonna call this **Job 2**. It is still KPI-driven sales, but in a completely different setting and selling furniture. The money is much better (£5K+ extra a year, which is a lot to me), with an even better commission structure, and I've been advised that I could potentially be looking at becoming an assistant manager within two years due to the size of the store I'd be working at. Only thing being is that this job is in a completely different city, it isn't too far away and commuting is definitely an option, however I've never commuted to a job before, I hear mixed things from different people regarding it, I'm not sure if it's for me but I reckon I'd have to try it first before making a decision. I don't drive however, so I'd have to rely on public transport and the manager said the company doesn't cover travel costs. So I'd have to use a chunk out of the extra wage towards travelling alone. It is also a very respected company within the industry and they seem very enthusiastic about hiring me. Walking around and meeting the people in the stores, everyone is a lot older than me, I'd probably say the smallest age gap is probably about 15 years, so while I'd make acquaintances, I don't feel like I'd be very good friends with anyone I'm working this and I'd hate to think that this would have an effect on my work but I keep thinking if I resent showing up to some place 40+ hours a week with people I have nothing in common with, I'd grow very tired of it straight away.


__________________________________________________________________________________________
**The issues come around two main points.**


My first point is purely financial. The hard option would be to take this higher paying job(**2**), but I'd have to get to and from work for the first month on very little funds. I definitely do need help with getting my finances in order and this job could definitely set me up to getting on my feet regarding money and finally get me some stability. However, due to being unemployed, I'm nearly at the very end of what little money I had left, and doing some math, I'd genuinely have to choose between eating and getting to work for a month until I was getting a regular wage. This is so unbelievably frustrating, as it is a very good opportunity.

My second frustration is waiting so long for this original job(**1**) to start, that they've made a very good effort to finally get me trained, meeting my new team and getting to know the manager. I'm really excited to finally start working again and get some structure to my days. However, I feel like going in and telling them I'm leaving right after they've just spent all this money on training me, including an all-expenses-paid trip to another part of the country to get to know the processes and be accredited would be a big slap in the face and I fear they may even ask for some kind of compensation for this. I'd hate to be that guy, especially leaving them without staff as they had specifically assigned me to this store with the goal of boosting numbers as I had worked in a very similar role under the same company in a different chain with a good track record. 


___________________________________________________________________________________________


It's just very frustrating as a month ago I had no jobs and was growing very bitter and negative towards everything. Getting a job really boosted my outlook on everything and now I've got too many jobs and no clue how to deal with the decision. 

A lot of rambling, I do apologise. The new place has given me until Monday to make my decision, and my first day with the original place(**1**) is Tuesday, so it may be over before it even begins, which makes me think I'd cause even more issues for the staff and team in there, which is definitely not something I want to do as it is a very respected company which I have a lot of respect for and could possibly see myself maybe going back to the company at some point if given the option in the future, so I definitely don't want to burn any bridges.

tl;dr - offered two jobs in short space of time, already accepted one but new one with better money but tougher to live around has offered me a job with guaranteed progression, almost definitely can't afford to get to that job for the first month until my wage starts coming in

133,"My parents are incredibly strict, and I've for the most part been okay with it. I'm eighteen almost nineteen and I am planning a trip to another country. I have made up my mind about going, but my parents can't know till I'm leaving. How do I buy the ticket without them seeing? and any other travel advice?",24Jun2017,5
136,"My family... doesn't really have a lot of money to spare. We aren't exactly poor, but my Dad has some pretty major health issues that require a lot of doctors visits and medications. Added to that is the fact that I myself have some weird thing going on with my leg that has already cost something like 500+ bucks even *with* our insurance. I'm not privy to the exact details of our finances, but I don't really want to ask for a therapist when we can afford it. 

Added to that, if I ask for a therapist, my parents are going to ask me *why* I want to see one... and I don't really have a good reason for them. I haven't really had any kind of traumatic experience that would necessitate it, and I feel like most of my issues are just me being over-dramatic all of the time. And over-stressed? I usually only start having trouble mentally if I start getting stressed out, so it's not really a consistent thing... But I don't really feel like I 'deserve' therapy, if that makes any sense. 

And added to THAT is the fact that I recently turned 18, and my Dad has made it very, *very* clear that I'm going to have to start paying for my own medical stuff once I get a job. Since I'm getting a job to save up for college (starting this fall!) I doubt I would want to shell out my minimum wage for a therapist. I want to, but it's more like the wanting to get a cool video game than actually needing it like if I had a broken bone or something. 

But, in contrast, the reasons I want to ask in the first place;

 - Suicidal thoughts (without the intent to follow through, don't worry)

 - Low-grade but persistent paranoia (my parents don't love me, people are talking about me, something is wrong but I don't know what it is, etc.)

 - Overarching anxiety

 - Constant apathy, sluggishness, procrastination, have little-to-no will to get anything done

 - Constant exhaustion. Constant. 

 - (According to parents/that one military recruiter dude) A 'strange lack of self-confidence'. I have my doubts on this one. 



So really, I honestly cannot tell if my reluctance to ask is due to my mental health issues, or because I have legitimate concerns. This isn't asking for medical advice, since I'm already pretty sure I have depression or something, but... Do I really have to ask? I don't feel like these issues are currently affecting my quality of life to any great extent, and since I only really have 'episodes' when I get super heckin' stressed, it might not be worth it. Just avoiding stress might be enough to make everything, ah, 'go away'. That sounds way dumber now that I'm typing it out. Jeez. 

In any case, advice? ",24Jun2017,2

If my school was prestige one, I would be fine with it, but now its simple public school, and some worse guys weren't kicked out.

149,"So my SO of about a year and a half had a falling out about a month ago. It was about this point that I decided to end it, and I had regreted it, but had no idea how to get back into her life so I decided to just leave her be for awhile. I now realize this was a mistake but at the time, I figured if we had some space we could think about what we really wanted and come back to the relationship as stronger people. Anyways, a month goes by and we had contacted each other and decided to get lunch. I was planning on using this as an excuse to get back into her life and ask her for second chances, etc, etc. About half way through our lunch however, she tells me that she has been seeing someone, nothing serious but for about three weeks, which at this time would have only been about one week after our break up. She had described it at a fling she would have when she was drunk, and that they had sex a few different times, so I really wasn't that worried about it. But yesterday we had a conversation about it again and she tells me that it really wasn't just a drunk thing, they would go on day trips and have sex in a bunch in different places. This, paired with the getting with this dude one week after our break up is really what is bothering me. We are working this out and I know eventually I'll be over this because I've already forgiven her for the overall thing. I'm just trying not to be petty and an asshole to her because I know that's how I want to act, but that won't help anyone. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has been in this situation and what has helped them get over a partner having sex with someone else. We already talk way more than we did before the break up, and I feel like our communication skills are way better now. So that's helping little by little but is there a more for sure way?

TL;DR 
broke up with girlfriend of a year and a half and she started seeing someone as a drunk fling, turned out he was an emotional rebound that had sex with her a lot more than the made it seem.

150,"I seem to quickly grow attached to people. Then I get hurt, but for some reason I keep on doing it.

I tried to be more distant and not letting them getting into my life but doesn't work. It seems like I'm afraid of being lonely when I push people away,  I am always too committed. I feel needy at times even though I fight it. However, I always end up being too over attached. I mean, I tend to fall in love with pretty much every girl I talk to. 

And I can't cut people off as I worry too much and I like them too much. I tried focusing on my stuff but it proved impossible because I can't focus without thinking about the person I've fallen in love with. 

I don't know, connecting with people is hard for me despite the fact that I get along with everyone I meet. I don't know what to do. I also have depression though it wasn't diagnosed but I'm sure I have it. Going to therapy is out of my reach. I have no means to do it. 

I don't know, I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of bring a secondary person and care too much. I just want to be cold so I won't get hurt, but that isn't easy for a person who fears loneliness.

151,"Hello, a week ago a I was woken by a cat crying in my garden, and as there are many feral cats in the area I ignored it and went back to sleep. In the morning I kept hearing it, so I climbed the roof and scanned my garden, that is walled, and surrounded by italian cypresses and surprise, the cat was in the top branches of my araucaria columnaris whis is over 22mts high. I read a bit online and decided to put a tuna can by the tree to bring it down. No success. Tried to spray it with a power washer from the roof couple of days later, to no avail, the spray is not even close. That was a week ago. I cannot climb the tree, the branches are to close to one another and I refuse to damage the tree, which my mother planted over 40 years ago. The tree cannot be reached by crane or any other machine without destroying the garden walls (concrete)and a couple of other trees. This is Mexico and so, professional help from an arborist is not an option(the city is in a desert basically).

Today I received a treatening letter from someone who claims to be a neighbor and the owner of the cat. Basically acusing me of kidnapping it(it has been crying a lot). Does anyone have any idea on how to bring it down? Is there any chance the cat would come down if it hears its owner?

155,"This girl, we aren't dating but I guess we can be friend with benefits, invited me to stay the night with her because she was home alone. I stayed over, really for the first time since we usually do things at my apartment. 

But her room smelt pretty bad. Like ass and oder and just... bad. I mentioned it without technically mentioning it and she says she doesn't smell anything. Her room was also messy and junky, even had old panties she wore days ago on the floor, old clothes in the corner, bottles, cans. It was very messy. I ignored that but it got worse when we got intimate and she took off her clothes, I sort of blabbed out did you bathe? And she says yes. But goes to take a VERY quick shower. 

&gt; Trust me, at my apartment she really isn't that gross. But then again when I think about it, she occasionally has an oder but I never paid much attention. I know her vagina tastes pretty bad.

When she got out, she smelt ok, but there was still a oder in her room. We started doing it, she was on top, reverse cowgirl, and flys started buzzing around, two literally on her ass and one was crawling to her asshole, I jumped back and she gets annoyed, we switched to normal cowgirl with her facing me and now one is on her arm, it flys to her breast, and on her nipple. I'm just grossed out tbh, worse is 2 flys started spinning around her vagina, and since my dick was there I stopped again. We switch to doggystyle and that went well untill she started queefing and an oder came which made me ask her is she just queefing... that pissed her off. So for awhile she sprayed spray everywhere, didn't help much but we finished.

Afterwards what really got me was instead of putting on what she had. She accidentally put on those panties she wore days ago that was on her floor. After that she wanted to watch a movie but I made an excuse to leave and haven't texted since... so yeah.

TL;DR Should I continue with this stinky slob, she's pretty hot, I mean everyone else wants her. But yeah, she has a bad oder. And apparently she's even more gross in her privacy since flys didn't even bother her. I mean... is this a reason to stop talking to someone?",24Jun2017,22

Let me introduce myself first. I'm an 18 year old boy from Malaysia. What happened was, about 6 years ago, on a regular Wednesday, I was watching Naked Science(nearing towards the end) at the National Geographic channel. It was about how the universe will be in the future. At the end of the show, one of the guys who works in NASA i think, says that in the future, the universe will be fully black and life won't exist, and that affected me badly and deeply at the age of 13. Until now, the thought somehow pops in my mind several times a day. After 5 years, i finally stopped thinking about it and slowly forgetting it, however it came back and started to haunt me again. I'll try my very best not to think about it, but somehow it comes back, again and again. Whenever I think about that unintentionally, i feel fake, the life around me feels fictional, I'd think of dying so that i don't have to worry this shit anymore, but at the same time i'm scared whether i won't have this life again. I will start to really miss my parents, my friends, relatives even though they're still around and think of what's after death? What happens if LIFE doesn't exist anymore? WHAT'S AFTER IT? And all of these will lead me to crying, which will then make me emotionally depressed(fucked). If i had just watched another channel, or didn't watch tv during that moment, I will be living happily as every other human being out there. These thoughts have made me completely hate life. Even in the Matrix movie, the people who are trapped in the Matrix are totally unaware and just living their life, but in my case, i'm emotionally dying everyday. Why God would want to create something truly magical, then make it temporary? All of these thoughts are keep running in my mind. I just want to live the life every other human being is living, and not think about these. I can't forget it, but i'm trying very hard to lead a happier life. I like this life, my parents, friends, relatives, the country where i was born, my life. To find out these are temporary just makes me really down and depressed. Life is cruel, unforgiving, not magical. I'm emotionally dead sad inside.
Right now, i need to forget the incident that happened 6 years ago, and all of these torture i'm experiencing right now. Please help me. Suggest me some effective ways to completely forget all these shit, motivate me with some really nice, happy-go-lucky words and of course, i definitely need advice from you people. Help me erase this painful memory.

I wanna forget it, but at the same time i can't stop thinking about it. Im fucked...upside down.

Will we still exist? What's after LIFE? Can we live rhis life forever someday? What's gonna happen??? These questions are too scary and depressing for me. I just don't want to think all of these and live my life. I just don't know how.",24Jun2017,1

That she was the female version of him and he wanted her like he had never wanted anyone else and was gonna ask her out... She rejected him and they became friends. 

She became promiscuous and that's okay, it's her business. She would always call us with relationship issues and such. She finally broke up with her boyfriend but... now I've noticed something. 

On his phone now he always has her Facebook message bubble, no matter what he's doing. He had his face in his phone when we went for dinner a few days ago... and when I grabbed his phone he grabbed mine and said 'if you text someone, I text someone.' I have nothing to hide at all so it was okay but he seemed a but nervous. 

I've never wanted to be the kind of girlfriend that gets jealous and goes thru his messages but honestly... he's been messaging the woman that used to be his dream girl nonstop since she broke up with her boyfriend. Maybe he doesn't want to deal with me anymore.

So I am a loner/introverted person.  I dont have any friends but I have been ok with it until recently.

She uses a ring on her finger so I never bother to ask or accept her advances since i thought she was married and I really respect that bond. This went on for around 6 months,  when eventually another male co-worker started talking to her.  This is when I asked her if she was married, and she confirmed she wasnt.  By now its too late since they are going out and I feel really stupid and heartbroken since I could have asked her out.

172,"Hi reddit,

I recently got scammed online. Bought a digital good in the hundreds of dollars through an auction site (not ebay) and the person ripped me off. Luckily I used PayPal so I'm not too worried about not getting back the money.

Using a clue left behind by the scammer, I was able to build up a pretty good picture of who this person is.

Details that I've found so far are:
- email addresses
- first, middle and last names
- social media profiles: Facebook and myspace
- parents' names and home address
- city and state they are from
- potential places they have lived
- approximate age

Something else that found which is circumstantial: this scammer might be in the US military. This is from pictures that were posted online and from a zip code that is an area covered only by a US military base.

I've gotten advice from a friend that I should put in a police report to get an official compliant of fraud but the only problem is that I live in Australia and the scammer lives on the US mainland.

176,"Its basically the title. I was involved in a car accident a while back and I was declared at fault. I have liability insurance. Both the other party's insurance and my insurance said I was at fault. The car is completely totaled.

Now I have a big lump of scrap metal and I don't understand all the ways to go about getting rid of it. What do people usually do?

I understand that a lot of the time your insurance is just supposed to buy your car from you and they take care of it, but I have liability so I don't think they're going to help.

The most rational thing I can think of is calling a junkyard and having them buy it off me, but I don't know all the steps to do this - apparently you have to officially sell them your car, and transfer the title; I still have a 'clean' title technically since apparently you only get the salvage title designation after your insurance buys the totaled car from you.

What are precise steps I should go about getting rid of my totaled car? Any help is appreciated! Or you can direct me to a more specialized subreddit that might have more experience with this haha (couldn't exactly find one). Thanks!",24Jun2017,1
177,"So to clarify, my girlfriend and I plan on getting married in Arkansas on the Buffalo National River next year. That is where we had our first camping trip together and thought it would be a great place to get married at. We don't plan on inviting any of our family or friends, only one mutal friend who would oversee the very small ceremony. I told my mother about our plans and she completely blew up and said, ""You were raised better than this."" ""But thats fine, we are obviously not important,"" and so on. Sure, I understand not seeing your first born get married might hurt, but it's not her wedding. It's not that we are not inviting family because we don't love them (I keep telling her that) Arkansas and our camping trip is where her and I fell in love and it was a very special and private place for us and we want to keep it that way. We don't want to layer it with family and friends or have to move location because people feel entitled to fill a seat because they raised me. As I type this she is talking about disowning me and removing me from any inheitance. For context, I'm 23 and I don't live with her. I'm visiting town for a doctors appointment. Am I wrong for not wanting to have family? I don't feel like I should compromise. I thought I had good news to share, but she did not want any of it. ",24Jun2017,8

But the reality of the situation isn't so grand. I'm short and not a particularly good-looking man so attracting a girl will be a challenge in itself. I'm socially awkward and have made few friends in my lifetime so that doesn't help things. Aside from school, I don't go out of the house much, making it tough for me to meet any girls in the first place.

All in all, even with a decent job, I may not be able to start a family like I wanted.

One day, we talked about the look of the others and i told her that she didn't need to worry because she was [The brightest star i've ever seen], and she told me to not say things like that, she knew it was to help but she didn't want to hear it.

196,"Situation: My wife and I belonged to a gym for a few months. It was a small place, around 30 members. It was owned by one guy who was a former wrestler. He was pretty nice at first and we became friendly. Over time, however, we started to see that he wasn't as stable as he first appeared. I tended to workout in the early AM and there were a couple of times he just didn't show up. His workouts were a little lacking in originality, but I passed that off because we were friends. Anyway, most recently, dude just disappeared for 24 hours. Didn't come home, nothing. There were a few of us there the morning that he was out of contact and didn't know what to think or do. We just went home or in our case to another gym we had membership with. In the last few days, he has totally gone off on my wife and I for deciding not to come back. 

So, my question is this: should I write our experiences in an honest review online? Thinking Yelp, Google, possibly Facebook. He's an advid Facebook user and I know he'd see it immediately. Thing is, I think it would kill his business completely. Everyone who is still there is pretty loyal to him and think my wife and I are the garbage in this situation.

200,"My cat, Twilight, got out 5 or 6 days ago (I've been losing a lot of sleep over this, so it's been hard to keep track) and has not returned since. The weather has been absolutely dreadful; it's been very hot (high 80s, low 90s), very humid (70-80%), and has been raining almost every day since then. I've sat out in the rain, I go out multiple times a day for hours looking for her in my yard, in my neighbor's yard, and along some dirt paths, I go out every night 1-5am, but I cannot find any sign of her.

I live in a fairly rural area with only three neighbors and a large amount of woods with a neighborhood a couple of miles off. I can't physically search the woods as half of it is surrounded by a cow pen I cannot trespass into safely (bulls) and being an amputee with severe anxiety, it's very difficult for me to trek to the other half since it's far off past a solar panel field and a very rough terrain, maybe about half a mile off in the opposite direction from where she escaped. I've put up flyers on a couple of stop signs and in the neighborhood, but I'm hoping to really double down on that and put them wherever I can.

Is there anything else I can do?

201,"My mother and I always had a very rocky relationship growing up. 
 
She would constantly put me down in front of my peers - body shaming me at parties while I was in a bathing suit - and encourage the other girls to mock me about my body when I was a teenager. She would say very hurtful things about me being untalented, unintelligent, rude yet when I brought it up with her she would fly into a rage and tell me I was making things up.  Sometimes she would get physical with me and hit me yet whenever this would get brought up she would pretend it never happened.  She had me medicated - I was told later by medical professionals I didn't need medication as there was nothing wrong with me - and would threaten to put me away in mental institutions if I disobeyed her.

I later found out - several therapists later - that she was a narcissistic mom.  I always felt love was a conditional thing and I was never enough, all of that stuff.  It took me a lot of time to accept this because for the longest time I thought I was crazy and she was this perfect person that she built herself up to be.  I experienced a lot of rage and grief and am working on myself - in the process of recovery from her and my father.  I've made significant strides and can now see through her lies and manipulations.  Her behavior hurts me less and I have higher self esteem and confidence now that I have realized what she is.

That being said, I've noticed when I'm in contact with her, it's very hard for me to burry the rage inside me.  When she says hurtful things or goes about her usual manipulations I lash out at her - obviously this hurts her.  I feel less and less empathy for her every time we interact because I can't move past the pain she put me through.

I'm a perfectly well adjusted person with a great career, loving friends, and a lot of interests.  I have made significant strides in healing from this and find her less and less triggering (or the reactions to her triggers less severe.) Yet whenever I speak to her, I become somebody I don't like.  This leads me to the question of whether or not it would be beneficial to cut contact with her because I am not sure I can continue this cycle of rage, grief and guilt much longer.

Has anybody done no contact with their mother? When is the time to do it? This is not something I take lightly. Thanks.",24Jun2017,1
202,"I'm going to give the details of my situation after this opening but if you just want the tl;dr, it's that I recently graduated from college and don't have career job (working minimum wage) or friends and haven't really been happy since around the time high school ended, I'm taking steps to alleviate my career problem but not really anything else. What do you recommend I do?

Anyways, five years ago when I went off to college, I don't really think I was ready or wanted to go to college, it was mostly just something I was doing because my parents pressured me to and wanted me to do and were paying for. But in 2012 if I could have chosen between going to college and doing another year of high school, I definitely would have chosen high school. I wasn't ready to take care of things on my own, and I wasn't ready to take college-level classes, and I didn't really have much in common with other young adults (still basically felt like a young teenager mentally). 

I started out a computer science major, but didn't like it and didn't have the academic skills or motivation to complete it. I had an undiagnosed learning disability for a lot of college as well so I would put in a lot of effort in my classes and wouldn't see results from that at all. This caused me to be very depressed and put less and less effort into my computer science classes. I switched to business and made my computer science a minor, and doing this set me back an extra year. I did fairly well in business overall. The year before last Summer I searched for internships (admittedly didn't put a lot of effort into that) and was unsuccessful in finding any. The year before this Summer I searched for jobs and paid internships (which I did put quite a bit of effort into) and was unsuccessful in finding any again, though I did have quite a few interviews, just never got past that stage. I feel like applying to any kind of graduate school would be a waste of time because my GPA is below a 3.0 (failed a lot of classes when I was a computer science major, but my major GPA is decent, well above a 3.0). 

Right now I'm just working at a local Sandwich shop and focusing on that. I plan on going back to school in the fall and taking more classes for a supplementary data science concentration program. I don't know how much that will help me find a job though?

As for friends and social things, I have Asperger's Syndrome, so social things have historically been difficult for me, but in my childhood it wasn't hard for me to find friends. I never really jived well with my college body though. When I got there I had very little interest in making friends, I just kind of went in with the mentality of ""I want to get my degree and get out,"" due to the aforementioned not wanting to be there. I never went to any parties or did anything crazy, which honestly part of me regrets (though maybe I wouldn't have liked parties since I don't drink or dance). Despite this I made friends in my dorm building partway through Freshmen Year, and we remained good friends for a year. Partway through Sophomore year we had a falling out due to misunderstandings and mistakes both me and my friends made, and while we're on decent terms now (judging by times I saw them on campus after that) I don't think any of them have any interest in hanging out with me any more. 

After that though, my experience with trying to make friends has been kind of miserable. I lived in a single apartment after that since dorms were mostly for Freshmen/Sophomores. I joined a club junior year, and I was initially pretty happy with that; it was a club for something I was passionate about and the people in it seemed really cool. However, I always got the impression they found me annoying and didn't like having me around. I think I said something hurtful by accident once, and I think I was just really awkward (because of aforementioned AS). In subsequent years I was a lot less active and only showed up to a few meetings a year because of this. I also tried talking to people in classes sometimes, but no one seemed to want to. The university was really clique-heavy and everyone seemed to plan out their schedule with their friends so that they would take them as a group, so I was always kind of the only person in my classes without a friend. A lot of people in the business school seemed like kind of douchey dudebros as well (I guess I'm unfairly stereotyping here though). I think in the last year of college I just kind of gave up and stopped talking to people completely. I feel kind of shitty about this since everyone I know who went to college and lived on campus at least made friends. 

Anyways I've been depressed for a while now and I think the sources of that are pretty obvious here. Any advice on where to go from here? What I should do, where I should go?",24Jun2017,2
204,"I had a close friend do something that has left me very angry, and feeling intruded upon and disrespected. This is a *little* lengthy, but advice and support would be appreciated.

I've been close friends with these two people (Josie* and Trevor*) for about 2 years now. We're all in our early 30s, and I expect a certain amount of maturity and respect from them both. 

The other day, Josie called me and told me that she and Trevor wanted to go see a movie that evening, and that they wanted me to come with them. While it sounded like fun, I was very sick that night, and had been for about a week prior (and they both knew this very well). Not only was I sick, but I was entertaining a guest (my fiance's brother), so I'd spent all day cleaning the house and getting it ready for him to spend the night, while ill. It was one of those things where if I'd cancelled on him and asked him not to come, he and my faince would have been very disappointed, because they don't get to see each other a lot, and he were coming from a long way.

So like I said, I just told Josie on the phone that as much as I'd love to go see the movie with them, I couldn't because I was still not feeling well at all, and I also had spent the entire day getting the house ready for my fiance's brother to stay the night, and as a result felt even more tired and sick. I explained that because of those things, I really needed to stay at home that night, not just for my guest, but also because I was pretty sure I was going to start throwing up again at some point that night (I could just tell it was going to happen, you know the feeling...), and didn't want to be stuck in public at a 2 and a half hour- long movie, battling severe nausea and running back and forth between the theater and the bathroom, or risk barfing right there in theater. I also explained that my fiance and I didn't have enough money for a ticket that night, and wouldn't get paid until that next Tuesday, so that that was another reason I could not go.

She told me she understood and that it was fine, but asked if she and Trevor could come visit me for about 20 minutes before they went to the movie, because they'd missed me all week (again, had been very sick, and couldn't hang out that week). I said sure, it would be nice to see them for a few minutes, if they wanted to stop by before they went to the movie.

So they come over, and have a seat in the living room with my fiance and his brother. Josie had swung by a coffee shop on the way, and bought me an iced coffee. I thanked her despite my intense nausea, because it was nice of her to buy me a treat, and drank it to be polite. We all just kind of sat there, watching a movie my fiance and his brother had rented, and all was good.

10 minutes into the movie, Josie goes ""So... we going to the movie or what?"" and she smiles at me, and gives me this really expectant look. So does Trevor. 

I asked ""What do you mean?"" And she said ""Well, the movie starts in about 15 minutes, so we need to get going if we're going to make it. Are we going?..."" and she and Trevor both kind of lean in, and give me that same expectant look. 

I said ""I thought I told you on the phone that not only do I not have any money to pay for a ticket, I've got a houseguest, AND I'm still feeling really sick."" I explained to them both-- AGAIN-- that I was pretty sure I was going to throw up in the next hour, and didn't want to be stuck in public for a couple hours feeling like that. 

Then she said ""Well, the thing is, if you don't go with us, we can't go..."" and explained to me that while her husband is okay with her having a male friend, he is not okay with her going certain places (like the movies, or out to eat) alone with another guy, without another female present, and then she goes ""Also, I have a reputation, remember?"" and told me how she was worried if she went to the movies alone with Trevor, people would start talking and maybe tattle on her to her husband. (There was a rumor going around about her earlier this year that she'd cheated on her husband, and now she isn't comfortable going certain places alone with male friends, lest someone she knows sees her, and decides to gossip some more.)

So, when she finished explaining to me why it was imperative for me to basically chaperone them along to this movie, she and Trevor both just did that thing again where they smiled very expectantly and leaned in towards me, while looking back and forth between me and the clock on the wall, suggesting that I needed to hurry up and say yes so we could all make this movie...

But I stood my ground and said ""Josie, I'm sorry. But I told you on the phone that I don't have the money for a ticket, AND that I'm not feeling well enough to go, AND that I have a guest. I'm sorry, but I just don't feel well enough to go with you guys."" Then I told them that if they really wanted to go to the movies, they could go just to the two of them, and I'll stick up for them if anyone they knew was there and saw them, and starts to ask weird questions. 

She basically just kept saying ""No, we need you to go, too. I can't go alone with Trevor. Come on, he and I both REALLY want to see this movie, and if you don't go, we don't get to see it... SO..."" and then when she said ""SO..."", she did that thing-- fucking AGAIN!-- where she smiled and leaned in, trying to pressure me and get me to say yes.

I told her no again, and said I was sorry, but just couldn't. She got really dissapointed, as did Trevor, and she kind of just gave me this really disappointed look and said ""It's fine, I guess..."" while basically letting me know with her tone of voice that it WASN'T fine, and that I'd really let her down.

*SIGH*... I want to say that normally she and Trevor are good friends. They've been supportive about my chronic illness, and are normally very understanding when I have to turn down invites to hang out or go do something when I'm not feeling well, because they knew before we got close that I was battling several different chronic illnesses. They're usually really great about it. But sometimes when Josie wants something, and wants it REALLY badly (like to see that movie), she's not good at taking no as my answer, no matter how many times I say no, and explain that I'm not feeling well that day. And I'm angrier at her than at Trevor, because I know her well enough to suspect that after she hung up with me, she probably told Trevor that I was just ""unsure"" of whether or not I wanted to go, but that I could be persuaded. So, I feel that him helping me pressure me was because Josie didn't exactly tell him the entire story as to why I couldn't go that night. He's more reasonable than she is, and I feel that she probably gave him an edited version of what I told her, and that I was probably just being wishy-washy on going.

But this specific time was the worst she's ever acted about it, and it really made me angry. I feel very disrespected, and I feel like she really didn't care how I felt, or what I needed. I did not appreciate being pressured into going to that movie right in front of my fiance and his brother (who were both getting uncomfortable with her pressuring me), when I'd already told her no. I told her right there in the living room that I was severely nauseated, and was going to throw up at some point (which I did, like 10 minutes after that conversation), and she said ""That's okay. Trevor is kind of nauseated too, and if you need to throw up in the bathroom or even on the floor of the movie theater, we won't hold it against you, so let's go anyway!"" Again, completely disregarding how sick I felt, and that I was so uncomfortable with the idea of being stuck in public and having to throw up there. 

I also feel like she bought me that coffee so I'd feel like I had to ""pay her back"" by going to the movie with them. I feel like it was leverage, so that I'd feel like I had to say yes. I also feel like her reason for wanting to come visit me before going to see the movie, was to come to my house and pressure me to go. That she planned on pressuring me into going all along by coming to my house, and bringing me a coffee as a guilt-trip, and that she probably counted on her using face-to-face manipulation as a better way of getting to agree.

I know this sounds like small beans, but I'm just so angry. I feel so disregarded and disrespected right now. She knows how badly I struggle with health problems, and that when I say that I need to stay home and rest, that that's what I need. I'm so angry that she actually had no intention of honoring my saying no and why that night, and how she tried to go about getting her way. She had absolutely no respect for what I was dealing with, and just wanted her way, my feelings and illness be damned. And she tried to make me feel *so responsible* for her not getting to see the movie, though she knew I'd have gone if I was feeling well, and had had the money to spend, and had not had a guest over to see to that night, as well. I'm just so angry at the disrespect, and at her trying to make me feel responsible. 

I'm also angry, because of how much I've been there for her, even during times when I was sick and should have been resting. When she was having marriage troubles, and dealing with people gossiping about her, she practically had a breakdown, and I was there for her several nights a week, sometimes into the wee hours of morning, when I needed to conserve energy for other responsibilities the next day, and get some rest/take care of myself. I've really been there for her, and have, at times, sacrificed my actual health, the rest I needed, and time with other people who also don't get to see me much because of how often I'm ill, just to help her out and support her... While I don't mind doing these things for a friend when they REALLY need me, I feel like her behavior the other night is a pretty poor way to repay me for these things.

I've been dealing with chronic illness since I was a teenager, and it gets hard letting people down. It really does. I've lost friends, and even family members, over my being so sick so often, and it's painful. Those friends weren't exactly understanding of my not being able to do what they wanted all the time either, which is one of the reasons we are not friends anymore. It sucks, and it makes me feel even worse when people in my life actively disregard my needs and wishes. Especially when they do it in such a planned, manipulative, intrusive way, the way Josie did a few nights ago.

Am I being unreasonable for feeling so angry about her behavior right now? Should I sit her down for yet another talk about my chronic illnesses? I do get tired of having to explain and re-explain to my friends and family, why I can't always do what they want me to do...

Any advice or support would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this, as I know it was long.

209,"I'm only 14 years old but I feel so constricted in life. I know I need to get an education and I do great academically but I just do not have a life at all. My parents hate me, I live in a little irrelevant suburb in England and I have no friends. People talk to me at school but nobody wants to do anything with me outside of school. And honestly I don't think i'd be happy even if I had friends. Most people at my school are simple minded (not to criticise them, I was the definition of simpIe minded until I had this huge crisis last year) and I hate where i'm living. I'm breaking down everyday. I can't even get a job because of my age. The only things I live for are being attractive and waiting for school to end. I know i'm privileged but i'm just becoming so numb and all I want to do is get out into the world and experience things. I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy other than when I was on holiday last year. If there's anyway for me to somehow get out into the world that'd be great, and if you're just going to comment 'hold on and get your education' don't bother because i've already heard it a million times. I don't know how to articulate my feelings about this without sounding like a pompous twat but please trust me on that i'm not.",24Jun2017,2
210,"Hi,

Whenever Im the centre of attention I stop thinking. Instead of being rational, I react intuitive by making jokes or witty remarks. I dont like that about myself, because being funny is ok from time to time, but thats just one side of me. Im much more than a joky dude. 
For example: I call myself a thinker, I strive to be empathic and I try hard to do good. 
But I feel like thats not what people see. And that, that makes me self-conscious about my behaviour. 

Aside of: don't focus too much about what other people think, what advice would you give me? What would you propose me to do, whenever Im in _that_ spot again?

Thanks for reading

Edit: so being funny is like a coping mechanism, but not always how I want to be

211,"Mom hired a handyman to do some basic work around the house such as painting and building a trellis for a wedding event. It was a random name she found on google I guess. The job was for $180. He came to the house asked her to pay him $40 cash so that he could buy the material and then the $140 after the work is done, and she signed the work order. He's been ducking and dodging my mom's text messages for the past 4 days with different excuses. ""Oh my van broke down today, Oh my phone's battery died..."" We don't really know what to do. I know small claims court would cost more than the actual amount itself. My mom keeps entertaining him via text message about taking action if he doesn't return the money for a job he didn't do, and now he says he's going to serve us papers for not paying him his full amount. Like what the fuck. My friend said its very easy for someone you hire privately to file for worker's comp so now it could get even worse than just $40 or $180.

213,"I'm not 100% sure that this is the right sub but I'm really hoping it is and something good can come from this! Here we go...

Long story short: 76 year old granny has been getting scammed for 2+ years from a ""soldier in Iraq"" and is supposedly getting married to him when he returns home. Has now had her identity stolen - but isn't telling my aunt or uncle (whom she lives with). She leaked SSN, names, address, credit cards, bank cards, has stolen cards from stores, and stole 500+ dollars from myself, brother-in-law, and aunt. She has opened new loans totaling $8,000+ to help this scam continues.

My aunt and uncle have been dragging their feet for 2 years after I called her out on it originally about it being a scam. At the time, I deleted all accounts but they helped her buy a new tablet and recover all accounts. Recently, I have discovered that my name and my SO's name have been passed on to these people.

I have months upon months of conversations between the two of them, addresses of where she is sending packages and money, receipts, the cards she sent, and messages threatening to kill himself if she gives up on him.

I have an awful relationship with this woman, but I don't want something bad to come of this with my name being out there. I'm stuck with all of this info but unsure how to proceed due to its nature. So, I guess my question for all of you out there is: how do I utilize this information in preventing her from getting scammed further and get our names cleared?",24Jun2017,1
214,"I'm struggling with the decision to move to Toronto Canada primarily for the following reasons;

**Free healthcare with comparatively not much higher wait times**
I'm more concerned with being able to handle worst case scenarios without the threat of bankruptcy. I'm looking into supplemental plans and plans that include catastrophic coverage.
I have health, vision, and dental from my employer but sill had to meet a 5k deducible for a tricky wisdom teeth removal procedure.

**More down to Earth society** more focused on cooperation rather than competition over social status, and a higher happiness index rating [source](http://worldhappiness.report/). I understand human nature is human nature, but it's very profound where I live and people are very rude (South Florida) [example](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081227210500AAfrYzL). I realize I can always look harder for better people by doing things like volunteering or getting involved in activist activities. This aspect is important to me as I'm tired of working for abusive employers and being disappointed in my dating life by.. untrustworthy people doing untrustworthy things in a relationship.

Toronto is within affordable flight distance from my family here, but I also don't like not being able to just get in the car and being able to visit or help out if needed.

218,"As the title suggests, I need help getting over an ex. It was a brutal break up after 2yrs of being together. She broke up with me over text two weeks before college started and she later chose to date someone else who was a close friend of mine. In the beginning, I really struggled physically and emotionally. I would quite often have panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I couldn't sleep for weeks at a time and I ended up losing 30lbs as I couldn't eat a meal. It's been nearly a year since she left and I still feel attached and think about her all the time. I've managed to beat all of the physical aspects of depression, but the mental ones have stuck with me. I still struggle to keep my confidence and ego up. The thing that is hardest about the ordeal is the fact that she was my best friend before we started dating so when I lost her, I also lost my best friend. I've started working out and doing things that most people recommend but I still feel this drag in my life. It's this hole in my heart that I feel can't be filled until I meet someone else. The only problem being that I'm not a very social person and my ex is the only girl i've ever dated. I hate the fact that I've trained myself to see dating as this holy grail of happiness. I wish I could be happy while being single, but I simply enjoy the feeling of being with someone so much. It's really nice to have someone to talk to and always have plans with. There are times where I feel real happiness with my friends, but eventually i'll slip back to missing her again.

Her and I share a car (hers died and were clearly broke). I work part time because it's all I can do, and she can't work due to disabilities. The people we live with are financially unstable and the breadwinner of the house just killed himself, leaving it only a matter of time before foreclosure. 

I don't know what to do. I can't afford to live on campus without a job and can't get to the job without a car, but can't take the car from my mom nor can I leave her to be homeless without me. She's my responsibility. 

We live in Florida. Rent is insanely high, like we can't afford anything. We were only paying  $300 where we are now, and we still are struggling.

Section 8/HUD hasn't accepted new applications in over five years. We've called every 6 months for a long long time, because we used to be on it. Also not even sure college students can use Section 8, and I'm the technical breadwinner.

221,"I graduated from high school in 2015. I earned my real estate license as soon as I turned 18 and I’ve been working in sales and attending college ever since. For the past two years, I’ve been going to school, taking classes full-time and working full-time. I have been paying for college, car payment, gas, food, etc. on my own. My parents have been generous enough to let me live with them while doing all of this, they are also paying for my phone, insurance, electricity and letting me live rent free. Which has been a huge financial advantage. 

Also, the location of our home is very convenient, we live 10 minutes from the community college which I went to school. That same school offers several bachelor’s degree programs, which I’m utilizing to complete my degree as quickly, cheaply and painlessly as possible.

I haven’t thought much of living with my parents for the past two years, while I’ve been going to school and working. This is mostly because I’ve had my head buried in books and work. I haven’t had either a positive or negative opinion of living with my parents until now, as graduation is lurking around the corner – only 2 months away.

I love my parents and appreciate everything they’ve provided over the years, although I feel misplaced at times. I feel almost as if something is missing in my life. I also feel painfully guilty for allowing my parents to provide for me. 

Now, I’m 20 years old and I will be graduating this August (2 months). I feel guilty for not living on my own by now. I will feel especially guilty for not having the ‘crutch’ of school that would make it acceptable for me to live at home.

I also feel as though I’m missing out on a lot of standard college experiences – living away from home, gaining independence, exposing myself to more people, dating, partying – all of it. 

I want the independence and social life, but I also want to make sound decisions in regards to my future.

Here’s my current financial situation: my student debt is $10,000 and my car loan balance is $16,000. I make about $30,000 per year in a commission-only sales position, I can only see this number increasing once I graduate and start working more hours. 

In my view, I have two options and five sub-options going forward:
• Move out when I graduate (2 months):
          o Townhome for a couple of years then buy a home
          o Trail run of moving out then saving for future
• Pay off all my debt (student loans, car, credit cards, etc.) then move out:
          o Townhome (while saving for a home slowly)
          o Buy a home (by staying at my parents’ home longer)
          o Buy a multi-family home and rent to tenants

If I move out when I graduate, I will most likely rent a townhome at the nearest university (15-20) minutes from home. The rent will be around $600 a month and that includes utilities. I will have the additional cost of food, car payment, insurance, student loans, etc. I can afford this on my anticipated income, but it will delay my debt pay-off. It would most likely take 5-7 years to save up for a decent ($15,000) down-payment on a home and pay off all my loans. I would be 25-27 when I buy a home.

Additionally, I could do a trail run of moving out. Sign a 6 to 12-month lease and plan to move back once I get the experiences I’m looking for. I could move back home and begin saving for my future (an actual home) and begin paying off debt. I would have the experiences I was looking for and only delay debt pay-off by a year. I would be 22 when I paid off all my debt and 24 when I buy a home.

Another option is to pay off my debt then move out. If I am aggressive with my debt pay-off, I can be out of debt by Dec. 2018 (a year and a half, at most). I could get a townhome very easily and the experiences I’m looking for, and I will only be 21 when I do it (nearly 22). With no debt, I would be able to save extra money that would be going towards a car payment and student loans ($600 a month), which could go towards buying a house. It would take two years to save $15,000 as a down-payment. I would be able to buy a home at 24.

Additionally, I could pay off my debt by Dec. 2018 and stay at home to save up for buying a home, which would probably take another year. I would be 22 (nearly 23) and have no debt with $15,000+ for a down-payment which is plenty where I live. This would allow me to purchase a home and have no additional debt besides a mortgage at around 23 years old. The only problem I see with this, is I feel like I will be too old to do the normal college-aged things like party and have roommates, force social contacts, etc. 

An adaptation of this would have me paying off debt and saving for a multi-family home. I would most likely be 23 with no debt and $15,000 cash. I could but a multi-family home near the campus I want to live by and rent it to college students who will help me pay off my mortgage. The only downside to this would be being older than everyone when I begin my “college experience” phase. But I would be set financially for the rest of my life. As I mentioned earlier, I’m a real estate agent so I have access to funding and lenders, financing this property on my income wouldn’t be a problem.

Please provide some guidance as to what you would do if you were in my situation. Thank you.

Graduation is a huge turning point in my life.

227,"

My older brother who's 24 yo, is someone with a disgusting way of self expression. 
I'll elaborate about him so you can understand me better and try to help me better:

For example, now we just sat in front of the tv and he started talking about one of my friends, she's quite hot but he hates her personality bc she speaks her mind. 
""I'll fuck the shit out of her hole. But damn I'd punch her head right after""
I just sat there disgusted and it came to a point I can't even look at him when he talks to me. 
It's been like that forever, he's that type of a guy who hates everyone and everything and swears his surroundings, sometimes even us the brothers and our parents!

I'm gay and I'm 22 and he uses the word fag and gay as a part of a string of curses he says about people who annoyed him occasionally. He knows I hate it, I told him about it SO many times and once even cried to him, I told him it feels as if he hates me and that he does that intentionally but he was sweet and said no and that he's sorry etc. 
but I feel that it changed and he keeps doing that and every time he talks about someone annoying, when the string of curses begins I get scared of maybe he'll use the word gay or fag in that string. 

Anyway, he's a pain in the ass and my family is also quite homophobic, life's hard here (not too hard compared to starving kids in Africa, yeah I know) but I'm not allowed to be myself at home, only my mom basically accepts me, all of my bros are homophobic and my dad pushes me to have a gf. 
My life right now sucks, I hate what I have even tho I live under pretty good conditions, I'm a CS student and we have money and blah blah... I'll have to get out of my house somehow even tho I have to experience in the high tech industry so I can't work, there are many things I need to get done plus school is hard and I have 2 more years.

229,"I found a girl who wants to sublease her room on a Facebook page. College students come to this page for apartments. I messaged her and to my surprise wanted to meet that very day to show me the place. She had leased the apartment through the management of the complex. After leasing it she felt unsafe there since the complex does not specifically cater to college students, but all adults that need a room. I said I would think about it and a few days later I said I would take the room.

Now I normally reach out to roommates before I lease a room to meet them and make sure they are normal. I reached out to one roommate and asked to meet her before I decide. She replies that there was an error in room assignments and the girl I am leasing the room from was not supposed to get that room. The girl that lives there now wanted her friend in that room but the management screwed up.

Now I get the feeling that the current residents don't want me there and for whatever reason the leaser does not want to go through the management to sign over the lease to me. She would rather have me pay her rent through an app. This isn't so bad since it would be $100 cheaper if I rent from her and not the management side.

Now I'm just conflicted because on one side I told this girl I would lease the room from her, on the other side I get the feeling I won't be welcome there, and now she wants me to pay her through an app. My instincts tell me its not a scam, just incredibly sketchy.",24Jun2017,1

231,"Hello, everyone. It's my first time posting here, and I've got a pretty difficult situation to boot, so forgive me if my post is a bit convoluted. I'd be happy to provide clarifications to anyone who asks. I'm just looking for honest, unbiased advice, as I'm really at a loss for what to do.

In high school I excelled academically, graduating at the top of my class, but I had severe behavior problems, partly due to untreated bipolar/depression and my own immaturity. I was accepted to a top-10 university, but wasn't able to attend due to a combination of not receiving enough financial aid and the aforementioned behavioral issues. I had to take a ""gap year"" and study at a community college, which I wasn't very happy about. However, it truly turned out to be the best year of my life. I realized that my goal of becoming a doctor simply wasn't right for me, and decided to pursue my passion for political science. I joined my school's Model United Nations team and won several competitions. I was able to conduct an independent research project my first semester and present it at a research conference in March. At only 19 I am being promoted to a managerial position at my job and I'm currently interviewing for several internships with congresspeople and major special interest groups in my area. 

The problem comes from what my parents want. They are pushing me to leave community college and attend a state university this upcoming fall. To keep them happy I submitted applications to the three best universities in the state (however, two of these applications were for Biology, my previous major.) I'd really rather stay at community college one more semester, where I can intern, take more classes related to my major, compete in Model UN, and complete applications for the best universities in political science (American U, Columbia, Georgetown, etc.) In the spring I would do an internship full-time, hopefully with the U.S. State Department (which I have already applied for.) I feel that I can really take advantage of all of the opportunities I have at the community college to propel me to a greater university - the best university in my state for political science doesn't even break top 30 nationally. Essentially I'd be ""starting over"" for no reason, as I wouldn't have the extracurriculars necessary to get me into a good university for the next year. The ranking of the university is especially important to me because one of the potential careers I am considering is in academia. My parents aren't willing to listen to me at all. My mom, who is usually very reasonable and not emotional at all, started screaming in the car and broke down crying when I brought this up.

My mind is 99% made up, but I'm still looking into other options to see what would be best for me. Meanwhile, my parents seem to be locked in that I will be leaving in the fall. They have gone as far as to tell me that if I don't go to university, they will send me back to my country (I'm from Puerto Rico). Moving out is pretty much out of the question - my job currently only pays me ~$100 a week, and my parents pay for my cell phone, car, insurance, and college expenses that my scholarship doesn't cover.

234,"This is my very first Reddit post. I created an account because I am specifically looking for advice for my situation. I am a single mom (one child who has special needs) in my mid-20s who still lives at home with her parents (father and stepmother). I moved out at one point when I was 19 but moved back home after 4 years because I ended a horrible relationship with my child's father. I've now been living with my parents for almost 3 years, and in that time, I've managed to finish college, find full time employment, grow emotionally and spiritually, and save some money. I didn't mind moving back or home, or actually living there for the first two years, because I was able to do all of this and help my parents with the bills, as well as pay my own. However, for the past few months and even weeks, I've been feeling an urge to move out with my kid and find my own place so that I can truly be independent. You're probably asking why I want to move out. Well, my son and I sleep in my old bedroom, which is not very spacious when you add both of us, our beds, and all of our belongings. We share one closet, which is bursting at the seams. I'm also tired of cleaning up after everyone because they don't clean up after themselves, at least not to my standards (I'm a clean freak). I'm ready to be out on my own and live a full, independent, ADULT life with my child. But on one hand, I feel obligated to live at home longer, mainly because of my elderly father, who is retired, in declining health (he doesn't take care of himself like he should), and doesn't bring in enough income to support himself (less than $700 a month in social security). My father is the only one keeping me here in this house, and if, God forbid, something were to happen to him, I'd move out in an instant. But I feel obligated to stay longer to help my dad and I know that it would deeply sadden him if we were to move out. He basically built the house so that I could live here as an adult with my other siblings (two of whom moved out because of criminal activity, and one still lives at home but doesn't seem intent on moving out anytime soon), and I know that he loves having me and his grandson here with us. Living here has made me feel like I can't live my own life, and it also makes me feel like I'm being a burden to my family, even though I've been saving for my own apartment, paying all of my own bills, own my own car, have health and auto insurance, and even been working on paying down my student loans and trying to improve my credit score, and helping with the bills here as well. My other sibling and parents help out with babysitting as well (sometimes begrudgingly), usually no more than a couple of hours a week. So overall, everything isn't too bad, but I'm just emotionally ready to move on with my life and enter a new chapter. What do I do? Do I stick it out longer even though I'm ready to move out, or do I move out and risk hurting my dad's feelings?",24Jun2017,1
235,"I've never had loads of friends or been invited to parties or whatnot, but I'm okay with that. I prefer a few close friends over a large group. However, I have zero friends- I don't hang out with anyone outside of school, and it's blatantly clear this summer where I have nothing to do (I recently stopped gaming...realizing how lonely I am)


I had 2 friends in school last year, however they've been slowly moving on from me. I won't lie, it's probably my fault. My appearance isn't the greatest, I wear cycle through a few clothes (I mean I wash them, but it still seems kind of gross/bland) &amp; don't wear makeup/style my hair, but these 2 friends are very into this stuff, especially this year. I think last year we were all just new kids &amp; neighbors so ended up being 'friends' because of the situation, but now they've found their ""true"" group &amp; I'm sort of being left behind. And no one wants to be friends with the weird kid at school. Essentially the only time they talk to me now is if they want to show off something (like a vacation trip) or rant, I'm their backup friend.


I also think another factor of why I find it hard to make friends is because I don't really use social media. Like other people just use snapchat to start a conversation, and I hear of all these parties that are going on, or these streaks that are going on for days. I'm okay with being left out of these, but I just want a close friend...but I just can't find anyone else. It is a small town too, I don't know. I'm hoping college will be better. I guess I am socially awkward, when in a group, I usually stay quiet because there's nothing I really want to say (most of the time I'm not really interested or ""updated"" to the newest gossip) I don't know what to do. I enjoy my alone time (introvert I guess), but some days it gets really lonely &amp; I'm afraid of growing older &amp; having no close friends to confide in. Or even just now.
I feel like it's harder to make friends these days with the internet/social media (like don't get me wrong, the internet is great...but i sort of feels like I'm disconnected from the people around me...) Is there any hope? Sorry for the wall of text.


**tl:dr No friends in highschool, may be due to unkempt appearance - just want a close friend or two, how do I go about?**


also - I've tried clubs, but I joined when it was already ongoing, so I missed the beginning where everyone was making friends (I'm the outcast again haha :( ) and I don't have access to transportation for like meetup or something...idk thanks oh also, I've been on the femalefashionadvice and I heard of a capsule wardrobe, and I think I might try that to improve my appearance &amp; seems more affordable. I don't know.

236,"I'm a film and television production student and I just finished the second year of my course, the first year was fantastic and I got decent grades (final mark was a 2/1) and made some half decent short films, it really made my happy about my choice of going to university, but then in second year my course has essentially gone to shit. More people joined most of which I don't like because of their work ethics or personality and since the course is mostly group work it's seriously killing my motivation to do the work, with that my grades have been declining to failure levels (I didn't fail a single thing in first year but I've failed several modules in this year). I'm very passionate about the work I do but having people around me in the same groups who aren't as motivated and don't have the same vision is really starting to get to Me. 
I'm thinking about sitting through the first semester of next year and see how I feel, if I still want to leave at the end I will heavily consider doing that but if I enjoy it and get over this I will stay. 

I just need advice. I don't want to waste another 2 years of my life and £19000+ worth of debt over something that I may not end up wanting to do. ",24Jun2017,1
237,"I don't know what I should do. I spent most of high school thinking I could put off getting a good gpa and now the consequences of my actions are slapping me in the face.

I used to dream about starting a business right out of high school and not needing grades. But that is likely so fail, and I need a backup plan. And I don't have the discipline to be ruthlessly effective enough to be successful.

Plus I just got a girlfriend, and I'm about to meet her mom tomorrow. Success and grades matter a lot to them, and idk how they will respond when they find out that I'm a C student.

Anyone have any advice to help me turn around my life?",24Jun2017,1
