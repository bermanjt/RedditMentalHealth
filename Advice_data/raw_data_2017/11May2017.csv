0,"I work in an office shared by four other people. The person at the desk beside me talks way too much and it interrupts my work. Im actually quite sociable and open to office chit chat, but he goes too far. 

For example, he told me that last night he stayed up until dawn to see the sunrise with his kids at the park. If the story ened there, I wouldn't mind. However, he spent the next 20min telling me every painful detaul about that event. What funny things his son did, what funny things his daughter did, how everyone tells him that his daughter looks like him, then a story about his grandmother, then the colours of the sunrise, etc. I didn't even get a word in. I'm just sitting there politely listening saying "" uh huh. Oh cool. Thats interesting"" while he rambles on. I'm quite busy and those 20min are extremely valuable to me. Even if it was once per day, I could overlook it. But this happens MULTIPLE times per day. His stories can last from 20min~40min per session! He is eating hours of productive time away from me per day. 

It has gotten so bad that I often opt to do my work at home so I can focus and avoid distraction. However, this has also gotten me in trouble. My other coworkers feel that I am lazy and just abandon work and go home to rest. I know this because my boss told me that these were the complaints launched against me. He also told me that he doesnt care that I go home to do work as long as it gets done, but it sends the wrong message and is bad for team morale.

My question to you is how do I politely tell him to shut the fuck up without causing a scene or creating drama?",11May2017,3
4,"Pretty simple question i'm currently in high-school and realized that i often become tired around third period (11 am). I would appreciate any suggestions on what i could to have some more energy for the second half of the day. I usually don't eat a big lunch and don't have the ability to go home during lunch or access to any sort of kettle, any suggestions appreciated.",11May2017,1
5,"Hey guys!

Ever since I (18 y/o M) was in elementary school I've had a hard time committing to anything. Nothing can hold my attention for very long. I constantly have random thoughts racing through my head and get mentally sidetracked very easily. 

I guess the most comprehensive example is the time I had a massive craving for Jell-O, bought a ton of it, then didn't finish eating all of it because I got tired of it and moved on to saltine crackers (ik I'm a weirdo). 

I'm a pretty high-scoring student (4.1 GPA leaving high school with 3 APs finished and a high SAT score) but I have an absolutely terrible work ethic. And when I say terrible, I mean I come home with the intention of doing homework but as soon as I get home I go straight to my PC and play some league or call my band and we play for a bit. I write my essays the morning they're due. I (unintentionally) fall asleep in class because I can't focus. You get the point. 

But I'm really worried now going into college because I can't seem to focus on anything. The only things that do hold my attention are the things that put me in a state of mental numbness (music, video games, etc.).

So I took an online test to see if I had ADD or ADHD. The questions were startlingly relatable and I was surprised to see exactly how many of these things applied to me (tendency to ramble, can't wait turn in conversation, etc.) 

I want to see a professional, but I have two problems. One, I don't know what kind of professional to see. Two, I don't want my mom to know about it. She has enough to worry about and she usually thinks I'm just being super dramatic about these things. I have insurance, can drive, and live in a relatively wealthy neighborhood in the suburbs. 

Thanks!",11May2017,2
8,"Hello fellow redditors, I'm 30(m), single and pretty much hit a wall in life and looking for some advice on how to make myself happy again.

A little bit about myself, I'm a full-stack web developer, musician (drummer) in 2 metal bands in which I play live often with one of them, there might be a third band coming to my list. I volunteer once a month at an organization that gives programming workshops to kids. I do some occasional fitniss and drinking at the pub. 

Despite all of the activities, I am still pretty bored with life, I feel like i've hit a wall. I've pushed myself to go even more to fitniss then it died out, I have some days that I practice drums really hard and then do nothing. No matter what I do, I don't feel happy or satisfied with anything. The only things that keep me going now are those small exciting moments, like the happiness from the kids at workshops and the public reaction after playing a show. As soon as I get home, I watch series and stuff to keep myself distracted, but as soon as I hit the bed, thoughts come flowing in about wtf am I doing with my life.

Question is, how can I start living again? How can I feel fun again? I have nothing to look forward to, and I'vetrie looking for new goals, but nothing interests me anymore. Should I look harder? Too many questions, so bottom line, what is your take on the situation?

Cheers",11May2017,2
9,"In 12th grade, I took this art class. One day I wasn't feeling well and asked my teacher if I could go to the nurse. He looked concerned and said, ""are you okay?"" And I, this little motherfucker, said, ""obviously not"" in this bitch ass tone.

11,"Hi, my name is Ryan and I'm eighteen years old. In roughly three weeks I will graduate highschool. Lately ive been stressing myself out about college applications and completing my fasfa's as well as trying to continue to work at my almost fulltime job (39.5 hours a week) 
In the middle of dealing with all the struggles one might face at my age, my mother was coming home from work on Thursday around 12'oclock when she spotted another accident on the interstate. My mother, being a nurse for close to 25 years and an EMT before that, decided that it was her duty to stop and help. When she began to slow down to see what was going on and what she could do, a suv speeding behind her as well as following to close ran into the back of her sending her car into a spin. She was killed instantly due to a baseline skull fracture. 
I went to bed Wednesday night around 11pm expecting to wake up in the morning with everything the same as the day before but I was mistaken. The state police showed up around 2am to inform me of what had happened.
Since this ive been running into so many issues. One of my main issues is watching the street I live on waiting for her car. Ive seen the pictures of the vehicle and I know its destroyed. ive also seen my own mother lowered into the ground. Still I wait for her to come through the door. My mother worked evenings and so did I so we often times missed eachother and could possibly not see each other for days at a time with us both working and me having school and her, a boyfriend. With this being said I keep waiting as if its just another spell when I wont see her for awhile even though I know the truth. 
My next issue is everybody's ""Help"". Around 300+ people came to the viewing and this is only people who had signed in the book provided by the funeral home. So many people have made donations to my grandmother and I(who are now the ones renting the home that the three of us use to live in). I want to accept everybody's help but at the same time I want to do it all myself. My mother was the head of the house hold and although I sometimes helped with rent, I didn't really have to pay bills. Now I'm stuck with bills to take care of and it would be stupid to not accept everyone's help but I feel guilty by accepting peoples money at the expense of my mothers death.
My last issue is ive lost all motivation to do anything. I was planning on attending my local college to obtain enough college credits to be accepted into the police academy where I hoped to pursue a career as a criminal investigator. Now ive complicated quiting my ""part time"" job dropping out of school and just sitting in my bedroom watching the world pass in front of me. 
When I lost my mother, I lost the biggest support in my life. Ive lost the one true person I need at a time like this and I don't know where to turn. I'm not really religious, I'm agnostic so I believe in something greater and hope for something but I'm so tired of hearing ""She'll always be with you"" and ""You'll see her someday"" ive almost lost my mind waiting for a sign at what to do next.

20,"Hello,

I have been recently for the last yeat I have been dealing with the fear of being weak and I think it's starting to damage my relations with other people and how I look upon myself as a person. It started when I first became a freshmen in high school (still am, tho for not much longer) and was very confused about the new ""atmosphere"" if you could call it that of high school hierarchy. I had already met some of the people I would be with for the next fours earlier during summer break since that's when cross country pratices started, but for the vast majority of people I saw on the first day I didn't. 

While it was a relatively minor issue I brushed aside, my fear really started to get to me when I became a varsity runner in cross country. I felt that while I was on the outside being considered ""important"" by the team as a whole for scoring point during events, that I was always outclassed by my other varsity runners who kept on beating me again and again and again, which I looked (and still do) down personally on as a sign of embarrassment and humiliation, including since I was being made fun of by one of the other varsity runners who earlier in the year was the sterotypical ""cool kid"" of the school.

When track started a few months before the end of 2016, I looked on it again as a new fresh start, but I had to go through the same shit over and over and over again, it was like it was neverending. All my hard work seemed to never get mentioned at all, while the people who were slower than me in almost all fields got all the attention and I became hate filled and jealous. It even happened only a short while ago when last weekend I beat the freshmen boys record mile time and got a 4:58, while the junior varsity (everyone elese) kept on getting mentioned and at pratice I recieved no ""Great going"" or ""Congragulations"", I only got mostly shamed by the team for supposedly bragging about my achievement (this may look very biased when I say this but I think saying ""It was a real pain in the ass to get that new time last weekend"" isn't bragging. 

This is a way way way more simplified version of the total story, but I have to type this quick. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I'm always used and then thrown out the window, my emotions keep screwing with me and I never ask anyone for help.

Sorry if I mispelled anything at all or made this look like a rant, my writing skills are not that good as of right now. ",11May2017,3
22,"Earlier this week I lost my monthly commuter train ticket worth a couple hundred dollars. The railway policy is to not offer refunds so needless to say I was pretty pissed at myself thinking I would have to spend another couple hundred dollars to make up for my stupid mistake. Amazingly on my way back from the train today I saw the ticket tied to a street sign waiting for me. It had been more than 24 hours since I lost it so I was amazed and elated that not only had someone tied it there but no one else had taken it and I was only out the $20 or so from the three rides in between when I lost it.

Anyways I would love to reward whoever did this but I have no idea what to do outside of tying an envelope full of money to the same street sign but that would just be dumb no? Is there anything I could do with email? Sadly I am now worried that the ""wrong person"" would take advantage of the reward. What should I do?",11May2017,1
23,"My neighbor has two dogs which she, without exaggeration, NEVER walks.  One is a husky, ironically named Happy, and the other is some little wiener dog thing.  When she first got them, she intended to keep the husky outside in the backyard year-round, despite not having any suitable shelter back there.  I pointed out that her backyard wasn't set up to protect him from extremely hot summer days or cold winter days, and that we have quite a few skunks and raccoons in the neighborhood.  She was all smiles and thank yous but she did indeed keep Happy outside without so much as a water bowl or bed/blanket.  The little dog (who's name I never learned), she kept inside, and only let (and still lets) it outside to pee and poo.  She has not once, ever walked either of these dogs.  The little dog was a little shit from day one but Happy used to be such a, well, happy dog.  Despite being cooped up in the yard all day, everyday, living in a minefield of piles of his own poo (she lets the piles accumulate quite a bit before she cleans up), he would run up and down the length of the fence, playing and communicating with my dogs as we walked by.  Eventually, he started crying at the door, being more aggressive towards dogs and people walking by his fence, and digging holes along the perimeter of the fence.  One day, he escaped (first of several escapes).  My mom returned him to his house and give the neighbor lady a piece of her mind and threatened to call the cops or something.  She kept Happy inside after that, but now, like the little dog, we only see him when he's let out to go to the bathroom.  Sometimes, I don't know why, one dog or both will just be left outside howling and crying for HOURS.  The little one is outside right now.  Has been for 2 hours, crying and barking away.  I should also mention that she's become pretty infamous among the dog owners in the neighborhood.  One sweet little lady, bought Happy a bed and blanket, a water bowl, and A LEASH (which he didn't have until then), cleaned all the poo up in the backyard (something she has done many times over) and offered to walk him with her dogs.  Sometimes, Happy would just chill at this ladies house while my neighbor is at work or just out.  But not anymore because, on top of never even thanking this nice lady, neighbor lady started resenting her and blaming her for being the cause of her unpopularity among neighbors and asked her to stop letting Happy chill at her house.  Someone, at some point, did call the police, but they showed up, walked in her place, walked out, and that was that as far as I know.  Nothing came of that or anything else anyone has done/said to this woman.  What can I do for these dogs?  How can I help them?  I live in Ontario, Canada, and as far as I can tell, my hands are tied.  I hope I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that it's not even illegal to never walk your dog here, so she might not be doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law, even if she is human waste.

27,"This morning, I received the following message on Facebook: 

&gt; Somehow, you popped up randomly on FB and its weird, because I got to remembering you the other day: thanks for being my only friend in middle school, it helped through quite a bit.

I was really touched by the message, but the problem is... I have almost no idea who this girl is. I might think it was a scam or that she had mistaken me for someone, except that I do vaguely remember her name. I know that it is her because her Facebook name is [nickname] [shortened variation of last name] and several of her family members share the full last name, so I am confident that I am thinking of the right name. 

However, that is literally the *only* thing I can remember about her. She looks vaguely familiar facially, but other than that I couldn't even tell you where we went to school together... I'm not even sure I knew her in middle school honestly. I tried googling her, but I didn't find anything helpful. 

The strange part is... I can tell you who my (important?) friends were from kindergarten through my senior year. This girl is definitely *not* on that list. It seems wrong to ignore her, but it also seems heartless to tell her I don't know who she is. What should I do?",11May2017,1
30,"Now the thing he is going to college for, he can only get a minor in at the college he is going to. He refuses to tell me what his major will be or why he is going to said college.

The college is 3 hours away and in a town that through research has a really high opioid abuse rate and apparently you can find needles just laying around. Not to mention the economy of said town isn't the best and jobs aren't just laying around.

I've tried everything I can think of to get him to talk but he won't talk to me, his mother, his uncle, his grandma, his brother or his girlfriend.

I have already told him I'm not paying for a dime of his college unless he gives reasons and what his major will be. His grandmother who offered to pay the whole thing is in the same boat.

He doesn't seem to care as he has already filed for FAFSA and other student aid/loan programs.

40,"So as a lot of people might know, New York has offered free tuition to it's state schools for families who make under 100k or so. Being that I fit into that category, and that my grades are good, I basically have the option of going to a lot of different schools in the state which is an unprecedented opportunity.

On the other hand, the one big ""catch"" is that however many years you plan on attending the college under this scholarship, is the amount of years you must live and work in new york.

69,"I just graduated from my University this past Sunday. I loved my four years here, and while I'm excited to move on to the next chapter of my life, a good part of me doesn't want to leave, and I think a lot of it is because my graduation didn't give me that ceremonial closure I want/need. 

Basically, our graduation was the least formal, most low key event it could have been. It started out...okay; we marched in accompanied by shitty organ music and found our seats in the arena where our ceremony was held. The faculty entered, heralded by some pretty awesome trumpets. The dean spoke, a student spoke, an honorary doctorate awardee spoke. Then, they began the long process of reading names. We were allowed to enter and sit in any order we wanted, so we had to fill out cards and hand them to the readers when it was our turn. This was...not great, but it could have been handled way better and with way more decorum. Basically, you handed the card to the reader, they hastily tried to ask you how to pronounce your name, and then they read it quickly before moving on to the next graduate. People in the audience whooped and cheered and used noisemakers all the whole, because they weren't told otherwise. After your name was called, you got the thing your degree would eventually go in, shook people's hands, and got your picture taken before returning to your seat...except most people didn't. Most people decided they didn't need to stay for their own graduation, and up and left before the names had all been read. By the time everyone had gone up, the stadium was 90% empty. No longer was graduation this momentous occasion of moving on with your peers, it was a mockery, something to skip out in the middle of because it's too long or something. My friends and I stayed, we had our degrees officially conferred and turned our tassels and all, then processed out to crappy organ music again. The whole thing just seemed so...cavalier. I wanted something inportant, something with gravitas and significance to culminate these four incredibly important years of my life. Instead, I and my classmates who stayed got a satire of a real graduation. 

Since then, I've been on campus, trying to find my own closure through visiting areas of campus that are important to me and the like. But I leave tomorrow (the earliest day my parents could come pick me up), and I can't shake the feeling that I'll leave without experiencing a significant milestone. I know this feeling is silly, since the truly important parts are all the memories and hard work that led up to graduation, but I feel a bit empty without that last ceremonial aspect. 

I honestly don't know what I'm looking for here, but if anyone has any advice or words of wisdom, I'd love to hear them. I don't know why this is such a big deal for me, maybe I just need to be told it isn't. Thanks.

76,"So, I always knew I was a mediocre student who averaged B's and C's and just did what I could to pass.  This carried on into trade school, and affects my career in a sense now that I am a full-time employee.

Whether it's studying for certifications to grow in my career or learn something for fun such as playing guitar or learning how to play a fighting game, I can't seem to grasp information.  I've had a guitar since I was maybe in the 4 or 5th grade (I'm 22 now) and throughout the years picked it up and down and still can't find motivation or dedication to really learn in.

Most importantly, I've been using udemy, spending real money (discount prices at least) to study for certification exams.  I learned a little from it but I just don't have it in me to continue after making it 25% of the way.  I know I don't have motivation, or will-power, but even when I actively try and practice things for education or fun nothing sticks.


I'm really not sure what to do anymore.  Is this something worth seeing a specialist about?  I don't want to sound dramatic but I'm afraid I have some type of learning disability.

83,"I've had this problem for what feels like over a decade now, and it's something that I've never really been able to overcome. Back in my pre-teen/teenage years, I thought I would just grow out of it, but now I'm 21, and it's gotten no better. Ever since I first started using the internet, I've always let myself be effected by the opinions of other people, particularly if they're at odds with my own opinions. It's especially bad if one person who seems to be super smart has a different opinion than me, because then I really do feel like my thoughts and feelings are stupid and inferior. To give you an idea of how bad it is, I saw a dude on another forum sometime last year that seemed like the smartest guy ever. Never made mistakes, never lost arguments, and he typed like he was some sort of professional writer. Every day since then, I've kept having this dude's posts pop up into my mind and giving me self-doubt. This kind of constant worrying about other people's opinions has made me extremely anti-social and with pretty much no friends.

It seems like there is a person who's ordering food through guest checkout on Yelp Eat24 using my first name and last name initial. 

I got the notification on my email because that's what they put in the order. The really bizarre thing is, they put in the area code of the city I used to live in 2-3 years ago. However, I've never owned a phone number starting with those digits. 

They used a credit card to pay for the food, but luckily none of my cards have been charged. I've contacted Eat24 and all they said is let them know if any of my cards ever get charged. 

This is the second time it has happened in 5 months. I never did anything the first time because they used cash to pay for the food. I'm afraid that this is an indicator of an identity theft that may be going on. 

What can I do to dig deeper into what's going on here? I have the address they ordered the food to (the same address both times).

89,"A bit of background:

A few years ago, I moved from my home state to a new one because of a job opportunity and have established myself as a resident here. However, I do maintain communication with friends back home.

These friends, however, are honestly starting to take a toll on me mentally. They're the type of people that are still living with their parents/relatives even though they've had countless escape opportunities presented to them in order to advance in adulthood

They've made bad personal, financial, career, and overall decisions which have landed them in this ever growing hole that they keep digging themselves. And whenever I talk to them, I do my best to give them advice on how to get out of the situation, but they instead choose to follow their instincts  and do what THEY think is the best course of action which, unsurprisingly, leads them to ruin. On top of that, they don't seem the least bit interested in contacting me to check on how I'm doing, unlike what I've been doing

On the other hand, these are the same friends that I've had since middle school, who have helped me through tough times (including the death of my father and lifelong companion dog), and the only people I know IRL that share common interests with me. To add to that, I don't have many friends out here and am not very good at making new friends altogether

I feel like I should distance myself from them or terminate the relationship entirely, but at the same time I don't want to because I won't have anyone to share those hobbies that I have so much time invested in with. I don't know which I should do?",11May2017,10

I work ~2 days a week and, for reasons I cannot disclose, I can't take any more days than that nor can I acquire a second job.

I have finally registered for classes in the coming fall semester at the local university (because I've been out of school for ~2-3 years), but those won't go into session until late August

Quite honestly, I just need something to keep myself occupied and some sort of companionship. It doesn't have to be a relationship such as dating, but just a way to spend time with others. Most of my friends are busy with their own lives (school, work, etc.) and my family is pretty much the same way

112,"I live in an apartment and have for going on 13 years now (not the same apartment). I sleep with a white noise machine in my bedroom and lately I have been turning on two white noise machines at once. I do not use earplugs yet but am a bit nervous to do so as I have a six year old son. 

For the past few months I have been noticing the noise of a child or children running at night. By ""noticing"", I mean that it has torn me from sleep a few times as I was drifting off, and has kept me from sleeping several times. This is always past 10p.m. at night and continues on often to 10.30 or later. It is accompanied by squeals and screams and perhaps jumping on the bed, but it is the thumping of footsteps that wrenches me from sleep. I go to sleep early, around 9:45 or 10 p.m. The pounding of feet is not an every night occurrence,  but has happened often enough to bother me. At first I did not know where the noise was coming from. It was so loud I thought it must be the neighbors above, but I did not think they had children. In the past week I have put my ear to the ground when I hear it and now i am sure without a doubt  that it is the downstairs' neighbors who have three children. I did not know noise could travel up like that, but it does. The building is old and has zero soundproof.  So after three nights in a row of this noise last week (thurs., fri., and Saturday nights) I decided to talk to them because it is really bothering me, and also because I am pretty sure they don't know we can hear it. So Sunday morning about 11 am I knocked. The husband answered and I explained to him, very politely. I told him that it was not crying or voices that bothered me, but the pounding of footsteps. As I thought, he seemed surprised we could hear it and also seemed like he accepted the fact that it was too noisy, I said goodbye and thank you. 

Then last night the running, thumping and squeals began again. It was a few minutes past ten p.m. and I was lying down to sleep. I waited, thinking maybe the child was just going to bed and it would stop. 10.30 p.m and noise is still going, so I go downstairs to knock. Outside their door I can hear children being noisy. This time both man and wife come to the door. Man seems surprised again, but wife is on the defensive. She says ""she is a child, I can't tie her up, they are just playing normally like children do."" The middle child is at the door, she is almost three. I insist on the lateness of the hour, 10.30 p.m., several times. Then wife cites a time that my son cried at 6am but they did not say anything because he is a kid. Background: three years ago when we first moved in my son was three, he made too much noise running at 5 p.m. in the afternoon,  neighbor husband came up to complain, I was honestly embarrassed and ever since have gone to GREAT lengths to stop him from running. During the day only, because he is always in bed by 7.30 p.m. So I mentioned to neighbors that when they complained about my kid I made real efforts. All the woman seems to say is they are just kids (even though it is past ten p.m.!) and just playing. Man begins to say ok, ok ma'am like he is dealing with someone slightly unhinged. Woman says maybe it isn't their children I am hearing. I am annoyed because she isn't acknowledging that they are making too much noise at all, and I remind them that when they came to speak to me those years ago, I made real efforts to stop my kid from running DURING ThE  DAY.

The advice I need is about how to handle things with them but also about my husband, who has told me I ""can't go down there every time there is noise"" (I have gone twice now) and ""they can't stop them from making noise, they are just kids"" as though I am being cruel to a toddler. My husband works late and his study is at the other end of the apartment and the noise of children pounding is on the opposite end, under my bedroom.

He later told me that his brain was dying and mentioned several times that he just wanted to jump in the water and stay there. I asked him directly if he was planning on taking his own life to which he replied ""of course"". We had a very deep conversation about life and death, and he invited me to come to the airbnb he will be staying at tonight. I accepted and he even bought me the ferry tickets.

But now I'm having second thoughts. He seemed very genuine yesterday but now there's that tiny paranoid voice saying ""what if there is something else wrong with his brain and he is just going to murder me"".

I want to go so he doesn't have to be alone in his last moments, but I don't want them to be my last moments. He is either 110% genuine, or, less likely, 110% delusional murderer.

He told me he has been bodyguard for a lot of famous people, and they are the ones paying for his trip right now. Again: either the most interesting man, or delusional.

What should I do? I am probably just paranoid. I already have the ferry ticket which he bought, and I packed my bag just an hour ago.

Thing is, whenever I actually insult him they just gang up on me and boo me out, so it never worked out in the first place. They refused to let me leave before he hit me. I said id let him slap me instead since that's what I did to him.

133,"I am 19 and have been working in the same industry for little over a year, I love my industry and the work I do, but my company makes the work unbearable with how far they bend over backwards for the customers (we are a heavily regulated industry by both my country's federal and state governments which means this often borders on illegal) and will throw me under the bus instead of back me up for making the legal call which leads to that client's small question turns into a full blown complaint and management NEVER takes responsibility for making the client angrier. (It should be noted that these things come back to the guys in the field like me, the state does not hold our office accountable for those service decisions)

Here are my top 3 complaints:
1. Like I said, the promising and expecting me to deliver on borderline illegal services has gotten me a warning from our state's regulating body. After this I complained to my manager but it STILL keeps happening. Another offense can lead to a HUGE fine and even prison time.

2. It has completely retriggered my depression that I thought I overcame after my senior year of high school. My mood swings pretty violently and randomly when thinking about work, I never want to get out of bed except on the weekends, I am constantly angry or sad and I want to avoid anything that isn't coming home and going to sleep. This has taken a serious toll on my relationships.

3. For what I am asked to do, the pay isn't that great. I am expected to work a 12 hour day at a minimum for six months of the year, 10 hours the rest of the year. I still don't make even a semblance of a living wage, I am paid the exact same as one of my company's technicians is in a state where the cost of living is half of what it is where I am. I sent a letter about raising our pay a little bit to meet the rising cost of living to our CEOs who openly mocked it in a monthly podcast all employees are supposed to watch. (They reponsded that we should strive for the extremely limited performance based bonuses that only one employee at each office (our smallest office having 10 employees) can have).

However, they are very allowing with vacation time, my gf's mom pays for vacations for about two weeks every year and always invites me. Everything is paid for which means if I left I would need my next company to allow this vacation time which is in less than 4 months now.

135,"I've (28m) been seeing this woman (28f) for 6 months. I love this woman more than anything in the world. We each have a daughter, both the same age. We have been having issues, mainly her opening up about things. I knew the moment I met her that I wanted to marry her so a month ago I popped the question and she said yes. 

We have had issues in the past, which led to many conversation(some of which ended up in arguments) about our bedroom life among other things. She never initiates and rarely seems interested, even when she says she is interested. Our conversations always end up with her admitting she has an issue and that she doesn't want to talk about it. This has been going on for months. 

Another thing I have brought up in the past is finances. We are getting married and looking forward to moving into a new house soon. I would like to lay everything out on the table and plan for paying for these things but she says she has never liked to talk about finances and she doesn't want to talk about it now. 

Every time I try to talk about something even remotely serious, no matter how much time (sometime weeks) in between the times I bring it up she never wants to talk about it. I am absolutely open to compromise, but she won't even tell me what's needed to compromise. She says she loves me, and I believe her. But I am at my wits end. Each time I bring it up she claims I am pushing her. And she may be right as I am frustrated with not being able to resolve these things. I am desperately trying to work on our relationship so we can be happy and get married and enjoy our lives together but she always shuts down and never wants to deal with anything serious, that is necessary to have a functional relationship.

I'm asking for advice. Please and thank you. ",11May2017,2
139,"I have lived with roommates for a long time. I'm finally preparing to get (rent) my own place, and ended up finding one that I absolutely love, in my price range. All the other places I've found whose prices I feel comfortable with, all feel a bit meh. This place feels like it could be a real home. So, that's nice.



So here's the complication: I showed the place to a coworker, and she said, ""Oh yay! I'm really excited! That's right next door to my best friend! I was over there basically every other night for a while. They have awesome parties, and you'll love them and we can hang out, etc!"" I thought, ""UUUUUGHGHHHHHHHHHH. LEAVE ME ALONE."" Because I'm good socially.



At work I tend to be really quiet about my private life, to the extent that it strikes people as weird. They (and she) typically assume that I have stuff going on, because I think I strike them as fun and confident. The truth is that I spend most of my free time doing basically nothing - binge watching stuff, surfing randomly. I get invited to do things, but I typically don't want to - they seem too energy draining most of the time. The appeal of having my own place finally, is that I will be free to do whatever I want without feeling judged or ashamed or pitied for choosing not to be more social. I read and hear about people living alone and getting drunk, playing video games naked, and I salivate (though maybe that's not healthy). If I want to board up and hang around for an entire weekend, then I want to be able to do that without feeling bad or pitied or judged. I'm tired of feeling ashamed in my own place. And while I know this is my own neurosis, I feel a bit anxious that I won't feel completely at home in this place if my coworker is next door, wondering why I'm just hanging out in my place all the time.



So that's the dilemma: Do I find another place, probably worse, simply because I want to be more alone than living in my own place? Or do I risk perpetual anxiety to live in a place that feels homey and comfortable to me? Which risk is more real?



The first option seems immature and catering to my insecurities, while the second seems idealistic and potentially defeating of the whole point of moving into my own place.



My therapist would probably tell me that I need to learn to be vulnerable with people, and that I would be surprised at the extent to which people would accept me as I am, if I revealed myself to them, so consciously choosing a more isolated space is probably not the ticket to intimacy. My best friend says that if I have palpable concerns about moving in here, why risk starting off in a new place with that anxiety? Just go find another.



I am obviously quite conflicted. Part of me feels I should move in. Maybe this is much ado about nothing. Maybe I'm overestimating the degree to which people will care about how much I'm home alone. Maybe I'm overestimating how much they'll even notice. Maybe my perceptions of what other people expect from a person who has it all put together are too romantic somehow. Or, maybe it will move me towards being a little more engaging with others. I really love the place, I really love the lease (6 months rather than a year, in case I really do dislike the dynamic).



On the other hand, maybe I should look for another place. Maybe this isn't the time to project unprecedented growth on myself. Maybe it's not the time to try to be idealistic. Maybe I'm romanticizing this place a little bit too much, and would be fine in another place that doesn't strike as quite this homey. I do fear a coworker having access to my personal life.



This is wordy.


So... what would you do? I know this probably seems silly, but if it were silly to me, I wouldn't post. I'm just trying to figure out how to be healthy. I'm not very good at that.

144,"Hi guys, I've got a bit of a problem talking to my mum about this situation. I'm not really sure how to approach it, so I came here.

A bit of context - I took a year out from uni and I'm returning in September to start my second year. Before I can return though, I have to pay off the tuition from my first year (about 6 and a half thousand). But I've been having trouble finding work. I've done cover letters, CVs, follow-up emails, interviews, all that jazz, and still can't seem to get a job. My mum is aware of this, so a couple of weeks ago she signed me up for an online nursing course, in the hopes of netting me a job. I told her at the start that I had zero interest in this field (I'm doing an arts degree) and it'd be a waste of her money. She signed me up anyway, and now I'm stuck doing a course I don't want to do. Every week she asks me how far along I am in the course content and complains that they're taking a lot of money out of her account regularly. I just tell her that I'm getting through it steadily, when in reality I haven't touched that course in about 2 weeks. I find it very tedious and I'd rather be out there *actually working* and saving up money instead of learning stuff I don't want to. My mum can be very forceful and she's quick to fly off the handle, so I've just been avoiding telling her. I know I have to tell her soon, but I don't know how to. What should I do?",11May2017,1

147,"So I found this really great girl on Tinder about a week and a half ago, and we went on a date two days ago. We clicked so well that the staff at the restaurant asked us to pay the bill so they could start closing up (we only really agreed to meet for an hour or so but we got completely caught up in the conversation). 

I'll add that before this I've never gone on a date with someone I didn't know very well beforehand, I've only ever dated people I was friends with for at least a few months and I have no clue how any of this is supposed to go after the date. At some point she mentioned a second date and that to me is a really good sign. 

Now I know that people generally go on a few dates before anything is made official, and I don't think now is the right time to talk about all of that yet since she lives very far away at the moment (but she's making plans to move back to her family which would bring her much much closer to where I live), but the problem is I don't know when the right time would be or how to talk about it without it being super awkward. 

I have no doubt that she likes me, but I've learnt from previous experience that that doesn't necessarily mean anything will happen between us. I know some of you might think I'm jumping the gun here, but I want to be prepared when the time comes you know? ",11May2017,1
154,"We plan to tell him tomorrow night. She and her partner have jobs and a plan. She's put a lot of thought in and really wants to keep the baby. She's almost 19 and her partner is like 23. My father is a very great dad, he loves us very much, but he's Republican and doesn't even except that I'm pansexual. I can tell he's feared my sister getting pregnant, as she was always the more party type and more social and had more boyfriends than I. I'm two years older in college and my sister never went to school. She works really hard at her job but that's not even enough for him, not all her employee of the month awards or anything. She's afraid he will kick her out when he tells her, that's why she's lined up to move elsewhere if she has to, right away, with a friend. Even tho he's mentioned about a year ago that he might do that if she ended up pregnant like two of her friends did, I don't think he'd have the heart to really do it. He loves us. 

I just know this will be shocking and scary to him, for many reasons. It means she's growing up, it means he's getting older, it means she's leaving, it means a lot of scary things. And I know he'll get defensive, angry, and quiet. Which is how she gets too. There's too much silence between them and they live together (I'm renting a room with my friends elsewhere).

The extreme weather has been negatively affecting my medical conditions and the people who manage our apartment have been treating me badly. The upstairs neighbor is in an abusive situation with a now-ex partner (who was appearing obsessively multiple times a day pounding on the door and being loud and aggressive at the neighbor... I only know these things as I repeatedly hear noise and drama through the walls and see them fight outside) and the neighbor somehow managed to outright blame me for their relationship situation after I made noise complaints to the management, in addition to claiming I caused the neighbor to have fights with friends and family, despite me not knowing or interacting with these people at all and being totally new here. The management is family with that neighbor and believes what they said and seems to want to facilitate drama between us instead of properly manage the place. In addition to putting me in a potentially dangerous position, the management had made many patronizing remarks over the year about my medical condition after I had disclosed my condition to them earlier in the year and they seemed to disclose my condition to the neighbor without asking me. I've been miserable for a year and just staying inside due to feeling sick all the time, unwelcome and fearful with anxiety.

171,"Please help me! I don't know what to do. I've been trying for years to get a job but I keep running into the exact same problem over and over again. My parents are horrible people and I just want to move out more than anything but I can't because I can't find a job because I'm limited to whatever's nearby because I don't have a license because the DMV is really far from where I live so I need my parents to drive me there but they won't because I'm behind in my schoolwork because the school I go to is poorly taught and I don't feel like I understand any of the concepts. I've tried to transfer schools but it hasn't worked so far. My parents wouldn't let me transfer at first because they thought ""if your doing bad at this school then clearly you'll do just as bad anywhere else"" but after a year of arguing with them I finally managed to get them submit of form to transfer me to the local school but then apparently that school just completely ignored my request and never even responded at all and that was a whole semester ago and now it's the second semester I'm failing almost all of my classes, summer is next month, I still don't have a driver's license, I still don't have a job, and I'm fucking 18 now. I wanted to have get my license and find a job and raise up the money so I'd be able to move out by now but nothing has worked out the way I had planned and I feel like a complete loser. The worst part is that I feel so lonely. I've never even been to a real high school since my parents forced me to go to online school by signing me up without even telling me. I told them from the start that I wanted to go to a regular high school but instead they signed me up for online schooling against my wishes. I only signed the damn papers because I didn't know how bad it was the first time, the second time I signed because they told me that if I did well enough in my classes they would transfer me (which they didn't even when I wasn't failing my classes) and I thought that perhaps there was some hope that I would get out of this mess, the last time I signed was because they straight up promised me that they would transfer me so I wouldn't have to go here for long which as I mentioned earlier didn't end up happening. If I would have known I would never have signed those damn papers. I miss my friends. We still talk to each other online and still see each other on rare occasions but I feel like I'm hardly ever around them they all go to a different school and even if I did somehow get to transfer I still probably wouldn't be able to see them because I live in a different city now because my parents made the decision to move me here. I was fully in support of the idea when my parents made the decision to move because I thought that my friends are probably all going to go to different high schools anyway (since the school I used to go to only went up to junior high) and perhaps I can make some new friends at whatever school my parents end up sending me to. Obviously this didn't end up happening. My parents have always been horrible to me and I wanted nothing more but to move out as soon as I could since I was a young child. I thought I would get a license, find a job, and start making money before I turned 18 and by the time I could I would move out but since then nothing has worked out the way I had planned. When I was 15 I tried to find a job (When I was 15 I didn't know that you could sometimes get a job at 14 and I didn't know that you could get a job at 15 either until I noticed one of my friends managed to get a job and curious I looked it up and thus when I first tried to get a job) but my parents never took what I wanted seriously and didn't help me find one and since I didn't have a driver's license or know that you can get a driver's license at 15 and a half I didn't really have an efficient way of looking. Add on to that the fact that we were moving and I had to try and adjust to my new school to say the least I didn't really have much time to look. By the time I turned 16 I wanted to make sure I had a license and a job before I turned 17 that way I'd have at least a year to save up for a house I started trying my hardest to get the DMV so I could get my license but before I could do that I had to complete the Driver's Ed course and keep on track with my schoolwork and by the time I finally did I failed the written test to get my learner's permit twice. Near the end of my 16th year I started getting desperate and tried to find jobs within walking distance of my house but almost none were hiring and at the ones I did find I needed a resume to apply and I still even now have absolutely no clue how I'm supposed to write such a thing as I'm still in high school, I have no particular skills in any one task in specific (that I'm aware of), I don't have any training in any specific profession or skill, and I don't have any previous work experience as I've never had a job before (at least none that I've actually been paid to do, I have helped my friend out with volunteer community work before. (mostly cleaning stuff and moving stuff around and setting stuff up I'm pretty good at that. I could probably do a maid service or janitorial job rather well if I could only get one). My 17th birthday came and I failed my quest, so I tried again to try and get my license when after I turned 17 but I failed the written test again. I finally found several job openings nearby but was unable to make a resume that I could submit and my parents refuse to help me figure out how to put one together and any internet tutorials I can find have been unhelpful to me because of the above stated reasons. I did successfully find one job that was near enough to me that I could easily ride the bus there, and a maid job no less,and that didn't require a resume to apply for and so of course I did apply only for my application to be rejected and thus I feel that I lost the very best opportunity I possibly could have had to get out of this damn situation and I'm all the way back to square fucking one. Now I'm 18 and I have no clue what to do. I feel absolutely hopeless and I don't know what to do. I'm on my junior year of high school now and I feel so alone. I just want to go to a different school, it doesn't have to be the same school as my friends as I understand that the chances that I'll ever be able to afford to go back to my old home city and attend there are ridiculous, I just want to go to a regular school and possibly make new friends at least have someone to share the misery that is high school with. I just want a house, it doesn't have to be a big house or a fancy house just A house, just about any house will do. So long as the place is still standing that's good enough for me. I just want my driver's license to be able to leave this place and never come back. I just want my damn freedom! Is that too much to ask for! I honestly feel like I should just kill myself sometimes, I'm such a goddamn failure at everything. None of my plans ever work! Nothing I do is ever successful! All I ever do is fail over and over and over again! I've put up with this bullshit my whole goddamn life, I just want to be free from my damn parents! I feel like I've never had something of my own my whole damn life, I just want something. Something that's mine for once. Something they can't take away from me like they've taken everything else away from me. At least I still have my friends but they don't understand and I can't explain this to them. None of them can help me. None of them are able to even if they did know. I don't know why I'm even posting this here. I doubt anyone can help me. I doubt anyone can actually do anything to change this situation that I'm in. I could just fail my classes but then that would make no difference. All my friends will have graduated and I'll still be stuck in high school or if by some magical chance I do manage to actually pass this year I'll still only have one year left of high school and yet I've never actually been to a real high school. All of the experiences I could have had, all of the friends I could have met, all of the things I could have done all of these years that I've been trapped in this terrible nightmare I'll never be able to get back. I often wonder if my life would be better then. If none of this had ever happened would be better off. Would I at least be happier in such a world I don't know.

183,"Not sure if this is the right sub blah blah blah. 

So I've been volunteering at a non profit that helps children since January. They had a huge fundraiser last weekend that I played a major roll in, specifically the silent auction. So since January I've been collecting donations, cold calling and walking in businesses, organizing donations, making baskets and setting minimum bids. The closer we got to the deadline the more responsibilities I held. Everyone on the board knew who I was and always talked about what a great job I was doing at committee meetings. The executive director has been singing my praises. At the actual event she specifically mentioned another women who works there and myself, saying this event couldn't have gone on without us. So I was pretty much a super star and not getting paid a dime for it. 

A couple months ago the executive director made a kind of announcement to me that the woman I've been working closely with is moving in August and she wants to hire me to replace her. I very enthusiastically told her I would love to and she said she would talk to the board. A couple days before the event I had lunch with the woman I would be replacing and she told me that the director does intend to hire me. So I think I'm pretty good. 

Here's the problem. I really want to start working now. I'm a stay at home mom, a decision my husband and I agreed on, but I'm ready to go back to work at least part time. I love all the ladies who work there, my daughter could use some socializing with other kids, and honestly I could use a little break from her as well. Plus we are looking to buy a house so I'd like to get an extra income to help save for a down payment. 

I don't know how to approach this. One of my friends who knows the director said to just ask her straight up. But I don't want to make things awkward. I mean I really rocked the event and I know the board would love to hire me on, but when she brought it up the director said August. I'm just not sure how to handle this. I'd also have to discuss pay. Because I'm working I'll have to put my daughter in daycare and that costs money. I know simce it is a non profit they can't pay me a fortune. But I should make enough to cover day care and take some home. Day care for 3 days all day is around $170 a week where I live, and $140 a week for 3 days but only 5 hours a day.

212,"Hello, everyone!

I don't know which subreddit to turn to, so I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. if anyone knows where I could get good help for this kind of a case, I'll be happy to try there as well!

I personally don't use snapchat, but she does, so if anyone can educate me on how that complicates things/makes things easier, that'd helpful.

So, my friend got ""hacked"" on Snapchat last summer, and basically, the hackers put caption on semi-nude photos like ""I'm a little whore, come fuck me"" or ""send dick picks"" etc. I think you get the point.

I only learned about this today because the hackers again posted from her profile and sent everyone these type of texts accompanied with the photos. I'm pretty sure this is insanely illegal, and my friend shouldn't be taken advantage of this way. Pretty sure you can even get jail time for distributing nude photos (although these are semi-nude, the way they post them and the ""hacking"" part might make it a more serious case).

Now, she is only 16~ years old, and she has had a couple of boyfriends and she is pretty ""sluty"". She claims she doesn't know anyone who would want to do this to her, but from what she's been telling me, I'm pretty sure that that's not the case, since a lot of her old boyfriends or their friends/rejected people might do this to her.

So I'm wondering - what exactly is the best way to handle this situation? I want the Snapchat profile banned first and foremost, but I'm afraid in the fact that I think this might not stop this distribution (although it will probably get rid of most of it). I don't know if there is any way I can somehow ""find them"", but I'd like the hackers/hacker to face consequences for what they have done to her.

Any Advice? My first move is probably finding out a way to solve this via snapchat support, but what else?

217,"Hello r/advice. I've come to you all for...I don't know yet. The humorous part of me would say, ""I've come for advice"", but that seems a little on the nose. Right now, the honest truth is that I feel stuck. I'm not expecting a magical solution or anything. To get success in life requires work and 
investment, I know and can appreciate that. Perhaps it would help to cover a few key points.

The Good:

* I've been told that I'm handsome. I'm still not convinced of this, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. (No, this isn't an r/amiugly post, so no worries there.)
* I know for a fact that I'm an introvert. But I can still gather the energy to talk to people, and apparently do it rather well. I'd like to believe that with practice I'd be great at presentations. 
* I love the thought of travelling. No question. I'm still terrified at the thought of being left alone and abandoned in a strange place, but I love the thought of being able to experience the wonders of the world that I've barely seen.
* Introverted though I am, I genuinely like to meet new people, to learn what they've experienced, and to listen to their stories. People are by their nature fascinating, much moreso than they realize, because of some of the things that they've done that I could never dream about. 
* One of my biggest assets, IMO, is my voice. I have been told that I have a naturally calming, soothing voice. I've been told that I would do well in radio and the like, but we've all seen those people that have done ""voice acting"" before, and fled screaming.
* One of the skills I have confidence in is my ability to hypnotize. I am self taught, and I've done it as something of a hobby for nearly a decade, though not in a professional setting.

The Bad: 

* I'm a lower class white male in my early 30s, and in a middle-of-nowhere Pacific Northwest town, USA. I have a spotty history of jobs in retail because that's what's around, and I can say honestly that it's not the profession for me, but I need to pay the bills. I want the chance to work a job that I'll enjoy, I just don't know what it is, yet.
* I don't...have the best hygeine. I'm not the sort to constantly smell of drugs and cat piss (those art the people I check out at work, believe me), but I admit I genuinely have issue keeping up with my appearance because of lack of healthy habits.
* With the exception of my student debt (below), I've got about 2,500 or so various small debts that have accumulated from various hospital bills, that kind of thing, but I've had a hard time trying to commit to paying them back, partly due to job history.
* I've done retail work, but as anyone knows, it's hard on the body. My back, my legs, my knees...they're all out of shape. I'm not an athletic person to begin with, but I can tell they'll only get worse from here, if I'm not careful.
* And I'm sure it ties into a lot of the things here, but...I don't know. I have some kind of depression. The most relief I get from my life right now is spending day after day cycling in a rut between playing a few games on my computer, reading a few comics, heading to work. It's a good day-in, day out for me, but it's not enough. I want to live. I want mroe in my life, but I'm still figuring out how to fix that day to day long enough to be able to taste success. I want to find out if it's depression that's causing me to hold back, or just...me.

The Ugly:

* Student debts. Spawn of satan to us all. I took out a handful of loans because they were helpful at the time, but I was also young enough I didn't realize the weight of them. I've been dodging them one way or another (Not saying it's smart, just stating the facts), and I'm fighting with myself to keep them out of default and the like. Despite that, I still don't have a degree proper. Right now, I'm sitting on a nest egg that's about $18,000 of hell.
* My teeth. My teeth...I've never learned how to brush proper, or consistently. I'm too old to blame my parents for it. The fact of the matter is that my teeth are rotting out of my skull. I have at least one front tooth that rotted to the point that it eroded and simply...popped out. I've already had one molar ripped out, and they're looking at three more, as well as a mouthful of fillings. I'd like to be able to afford to fix them, but the last dentist I spoke to quoted me with $50,000 to fix it all.

I can't help but be depressed, after all that. But day by day, I fight to go on. So I suppose, my question to all of you is this: How can I escape under this mountain of depression and debt with what time I have left on this rock to be able to better experience real happiness, life?",11May2017,2

222,"I've posted in like two other subs and received no help. This is like my last resort because I'm DYING for a happy outcome to this situation. I kinda bit off more than I can chew and *I'm the one that suggested we meet up* in the first place so I'm a nitwit. 


I'm homeschooled. I live in a rather unpleasant situation, where my mom and I are completely dependent on my abusive dad for everything. So I've been isolated. But it's okay, I've really been coming into my own person this past year. Going out by myself, doing my own laundry, cooking, doing dishes, shopping/ordering food on my own, etc. I feel ready to meet up with a friend, I just don't know how to break it to my mom or if I *should* feel guilty.


My mom used to not let me meet friends or have them over because she wanted to get to know them and their parents first but she said now that I'm older (5 months from 18) she said she doesn't care. But, there are still some hurdles.


Just some background: I've been homeschooled for about 6 years now and haven't had any friends in that time except for one girl who was my best friend in middle school. We only kept in touch through texting/face time, because of my mom's previously mentioned stipulations to having friends. I just didn't want to deal with it, really, especially since bringing anybody home meant dealing with nDad and nGrandma. So this is the first time I'll ever have met anybody outside of school, and first time seeing her in person in six years. I'm not too concerned; we mostly kept in touch and I know she's not a troublemaker or anything. We've been talking again for a few days now after a couple month break. I'm more concerned about breaking it to my mom. Because:



- She said she doesn't care (we had been talking randomly and I casually said she'd never let me meet with people, and she denied it). But I know better. I've spent every day with this woman, okay, I *know*. So I'm worried that she's gonna find some trivial reason I can't do it, like a street I'll need to cross is too busy or something. (That's why I can't go to a certain restaurant). I'm trying to be reasonable and understand that this is hard for her but if she isn't reasonable I don't know how to handle it.


- Up until very recently we never left the house without the other. Walks or anything. The reason being we're both stuck at home and isolated all the time and thought it wasn't fair. We agreed we need to stop that but my mom is still doing it. She won't go anywhere without me and when I go to McDonald's or whatever she's like ""fine, leave me here with him(my dad)..."" Another example of this is even when my older brother picked me up the other day, as soon as I got home she said she wants to join us next time. I know you're all gonna say she's grown and it's her problem but it's not that simple. She can't drive and has no money so she's very very limited. This really isn't her fault, it's a long story but I feel guilty about going anywhere without her but honestly I'm not the same homebody I was at 9. I NEED to be out of the house more than once a month, and as bad as it sounds, I NEED TO go out without my mom.


So I really don't know how to talk to her about jt. I never told her about this friend because I knew she wouldn't care/would immediately think the worst and I'm worried about what she'll say if I explain it to her now. So how do I even explain this to her and ask if I can meet with my friend? And before anyone suggests it, deception isn't an option lol. The only time I'm out the house is if I'm walking to McDonald's or the store and my mom knows about how long that takes so there's no way I can lie (and I'm not comfortable with it anyway). I need to do this so she's as comfortable with it as she can be and it doesn't ruin our relationship. Any advice is helpful. I've got a couple weeks and I'm gonna try to wait until after Mother's Day.


Part of me feels like I'm not doing anything wrong and the other part feels like I'm abandoning my mother. I don't think I'm being too unreasonable, and I desperately want to break this unhealthy cycle of isolation. I wish my mom would too because having no hobbies, friends, or activities simply isn't healthy but I can only work on myself and that's what I'm trying to do.


**TL;DR: I've been homeschooled for six years and I've only kept in touch with one friend, on and off, for that time. My mom never knew about her because I'm private. about that kind of thing due to my parents' attitude towards friends before. My mom and I are very close and have just recently started doing things without each other, but my mom is still overprotective and I think she resents me for doing it.**

223,"To start, this friend/lover of my roommate has done nothing but cause drama when she is around. I won't go into detail, but she's done a lot of shit to my roommate and has caused her to have multiple breakdowns because of her. I asked my roommate not to invite this girl over anymore. I do not like her. I do not want her in my house. The friend is also a druggy, but at the time that was not the reason I didn't want her around. This morning my wife texts me while I'm at work and tells me she only has 5 Klonopin in her prescription. She just had it filled on Tuesday, too two that day, and one yesterday. I know the bottle was full last night because I had moved it on the kitchen counter with the other meds that we keep there. It was on the dining room table this morning, not the kitchen counter where I left it, and like I said, more than half were missing.

My wife woke up our roommate, and admittedly I should not have been screaming violently at her from over the phone, but I was already upset that she had allowed her friend to come over when I had explicitly asked her not to, told her i didn't like her, and told her WHY I didn't like her which she was supposedly understanding of.

Anyway, after the fight this morning she immediately texts me that she is moving out and quit her job. This is after she fought with and kicked her friend out of our house the night before, and decided to defend said friend when we told her she had stolen the Klonopin. 

Our roommate is my best friend. We helped her out of a really shitty situation and got her clean off of Oxycontin. Recently she has been falling into a hole. Drinking a lot (and getting mean when she does), not going to work, not helping around the house, she pays her rent late every month, which isn't that big of a deal, but it contributes to the fact that she has had it so fucking easy living with us.

At this point I don't care that she's leaving. I'm planning on gathering all her shit up when I get home. But I need to know if I should end the friendship as well. She doesn't take advice. She doesn't respect me, as shown by inviting that girl into my house. What should I do?

230,"First of I'm 18 and female. The main reason why I ask this is because I have Autism so I don't know what certain things mean. Also this gets kind of long.

It started in the middle of April when we were getting our predicted grades for our Drama class. My acting needed work because I'm too quiet and need to get out there more. I was sitting in the common room talking to one of my best friends about it when a boy from my Drama class came out of nowhere and gave me advice. I felt honoured to get advice from him because he's the most confident person in my Drama class and he's usually more of a talker than a listener so it was kind of random. Since then I've been thinking about his advice which I don't normally do when it comes to advice.

Fast forward to last Friday. We all finished our final performance and our teacher told us to clean the assembly hall after us. We were the only two people who stayed to clean up (everyone else left for ice cream, jerks). He started talking about his personal life which was kind of random because we only properly talked once before that. He mentioned how he was rejected twice in his old school (he's from another country) and once more in our current school. He also started talking about how he used to be shy as well which obviously caught me off guard. We eventually cleaned the assembly hall and went to our next class.

Since then we have been continuing to talk. Two days ago we were talking about an exam coming up. He was saying that he was excited but I wasn't looking forward to it. He said that I should be more positive and less hard on myself. It felt nice but again I can't get his advice out of my head.

What does this all mean? I never follow anyone's advice because I don't like change but I've actually been listening to him and I can't stop thinking about it. It's driving me insane!",11May2017,5
231,"i am 24 and growing up, my parents were both emotionally abusive. my parents separated when i was 9 and i ended up living with my mom and her family for 7 years. it was 7 years of hell and emotional abuse. i was constantly told i was worthless and a burden for even basic necessities. i was always made guilty for asking for such things especially because they felt i should have went to my dad for money. my mom always made me ask for child support checks from him as a kid, and asking for it was like pulling teeth. hed hand it over to me angrily or just threw it at me. 

my moms family was emotionally abusive to the both of us and i never understood why we lived with them and why my mom never stood up for me. then in my last year of high school, she had suffered a stroke and on that day at the hospital, i had discovered she was living in canada with no status- and had been doing so even before i was born. everyone knew this, which explained why her family hated me and her so much. it explained why she had a stroke-- she never had a health card and was taking my grandmas prescription pills sporadically to treat her high blood pressure-- and she never had a real job to take care of me despite her always blaming me for being such a burden. tbh, she never had a reason to not apply for status since she was married, studied here and all her family was here. i think she was irrationally fearful. whatever her reason, i cannot find it in me to forgive her for the way she treated me and how she allowed her family to treat me the way they did as a child-- as if it was my fault that she had no money to take care of me, as if it was my fault for needing necessities to exist, when she should have applied for status and taken care of not only me but herself properly as well

fast forward 6 years later, shes being taken care of by legal aid and living in a non profit womens home.  for the past 6 years, ive grown a lot on my own as a person after having moving out alone and cut off my moms toxic family. ive also dealt with extreme resentment which has slowly gotten better over the years but i still have no interest in building a relationship with my parents. my dad, who never gave a shit about us, now calls me selfish and horrible for not wanting to visit my mom as much, or his family. my mom sometimes cries on the phone telling me i dont care and how can i be this way. and to be honest, it infuriates me for them to talk to me this way because ive been taking care of myself better than they ever did and now im the bad guy. what do they really expect from me after having treated me like a big inconvenience all my life?

i only keep them in my life out of obligation. i see them maybe once a month or less but even with that much distance, a visit can be so triggering and emotionally draining. ive struggled with this for years and i rly dont know what to do... i honestly just want to live my life without either of them calling me every now and then to yell at me or gaslight me. like i truly dont get how they can go from treating me like a burden and then calling me selfish and ungrateful now that i am on my own. but of course i just look like an awful daughter for wanting to cut ties with her parents especially my mom with the condition that she is in.

243,"Student here doing a web design class and the final project was to make a portfolio website. It's looking very basic (it's a scrolling page) but I want to know how to make a fixed navbar that changes as you scroll down the page. I need to have 'about', 'portfolio' and a 'contact' section, so naturally it's in order like that. I have [this](http://imgur.com/a6hIVh2) so far, theyre just buttons, but is it possible to have a navigation bar come down from the top of the screen after you scroll past these buttons?   

Another thing I like (and this is just a small detail) but the way some websites underline the word in the navbar as you scroll onto its link. So, for example, scrolling onto the 'portfolio' section would make the word be highlighted in the navbar, and it would be underlined.

**Offer 2** is a MUCH higher ranked school that has offered me NO scholarship but the degree here will be a MA in Marketing / Management. Ill be looking into new grounds such as finance and HR skills.

I was wondering what advice you guys would have about going to a better school for a more _general degree_ vs going to a lower ranked school for a _technical degree_ I would be stacking my skillset (I love my Job but I'm wondering if this is the right route to the hybrid client / production executive roll) while on the other hand does getting a degree from a top notch place hold weight in todays job market or will I be judged on what I produce / score during my program.
