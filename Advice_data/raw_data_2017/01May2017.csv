1,"Throw away just so my husband doesn't find this. My husband is a social person and I am not. Our mutual friends are always inviting us over, which is fine since I can make an escape when I start feeling overwhelmed and awkward.
Last Wednesday, my husband told me that he invited some people over to our house. I felt the need to split before they even arrived, so I'm currently hiding out in our office ""handling a work thing"" while he entertains them. That excuse will work for a few minutes, but we all work at the same place so I can't keep it going for long.
While helping him prep the house for our guests, I asked my husband if he could maybe entertain somewhere else in the future if he feels the need to be social, but it started an argument. I stopped helping him, which is making me feel worse since the house and food look unfinished.
What can I do to ease my nerves when there are people in my house? I want my husband to be happy and entertain when he wants, but I have no way to excuse myself for the night when I've had enough of people. I've considered just going out of town on the days he decides to host friends so that I don't have to deal with it, but that still seems very rude.

TL;DR: Husband wanted to socialize with friends in our house. I'm hiding in the office because I'm feeling overwhelmed. What do?",01May2017,1

6,"So i've already taken off about a week and a half for the end of May to go to a wedding in CA and visit my sister, which my boss approved with no problem. However I have another wedding to go to at the end of June/July in Europe and need to take another 2 weeks off for that period which I have yet to do. The reason I didn't take off sooner was because I've actually been thinking of quitting my job for a while and was planning on doing it before my Europe trip. However, recently my plans have changed and I would like to return to my job when I come back. Does it look really bad if I request another 2 weeks off only about a month after my other vacation? It is still a proper 6 week notice (the schedule is written out 2 weeks in advance so it's plenty of time). I have been working at this job for over a year now and am generally well liked and haven't taken vacation time since about October of last year. My boss is also almost never in office because he takes so much vacation time and he's generally pretty chill. I think I just feel guilty taking the extra time off because we have been short staffed lately and don't want to leave a bad impression. ",01May2017,1
7,"**TL;DR** - 

Take the good job offer and move to a different state 2k miles away tomorrow, or turn that down for the possibility of job of a lifetime?

**Detailed version** - 

I'm a 911 dispatcher.  Agency I was at was bought by a crappy nationwide one (three letter name, for anyone who works in private EMS).  I got out, worked in a doctor's office for a year, and decided I missed dispatching too much.  Husband and I have been kind of getting burned out on our local community for awhile since it's rapidly becoming less ""small western town"" and more ""California retirement village"" and so I started putting in dispatch applications all over the country.  We essentially sat down with a map, crossed out all of the states we didn't want to live in, and I applied everywhere else (he works from home so can work from anywhere).  

Of my top three, one was working for the National Parks in the state I currently reside in.  I'd dispatch PD/FD/EMS/Search &amp; Rescue.  I equate this one to playing college sports.  It's a great way to possibly start a fantastic career, and if nothing else is a thing that not a lot of people can say they have done.  I'd get to live at that park (one of the 7 natural wonders of the world), great pay &amp; benefits, and hell, it'd just be cool to say I worked there.  I'd put this one as number 2.

Number 3 was a job in my home state in the northern mid-west.  It's working for a private ambulance company that ISN'T owned by aforementioned EMS giant, and in the interview they mentioned how much they disliked the other company.  It has good benefits, decent pay, good hours, and it's ambulance only, which is really my favorite thing (dispatching police, for me at least, is kinda scary considering the current political climate in the US.  It's also not something I've done before).

So.  Thursday before last I get a call from #3 offering me the position, but I would need to fly out this week for orientation.  I had been kind of down in the week leading up to this, as I had been lead to believe in the interview that I would be hearing back from the next day, and so when a week had gone by I'd started to think I had just failed miserably at the skills test or something (turns out I had done exceptionally well, and they had wanted to offer me the job that day but had to go through HR first).  Because I was so down beforehand, I jumped at it and said yes without really thinking through the whole ""You have a week to get your crap together and move"" part.  Told husband, who while happy for me, was also kinda shell shocked.  He later said that, while he loved the idea of moving in abstract, when it became reality he was less enthused.

One hour later, I check my email.  I see one from the National Parks Service asking if I would like to begin the interview process with them.  It describes the job in a bit more detail, as well as mentioning you are obligated to live at the park, and that in the beginning families are not accommodated (so you can live for 6 months or more in apartments before being eligible to bid into bigger family housing).  Other than that one hang up, the job sounds awesome.  Everything I thought it would be, plus rotating shifts so I won't be stuck on nights until the end of time.  In order to continue the process, I needed to send in X amount of peer/supervisor references right away.  Did it immediately.  Because it was a larger amount than I was used to, and because half of the peers I usually used were supervisors anyway, I had to quickly cast a wider net to some slightly questionable sources.  Not 100% that 1) they will get back to the interviewer and 2) that their reviews will be as glowing as I would like (I was never a bad employee, but I do tend to speak my mind probably more than I should).  One of the friends I used forwarded me a copy of the questions they ask.  It's like a bunch of full paragraph answer type questions, almost like they're interviewing the reference.  Kinda crazy.

Anyway.  Now I am faced with a dilemma.  I am due to fly out tomorrow to start the process of working for EMS job 2k miles away.  I do the basic new hire stuff this week, the orientation next week, and start actual work the week after.  I'll end up living in an Extended Stay or renting a room for 2+ months while my husband packs up the house out here and gets our affairs in order, and I'll have to find us a place out there to live.  It will cost several thousand to move, and once we are there it will not be an easy/quick thing to come back.  Plane tickets are roughly $100-$150 each way if I need to go back/forth in the meantime.  I will also need to secure days off from a job that I just started (though they seemed like they'd be a bit understanding since I'm dropping everything to move from out of state).

As far as living there for us, it is a great place.  Beautiful area, younger/more vibrant.  If my husband's job goes away, there are plenty of other opportunities for him there.  I have family nearby, but not near enough that we have to deal with them on a daily basis (I love them but OMG large Irish Catholic family).  There are some cons though.  His father is not in great health and will only get worse.  Currently we are an 8 hour drive from his parents, and while we will be moving to a place with direct flights to his parents' city, it will still be more financially difficult to get out there.  I grew up out there, we've now lived here for 6 years.  I have friends in both places, and while my older, closer friends are out there, I have more friends here.  My husband's friends are all either mutual friends or not in either state so he's kind of a wash.  If I was to work at the park, while in theory we'd live apart longer, I'm (long distance) driving distance from our current house.  I'd be able to come ""home"" on whatever my days off are until I was finally able to bid into family housing.  So moving cost would be a helluva lot less.

Cons for the park job - 
For obvious reasons, it's a pretty secluded area.  Any kind of major shopping, doctor's appointments, etc are 1.5 hours away, and there's probably not anything more than satellite internet up there.  Since husband relies on internet for work, he might not be able to work up there.  Because of how housing works and pay scale though, he would not necessarily have to work if we lived there.  We are both ok with this in theory, but he's an old fashioned dude.  Dunno if he'd be ok with this long term (we don't have kids so the stay at home parent thing doesn't apply).  I'm also getting kind of a lot of pressure from family/old friends to move back to my home state.  I miss them all, it's been a long time.  I feel terrible telling them I'm coming back and then ""just kidding"".  **Biggest** one of all, and the most important here.  I don't have the job, and haven't even gotten an interview date.  I feel like an interview is imminent, but there's no guarantee I will get the job.  I have no idea what my competition (if any) is like.  I have no idea what qualifications they like/don't about me.  I did dispatch EMS for a neighboring agency, and I am very enthusiastic about this, so I have that going for me, but other than that everything is an unknown.

So.  Wat do?  Take the Midwest job and be happy?  Say nevermind and chance that dream job?  Or try and (possibly unsuccessfully) do both?  Which would mean starting the midwest job, sneakily fling back for interview for dream job, then quitting the EMS job if I get it.  Last one is currently the plan, but it's going to put us at/over our financial limit and possibly result in me getting fired from one and losing the other....which is why I am in freak out mode, and posting this on a Reddit advice forum 12 hours before I am supposed to get on a plane and fly out of here.

Sorry if this is all a bit difficult to read.  My brain is scrambled eggs right now because I am all kinds of messed up over this.  Husband has been simultaneously super supportive and no help, by saying ""it's your career.  You need to decide what will make you most happy, and I will go with it.""  *Edit - for slight clarity and formatting*",01May2017,2

18,"18 M. At a University with a major in physics, hardly.Posted here before but things are starting to reach a critical point.

My first year at college has been the worst year of my life. I'm already one semester behind of where I should be and to remedy that I was considering taking summer courses but...I'm just so tired of all of this. Every day I admit defeat to myself and say ""yep you should drop out..."" but then ten minutes later, some god awful force within me convinces me that I can stick to it and do it. It has been fluctuating like this every single day since the second semester started.

I'm constantly tired despite how much sleep I get, I have made zero friends (not that I really care anyway) and I just hate being here in general. Even the easy classes cause me to go into a fit of rage where I have to go for a walk to collect myself.

I don't know what to do. If I quit college, I will consider myself a failure and I will let a ton of people down. But if I stay in college, put it this way, I likely won't make it 3 or 4 more years. My love for science has been practically killed because I realized that science is disguised as something fun and exciting but then when you actually do it it is just math. My passion for physics has essentially died upon coming to terms with this.

My advisor is an indifferent piece of shit that doesn't have time for me and I have up on the tutoring centers last semester when I realized they were just upperclassmen who didn't want to actually be bothered. It feels like my face is grinding on pavement and I don't have motivation to do literally anything.

What do I do. No other major interests me, literally no other major at all (at any school)",01May2017,2
19,"Long story short a coworker and I didn't get along. She would yell at me in front of customers and make fun of me behind my back. I really hated her but I was too afraid to confront her so I just told on her to my manager.
They say us down and basically said to stop talking about each other or we'd be fired. I wanted to drop it anyway and just do my job. I hate drama. And all I've been doing since then is working and communicating with this girl only about work and with some pleasantries.
I thought things were going well until a few days ago.
It started with a few snarky comments that I ignored because I figured I might just be taking it the wrong way and she was being nice most of the time. 
Today I got a call from her saying my register was short $100 dollars, which during the duration of the call slowly widdled down to just $20 somehow.
So I went back to count the drawer myself and the whole time I'm doing this, she laughing at me and baiting my coworkers into making fun of me. Saying things like ""it's common sense to know how to count your register this isn't kindergarten."" I finally (sort of) stood up for myself and said ""you know ---, I'm just trying to sort this out you don't have to be like this"". I think she picks on me because she know won't really fight back 😞
Well guess what? My register wasn't short! She did it wrong! And I wanted to rub it in her face but all I said was ""there you go"" and stormed out of there pissed off as fuck. How dare she make fun of me like that just for wanting to count my register?
Then when I got home she sent me a message (big mistake) saying I should go back to kindergarten and that I lack common sense. I sent this to my manager but now I'm afraid I'll be fired for this drama. Even though I didn't say anything and I'm just trying to do my job. What can I do?",01May2017,1

38,"So, I have hung out with this guy twice in the past two weeks. I've liked him since around January and finally decided to ask him to do something. He said yes and we went to Starbucks. After Starbucks he asked me to come back to his house and we watched the office and he kissed me. However, this is the part that confuses me.

He will always be super willing to do stuff when I suggest or recommend it. Like after the first time we hung out, he seemed super into me and seemed like he was enjoying himself but, I had to ask for a second date. He even gave me his number but, he never initiates texting or hanging out but, will always say yes to me asking. The second date we went to Panera and then just sat in his car and talked and kissed again. He even asked if I would want to hang out again and I said yes but, we didn't get into specifics.

It's just very confusing because on one hand he always initiates kissing me and when we spend time together it seems that he always tries to find stuff to do so we can spend the longest amount of time together we can. He seems genuinely interested in me and when I suggest hanging out he is always super willing and excited. The part that confuses me is that, I always have to initiate. He never texts me and the last time we hung out was last Sunday. Now granted I have been out of town in California for a week and he knows that so I know it might just be because of that but, even before I left for California he wouldn't initiate texting or hanging out.

I did only wait about 5 days to ask between our first and second hang out so maybe I just didn't give him enough time. It's just so confusing and I really like him. Part of me thinks maybe I just make him nervous or he doesn't want to bother me but, there is a little part of me that feels like maybe he just doesn't care. I know I'm probably totally overthinking this, I just really like him. Any help is appreciated.",01May2017,0

46,"OK so I started working with this company called cutco and at first I really wanted this job because they said $15 an hour and then once I went to the training I realized it wasn't an hour it was per appointment. There was a bunch of sketchy stuff that I didn't catch on to because of how gullible I am. Today was my last day of training and I finally told my mom I had got a job (I haven't told her because I wanted to surprise her) but she catched on quickly when I started to tell her everything we did in training and that's one finally everything clicked. Now I realize how they got me. So now I have 3 appointments tomorrow and realize how the company works and I want to quit but Idk how to do it without being disrespectful to the manager.

She knew all day about the strippers, but only asked if I was okay about it WHILST she was there... with the strippers. And I flipped, I told her I'm gonna leave her and basically told her shes a bad girlfriend.

This wasn't the first time, she went on holiday and never told me about it, she got a job, never told me about it, if she breaks up with me, I might not know about it.

50,"An old friend who I have not seen in years visited me recently. We chatted for a couple of weeks and in that time she mentioned that she has OCD. She seemed nice over the phone and Skype, so we decided to meet up. We went out to concerts, dinners, and movies to get to know each other better. While we were together I noticed her OCD flaring up. She would ask me, ""Is everything okay?"" about every 5 minutes. While listening to music, she would be constantly concerned if I liked the song that she was playing. Even when I reassured her that I enjoyed that song, she would say, ""I can tell you are not enjoying that song."" and play something else. I also noticed that she lied about different things because she was afraid of disappointing me. She sent me pictures of herself that she said she just took, but were clearly her old Facebook pictures. She would mention she had a great time hanging out and talking with her friends, when she has not seen them in a year. I honestly do not care about these little lies, I am just concerned she feels so much pressure to impress me from her OCD that she has to lie. She is such a sweet and warm hearted individual. I just want to know what is the best way to get her help. She is already seeking therapy and medication for OCD, are there any other resources you would recommend? Also, what is a polite way to mention that she should seek more help or maybe try a different method?

51,"So I graduated last May with a Bachelors. It's one of those foundational degrees where you're unable to actually use and apply that information you 'learned' until you get into a Master's or Professional/Graduate program. It also took me almost my entire college career to figure out what I even wanted to do with it. 

That same year, I had applied for a couple of professional programs, but got rejected by all of them because it is very competitive. So I'm waiting for the next application cycle to start. 

Today, I'm taking a class on physics and considering of taking a class on chemistry in the fall. I've never been the best at it, but lately I've been getting more and more curious about more physics and chemistry and environmental sciences. 

So my question is: should I see this through? I'm afraid my Plan A of going to professional school is slowly growing farther from within my reach because I've apparently lost my 'passion' for it and I'm not as curious. Or should I just play it safe and just read and learn recreationally about the subjects? How does one know what they're meant for? Sheesh. ",01May2017,1
52,"After a couple of months of avoiding the entire family, today my 21 year-old 2nd cousin (who is like a little sister to me) told me that she is pregnant. I am the only one in the family who is allowed to know for now. My first question was if she is keeping it, and she said yes, to which I simply responded, ""Then congrats! Let me know if you need anything."" I didn't know what else to say. She's confiding in me because we're the only family members who don't judge each other, but the irony is, this is the first time I'm kind of judging her, and I do feel quite awful about it. 

For some further context: About a year ago, my cousin moved back to Washington from South Dakota, and it's the first time she's been living here again since she was about five years old. She moved in with her grandmother (my aunt), so that she wouldn't need to worry about paying rent, could work part-time, go to college, and save money. My aunt even paid for her other college expenses that financial aid wouldn't cover. We're all pretty chill about that in the family, because we believe having a higher education is important, and if we can support the costs, it's worth it to educate our family members. 

Since then, she has dropped out of school (not the first time, unfortunately), thought about pursing a career as a talent scout (she has some connections), didn't, started dating this guy (who I haven't met yet, but he seems nice enough from social media), and about three months ago, both of them quit their jobs. I believe her boyfriend goes to school. He lives with his parents. 

The family has been concerned because my cousin has been rather avoidant lately. In the past couple of days, I heard from my mother, who talked with my aunt, that she has only seen my cousin twice in the past couple of months. Apparently my cousin moved out of my aunt's house and is living with her boyfriend in his parent's house. She has started seeing a counselor (which is really good imo) and started taking anti-depressants. Neither of them still have jobs, and she's still not back in school. 

In our text conversation, she expressed that she's scared. I was blunt and told her, ""Well, you know I am a bit biased because I'm not a fan of children, so I would be scared too! But you two are smart, so I am sure that if you came to this decision, that you have a good plan and it's going to be okay."" I said this in hopes that it would plant a seed. Clearly, in my opinion, they DON'T have a good plan. You're both unemployed, both uneducated, you've been with this guy for maybe 9 months, live at his parent's house, and you're young and had so many plans with your life!! 

She said she was concerned about what the family would think as well, and I assured her that they would probably be ecstatic since the family is being overrun by baby fever (we have one other family member who just had a baby, and another who is currently pregnant). I'm sure the family will be supportive, especially since my cousin is kind of a golden child, but they will likely talk ill behind her back as they do with everybody. 

**Basically what I need advice on** is how to continue to be supportive and try not to pass judgement on her even though I don't agree with her keeping the child. Part of me really wants to be honest with her, but the other part of me is afraid that will make her push away from me. But then again, I'm kind of selfish in that I finally get more time to spend with her now that she has moved back to Washington, but now that's all ruined because she's going to have a baby. I wanted to spend our young adulthood together. It's selfish of me... I know that. She's just also smart, and talented, and has so much potential, and I know she'll make an amazing mother some day, but I wish that day wasn't happening so soon.

I understand that tensions in the region are an annual thing on account of the war games, but my understanding is that these generally end with us giving N.K food and other such supplies. This time around it's different. The U.S has taken proactive, provocative measures by sending warships and THAAD systems, even talking with the ""leaders"" in Singapore, Thailand, and Philippines. We're dealing with a totally irrational leader during an uncertain time in the region, and adding Kim Jong Un to the picture distorts things further. There is also the issue of Russia's silence on the matter. I seriously doubt Washington will let this escalate into Trump's playtime, but the man has proven us wrong so many times already. His failure to bring about any productive change whatsoever in the first 100 days means he can't stand to look the fool again--how convenient a military victory would be! His actions in Syria and Afghanistan show us that he isn't averse to an excessive show of force, either. Only the thousands of U.S civilians and troops in the region, specifically in Seoul, would almost certainly die if violence erupted. There simply is no way that the THAAD system, placed 125 miles south of Seoul, could protect it in this case. This report http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/THAAD-031016-Michael-Elleman-and-Michael-Zagurek.pdf points out the possibility if not the probability of its being overwhelmed by a barrage of missiles.

69,"I work at a retirement home where i'm there from 2:30-7:30. From 2 weeks after i started until around February things were going smoothly, i always got out by 7:30 and got out late every once in a while.

Recently my boss has been asking me for a lot more than i can handle. She's added a few things i'm supposed to clean and ever with that i still got out around the same time but now she wants me to come in at 3 but i can't have all my stuff done and ready before 4:30, she wants me to clean these dinner carts, but i can't since my coworker works slowly and i'm not going to wait for her to finish so i can get started (which is around 9:30, but cleaning those carts has always been their job), and she's been asking me to ditch my classes because someone couldn't go to work these past 2 weeks. I have 3 days off for a reason yet she's called me telling me someone didn't know they were working last week and this week someone else got sick. I'm tired, pissed off, and behind in school now.

But what's really pissing me off is she told me today that i need to get everything done by at least 8 (other wise i'm paid overtime), but with the carts it was ""okay if i stay a little past 8"". Today we finished late and i didn't leave until around 8:15, my coworker hasn't got any of the carts ready for me to clean, and i have class tomorrow.

The nurses there you'd think are saints but sometimes i feel like i know better than them when it comes to what a patient can eat. Like sometimes a patient who is allergic to milk products will ask for something with milk products. I, having an near eidetic memory, recall this person can't have this certain food yet a nurse will be oblivious to that and ask for it on behalf of that patient anyways. Yesterday we started late because there wasn't a single nurse in the dining room (we can't serve without them there). Today a nurse literally stopped me to write down the info for a new resident rather than take it to us herself. It isn't like she had it ready to go it was obviously that she didn't wanna take it herself because she wrote it down on the spot.

But i'm use to that from the nurses. I get their job is far more important but they aren't trying to be dicks about it.

Recently the residents have been ticking me off and they were originally the reason i liked my job.  i feel like a lot of them think they're entitled to whatever they want. Like i have today's dessert and that's what most patients should get, yet they'll ask for ice cream. One patient stopped me while i was talking to another patient at another table so i could attend to them like i skipped them on purpose. When I tried explaining i usually go around in a circle and they quickly denied that.

Last week a different patient was mad that he couldn't have certain food and blamed me even though i have no control over that. 

I don't like my job anymore. That short hour of interaction with the nice patients used to make up for the other 4 hours and now i just want to quit. I'm looking for a summer internship right now, i'm fairly close to getting one, but it's unpaid so i need a job. i don't know if i wanna stay there because there are some patients i do like and i think they'd be disappointed if i left",01May2017,1

71,"I'm starting my junior year in college this fall, and I've been stressed about what the hell I'm doing since the beginning. I've never had a clear idea of what I wanted to do ""when I grow up."" I've dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety that have clouded that. I do honestly love school though. This past semester I FINALLY declared a major (english), and I spent a lot of time trying to decide between a history or psychology minor (because those were things I was interested in but not looking for a career in). I went with psych. 

But I had a conversation a few weeks ago with my now ex that has kind of sent me into an existential crisis. I was going through a bit of a depressive episode due to stress, and he went on a tangent about how I needed to find goals to drive me. He is studying to be a doctor, but in his words ""career isn't enough."" He wants to go to space and help kids in war zones and eventually retire. Those, on top of his career, are the things that drive him.

I've always had difficulty with long-term goals because I never knew what I wanted to do. My goals have always been vague-- be happy, experience life. The english major-- writing, critical thinking-- it makes me happy, and I'd like a career in editing or technical writing or something along those lines. But all the people around me, my ex's friends, they have goals to help people. Doctors, dentists, pharmacists. And he explained those goals that MEANT something and were outside his career. 

When I realized I don't have those, I panicked. I still don't know who I am, I don't feel like a whole person (the breakup certainly didn't help, but that's not the point). I realized the only thing I have ever felt really passionately about is animals. When I was younger I wanted to be a vet, when I started college I wanted to do biology to research animals (didn't pan out). So I started looking into internships with places like WWF. I started looking at an environmental studies minor. 

And now I'm at a crossroads. I changed my schedule around and realized this minor is extremely hard to schedule because my school rarely offers the classes needed, so it doesn't give me much time for work or volunteering (which I need lots of time for for my school's honors program). Let alone extracurriculars and social time, which I am trying to get more of as I've neglected these things the past two years, and self-care. On top of this, the classes don't look at all like something I would enjoy. They stress me out more than anything.

My question is, is the minor worth it? I know minors don't mean much, but I don't want to use my time on a psych minor I will never use just because I enjoy it and then find out the environmental studies minor would have given me the opportunity to help out in conservation or animal rescue or SOMETHING. But I also don't want to stress myself out so much, make my schedule absolutely horrible, and take classes I won't enjoy at all for a minor that won't mean shit. And how do I ever flesh out and achieve this goal of ""helping animals/the environment?"" I always thought I would become a researcher and help save animals from poachers or something (I was young lol). Anything I can think of isn't anywhere close to my ex's ""helping kids in war zones."" 

And while I'm here... how the hell do I make these kinds of goals that drive me? Are the goals of ""be happy"" and ""experience life"" shitty goals? How do I find what I want, How do I find who I am? I don't feel like a person, at least not a whole one. I don't have an identity compared to all these people I know who seem so sure in what they're doing. I'm starting to question my entire existence.

TLDR: I can minor in psychology which I find interesting and offers flexibility in my schedule, or I can minor in environmental studies which is nothing but stress but is the only way I can think of that may or may not help me ""make a difference."" Don't know what my goals in life are, if a minor will even matter in the end, or how I can accomplish my half-baked goal of making a difference by helping animals/the environment.

I been 6 years married and it's been a Rollercoaster. My husband has accused me of hitting of his friends or dating a lesbian and so much more. I have been faithful to him at all times. This hurts me so much after everything we have gone together. Our arguments never get fixed, It's always pointing fingers to eachother. He doesn't know that it's hurting me so much inside with his words. I feel this was a waste of time trying to put sense on his mind. I hate what I have become and I hate that I'm not happy.

I have potential plans with a friend to go to a music festival over the summer. We would take the train there and then get a hotel for a few nights. However, I just realized that she might want to invite her girlfriend. Her gf is cool but I've only hung out with them as a couple a few times (mostly because I go to school 2 hours away and only see my friend on breaks). It's not like they would ditch me, but I can definitely see myself becoming kind of a third wheel while they dance together or w/e. Of course I'm not going to tell her not to invite her gf, but if she wants to, I would probably reconsider going (it would be fine if I had other friends there, but we already asked and no one else can make it). I don't want to spend the time/money if I'm gonna feel a bit awkward and left out for a weekend.

Obviously the best thing to do is to just ask my friend if she's planning to invite her gf. But before I do, I want to hear other people's opinions on whether it's fair or not for me to back out of plans to avoid third wheeling. We're all 20-23/f btw.",01May2017,1

Awful teacher imo and was terrible at helping and teaching the class. I received a text from the Assistant Dean a day later saying to contact her. I called and she said it ""worried her"" because of the ""current state of the world"" like ISIS is a good thing. She said she wants me to go in and speak with a specific counselor she chose and I said I would. It feels very politically motivated because she wouldn't stop with the ""Trump"" part. 

I feel like it's dumb because:
1. I did not use any vulgar or explicit language
2. Did not use any sort of threat
3. Read through the school's guidelines and policy and doesn't show I violated anything
4. Could have posted this on one of the teacher rating sites and they could do nothing about it. 

Wanted to hear people's opinions on it, not a huge deal but it could turn into one if they want me to do anything further than speak with a counselor one time, even though I think even that is unnecessary.

I'm not kidding-- even with new people at work, she'll randomly say something like 'I think I'll stick a knife in a socket tonight!"" or for example if you're discussing parents and ask about hers she'll say something like ""Yeah, well, quite honestly I wish my parents were dead."" or other comments like this. She does it in a very flippant tone, too, like she thinks it's hilarious.  
  
The thing is, I know she really does feel these things-- but she drops this stuff into conversation in such a way that it's less like she's trying to (I guess?) ask for help than shock random people because she's bored.

So I'm two years into school here, and while I like being at school and being out here (far away from home - that's all I'll say), I've been feeling extremely lonely. I've had a lot of trouble making friends, and especially making female friends. I have a small group of friends, but it's all male, and honestly it's not very fulfilling. I'm in a major that is both overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly antisocial (Computer Science), so it's been hard to meet people and make friends in my classes. I had/have also been struggling with depression for most of my first two years here, so all in all I feel like my social life is pretty stunted here.

So basically what I want to know, is if it's possible to sort of ""reset"" when I come back to school in the fall (it's too late in the year now to do all that much). What can/should I do?

For some context, I'm only in one engineering club right now, which isn't so social. I'm not super attractive I don't think, and I'm not in great shape (trying to work on that as much as possible). Greek life doesn't really interest me - I don't like the stigma and the reputation that comes with it.

Recently I had a formal event, so I went to get a manicure. I went to a small salon that a friend of mine owns. My friend herself did the manicure, and I could see that all of her tools were clean, and she wore gloves.

However, less than a week later, a wart has popped up on my nail bed. 

I have had warts on my hands before, so I know what they look like. Also, I had them years ago, so I doubt that it was passed from one part of my body to another.

I am a non confrontational person and I really don't want to offend my friend, but frankly I'm grossed out and annoyed. I am not quite sure what to do, because I value our friendship and to be fair, this wart could possibly even be from somewhere else and I just didn't notice.

Right now I assume my options are:

1) Tell my friend politely and risk offending her and damaging our friendship, but at the same time this might increase her protocol and stop this from happening to a client who will go to the health authorities about it

2) Self treat it and not say anything about it, but then potentially have someone in the future go to the health authorities about it

My worst fear would be for my friend to get her salon shut down, but I am also afraid to confront her and offend her, especially if I didn't get it from her salon in the first place.

Anyone have any advice?

106,"I don't know how to word this, will try my best.

I am a father of 3, happily married man, 32 y/o and an engineer with a decent job. I hate my job with a passion, but its all I am qualified to do without moving away and it does allow me to pay for the family. We never have any money at the end of the month, but we never have hungry children, in this day and age that's a blessing right??

I say never have any money, we do put some into savings etc so I am not on the bread line, if both me and my wife lost our jobs we could survive anywhere from a month to maybe 3 months depending on how generous our family was lol, so I don't have spare cash but am very aware im better off than most in this world.

the reason I am saying this is because I want to quit my job, I have a deeply ingrained wish to change stuff about the world I live in. I feel that I am a corporate slave, I live in a world where I work long hours to make money for a select few, the CEO's and shareholders and the like, none of whom have any consideration for the life of me, my family or that of my co-workers.

my company is a large multinational firm, and our CEO makes in the region of 1.2mil per year, with rumors of a 450% bonus, and all we see him doing is travelling the world, meeting dignitaries and making his travel blog, designed to make us think he is fighting the good fight on our behalf. 

I don't know the guy, so talking about him personally is redundant, but I do know that he travels the world in luxury, making more money in a year than my entire living family has ever made or will ever make in their combined lives, and that disgusts me.

I had made my peace with it a long time ago, I am hard working, but not ambitious, I don't want to be a boss or a manager or a CEO, I just wanted to get by, but now I realize, if this doesn't change, then my children cannot expect any better, and that by being part of this system, I am helping ensure they live the same life of servitude that I do.

I want better for them, but by better I don't mean the life of my CEO, I want them to have choices, to life in a better society that cares about them as much as I do, or at least one that gives them the choices I know they deserve.

I do my best to teach them about this world, but of course they don't listen, who ever listens to their parents, and they are still young so most of anything I say is totally abstract to them anyway. 

I try to be optimistic, im that kinda person, but it makes me feel like I am burying my head instead of dealing with the problem. even before I had kids I had worked on my idea of a better society, the basics of which we can all agree on, basically freedom and responsibility tied together in a nice cohesion.

And it is easier than most imagine, all it takes is showing our kids exactly what that means, it will make our lifes a bit better as we will see the start of social change but it will make our kids and our grandkids lives immeasurably better as they see the brunt of it.

my wife is not of the same opinion, she believes that the right route is to let those in power currently continue to do their job and that they will sort everything eventually. I totally disagree and see them as the incompetent elite who are totally lost, I don't hate them as that is pointless, but I don't think they are capable of helping us in any large scale way.

I strongly feel that if I could get into their game, I could change it up and I have done the work to develop a plan that would allow me to make changes and I really really believe that together we could instigate the beginning of real change, something tangible and ultimately real, to allow our kids to take the world off our hands and run it properly. I can provide details if anyone is interested. lol

the big issue is, of course, funding. I cannot afford to run for a political position and fail, my job wouldn't take me back, why would they when I argue for their demise? and if I fail I am left with no job and its not me that suffers its my family. the thing about politics is that it is about what you say you will achieve but also about personality, and I don't know that I have the right stuff. convincing people that my ideas have merit don't rely entirely on the merit of said ideas, but about how they are delivered, and sold to the masses.

I don't know that I have what it takes. it could, and most likely would be a disaster, but I cannot get over the compunction to try!!

please help.

TL:DR - daft idiot with (well meaning) delusions of grandeur wants to risk his entire family life to try and achieve world domination.

107,"I'll try to keep this brief if only to not bore anyone to tears, though I'll probably fail on both counts. Fair warning!

So, a month or so ago someone added me on Facebook who I didn't know, but we had a mutual friend and he had liked my comment on that mutual friend's post. (That friend has since told me they didn't actually know each other but had presumably added each other in a similar way to how I'll describe.) A lot of people on my Facebook actually are people I know through old online communities or that have added me because we are in the same FB groups or follow some of the same people and occasionally comment on them, etc, so I didn't think anything of it at the time. I've met a lot of cool people (sometimes in person eventually) that way and hey, it's nice having some people in your feed who have similar interests and views. More interesting than someone I sort of knew in college telling me about their trips to the gym.

Anyway, this person seemed normal enough (albeit he posted a LOT), but in the last few days his behavior at least with me has become deranged. He went from occasionally liking or commenting on something I posted to commenting on EVERYTHING. He started repeatedly posting on my wall either posting weirdly fanboyish things (for context: I'm straight, male, have a girlfriend, and haven't specifically sensed that there is a romantic or sexual fixation here) about how much he likes my posts, or to ask my opinion on various things (what I think of this or that movie, etc). Not only that, he started to apparently search for old posts and started liking them and even commenting on them - some of them are REALLY old, like from 2009 or 2010. He added a bunch of my friends (since some of them are people I knew on online communities, they assumed from the mutual friendship that he was someone from those communities that they just didn't remember the online username of) and subsequently of course some of them noticed how often he was commenting on really old posts and voiced concern. Although I am known to post a lot of longer opinions on various things (politics, movies I've liked or disliked, etc), almost like a personal blog, to be frank a lot of the posts he was digging up weren't even anything special and were just dumb memes or YouTube videos or things like that that I really don't even remember posting, yet he would take the time to mention how much he ""appreciated"" these posts. He's now admitted a couple times in wall posts or private chats that he has ""obsessive"" tendencies and most recently sent me a long chat message saying that he's been ""obsessed with you to say the least"" in the last few days and expressing sadness that I haven't been replying to his constant comments (which I wasn't doing because they were constant and annoying and needless to say, creeping me the hell out). He seems to have some self-awareness that he's been a ""nuisance"" (his words) but of course, hasn't really stopped. I finally sent him a message basically saying that his behavior hasn't really been healthy or appropriate and that he should probably seek some kind of help, and unfriended him.

My girlfriend and I have friends who are bipolar and have had manic episodes, and my GF says that this struck her as a manic episode, which is the only reason I didn't unfriend him earlier (which I obviously probably should have done); I was afraid my dropping him might lead an unstable person to go even deeper into whatever psychiatric episode he's deep into and harm himself in some way. But of course at a certain point I have my own problems to deal with and it can't really be my responsibility to help someone I don't really know. 

Before I dropped him I started making my own posts as well as ones made by friends on my page invisible from him, and while my address isn't visible (other than the city I live in) I did realize that my phone number was visible to friends until changing that recently. As far as I know he lives in another state entirely although we are both on the east coast I believe. 

I guess I have a couple questions: was it right to send him a message basically recommending that he get some help and telling him that this behavior obviously wasn't healthy, or is that likely to exacerbate whatever situation he's in? And do you think I have anything to worry about as far as my own personal safety, and if so, what precautions should I take?",01May2017,1

My 'broken brain' means I have seizures, but the main problem I'm having is the way it affects my memory. My memory seems to slowly delete details of things day by day, without constant revision I lose things that I've learnt and forget things that have happened.

This is extremely obvious when talking with friends and trying to expand upon my studies. Last year I did computer science at uni, I wanted to do electrical engineering but didn't have the A-level maths and didn't want to do a foundation year for it.

I did computer science but the memory issues really affected my learning ability and this was amplified by my lack of interest.

I work for the government and have the opportunity to move a lot for work and my salary increases and i get a free house to move into meaning I can rent my house out. Moving costs for myself and family are all paid for each time but my wife refuses to move.
So basically I go away for work and come back and see my kids every few months for a week or 2 then back to work. I've been away for a year and now I feel like I should tell my wife I'll divorce her if she doesn't want to live with me. Keeping in mind she has no income and cannot survive without me. I feel guilty for even thinking about it but she absolutely refuses to move. 
She also refuses to try anything new whether it's new food, new style of clothes, new place to visit etc.

142,"I would like to ask for thoughts from a more mature person for advice regarding my problems. I have been contemplating on what to do it with it, but I thought it was better to ask from someone who has a better grasp of what to do.

I had this girl best friend that I have been friends for a long time, and as we talked together, we started to develop feelings for each other. It was obvious that the people around us kept pushing us to just confess, but I made the first move and told her what I feel. She told me that she felt the same way; however we did not start a relationship with each other because we promised each other to put our studies first and we set a goal that both of us should get high grades.

It was going really well. When I am not able to talk to her in person, I just send her some letters (Non-sappy ones, I usually just ask her about her day, remind her to not push herself too hard or she ends up getting sick, and some advices to aid her in her studies). We both got high grades and we were honor students.

I would occasionally hear from her friends that she told them that she has strong feelings or that she misses me, or that she would kill me if I fail to take the tests whenever I got sick. (I tend to have asthma attacks, which forces me to stay home. But nonetheless, she still supports me in my studies). I admit that I sometimes go overboard with my concern, because she kind of laughed at me and called me cheesy when I found out that she cried in her class and I panicked (A bit. I immediately confronted her about it) Knowing her she does not do that unless it's serious. I felt bad because apparently she thought that I was angry with her over something. 

Then one day I heard from her best friend that she would participate in our school's CAT training, because when her best friend was teasing her about it, she told her that ""She didn't want it anymore, that she would just join for it to stop"". CAT was not required for her current level, but it was required for me. I support her decision in joining, but I cannot help but feel a bit selfish sometimes, wishing for her to join next S.Y, because that means she would have barely enough time to sped with my last S.Y and I hate myself for it. However, I feel happy for her because she's going to improve herself.

I am also confused, because she seems to be sending mixed signals whether she's fine with our state or she wants to cut me off altogether. I feel angry at myself because there's this nagging feeling inside me that wants to be selfish. What should I do now? I want to tell her what I feel, but I do not want to lose her when I do that. Ultimately, I just wish that she would still have some time to hang out together, even when pursuing her goals. I do not want to bother her too, which makes me hesitant to ask her to spend time together for fear of hindering her (For example, I would sometimes ask her if she wanted to hang out after classes, but I feel like I'm being too clingy, even when she is my closest best friend).

So what should I do? Thank you for your time for reading this.",01May2017,1
143,"I accidentally got my Boss accused of deep ripping vernal pools that are protected under the Clean Water Act.

First, a bit of background. I'm in the UK, so I left school at sixteen with really good grades (A*/A mostly). I've always been very good academically, and was even voted most likely to succeed. I was considered 'the smart one' of the family so everyone expected me to do really well.

I went to a good college, and in my first year I got decent grades at AS-level. I was given conditional offers at all five of the universities that I applied to. My second year didn't go so well however, there was a lot going on at home and I think I became depressed and missed a lot of college. My A-level grades weren't as good as I hoped, so I decided to take a year out and retake my exams at the end of it.

I didn't have enough money to travel, so instead I took a few minimum wage jobs which I hated. There tended to be a lot of drama at the first place I worked at and the second and third place wasn't very organised so I never really knew when I was working. I retook my exams, but my results were the same, because I was working all the time and I couldn't muster up the energy to study.

I quit my last job and went to decent university local to me anyway. I stayed at home, which made it difficult for me to make friends. All of my friends were at different universities so I felt really lonely over my gap year and throughout this year at university. In my first semester I skipped a lot of lectures and just stayed at home and dossed about instead. I did okay at the end of my exams though, I passed 2/3rds of the modules.

When this semester started I was determined to go to every lecture, and I did do that in the beginning. However this stopped and I ended up having a bit of a breakdown and seeing the doctor. The doctor has put me on 100mg Sertraline and I'm going to some group therapy sessions as the waiting line for CBT is quite long.

Anyway, I stopped attending any of my lectures, and the less I went to my lectures the more anxious I felt over going to my lectures. This has left me at this point with my exams in two weeks but without doing any revision at all.

I'm thinking of leaving university, potentially moving out, and getting a job next year. The problems with this are that I kind of need my degree to go into the field that I want to go into (but I need a first anyway and that might not be possible). Also, if I don't finish University I need to pay back my student loans ASAP which is not doable because it's about 17 grand for this entire year, so I'm thinking of doing University part time instead. I haven't been out (clubbing/partying) at all this year, and have never been out of the country, and I would like to embrace my twenties and do that. I'm just really confused. Does anyone have any experience with this or any advice that I can have?

148,"Hi, I have no idea what to do with my life right now, any advice, tips, consolation would be appreciated. Here are the basics:  
* Started working at new company about 6 months ago  
* Moved in together with then-bf the same time as I started working  
* My mom has a flat but it's far away from my workplace and nobody lives there  
* My dad has a house even more far away than my flat but he lives there  
* I have a dog with separation anxiety  
I moved out from my bf's flat because we broke up. I decided to give my dog to my dad temporarily(!) meanwhile I stay 4 days a week at my mom's place and 3 days at my dad's place. I decided to give my dog to my dad because otherwise he'd be alone 11-12 hours a day if he stayed with me at my mom's all the time.
This is only a very temporary solution as I love my dog and don't want to give him to anybody permanently. I have no idea what to do and these are the options I could think of:  
* Move in with my dad -&gt; No rent, dog's never alone, but I'm 25 so I don't want to live with my parents  
* Move in to my mom's place with dog -&gt; Dog is alone for 11-12 hours a day and I have no social life whatsoever as I can't leave my dog alone at night but at least I don't have to give him away  
* Rent a flat -&gt; Dog would still be alone for many hours but probs not 11-12 hours as I'd rent a flat closer to the workplace but I'd have to pay half my salary at least  
* Buy a flat -&gt; Might/might not have enough money to do it, and dog would bark all day for the first 6 months for sure but at least couldn't get thrown out because of it  
* Buy a house -&gt; Would need to get a loan for this, but at least I'd pay for my own house, might not have enough money to pay a loan though, but having a house is a good solution for all my problems   
  
I can't think of any other options, help? I feel like I have no home  and I'm failing myself and my dog. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? ",01May2017,2

155,"I don't know whether its because I am a delusional narcissist or whether my family are just trying to shame me but they all label me as the spoilt one in this family but I disagree?

My whole family is very dysfunctional. I think it all stems from my Dad. Firstly, they think that a mental problem isn't a real thing. They are in denial about every mental problem there is. 

For example, right now my family are arguing about my brother who gambles. He steals mine and my brothers money to do it because he is obviously addicted. My dad is in denial about this and just says he needs to man up and grow some balls and saying he is addicted is just an excuse.. he then shouts at my brother which obviously does not help as he then gambles again the next day?

Meanwhile, my mum keeps the amount of money my brother actually gambles a secret from my Dad because he gets angry and my mum feels bad for my brother that gambles -- this is usually because my gambling brother will manipulate my mum into feeling bad by saying something like 'well done'.

Anyway, these past recent months I have felt really sad because I feel like my family emotionally bully me. My gambling brother has been the worse and literally every time I walked into the room he'd say something negative that would hurt me. I also notice that my family tend to blame me for a lot when things go wrong - but I know in my mind that its nothing to do with me.. but my whole family gang up against me. 

The reason my family think I am spoilt is because my parents recently have given me £1000 for my second collection of my fashion brand. I was originally wanting to take out a loan but they prevented me from doing that and instead offered me the money for a startup. It's not like they are just giving me the money? I am running a business and doing lots of hard work with it. I make the website, I design, I do the social media, I talk with the printers, I promote, I photograph etc. Just because I don't have a weekend job does not mean I am spoilt - I am making money a different way?

My brothers also argue that I am spoilt that my parents bought me a £1500 camera for my 18th. But this is to support my future as I am in the creative business. Plus, our family considers 18 a big birthday. My brothers received Mac laptops and a paid trip to Ibiza that my mum actually said worked out a lot more then my present. But whenever my brothers say that I am spoilt and use that argument against me my mum never speaks up for me?

My dad also calls me spoilt. And it bothers me because I do work hard with my business. My whole life is revolved around my college work and my Fashion brand. I spend the majority of time working towards that rather then going out socializing etc. 

I just want peoples opinions on the matter to be honest.. because I am a little scared i'm actually a massive spoilt brat as thats not an attractive trait. But i'm more scared that i'm not aware of the fact..

He also gets really repetitive with his rising hate on woman, screencaping and sending me images of people he deems as cancer on his facebook.

One of them clearly was flirting with me. She asked me what I did for a living, where I lived, and she made it known that she was in fact single, etc.


Normally I'd be fully invested in the conversation we had but the bar was so damn loud coupled with the fact that my ex that I hadn't seen in months was at the same bar, so I was distracted. Needless to say, I never got her number.


This happened two days ago and I honestly totally forgot about it until last night. Just for shits and gigs I typed her name, job, and location into Google. Lo and behold, her couchsurfing profile is one of the first searches to come up, so I was able to find her on instagram.


I'm contemplating sending her a message via Instagram. Maybe something like, ""Hey, this might sound really weird or really flattering depending on how you take it, but..."". Then proceed to explain myself and ask if she'd like to grab a drink and continue our conversation sometime.

163,"[Edit]: of course I have a typo in the title. Hit* a  wall with my relationship.

Hey Reddit, just looking for some relationship advice and looking for other experiences. Throw away because she knows my account name and I don’t want her to find this just yet. (TLDR at the bottom) My girlfriend [27f] and I [27m] have been dating for 6 years now, living together for 2. We have a great relationship, but I’ve hit a wall and I just want to know how common it is. I don’t really even know how to explain it other than I feel like there’s something missing. This started about 4 years ago, but comes and goes. It’s gotten real strong lately as more and more friends get married and have kids and then turn to us to do the same. 

About us: we have a great relationship. We communicate about everything, we’re both laid back, still have great sex, have never had an argument. Neither of us want kids. We’ve talked marriage, but neither of us feel ready just yet. My career isn’t stable yet and she’s finishing up her masters, and may do a PhD after. I spent a year across the country getting my masters, so we’ve done (and survived) long distance. 

The problem: I’ve known she was special once we started dating. We met in college and were friends first; we were both in other relationships, both became single around the same time and decided to try it out. Took it slow, and things worked out great. But sometimes I get a feeling like, “is this it?” And there’s nothing even wrong! We’re constantly told we have an ideal relationship. But I just feel like it lacks something, a spark, I dunno. 

Best way I can describe this, is that if I was ready to get married, I’d ask her. But I have no desire to ask her, and I really don’t know if it’s because I’m not ready to get married, or I don’t see myself getting married to *her*.

But it’s not all the time. I’ve travelled a lot for my job (and my masters), and each time I think about how much more meaningful it would be if she was by my side. Absence makes the heart grow fonder I guess? There has always been something to kick start that feeling again. My masters, moving in together, her masters. But once we get a steady routine going, I stagnate. I’m not unhappy by any means. I just see all my friends (and movies and whatnot) showing a very specific and confident type of love which I don’t always relate too.

After six years all our friends are the same, or have been dating for less time than us. So it’s difficult to ask them, which is why I’ve come to reddit. Also it’s a great to get all these thoughts out and organize them before sitting down your SO and telling them this (which may hurt them).

TLDR. Hit a wall where not sure if our relationship is stagnating, or something that every couple experiences. Just looking for advice, comments or other experiences and insights.",01May2017,0
165,"Hi all, I am starting university this coming September and I am not sure if I want to go to Laurier for their BBA program, or Waterloo for the Environment and business. I average low-mid 90's in all my courses, however, I suck at math and have private schooled Calc and Adv Func to get the marks I need to get into both programs.

- Laurier's coop is not guaranteed, and you have to get a combined 7.0 GPA in the first year to qualify? Does that mean 3.5 and 3.5 ? What % average does that equal to? I definitely want to do coop and gain work experience before graduating. Waterloo's EB program is a coop only program, and I have heard it opens up opportunities in many fields in both environment and business. I am scared I may not be able to keep up the grades to get into COOP at Laurier, and it scares me because I need to pay for my own Uni
- I suck at math, and I need to take some form of Calc at Laurier and I am scared I will bomb it and not qualify for COOP, which would be terrible. Waterloo's EB program has basically no math involved, which is a huge plus for me.
- The marks to get into Laurier BBA are much higher, does that reflect how successful I will be in the future?
- I have also head that the BBA program is super difficult, and the EB not so much. I am prepared to work and study my ass of to benefit my future, but further explanation from anyone with experience would be greatly appreciated
- Which will open up more career choices for me?
- What can I expect out of university after finishing the EB or BBA programs?

About two and a half months ago my boyfriend and I moved to a new apartment. Our first day there, we met our neighbor who I'll call Trevor. Trevor is, I would guess, in his late 30's. He lives alone except for his cat, and also works from home, so he is always home basically and I would imagine gets pretty lonely. He's a really really nice guy though, helped my boyfriend carry something really heavy into our place that I couldn't help with, and when there was a big windstorm he knocked on our door and asked if we needed to borrow any flashlights in case the power goes out.

Trevor lives in the adjacent building and our back patios face each other. He's a smoker so we see him out on his back patio very very frequently having a cigarette. Like if we look out our back patio at any given moment, chances are that he's out there smoking. His cat sometimes hangs out on the patio with him.


Early last week, my boyfriend and I were outside grilling dinner on our patio and Trevor was outside smoking. My boyfriend offered him a beer and Trevor said he is trying not to drink because he recently had a beer after 4 years completely sober and had a bad time. He mentioned having some addiction problems in the past. So we left it at that.


Later in the week, on Thursday, I was on the bus on the way home when my boyfriend texted me saying he thinks there's something going on with Trevor. My boyfriend got home and Trevor was on his back patio sitting with his head in his hands and my boyfriend asked if he was ok. Trevor said, ""Not really"" and didn't seem to want to chat so my boyfriend left him alone. He mentioned that Trevor seemed really out of it.


When I got home, I saw that Trevor's blinds to his back patio were closed which I found strange because they are usually open during the daylight hours since he goes outside so frequently. The next day, Friday, when we got home from work the blinds were still closed and we didn't see him at all Friday evening. However, we did see his cat poking his head out between the blinds and looking outside. Trevor would usually open the door to let his cat outside in this case. But no sign of him. The lights in his apartment and on his patio were on though, and I believe had been on since Thursday afternoon.


Saturday morning we left to go camping and came back Sunday evening. We got home and saw that his blinds were still closed, same lights were still on. Cat still occasionally poking his head out to look outside. But still no sign of Trevor. Haven't seen him outside at all.


Today is Monday. This morning we looked out our window to see that the same lights are still on, but no sign of anybody moving around in there. It's getting really weird. We discussed the possibility that he overdosed on something in there, or something happened to him. We think maybe we should let the apartment office know, or maybe knock on the door of his next door neighbor in his building to ask if he has seen or heard from him.


It is very strange because we see this guy outside 20 times a day. Now neither of us has seen him in 4 days (granted we were camping Saturday morning to Sunday evening but still). We are trying to tread carefully and not seem like we're all up in his business but we're worried. What should we do?

tldr: Neighbor with a history with addiction problems seems to have disappeared after acting strangely last week. Not sure how/when to act.



**Update 1**: sorry this took so long. We had a commitment after work (west coast here). My boyfriend just knocked on the door. No answer. Kitty is still poking out once in a while. We really hope he is out of town or something but will keep an eye out. Not sure if it is too early to call the police.  


**Update 2**: About an hour after I posted the first update I saw the blinds to Trevor's back door open. I thought he had returned but it was a lady in there straightening up, folding a blanket, pouring food out for the cat. My guess is he went out of town and asked her to come by and feed the cat. Crisis (hopefully) non-existent. He did seem to leave abruptly so I hope everything is ok. At the very least we know kitty is fed and ok so I'm happy about that and hopefully we will see Trevor soon.

196,"I was driving home from work listening to the radio and the host and hostess said they were on the fence about 13 Reasons and that listeners could text and talk to them about why they should watch the show.

I texted and they called me back and I was sooooo taken off gaurd (because when does that ever happen!), I got super nervous and excited at the same time andddd sounded like a complete idiot. Like I couldn't form a coherent sentence without blanking in the middle idiot.

This happens a lot with people and it's so embarrassing because I must come across as an idiot to half the people I meet who just scare me for one dumb reason or another. But to have it happen with such a little neat experience kind of bummed me out afterwards. They were very nice and said thank you and I continued to listen to the radio and once the song playing was over, they came back on air and very politely said they had a nice conversation with DuckDuckPlatypus off-air and they're rethinking watching the show now, on to the next segment!

So I was just wondering if it's normal for radio hosts to really take calls off-air or if they only do that when callers just sound like complete buffoons. ",01May2017,2
201,"Long story short: I've been (falsely) accused or something by my ex-girlfriend/coursemate. I can provide further details over PM but I'd prefer not to post openly in case of identification.

As a result, I've gone into a huge depressive cycle. All of my old friends will no longer talk to me, and I have another year of my course to go.

I'm barely able to study with these people, I've received hate mail through various social media accounts as a result. I'm holding on as far as my mental health goes, but I don't think I can do another year.

If I transfer University, I'm going to have to redo another year. I don't want to spend more time in studies than I have to; if I stay at my current location, then I will only have one more year but I risk further issues. It's not certain, but there's a chance.

I initially was interested in her and once I got to know her I hoped we could date and enter in a relationship but she declined due to her own reasons. I accepted this and remained friends with her coz she's a cool person but after the initial lust/honeymoon period of getting to know each other passed I did a bit of soul searching/analyzing and discovered that I'm not really into her tbh, my intentions were primarily driven by lust (stupid and kinda shitty, I know).
Now here is where the problem begins, I know I'm not into her, she's attractive but not exactly my type so I know attraction isn't what's making me feel this way. 
I just want her approval for some reason...
I see pics of her as I scroll through Instagram and get excited for some reason. And I'm pretty sure the reason isn't attraction, I just want her to approve of me, I don't know in what way, but I just do.
My mother was kinda emotionally unavailable and maybe it's what's turned me into this but I don't understand why it's just her and nobody else...
**I cannot emphasise enough that it isn't attraction, I'm not interested in her in that way.**
I've been rejected by other women and don't care but with her I don't know how it got to this...

So, I've always pretty much wanted to move to the US in the future. As for now, I'm 17 and I live in Poland. I've honestly never been abroad due to my father's job, with the exception of Czech Republic, close to the border when I was like 9. 

I've already found that if I want to visit the US - I will need to get the B2 Visa. Well, alright, that isn't very complicated with the exception of the fact I might not get it. However, just the B2 visa won't get me the permission to live there. 

I know that there is a lottery for the green card, but let's be honest, the chances I would win are pretty low - I'll probably try regardless of it as soon as I finish education, though. 

And I came here - to ask you guys, what is something I should do to maximize my chances of getting the opportunity to live in the US?

I don't have any family over there and the chances seem pretty low to me, and due to my age I don't really know if there's anything I could really do right now even though I really want to.

Any who: over the course of the past year I developed a problem with a certain snorted substance... Used to be just a couple streaks of blood in snot, now it's like a crusty-mucousy-mess everyday. (((DON'T DO DRUGS))) I try to keep it clean as I can up there by doing warm nasal rinses, and then salve it with gentle, non-comedogenic, creepy-chemical/smell free moisturizer.

I was blowing my nose yesterday and noticed my nostril-bump was particularly sensitive and felt a little bigger. I don't think my nose looks swollen though. I took care to rinse with warm water, try to get all the crap out, but my symptoms persist.  I feel like putting some sort of ""wound care"" alcohol stuff would be a terrible idea, so I haven't done that.

212,"Hi,

i'm studying applied informatics in an integrated degree program. I'm working now for some months there and need the money for paying the tuition fees. I soon realised i don't really like that kind of job and the company but i really need the money. I have some private projects for which i can get some money but after that i would be unemployed again. 

Now i'm thinking of changing my workplace but i'm afraid of a bad mark in my curriculum vitae and i think it's a bit unfair to the company because i'm the first student they have in this kind of integrated degree program. I don't want to ""piss off"" the people there. 

Is it okay to look for another job and maybe switch to it? Should i tell them the truth or should i rather tell them something like ""for private reasons i think it's better for me to leave you"" or ""i can't handle the work"" ?

I don't want to piss off my parents too.. They are very happy i found something but they don't have the money to support me financially any longer. 

At my university it's possible to study without a company so i wouldn't lose my university place because of that. Only the money would be critical. 

Wouldn't it be better to stay at this company and after my degree i can look for another? Should i really change and ""do what i like more"" or should i bear three years till i got my degree?

217,"I don't know if I should ask this in /r/depression, a lot of people there are willing to help, I'm just not sure if they've gone through some kind psychological issues I guess. This just seems to appeal to a broader audience and therefore it's more likely for me to find someone who has been in my situation, whatever that may be.

I've been pondering suicide for about a year now, not because my life is shit necessarily, but because life will always be mediocre. I've always like the quote ""if you work for a living, why kill yourself working"", from the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It pretty much summarises my thoughts on life. It all seems so worthless and superficial. It feels like most of my life I'll be working. I've talked about this to a friend of mine, who says I should enjoy work, but that simply makes no sense to me. I enjoy my free time, doing nothing, maybe going out for a swim in the sea, but I don't see people making a living out of sitting on the couch and occasionally working out or doing sports (except in reality shows, but sadly I'm not retarded so I don't qualify for those). He then went on to speak about greater powers and going to heaven and so on and so forth. I have NOTHING agains religion, I just want to clear up that if you want to give me advice, please don't waste your time trying to convince me that my actions will have some significance after I'm dead, because it won't work. Again, when I say that people with faith in these kinds of things get pissy, IDGAF what you believe, it will not change my opinion of you unless you use it to judge other people (example: abortion, probably not the best example but that's not what this is about).

Back to the topic at hand. I've thought about getting professional help, but I'm not sure whether I should, and furthermore I have no idea how to go about getting professional help. How did you go about getting help (if you did)? What am I getting professional help for? Being a little bitch because I'm gonna have to work like everyone else? I don't even know where I should post this. Any tips or any general advice is appreciated.

Sorry for the long post.

I like to think of life as a sort of guilty pleasure. It's temporary, it's meant to be enjoyed, and once it's gone, that's that, you're dead. So it makes no sense to waste any time if this ""guilty pleasure"" doesn't actually bring me any pleasure. It's a ""why smoke weed if it doesn't get you high"" sort of thing.

TL/DR What's the point of living, where to get professional help, what kind of help, what do I even need help with. I guess thinking that suicide would fix everything is a reason, I just really don't think I'd ever go through with it. I've always thought everyone felt that way already.",01May2017,1

college student here. I recently broke my phone and needed a replacement ASAP for both school and work. I went onto craigslist just hoping I wouldn't find a stolen one. But after coming home, I realized that I had bought a stolen iPhone. I tried contacting the seller but he cut his number.

219,"So after this whole debacle, the manager insists that I'm lying and demands I e-mail him proof, here was my e-mail that also summarizes my situation (names have been changed):




Dear T,
My stay was abysmal, I should have been refunded fully for this alone. Then to top it all off I see that your clerk used my debit card to purchase $60 of mobile minutes. Now please, if you take yourself seriously as a business, you cannot be denying me a full refund given these circumstances. 

I did not use my card for anything else that day whatsoever aside from Thai food where the hostess swiped my card in front of me and handed it back. With your clerk Al, after he goes into the backroom with my debit card, I am then charged for some mysterious mobile minutes. Although he claims he did this because he needed to check that my card was not a Visa that was reported stolen, you personally tell me that there was not even a report of a stolen Visa for him to have done this strange procedure. So this seems to have been a lie and further proving that he was committing fraud. 

I called straighttalk airtime (where Al charged my card) to track with my card number the purchase that was made. While my bank is tracking it as a fraudulent charge, they informed me that the phone number had a Vermont area code. T, I'm from Massachusetts. How can this be anymore obvious?

Just for clarification I will relay the events of this night again.

I arrive with my boyfriend and his friends around 2AM. One of his friends purchases a room with two double beds. Being the only woman there, I don't want to share a bedroom with men who are not my boyfriend so we ask for a cot. There are no cots available so I go downstairs to buy a single room. 

Al takes my information, I hear the sound of a photo being taken, and then heads to the back room with my debit card. When he returns he tells me that he had to make sure that it was not a stolen card that had been reported, and that his boss would have been upset with him should he have seen on the cameras that he did not check. 

Exhausted, I return to the room where there is practically steam rising from the floors. I turn the heat off and me and my boyfriend go to bed, I wake up at 5am gasping for air as it's about 90 degrees in the room. I try to turn the A/C on to no avail, I pick up the receiver of the phone and dial the front desk, to no avail because it simply did not work. So at this point it is around 5am and we have been sleeping in a sauna all night. 

I go downstairs to tell Al that I personally appreciate all his customer service throughout the night, especially noting that the guests I was there with, were more difficult to deal with. I simply ask that I be refunded for this room seeing that I solely purchased it because there were not cots available and nothing in the room was functional, including the phone and the intense heat we had been sleeping through during the night. He told me he’d let his managers know in the morning.

I am then awoken two hours laters by Cate. She brings me a new phone and tries to dispute the issue with the heat, while I tell her we’re clearly still sleeping and we can discuss this later during checkout. The heater was broken, I even encountered a mother and daughter from the third floor that told me they had the same issue, and they had to purchase fans to stay cool during their stay. Then I was “generously” refunded only half the price of the stay. 

Later that morning, I see in my bank statements that although I only purchased dinner and the motel room, I was also charged $60 by StraightTalk airtime at the same moment in the early morning hours as I was charged for the motel room. 

There was not even a real report of a stolen Visa for Al to have even gone into the back room to check in about. 
-end of email-
So in response to this, I get a reply from the property's general manager who states: ""This is the actual property manager.  You are no longer welcome here.  Stop contacting us or I will charge you with Harassment.""

Further Confirmation of Al's Theft: I then find Al's Facebook page, where he has his cell number listed. I then call StraightTalk mobile and confirm that my debit card was used to make a $60 deposit that night onto Al's phone number!
--
I have received no response from the Motel 6 or it's corporate offices and the local police are SLOWLY investigating the matter. I suspect that not much will be done. I'm a struggling college student and the money Al took was all I had to survive for the week. I don't know what to do, I really need a full refund. The bank cannot refund my the money until it's done pending and they have investigated everything themselves. I'd appreciate advice on how to continue on with this situation, quick money-making ideas, and maybe how I can most effectively destroy this HORRIBLE managerial team.



tl;dr: Had a horrible stay with a heater that was stuck and blasting. Me and my boyfriend slept in a sauna all night. Next day I see a weird charge on my card for mobile minutes and remember the clerk went into the backroom with my debit card. The managers told me to stop contacting the motel or they'd file for harassment.  I have confirmed by calling the phone company that the clerk used my card to pay for his mobile minutes.",01May2017,3

232,"Hi all, I am a 23 year old male and just wanted some advice on enjoying life again. I could post an essay but I'll try and keep it to just the main points I have.

I graduated college about a year ago with a math degree. Math wasn't something I was super passionate about but I was good at it so I did it and just assumed I would be content getting some office job somewhere. Well I have had that office job since I graduated college.

I do data analytics and my company is a bit behind on the times so our technology can be limiting. I enjoy the people I work with but very few of them share viewpoints that I do (I'm not really a big fan of American business and how it works).

I have a few friends (several of them are finishing up college right now as well) and I still live with my parents (planning on moving out this year because it's damn time).

In all, it's very hard for me to mesh with most people. I can fake get a long with most but I really don't find anyone that interesting anymore. I broke up with my girlfriend a little over a year ago and I just really haven't enjoyed life ever since.

My main hobbies now are just working out and studying a foreign language. I used to play guitar but I really have lost passion for the instrument.

I have a lot of interests but have few friends that are ever free or wanting to do things I like (music, hiking, art, museums, movies, etc.)

I just feel very lost and alone and rarely am able to mesh with people to the point I want to. It's led to me becoming a recluse a bit and it's a major bummer.

My end goal is to find passion for something in life again. I currently don't know what that is. I sometimes consider going back to school for biology/chemistry/biochemistry but am unsure if I would even enjoy it or what I would do with it. I am in a stable position right now financially and don't have many worries on that front but I just feel like I have no purpose and have been in a deep depression for awhile now. If I went back to school it would not be the smartest financially and if it doesn't work out or I don't like it then I would be set back very far. I'm just not sure if it is worth the risk at this stage in life.

So, I'm 27 years old (just turned). I have a BA in Studio Art, I minored in English Writing. The plan was to do something creative as a career. That hasn't quite worked out... Since graduation, I have worked as a lifeguard/swim instructor, a community college art instructor, FD at a hotel, an art sales associate on cruise ships, concierge at a B&amp;B, a wine consultant, a hotel sales manager, and now I work for a state funded employment agency. I'm planning on taking an EMT course in September, and shortly thereafter, I'm planning on trying to get into the Fire Academy.

Here's the thing: I have NO IDEA what my life plan is... I mean, I have the Dream Job, I think everyone does. I'd love to own my own art gallery someday that has a wine and cocktail lounge, has dancing, and local musicians perform there. A real classy place. But I also want to start an animal and people rescue organization. And publish some novels... But, I have no idea where I'm going in life.

And, being that I just turned 27, everyone is starting to ask me ""What are your career goals?"", ""When are you going to get married?"", ""When are you going to buy a house?"", ""When are you going to start having kids?"" (I hate that last one!). And I have no idea how to answer them...

I mean, I've been in a serious relationship for the past 4 years, we're talking about eloping, although I've been having doubts lately... And I really feel like I need to move out of state. Right now I live within an hour of literally every single family member I have (including the extended family), and I feel like I'm letting them hold me back, and that maybe I should move to another state where I only know ONE person, so I have some support, but don't feel like I'm being held back or hiding behind them.

My partner and I of 6 years have just moved across the country together. We have been on the rocks for about nine months or more and as each day progresses its harder and harder. I know its never feels like the right time to pull the trigger but having just moved to a new place where neither of us have any support system seems like the worst time. She also deals with chronic pain and tmj and its been pretty bad lately.

I simply feel like i can't show up for her anymore. I can't make her happy the way that i used to because frankly, I have fallen out of love with her. She doesn't seem to feel the same but I know that hanging on and watching her suffer as I grow further apart from her is not right. I want to stay here with her until she can gain a support system so she's not completely abandoned but I'm also trying to be honest and let her know where I'm at currently. And currently, I don't want to do this anymore. Ive been with her since I was 20 and have spent the better half of my twenties with her and I feel I have gained no individual adult life experience apart from her. 

I have lost myself, my identity within our relationship and it feels now like my spiritual immune system is kicking in to help me heal the parts of me that I have lost. To help me regain my ""essence"" if you will. I want to mitigate the suffering to come as much as possible but it seems we can't stay in a state of stasis long enough to gain a support system.

She is hurting so badly and it is breaking my heart because I know its me doing so. My breaking her heart is breaking mine. It feels like I have turned her light off.

I know that this is the right thing to do for both of us but I just wish she could see it. She has dealt with severe depression and insecurity almost her whole life and I don't know what to do! I feel I am literally destroying her.

We are on a lease together for 9 more months, we have a dog together, we share furniture, bills, responsibilities. Even the logistics of a breakup are terrifying. 

Her sense of security and confidence have pivoted on me for the entirety of our relationship. And for a while mine did the same. I know that isn't healthy. Two people should lean on each other sometimes when they need the other but not constantly. it seems that as I begin to stand on my own she keeps leaning and I can't hold her anymore. My life is going to change dramatically, I know, but I don't know what else to do. 

It was all too much too fast. I moved in with her only months after dating her. It was hard, fast, passionate love. She took me in. She provided for me and nurtured me, even mothered me for my mother wasn't and a year later she past. I have nurtured her as well. Given her confidence and security and love when she had so recently been hurt by another. 

So now I am dealing with the guilt of leaving someone whom I love and who has been so very good to me even when I didn't deserve it, because I ever-so naturally fell out of love with her. 

I am just rambling at this point, trying to piece it all together and for that, I'm sorry. If anyone has any words for me about how to proceed with anything from minimizing the pain to organizing a new living situation it would be most helpful. Thank you all very much. I can provide more details if necessary. Its hard to type out all of the complex details in a concise, digestible form. ",01May2017,1
243,"Hi, I like going commando a lot, i'm very comfortable that way and would like to do it full time, do you guys/girls think it's a bad idea to do that?
I've thought about throwing all my underwear so that I don't wear it anymore, I really want to do it, but I'm kind of nervous about it.
The thing is that i've been questioning my gender (i'm male at birth) and i'm afraid about doing something like this because I feel it would be wrong. If I were born female I would love to go commando all the time too, I hate underwear.

Any kind of suggestion / idea would be awesome, thanks.",01May2017,2
246,"Hi everyone. I'm in junior year of high school, and I made a horrible mistake. I am generally a very honest person and I hate when people cheat on tests and quizzes. Also, I care about my grades but not as much as some people who intensly cheat do- what I'm saying is, I'm not a cheater. It would spoil the pride of a good grade, and it would be too much effort anyway because I honeslty don't care enough.

That being said, last wednesday we had a mini 5 question, 5 minute quiz in chemistry. It was just a vocab quiz, and we took it on our phones. Because it was on our phones, many people simply opened a new tab of safari and looked up some (or maybe all) of the answers. I didn't know one of the words so I discretely did the same. I'm so mad at myself because that quiz barely counted for anything towards our final grade and I should have just left it blank and gotten it wrong because I don't even care. But I was an idiot and just looked it up. I looked at the answer that came up and changed it very slightly.

The next day, the teacher of the class told everyone that ten people in the class wrote a word as an anwer that was not on the vocab study sheet, but was the first answer that came up when the question was plugged into google, so he came to the (definitely correct) conclusion that we cheated. He said he would be writing up the students that he knew cheated.

My answer was very similar to the google answer but did not include the word he named, but I can safely assume that he knows I cheated as well based on my answer. 

I feel so bad about this because he is actually my favorite teacher. He makes fun of me a lot but I know he likes me. I get the highest grades on the math problem tests that we do without really trying. He has pulled me aside multiple times to ask me what I wanted to do as a career when I got older, and he told me that I have the potential to be a really great engineer or something of the sort. 

So anyways, I am freaking out now for multiple reasons. One, I'm probably going to get written up, which means either detention or suspension, a call to the parents, etc. My student handbook says that the consequence for cheating or plaigarism on the first offense is a call to the parents and a zero on the assignment. At this point I could care less about the zero, and while I hate my parents to get this call (I am a really shy, really good student at school, and I have never gotten in trouble besides for being late too many times last year). However, this would be a whole lot better than detention or suspension, so hopefully my school sticks to the handbook. But I'm also in National Honor Society, and the handbook says that cheating would be reported to the advisor for action to be taken. I'm so terrified that I will be kicked out of NHS, that would be so embarrassing and horrible. Also, I read online that records of cheating are put on the transcript and sent to colleges and on college applications ask if ou have ever been in trouble for cheating. Is this going to absolutely ruin my chances for college? I'm such an idiot. Like I said, I'm not much of a cheater, I probably haven't done it since middle school, but after this is will definitely never ever do it again.

Okay so my first question is, how badly will this ruin my college chances? Can I get into any college with this record on my transcript? What about community college? I qualify for NJSTARS where I can go to community college for free, would this get taken away from me? I didn't want to do that anyway but would a state college even accept a cheater? I have no other offenses besides this, as I stated earlier the only thing I've done was gotten a detention for having 5 lates (I hate my school) sophomore year. And I might get one this year. I also have a pretty good GPA, honors and AP classes, and pretty decent SAT scores I think.

Sorry this is so long, but also there's this: should I confess to my teacher? As I said earlier, we respected each other, and I don't want him thinking I'm really dishonest. The thing is, he said he was reporting those he knew did it, and I'm not sure if I'm one of those people. What if he doesn't report me at all? But I feel like if I confess to what I did, maybe he will go easier on me? Or tell the principal in the write up that I at least confessed, and maybe he will go easier on me? I also always planned on getting a letter of reccomendation from him next year, and I wanted to go to him for advice about my career because I'm feeling pretty lost and confused about that. I want to tell him I cheated but if he didn't already think it, he will lose respect for me and report me. But if he already knows and I don't confess, it will be worse. I don't know what to do. I think I'm going to confess though.

So what should I say when I go? Obviosly I should tell him that I cheated, and that I'm sorry. I'll probably start crying, but not on purpose. I don't want him to think that I'm pretending to feel bad, and I don't want to seem fake by being all ""I know what I did was wrong, blah blah blah,"" but I know I should show that I am remorseful. I obviously want him to go easy on me because of my confession and because it is out of character for me. But I genuinely do feel bad for breaking his trust as well as trying to get an advantage by cheating, because I really do think cheating is wrong and unfair to other students. How should I convey this? And should I let him know my worries about colleges seeing this offense or would that seem too much like I am trying to get off the hook through pity? 

Sorry this was so long, but I hope someone can help me. I'm really worried because I don't get in trouble ever, and I feel like crying. Writing this post had calmed me down a bit though.

TL;DR: I got caught cheating on a quiz and the teacher said he was writing up all of the students who cheated. This is very out of character for me (cheating) and I am very afraid of the consequences. I'm nervous that colleges won't accept me if they see I got in trouble for cheating. Also, should I confess to my teacher that I cheated? And if so, what should I say? Will this let me get off easier? Thanks.",01May2017,19

251,"I just cannot afford to live on a single income with her and also keep my sanity. she was diagnosed with adhd and anxiety. as a child. she's like a child sometimes. she's extremely reliant on her parents for information and guidance which often clashes with my understanding of the world. she's really impulsive when it comes to sweets and other stuff that she doesn't need and it's almost useless for me to argue because she just completely overreacts when I put my foot down about something that's really trivial like saying no to getting a shake. 

we've been living together for about 6 months we planned to get married later this year. during that time I helped her get her drivers license and her first car. 

I think a lot of the problems I have with her can be linked to her adhd. She has had two jobs and hasn't been able to hold a job for longer than a month since she moved in. I did some research to see if she could receive benefits but I just don't have access to any of her medical records to even confirm that she should receive benefits. 

I really do love her and care about her. I plan on helping out with some of her bills like her phone and car insurance if we do break up so she's not completely screwed. I think she will end up moving back in with her parents in all likely hood.

I just think she's not gonna take this breakup too well. I'm backing up my files and changing my passwords just to make sure that I don't lose everything if she gets violent or vindictive. I think it might sound weird but I think breaking up with her in her parents driveway would be a good way to mitigate damage to my property and herself.

I know I'm not perfect in this. I know she is a better person than I make her out to be here. tbh I don't know how I'm gonna feel when I break up with her I'm looking at everything from a really detached frame of mind right now because I'm so stressed out over.

before she moved in I was building my credit past the 700's and at least breaking even. now I'm I'm $4300 in debt on a credit card and about to max it out ,she can't even pay for he phone and car insurance(the only bills I ask her to pay), her parents have a problem with me even asking to split the car insurance with her which she likes to remind me of every time it's brought up. I fucking hate her parents btw.

there's just too much to go through Im just gonna have to stop here.

I have discussions every once in a while with my friends, discussions I can't stand. I usually entertain the topic anyway for a bit but then just stop talking considering they piss me off.

I have a friend who I suspect has no idea whatsoever about anything political. I assume he just watches videos by edgy YouTubers and gets his views despite not understanding anything (and despite the political climate being different in USA vs. Sweden). I'm struggling to figure out what to write here, because I can't pinpoint it.

I asked him if he wanted to join me watching the May 1st parades. He says yes, and then asks me who's demonstrating. This person doesn't even seem to know the most basic facts about political movements (I don't either necessarily, but it's very obvious and well-known that it's for people to the left of the spectrum). I'm not going to force him to join me on something like this if he doesn't want to since it obviously isn't for everyone. His family is conservative as well, I believe. He told me he wasn't going to go on anything by any political side. He just seems to not know anything.

It pisses me off that he's one of those ""both sides suck"" person. I mean I'm obviously biased, and although I agree that both sides have problems, this fucking stance pisses me off. He goes on to say how media sucks and all because they didn't report on one thing or another. Yeah, media isn't perfect, but he hasn't even figured that out by himself. He can't because he doesn't know shit about politics.

I know friendship transcends politics, and I love him as a friend. I'm not going to tell him to join my side or whatever, I'm not going to start political discussions with my friends. But this one guy seems to be a staunch anti-feminist because he's heard about it on the internet.

I'm not going to tell him he's an idiot, especially since I don't even have my own arguments. He has his videos and it seems like he practically absorbs the opinions of some YouTubers.

277,"Hello, I'm not sure really where else to turn at the moment. I was reading an ask Reddit thread about secrets, and someone's comment about childhood abuse has suddenly got me thinking, I feel confused and alone and did not know where else to go.

Years ago when I must've been 9 or 8 ( I do not remember when, its pretty likely to have been earlier than that) my brother pressured and forced me into performing sexual acts on him. My brother is two and a half years older than me, and I am also a male. It started when I once walked in on him masturbating, I did not really know what he was doing or why he was doing it, only that it made me feel uncomfortable to be there while he did it. He explained it to me and said it felt good and that I should try it. I don't remember how it escalated from there ( there is a lot of aspects about this I don't remember, partly because it was a long time ago, and I'm sure a lot of it I have blocked out), but basically got to the point where he would pressure and often blackmail me into performing oral sex on him (one time he may have forced himself on me but I'm not sure if that's true because it's all a blur). 
I did not like doing it as it made me extremely uncomfortable, both physically and emotionally. 

Eventually I began to go along with it and became neutral to it, saw it as a thing we did that we both agreed to and wanted to do (despite it only ever being me performing on him, never the other way around). I'm not sure exactly how long it went on for but it stopped eventually. Me and my brother have never discussed it since and I don't plan on it. He is at university and I still live at home so I don't see him that much anymore. We do not have a good relationship and often argue.

I have a lot of issues with myself. I'm addicted to porn and masturbation, I started masturbating extremely early as a result of this experience (I began to masturbate myself to the point of orgasm before I was developed enough to physically ejaculate). This has lead to other problems. I also have a difficult and destructive relationship with food. I'm quite overweight and have a food addiction (binge eat constantly, eat non stop even when not hungry, binge eat, sneak out of the house and eat and use food  as a coping mechanism). I've also had quite bad depression and anxiety from quite an early age ( I'm 18 now but was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was about 12 and have had it ever since, although it has been better the last couple years).

Despite all this I still have doubts and questions. ~I'm not even sure as to the truth of everything I have just said (I can barely remember it) 
~a lot of what happened I eventually went along with and began to see as almost consensual. I feel as though it was as much my idea and fault as his

~ is this the source of my issues at the moment? Or am I just a lazy broken person looking for an excuse?
~ how deeply has this affected me, am I damaged? Am I changed as a person?

He said he was tired, but I worry he isn't telling the truth and is just saying he is fine when he isn't.

I don't really know if this is the right sub for this post, given that I don't really know what I want from it. I'm sorry for repeating myself, I just started writing and just laid out the facts",01May2017,2
280,"Around 2 years ago I dated my friend, and after 2 or 3 months our relationship came to a halt. Our relationship was mostly a physical ordeal, and when the time came for the end, she acted weird around me. 

This previous summer, she reached out to me after us not talking since we had broken up. She had the boyfriend that she cheated on me with, and they had been dating every since we had stopped. 

Her and I had some mutual flirting for a long time, and while I expected nothing to come from it, I started having the same feelings I had a long time ago come back. 

Her and her boyfriend broke up, and she reached out to me, and we made plans to hang out. She was very adamant about coming over to my house to hang out and chill, when one day she said she was busy. I respected that, because I know that her future ""career"" requires time. The same day she said she was to busy with work and school she went to get back together with her boyfriend, went hiking with him, and posted the whole trip all over Instagram. 

I decided I was going to insult her and tell her exactly what I felt because of her bullshit leading me on, when she started wanting to hang out again. 

She is acting distant again, doing the same shit she's done in the past.

I really want to tell her off. I know it's not the most mature thing in the world, but after how long she's strung me around for, I want to just lay into her. I don't know how to do that though. I'm not a mean person, I'm generally pretty happy and rarely complain.

How should I handle the situation? If I do lay into her, what things should I say to make it sting? I really want it to sting. I was planning on telling her it must be nice to have someone to talk to when you need it, would love to know the feeling or something about that.

282,"First of all, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for the topic, so please feel free to redirect me appropriately.

I was researching the Green Card Lottery, and somehow ended up on http://www.usadiversitylottery.com/. I ended up signing up and paying the $59 fee (I'm not a smart man), before realizing it may not be legitimate. I did further research, and all official sources seem to point exclusively at https://www.dvlottery.state.gov/, and state that the program is free to apply to and is only open within a specific time window in the fall. I called my bank immideately after I realized, which is about 1 hour from the transaction, and was told there is nothing they can do to cancel/revert the transaction. 

What steps should I take next? Is there any chance I can get my money back if I contact the shady website? Do I have a case with the police?",01May2017,3
283,"I work for a pretty popular retailer, huge corporation, and while hiring someone under 18 was finishing up their work permit and I faked it until they turned it in. They never turned it in and I was found to be the one who faked it and now I have no idea if I should be looking for a new job or not. Wednesday the schedule randomly changed and now an extra manager is working and I'm afraid that is to fill my spot for when/if they fire me. So basically what I'm asking is if anyone has seen or heard of anything like this and what the repercussions might be. 

Possibly just a write up? Or the less attractive, being terminated. Any sort of input or experience would be extremely appreciated. 

Edit: to add to this the work permit is now on file and everything is corrected, does that change anything?

284,"I work at an Ad agency, and I love my job. However, the agency is poorly run, and we are always scrambling at the last minute to get work done. This is mostly because of the types of clients we have and our internal leadership issues.

My boss and I have had a rocky relationship. For the first year at our company, he was by far the reason that made my job doable and enjoyable. His leadership skills were spot on and he didn't shy away from doing what his job required. 

Fast forward a bit and we have our first major disagreement. He was slowly refusing to communicate with other departments on issues we we're having with them. After multiple private discussions with him about the issues, and his lack of action, myself and the rest of the team went to the boss of our boss. The issues were addressed, and my boss blew up at me for going around him. His leadership skills started to slowly crumble as he got burnt out with work and issues like this.

Present day, it seems like every time something comes up within our department it always comes back to poor communication or management skills in our leader. Now it is extremely common to have to call in the help of other senior staff to try to get our work done. Beyond all this, he has begun to have discussions with other leadership in front of us about who he doesn't like and get along with. Now it seems like any effort in discussing these issues with him results in him telling me to quit my job if I don't like it or deal with it.

286,"Tldr: how do I talk to people when it's junior year and I still don't have friends? Everyone already has there groups

Yes I know this probably isn't the place to ask but many of you have great advice and I don't know where else to turn.

Also yes I know that I suck at recounting stories, no need to mention it.

Information
I went to a different school freshmen year and had a pretty awesome friend group. After that year we moved to another school like an hour away. I'm an introvert, loner, person with social anxiety, whatever you want to call me. The only reason I made friends freshmen year is because they talked to me.

Sophomore year I'm at a new school and I know no one. My classes are all over the place with some in freshmen sophomore and junior levels so I don't share a class with the same person in any class. I go into depression partially over this for a little while and then come out of depression a little into junior year. At this point I'm feeling a lot more confident but then this weekend happened and I made no friends before this, only acquaintances.

This weekend I went to a jsa spring Congress session all weekend and this was my first social event in years. I had a lot of different people that seemed to really want to talk to me, most being from my school and it was a ton of fun. Once I left though I had a crushing realization that none of them would talk to me at school and I was right. The most I got from anyone was a passing hi which was soul crushing because I truly thought I made connections there. 

The reason that matters is because I've realized how much fun socializing is and being as lonely as I is just going to be depressing again. The closest I am with anyone is a girl that I sometimes talk to (yes she does initiate conversation quite often) and I don't even know how to hold a conversation with her. I'm clueless.

I would like to say that I just recently joined a club (jsa) and will be getting into 2 more school clubs next year partially as an attempt to make friends. Jsa isn't really working so far though I guess something could happen in the remaining weeks.

I'm nearing the end of junior year and going to be a senior soon and I would rather not look back at high school as utterly depressing. Not to mention I'm moving very far away for college and would like the social skills to carry on.

How do I talk to people and hold the conversation? I just don't understand because everything I say or ask feels so awkward. I actually had a plan to talk to someone this morning and I actually did but then someone just interrupted the person I was talking to to tell them a story and I was out of the conversation just like that. I would like to mention that said person isn't really their friend, it just happened to be the single time that I built up the courage to talk to someone...",01May2017,2
287,"Hello! I have been having a rough time making a decision about this. I would like to gather thoughts and opinions. I'm basically down to 2 options right now as high school comes to an end. I have a girlfriend and we've been dating for about a year now, I love to play the guitar, play video games, and hang out with my friends. 

Now, I want to either join the Army or head off to college. The Army is offering contracts that last only 2 years of active duty, and then 2 years in the Reserves. (So I would live at home for the last 2 years) I would enlist with a friend of mine through the buddy program, so we would go through it all together so I wouldn't necessarily be alone. We'd end up in the same unit even. Some benefits that I see from the Army are the ability to travel, get outstanding skills in many different abilities, great benefits (i.e college paid for, medical care). It would seemingly be a once in a life time sort of thing. 

On the other hand, I could head off to college right now. Instead of heading off to a 4-year school, I would get my general studies out of the way (at my local community college) first for the first 2 years of college. (To save money) My girlfriend is doing this as well. And then we both had talked about going to the same 4-year school together and getting an apartment. My friends who I make music with also are going to the same 4-year school. So I would enjoy being able to make music and hanging out with them too. (We had even talked about our band playing at college parties and such, lol)


Overall, the Army could be a great career for me and I could absolutely love the experience I'd get from it. But, I would miss home and my girlfriend very very very much and it scares me being away from them, even though I would have a friend with me the entire time. College is the typical experience that people endure after high school. It could be fun, even though I don't typically enjoy the though of going back and sitting in a classroom for 4 more years, and then being in debt from student loans. After all, I'm not even sure what I want to get my degree in. But, I would be continuing my passion of music and remaining close with my girlfriend and friends that are there.

This decision is a rather large one and has been in my head for weeks now and it's stressing me out and I can't figure out which direction to head in. I don't know what to do. Any advice, or tips would be massively appreciated.",01May2017,1

My parents are NOT okay with me having a sleepover with them, even though we will do NOTHING wrong or inappropriate, and I've done nothing in the past that should make them think that i would. We even have a plan to all four of us have separate rooms so we're all comfortable. Any ideas to help convince my parents?",01May2017,1
292,"Ok, even typing this is embarrassing as fuck. But I am at a point where I need some advice. I am about to turn 26 in a couple of months and yes, I am still a virgin.

I feel like I have wasted the last 10 years of my life and now I am ""waking"" up out of a slumber with almost no social skills. I literally haven't done anything else but studying like a freaking nerd. I have now got my Masters in chemistry and will start my PhD. 

I want to change something, but I don't know where to start. I feel like I have passed a ""point of no return"" especially considering how male virginity is seen in our society. It's not only the sex part but the complete lack of intimacy and the feeling ""there is to be something wrong with me"" that is hurting like hell.

I have some close friends (not a lot) and quite a lot of not so close friends. I have got rid of a lot of my social anxieties and fears (way too late).

I am mildly depressed since I am 18 and it's getting worse and worse the last couple of years. There are a lot of ""emotions"" going on in my head: shame, the feeling of inadequacy, regrets, a lot of self-loathing, loneliness and the feeling that can't get out of my situation anymore (somewhat hopelessness). My confidence and self-esteem are at rock bottom atm. 

And the idea of forever being alone if fucking crushing. I am quite honest I am getting more and more suicidal.
I actually don't know where to start. I know I need to work on myself, but there are so many things in my head, I can't focus at all.

293,"Hello all! I'm really interested in robotics and artificial intelligence, and I am hoping to find a career in this field later. I've been looking at tons of colleges, and I've only found two with Robotics as an undergraduate major- Carnegie Mellon and Worcester Polytechnical Institute. I'm more interested in the hardware/building robots, as well as the programming aspect. WPI would be a good school both academically and general location-wise, but I am not a huge fan of the actual area around the school, the food, or the school itself. It is not my least favorite school, but it isn't my favorite. Carnegie Mellon is far, extremely difficult to get into, and very rigorous. I have not seen the school and will not visit unless I am accepted. Does anyone know of other schools that have Robotics as a major, or something of the equivalent, regardless of location? What major(s) should I look into other than robotics to give me the best qualifications to work in the field later on? Should I strongly consider grad school?",01May2017,2
295,"Bit of a back story.  Myself and my housemate have been sharing for nearly 4 years.  We've had a few rows at the start.  Orginally over him not paying bills on time or stealing from my fridge, being quite noisy, not helping with the cleaning, we got mice and he did feck all to help, borrowed money and was late to repay.  I'm not innocent at all, I know I've been messy, noisy and can leave dishes for a day.  Probably my worst trait is that I can be quite passive aggressive but I'll normally hold it in rather than leave some nasty note or message.
Then in the middle of last year his girlfriend leaves her dog with him for a weekend.  I'd warned him there was mouse poison and where it was.  He doesn't bother to pick up all the pieces and, invariably, the dog finds them.  He'd told me it was picked up and goes on a mild rampage blaming me.  Thankfully the dog is ok.  Though his girlfriend has barely spoken to me since then.  I feel to blame for that but I'd been working 50-60 hours a week and was constantly tired.
Two months later I get diagnosed with a non hodgkins lymphoma (blood cancer).  I ask very little of my housemate, keep working and pay all my bills.  He loans me £50 without asking and without me needing then demands it back a week later as he's skint.  As it was sitting in my savings its in his account in minutes.  I ask him to be cautious if he has a cold or with noise in the am.  His alarm goes off at 0720 but he lets it ring for 5-10 minutes, but never leaves his room till 0820.  So his alarm rings every 5 minutes till he finally gets up.  His response to me asking him about is that he's tired, well I'm tired but my alarm goes once then I'm up, but I need rest.  He doesn't care.  I mentioned one evening that I was tired and was going to rest for a few hours before he comes home from work.  An hour later he's in the door singing and whistling.  This starts after I start chemo and ended a few weeks after I finished my chemo.  I didn't want to start a fight as I was too tired for it.
He never cleaned up after himself so a lot of my time in the kitchen was doing or redoing his filthy dishes (his foreman grill had bluemolded food stuff on it till I cleaned it).  I asked him to leave the bin out a day after I had chemo and he refused as he was too tired.  I was wrecked but got up to put the bin out and bring it in.  In fact he only started putting the bin out a month ago, supposedly because I'm too ill (though chemo is now over and I'm doing better now).  This happened after I slept through a day and our bin was nicked, but again I dealt with getting it back.
In the last few weeks he has barely said anything to me.  Doesn't talk or acknowledge me.  A few nights ago I left my bedroom door open (at 1830) and he screams at me about the noise coming from my room (I had litterally just started a game of sniper elite 2), I usually use headphones but didn't realise the time.  Then tonight I order food for my dinner break during work (I work from home) requesting it to be delivered when my break starts.  The food arrives 30 minutes early and I don't hear the door but he answers it.  Starts screaming at me that if I order food I should answer the door then demands I thank him for getting the food.  He has started letting music ring from his phone as an alarm and, again, starts at 0720 then carries on until he leaves his room an hour later.  He takes plates and cutlery into his room and leaves them in the kitchen a few days later (I own all kitchen utensils bar the foreman grill).  If I make the slightest bit of noise at night I get texts messages telling me to keep quiet he has to sleep.  Yet he never shows me the same courtesy.
I've spent the last few months dealing with the cancer and the death of friend.  Trying to be as understanding of him as possible, trying to be helpful but he won't do anything without encouragement.  I had to beg him to help me clean the house which exhausted me.  I've no idea whats causing his mood swings but I'm having a hard time with the cancer and the death of a close friend but I've done my best to make sure I don't take it out on anyone.  I'm at my limit with this and can only see it getting worse.  Hell he's even stopped buying toilet roll (he earns £100 a week more than me since I do reduced hours).  It just seems so petty but I don't want to do anything rash.  I don't want to loose a friend but I don't see much of a resolution outside of getting a new housemate.",01May2017,1

- Scrubs

- Stranger Things

- Orange Is the New Black

- 13 Reasons Why

- The Office

- The Walking Dead

- Jane The Virgin (probably one of my favourite)

- Archer

- Downton Abbey

- Breaking Bad

- Prison Break (at least the first 2 seasons)

- House of Cards (getting almost a little too intense though, no??)


I've also watched a lot of these things and kinda sorta like them... not looking for something similar, but, to rule them out as a suggestion:

- Gilmore Girls

- Friends

- Family Guy

- Futurama
